Julie welcome to the ... and how can I help\nWhen you were involved I have a question about our jeep wrangler real because what can we were involved in an accident on September first two thousand federal\nAfter Ninety six days on twenty four thousand dollars worth of repairs we've got the car back whoa and I know and it really didn't look that bad but because my husband tried to avoid hurdle went up on two wheels kind of cost editor carriage so the whole frame was replaced\nAnd of course everything else that goes along with that at about Fifteen hundred miles after we have the car back the right I'm Sorry the driver site front tire had a very bizarre wear pattern so we took it back to the body shop and he said I'm the car was put back together correctly it's a jeep tire issue\nWhich of course it wasn't an after four months of me running around this suspension is off an eight spot due to where it was put back together and the alignment is way off and he's still refuses to fix that set aside his problem\nOkay so let me let me back up a second how many miles that half the destructive on at the time of the accident at the time of the I could've had sixty four hundred and six thousand four hundred miles\nThat's correct it was ten months old had sixty four hundred miles ... to\n... and obviously this repair was performed through your insurance company\n[noise] through the insurance company if the person that fault\nOkay so you know the only thing I Can't comment though 'cause it's California in New Jersey um doesn't matter whose body shop does it they're they're just as responsible as if it was your worst\nNow you know the argument becomes that now will be asking this question did it go directly through their insurance or did your insurance pay for it and then they went after the other person\nDirectly through their shrimp or so have you talk to your insurance company about this I\nI have but they say because I\nTurned it over to the other insurance company they're out of it\nSo he suggested my agent suggested I go get it fixed myself\nAnd then try to recoup my losses so I don't I haven't taken it yet but what I've been told\nIs it it's a relatively minor thing to redo the suspension probably about twenty five hundred dollars okay so my question to you that the Carson City since March about march the ... and we haven't driven it other than taking it to places that haven't looked at is it safe to drive until I have the time and money to fix it or should I be driving it until I got that\nWell when they say it's often eight different places what do they what do they mean by that is it so that they visit workman ship is it is a is it you know the quality of ... what do they mean by that\nSo I have this print out where they put it on a machine and gave you gave me the degree and stuff what it is in all these different spots where the suspension or the cars to the frame I guess right and an eight of them as many as Fifteen degree is a tough one side of the car is higher than the other by approximately three quarters of an inch\nOkay so it sounds like this poor work my ship in the car never should have been put back together credits that is what it\nSounds like just from your description but I just don't get your insurance company's obligation isn't it isn't it isn't that their responsibility to arbitration on your behalf\nWell that's what I said and he said if I had given it to them to begin with and not gone straight to the other company they would have repaired and that spot with the other company but since I took them out of the equation which I didn't realize I was doing\nOnce I took them out of the equation they no longer have any say in it and the other insurance company says we fix that we paid him if he didn't do it right that's on him not us we paid to\nHave his hair so now you're stuck in the sport where everybody's passing the book exactly um do you have a lawyer you can talk to like a ...\nI Do and I've been talking to them and so um you know now that we're where I went to the bar every everybody the bureau automotive repair came out of course he kept telling me his findings but he told me be sure that I get the report and have my attorney\nDo whatever they have to do to get it he said you need to see this so I Believe that he he's telling me that there was a problem with the repair so I'll probably have to fix it and then go after him either ... or a small claims depending on what it is that's what the other insurance company hasn't paid the whole claim yet either because I always go after them why and how it's like\nBecause they don't want to pay more money they don't pay rental car they don't pay anything like that so I Need to go after them to collect that money you know and still without a car that we can't drive\nWho ... who had the your husband your whose fault was the accident\nIt was the other party they made\nWell double yellow and it was so close to him going down the street he didn't even see it till she was right in front of him so she doesn't see how she never had a break so he tried to avoid her and ... well obviously it was her father luckily for us there was a group of golfers standing right there at a golf tournament and saw the whole thing and they were all police officers\nIt was like dude [laughter] there's nothing wrong with the vehicle changed the oil and move on\nYeah you know it just hold it seems that well and that is that they're making Swiss cheese milk in the instance of the lady with the Camaro she's\n[noise] you know where is the responsibility where's the obligation of the repair shop to do the right thing and in in ... case with the jeep and in ... I don't understand these guys sleep at night I really don't fix damn car is what you got paid for what you got paid to do fix the car how hard is is\nI beyond like be on my comprehension let's go talk

Shaffir hello Tom good to talk to you welcome\nTo talk to you listen to you every weekend really an enemy call until now\nWhile I'm Glad you called [laughter] so one week ago last friday yeah they got a while they admitted to having been hacked by\nA somebody who figured out a clever way to steal people's accounts and that they sold their accounts by used by basically stealing this little cookie this token that Facebook's you know when you log in Facebook you only have to log in for once and then as they walked in\nWith the way that works is when you log into Facebook stores this little piece of information on your hard drive that's unique to you\nThat says yeah that Tom let's go Tom from cars to California yup letter man than this hack or allow bad\nGuys to grab that little piece of information and use it for themselves so what Facebook did when they found this is a deactivated Ninety million users a week ago friday now is that about when you were unable to log in\n... in actually it's my wife's account I can still log into might find\nSo she was one of the Ninety million you weren't\nYeah yeah yeah 'cause I was very judicious about every thing\nWell it doesn't have anything to do with how judicious you are that's what's scary about ... like this is you can be\nPerfectly good and still ah have your Facebook account stone and this and we believe that uh actually one of my producers had as a couch sewing or some months ago and now we believe that's how it happened so\nAh the way Facebook fixes it is by the activating that cookie and by the way that would also log you out of anything you used Facebook to log into you know you can use face re log into a lot of stuff so she she's probably noticed that as well\n[noise] well yeah like me I'm each each think like Instagram and that sort of thing you know each one we don't log in from Facebook what do you use individual long\nThat's smart yeah\nTurns out that was if you are good that was a very smart thing to do because if they got that token and you could use that token log into other sites fray they'd be able to log in to you now they do you have to re log in and now you're they're saying hey we we want your second factor normally what that would be is a text message sent to your cell phone\nRight or another Facebook\nInstance that you could use the code from 'cause there's a code generator into Facebook app\n[noise] right well we we've been down that path um [noise] of course we can't get into her account she only logs in the face but for one thing yeah\nBut you know the truth is even if you have on the phone and they would have been locked out too so write write code generate isn't gonna help you know\nBut it oh it's different yeah that well I I knew that but uh right yeah\nNo of course you you we must use every outlet\nSo does it at some point in their day well I don't have access I Know it I Can't do it that way what else can you do and then at some point and say well we have a phone number on record for you or does it not\nWell she didn't it needed I but needless to say I've gone in and put one in mind\nJust like to go by the way yeah by\nThe way we've also learning that Facebook once you put that phone number in their uses it sell ads against it so thank you Facebook what a nightmare Facebook it's turned out to be yet\nBut you have to use that were black veiled into this so it sounds to me like she's going to have to contact Facebook except to say look I Can't and a number of people have had to do this and it's [noise] they'll make you jump through hoops with Facebook and the only one\nThat this man you\nGot ... I mean literally and we're going to answer is home theater question\n[noise]\nYeah well you can't have either from the top ... teams partly cloudy skies tonight with temperatures shopping into the ... warmer for Sunday\nPartly sunny and higher Seventy nine partly sunny where the chance of some sprinkles on Monday and highest Seventy two and we're expecting temperatures on next week to be in the seventies I'm Denise ...

P. simply struggles with that as a as a ... part of its nature so you know we watched a bit of Black Panther yeah in the dark yeah and it has some really dark scene and those are not as in ... and you lose some detail\nBut if you're in a living room with the lights on or you're watching a football game or something it this thing's going\nTo be ...
