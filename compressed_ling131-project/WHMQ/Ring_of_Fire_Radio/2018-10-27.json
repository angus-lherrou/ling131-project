Tim welcome to the car doctor\nHow can I help sir hey how's it going around us or what's going on\nUm I have a question for you I have a Ninety six F. one fifty that um I've got a really bad vibration and my gas pedal will come like when I come from a stop 'em and they go in or I apply the gas\nAnd then it goes away once I pass like sixty sixty five miles an hour ... minutes in may and it turns off I'd like thirty five miles an hour to come back like fifty\nAnd but it's like a really really hard vibration\n... when when you say a vibration Tim I'm like running off for like running over a rough road kind of a feeling\nYeah that's exactly what it feels like a like a bumps on the side of the road if you're running over those\nWhite and you're not you don't feel it to the dashboard you don't feel it through the floorboards just specifically the gas pedal\nIt's just strictly the gas but and then when I come off the gas I can rest of my foot without crossing the gas and I won't feel it but then as soon as I put my foot to press the gas pedal down again I feel I brought it to a couple of mechanic shop nobody can seem to figure it out a couple of guy that told me what they thought it was but then I've gone and fixed it myself\nAnd ah I Can't I I don't know any more I\nI mean how long has this been going on\nUp all the truck about six months ago the guy said it at ... and when I bought the truck and he thought it was a tire balance too because you put new tires on it um when he noticed that start to happening but\nI got I got the tire balance that I thought it was and then that didn't work\nI'll tell you that I'll tell you the stupid thing I think it might be but I might be wrong I I Would I Would want to know what the ... joined sort of like in the dry shift\nThat's what I checked also yeah we're just reading forums but when I went under there to recall that Dr shop a guideline it had no playing it at all take it off\nHere will pull a shift now pull the shadow ... pull the chef down and feel the joint you know on the front one or the back on\nA um [noise] I think the rear one I hold joints on the rear one would want to be what I wiggle in general because it's it's got to have good clean movement in all directions\nAnd ... and I you know I've seen this it sounds crazy but as a matter of fact as a matter of fact to resurrect\nThe imagery of a carpenter Bob's eighty four each three fifty van which only went to the junk yard a year and a half ago with five hundred thousand miles on it All right well uh I remember back when it had\nWhen it was a child at two hundred thousand miles and we had a similar problem where we had a vibration and the gas pedal and we went round and round and round\nAnd pulled the dry shift out and sure enough why and I kind of let Bob work on it for about a week because you know he was he wants to play mechanic and it finally said well you have to well 'cause hey listen when I'm working on what he never tells me what to do right away kind of it's a it's an it's an equal torture that's the love affairs\nAnd I I had to pull the dry shift out in the front joint just had a little bit of a click in it and sure enough it just it it it was catching it just right creating a vibration through the drive train but you know can be a friend who we are joined uh seen it I've seen it both combinations\nObviously we're going to talk about you know is the exhaust hanging right or the ... correct a you know anything that can cause are transmitted vibration from the engine to the gas pedal\nBut you know that should be a cable linkage set up so I'm thinking it's an isolation through the floor pan is it strictly the gas pedal or is it may be also in the area surrounding the gas pedal\n[noise] the only place I've ever felt it was the gas pedal well then again I guess as soon as I come off the accelerator goes away goes away\nYeah right it's it's it's kinda hard you'd have to take your left foot and shove it under the gas pedal while you're holding down with the right to ... you know it's it's and it gets a little awkward you don't want to do that Ernie Ernie crowded streets but yeah I wouldn't be thinking something Dr line and then when when you're looking at the shift\nMake sure you know look at it how rusty is you know we're in the northeast you're in Florida we were in the north you're in the south oh we have this thing up here called snow and salt and corrosion and then they throw all these chemicals\nThat are on I don't I don't know that as you say I Know it's you know it's got\nNorth you're in the south or we have this thing up here called snow and salt and corrosion and then they throw all these chemicals that are on I don't I don't know that is you say I Know it's you know it's God Bless you and you know we um you know we have these things were waits fall off of dry shift overtime\nAnd you know you don't stop to think about and then you get under the truck and you go why is there a fresh rush spot\nThere and the rest of the shift as a darker rust colored 'cause it used to be something welded to that and it fell off a ha so\nYou know getting the dry chef checked for straight sometimes isn't the best worst idea either get a check for ... straight it'll grounds\nYou know if it's some it's it's actually gotten to the point in a lot of people don't understand me for there's a lot of people don't understand me for a lot of things but\nI I don't do your joints in house anymore not nearly as much as I used to and it's not that we can't do them I don't think we can do them right\nBecause I think when you're doing you universal joins if you're not having the shift check for straightened balance I think you're only doing half the job I think it's like do I want to change with just changing a filter or you know ... unless\nSo I said well let's just you know do I have a bad fan okay I I hooked up and set up a ground than a hot feed right to the fan itself bypassed everything fan doesn't run I grabbed the fan blade and I hear clunk clunk clunk clunk clunk there's a wobble the fans wobbling on a shift\nI said gee I Wonder you know a bad spot on the armature of the cars been sitting for a year and a half right rush spots I mean it it's been sitting for a year and a half I moved the fan just maybe an eighth of an inch rotation just to change the contact point of the brush against the commentator\nI left the car warm up again well actually what I did was I took my power set up power grab and I got the fan motor run noisy as all get out called pop pop pop pop pop pop pop up but it started to spend it sound like a World War one by plane I was looking for new pie in the red beret and sure enough I hoped it back up\nI let the car start to run and get warm got the two under seven degrees no fan All right I Need a fan motor this is really weird and then I thought about it and as I was cleaning up last night carpenter Bob came in and this is the last job of the day this car was on his car all afternoon yesterday\nGovernor Bob came in and I'm cleaning up and I'm wiping my tools and he says what are you doing because he's got this Honda in front of 'em running\nAnd I've got this my my test headlight I couldn't live without my tests headlight right I've got my test satellite plugged into the fan connector where it gets energized by the ... and I said well I said this is kind of like back to the future I said when this thing hit two hundred and seven degrees or or higher than one Ninety nine according to the wiring diagram the headlights should light up\nAnd then Bob Said well where does it take the temperature reading 'cause I was explaining to them how I was seeing to seven to await and still no fan run and I thought about it and I said you know the switches in the bottom of the radiator\nThe temperature sensor that I'm reading is located in the ... head of the top of the engine it's two different areas it's not taking it both from the radiator temp I Wonder if and then I realized Honda's or two hundred and twelve when I Do an I'd alert on a Honda\nIcy temperatures up to two hundred and twelve degrees before the fan comes on I felt like Maxwell smart missed it by that much right needed five more degrees so I wait until the car turned to buy more degrees I wait until it got up to two hundred and twelve fence which read one Ninety nine\nSo when he entered into two twelve the radiators at one Ninety nine that's the temperature differential temperature differential the headlight came up Bob goes wise the headline on well let's go to the fans bed\nAnd he just looked at me and I explained the whole thing to him\nSo sometimes you got to go there really a long way around the board but the point becomes test everything I tested everything in that fans circuit I knew how everything worked when I was done I tested every component Monday it's getting a fan and the car will be done three problems none of them related the only common denominator that I can figure as\nSome of it had may have something to do with the fact that the car set for a year and a half\nBut you know there's no way I can control that fix the problems in front of you\nIf you've if you've ever wondered is this part of that part take the part of the car wired up on the bench treat it like a standalone device how\nWould you test it if you

P. tutor kept saying that you know even though the truck at thirty five is on it the tutor was programming and setting it up for thirty two\nAnd I kept saying you know we're sitting this code for tort calculation empire size is going to affect gear ratio and gear ratio is obviously going to affect\nYou know chore calculation and I I think this is your problem they ended up taking it down to a tutor in South Jersey was able to reprogram the whole thing and it turned out that yeah the tire saw differential was the issue so you know you gotta look at the whole thing engineers you know calculate and do things the whole you know you gotta look at everything it's like an old school out rock\nRight that's right we we we've got to look at everything gear ratio tire size listen to the camp um everything affects everything and now we're going to look at electronically so just make sure whatever software using gives you that option um\nYeah you're you're you're you're correct over that's that's the starting point right there and I think I think that's where the the issue lives right in and around the nation and really I I I Believe\nSo I think you have this but I'm just not accurate I'm ... and you know that's not a bad vehicle wait until you get to something ten years ...\nOh my gosh you drive by wire and the whole night it's it it drives a truck not just us but ... by any appreciable amount changing tire size and and you know all the other things that affect it or you know I've seen at and I'm Amazed at the performance after market has\n[noise] I don't know if its guts or nerve but the ability they just they start they sell these kids and then they have all these problems and I watch some of the issues they have\nA ... you know where they and they don't have the tech support for the better companies do the the some of the others don't and I think technology is going to be the um it's gonna be the end game\nUm you know be me up Scotty it's a tell you what the technology is addictive let's go to Alan Minnesota oh aid BMW see what's ah see what's going on here outlook him to the car doctor sure what's going to do for you\nWell thanks for calling about a two thousand and eight BMW that he has a three point O.

Thirteen millimeter both I Believe there's two of them\nAre you have to remove be are covered under the car and it's right there you\nKnow that it's gather to grieve\nRight mind very agree in months are replaced it uh there was absolutely no problem which started in the vehicle so it wasn't an alternate her she was ... was a dream issue it powering around here was about an hour of my time in a box of dollars yeah\nIt's it's it's it's it's it's power and ground listen I had I had a customer oh gosh got to be five six years ago\nWith a with a Nissan that wouldn't start in cold weather fuel pump wouldn't turn on you had a broken ground water coming off the transmission to the engine uh uh to the main cross member who was losing ground from the engine to the uh to the to the body of the vehicle was a ... sort of similar situation held on by one braid\nDoes you know six seven year old Nissan customer didn't believe me or we put the ground strap on the car fixed the car lost the customers because he was so annoyed that he went somewhere else and I don't feel ... and um you know why didn't you come to us first like it was my fault so but it happens it happens so yet um\nAnd the other thing I think that uh people need to be aware is that when these ground cables to erode they could actually cause overcharging and could hurt other parts of the ... oh yeah oh yeah and I would really right to you know I Would really recommend for anybody\nThat you experienced in those days to check the ground issues around cable first and I'd even go further that said there should be a\nA maintenance item so I really think that a at a hundred thousand miles I mean the Ikle or if you're experiencing anything like it or even if you're you're not you ought to be checked in with ... such an image of a replacement\nWell and and I agree with you and I think I think part of this comes back to the I think the better repair shops vehicles are coming up for service in maintenance\nAfter two three whatever we want to say ... years old it becomes part of a regular voltage dropped ground test and battery low test in charging system test at a specific mileage\nAnd the

have a physical switch\nWhich is really the right way to do it anyway and that's about my phone situation we have real telephones people can call ... when you've been answering them and who we are actually it here in Alexandria, Virginia thinks that one of her friends\nGot Facebook hacked or maybe oh she's not really sure oh dear what precautions you know she wants to know\nWhat everybody from just deleting it like you I guess yeah thank you Ken Hi\nCheryl Alexandria, Virginia welcome we'll report the tech guy\nThinks a whole lot to send this morning I got a\nFacebook Messenger message from somebody that I knew casually on Facebook friends with Sam I'm that this was a first Facebook Messenger that I ever got from Dan in rural suck it it started a little bit of conversation on that thing got suspicious and\n... this couple had built their retirement home in a New Bern North Carolina that got flooded\nSo badly and or ... you know somebody trying to take advantage of that with\nMoney that was it was it\nStays book that was how was it was it somebody she is a very common name to somebody just cake courting aiming engine can account and has has my phone ... catch my Facebook can white clean up there and they had a she clean it\nUp so many questions so and I don't blame you for worrying these days we all know that Facebook uh was in fact vulnerable at least thirty million people got their Facebook account ... so the there are a couple of ways people do this particular kind of thing you're the first one of the easiest one for them to impersonate somebody\nAnd and that Facebook makes it fairly easy I've had it happened to me at least several times because if you have a Facebook page they can take you know anything that's public and for most people that a lot the images the ban or your you know personal information\nAnd create a new account with a slight difference they can't use the exact same account name [noise] but they but since a lot of people don't assign a name to a Facebook account it's pretty easy to do this\nSo because they can make it the same name you know the public name it's just the the the Web pages has to be different you know the the official link has to be different so if your name is Emily ... Johnson\nA there maybe ten as you know there may be ten thousand Facebook pages for an Emily gee Johnson and if it has the same pictures St profile picture it's almost impossible distinguish it\nSo that's the most likely scenario um the second most likely scenario is that they got hacked and as I said Facebook announced thirty million people were hacked due to a flawed Facebook they reset all those accounts so even though they had been hacked unless somebody used that opportunity to take the account over\nUh it's it's you know not and it's hard to get your account ... although\nYou know if you use a password like monkey one two three and easily guests password um that's also possible so it might not be a bad idea to to contact or that person out of the band you know on a phone caller message or email message and say hey just question do you know was this huge we have a conversation\nSounds like you know that it isn't so that's that's a case where you might say hey it's happened heck now have you been hacked unless you click the Lincoln downloaded something or were taken to a\nKind of fraudulent page no just getting messages harmless but to be careful about links in these messages because they can link [noise] you know the bad guy wants\nTo run a program and so they can link to militias pages are malicious program to impact you we'll report the tech guy [noise]\n[noise] one on one by one over seven fourteen hundred and forty WHM news information and the arts [noise]\nRead us had mold plays at that that is also a sense\n[laughter] had to read I quickly you miss football seems kind of pick a witness after twenty two Seventeen down his east Hartford murky brown water forty eight guys including a key fourth quarter touched down\nTo leave the ... twenty two Seventy victory in Benin just hated rival you caught scratch listens to mark ripples from\nRed Sox Dodgers game for the world series tonight eight or nine first pets tonight as the red Sox and Dodgers full plate of the ... marathon seven hours twenty minutes or you know about it by now as it has three thirty eastern time\nHopefully tonight that game as a whole little more than that won some socks and Dodgers socks put a stranglehold on the LA Dodgers\nNational Hockey league tonight Bruins Canadians seven o'clock start there is a host of the NHL game tonight and there were three places after New Jersey Beach Florida I was just the Philadelphia that this will be Nashville and right now wants to retire to three three\nSelfish play tonight there is also hosts the NBA games there to try to play the pistons\nThis afternoon of a similar to the field out all these headless lizards she didn't have a PC at ...

just because you're playing the same ... go to each other's buildings were fortunate knock it used to be able to do this so easily but all this might be one of the more difficult once you're both teams is a little bit longer ride\nA but still I think it's a it's a great tradition hockey used as having these hallways and gives our fans chance she's we played last night and vice versa\nA lot of things I liked your team did maybe a few things you know the the can you use a little help on what are the things I noticed a not a coach but it looks like\nWhen you had those power play opportunities that team got sort of caught sucked into the uh being too much on the perimeter outside and not shrinking that ice there that can happen at the moment that seemed like a lot of the shots for a couple of the boards\nDo you agree with that I think actually was our whole game\nA including five on five you know the power by the fiber on three power play I actually played fashion generates opportunities up until that point in the game uh we really haven't even been in the offing zone I answer that allowed us gets his own time I thought we actually play better coming out of that we didn't school who had some decent looks\nBut we spent most of the night in the perimeter and I coach obviously at University of New Hampshire I Know that can happen to visiting teams\nI just felt that we didn't work hard enough so I I Know we made it easy for them I'm sure they play teams in that building and they have to really work hard to keep them on the outside last night they didn't have to work hard and that was my disappointment if we uh play that game and you know those guys were making them pay a price and they're working hard to keep us in the primary\nNobody can live with that but I was pretty disappointed with our effort to get into the inside the ice\n... coach Scott or care before UMass and Miramax um last night double physical little chip at the end this spring could solve whether you want to play physical or not you got to play physical here and uh so disciplined is the key certainly tonight\nWhile they got a you know an incredibly strong power play and we need to make sure that we play discipline\nUm you know we didn't show much on our power play last night but it just went to district is always important you can be the only box all night if you if you lose your discipline a note to important for us to keep our feet moving I'm not you know get our ... they'll give them a chance to fall down\nOn that's the problem when that happens and you need to make sure that you're you're moving your feet so if the players play against us move has that's on him and for the officials who tell the difference but\nUm there'll be contact 'cause that's the nature of the game at all or\nYou know what are the things I Know the power play maybe let you do last night but a ... it's early season numbers the sample sizes small but your power play going to last night was over twenty percent I Would imagine a a goal of any coaches if your power plays at twenty and you're pedaling kills in the upper eighties you're probably pretty happy\nYeah I Know for sure I I think ... is when you know um you you can have a three foot by now to a win six nothing and you know those those are that's great percentages but they're not wind power by goes I don't last night that was the biggest the five five minute major surgery for one of the game was that time\nWe were like are scored obviously we like to play better on that situation\nBut the earlier pop in the first grade when I was one nothing that was one that really I think took her to be rushed spirit because that's a wind power play and we got the opportunity or they gave us a second power play 'em and we just didn't do enough where they would have changed ... ... a game I think it would have\nI think we did they were very confident she last night and we were not and that was the difference in the game\nAnd gold quake potato you come back with him again tonight I'm nothing really to say about him but it's not a lot he can do a lot of the first chance to stop so you had to make\nYou did and he's he's very steady is going to make the safe should make 'em and that he's going to maybe ... ... you should uh but last night I thought he you know he was a victim motivated by our play we backed up a lot I have two beautiful goals which was just we're just um the Boeing and one and I forgot the other one of those shorter but uh\nOur play we backed up a lot I have two beautiful goals which was just we're just um the Boeing on one and I forgot the other one who shorter but I just two bombs by two guys just make great place on can't really blame him I Love to happens drop 'em but\nYou know and they didn't ask for an anyway but he's a really common sense launched for our team and this rank the nice thing about Craig's he plays a very tight game designer run around a lot you have a goal you places around the you know the runs around ... bad chances I encourage us to do that and that's why we can start tonight\nFinally I always thought it was kind of parched unfair to the teams playing here whether it's your team or anybody before you that's coach chair right back to when you mass played his first ever game against ... they always say teams like B. C. B. you would struggle come in here because they're fast or whatever but there's more to it than that what is the key\nOf you recruited and coaching here in a rink like this and probably the same with ... leaving in Providence where play small what do you do that good here as opposed to the other team struggling\nI think what you need to do here is you need to be able to play big and heavy and detail because things happened very fast in Iraq so actually begin happy I don't mean why don't people over I mean taking their isolate\nA we want to be big with the ... want to be with out to park and that just means to you know owning the shift in front of you last night I thought that you ... did a great job of that and we really never\nOwned their ice you know maybe the goal school it was a one time I felt that a limit chaos you guys actually go out and saw some room to get the parts of the net\nOther than that we didn't do that in this rank if you own the action front of you know that's a lot of ice for this ranks so\nWe really need to do that place drawing around the park and things happen faster you need to be detail because if you mess up a fortune ... put yourself you lose balance on neutral zone it shouldn't be ... opportunity because there's ... there's not hard to get sworn opportunities here last night the score opportunities will probably in the teens are both teams\nFlights will be in the twenties but no matter what happens you're gonna be the twenties tonight so um you want to make sure that there are shortages would be chances because you have good details on and then I tried the same thing\nExcept for a head coach ... appreciate your time as always best luck tonight the rest of the season actually will see at the end of February for the third and perhaps citing game of the series again thanks for talking with all the X. box really appreciate it back head coach Scott Parkland come back we'll chat with usa coach Greg ...\nThere's nothing better than a than that will stay in the last whistle in overtime and nothing better than a home heating company that does the same\nStandard we intervene last whistle doesn't blow until you've gotten the service more fuel you need to keep your house warm this winter ... technicians if you trust will be there what do you need us and we'll always answer the call\nEven when the game and Ender's trouble over the injury dot com to learn more about scenery and how they will be eating you", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Ring of Fire Radio", "city": "Greenfield", "day": "27"}
