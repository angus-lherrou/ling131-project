just missed hitting hitting the Fox river so today though I saw a pair of a deer and uh you know I I\nRealize this is not a big thing but when you do see you know you do your in your neighborhood\nOr it's kinda cool so I was ... this morning um apparently and I guess the deer have pretty good success with removing ticks there's the story that we are just got to the other day about the moose population especially the young moose population\nWho are really beleaguered with checks and they find they found on one young moose a dead they found forty seven\nThe beleaguered with checks and they find they found on one young moose a dead they found forty seven thousand ticks forty\nSeven thousand ticks that they found on this one animal and a lot of the expense of the young ones they're just inundated with us and what they do they we have that many ticks on you that they take all your blood so then you get anemic and then you get weak and then\nThat's the end of it so the news population is in a serious trouble or I guess in Canada and in Maine and other places where we are the most is hang out with me says yes it's a nice time uh but uh anyway so you got to be you feel for them um I have actually a commune with most\nOf this would have been in our days are younger days or if the moose head like and we should do a lot of camping up at the books that like I mean that's a way up to

you could get it right up close to them because the ... that's the other thing about moves that there are such terrible\nSo they don't even process that you might be a threat to to get right up close to them\nAnd are are we got I think I've still got like a super rate film that I took I was in the front seat and ... and the back and our baby was with us to baby is sleeping soundly floor of the canoe okay sleeping solid as we're out there a risk in our lives\nBecause you know most can charge you are you a I don't know I think of them is a fairly benign creature but do they can charge you and they can get frightened and they get they get spooked pretty easily\nAnd this one you just wanted to get spoke to he's looking at us and he's trying to do it they don't have any kind of long distance site or anything and so he wasn't trying to study to see what are we what are and then he realizes what we are\nAnd then tries to Gallup into the woods and trips all over these laws and I think this is kind of sad actually you didn't get hurt or anything but uh you know for Emory as you can hear is that going like I don't think this is a good idea to get this close to the most\nBut I've actually touch them we have been in the ... in in the woods it's very times a day and the booze come right up and they don't necessarily like to be touched or they they get kind of weird about it but unlike deer a deer can remove I guess because of the flexibility of the neck or something they can remove texts that are on their body so\nIt's not as much of a direct threat to a dear as it is to move move
