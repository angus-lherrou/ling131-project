when then and now they have a social service\nWhich she thinks she thinks there's some ... other turn it off and on and on and turn it off and turn it on so they're limiting the amount of people\nThat are all I mean you've seen the picture all aging status day I'm surprised that more people did not get hurt though during when you start looking at the eye of the storm and where it hit how close it hit it could have had to like a major metropolitan area\nAnd it wasn't just twenty miles or twenty miles per hour from being a category five storm I mean this would be huge\nHurricane yeah my brother lives near Panama City\nAnd how's he doing right okay uh his house survived during a but we're all\nYou know thinking I kept telling him like you know you you should go evacuate I think you should leave and you tell them to evacuate only two days before him and he did in the morning of the hurricane worse you know what I mean aren't we yeah um\nBut you know he lives right on the water on and he built a house that's like twelve or you know like twelve feet above the ground and he said the water was four feet up\nOkay so so ... was a smart choices but you know it's so funny that you know think about that so so if your house is twelve feet off the ground right\nEvery time that you pull into your driveway you're getting your steps and you're trying to make sure where on your dollar [laughter] because you're going up\nAnd up and down a best is in Tallahassee as Andrew said hello there Beth try him so do you have Internet access is everything goodbye you\nWe do not have Internet ah we have body cell service\nSo it's All right so without the Internet what do you miss the most\nOh my God I'm probably social media\nFacebook it out I heard Facebook in the background of fake I\nMy daughter and my husband are here with me there and so um yeah I I I went to make a dinner for the last night and I thought oh I've got the rest of it away [laughter] I Can't look\nIt up [laughter] so our kids are going to have a Mac and cheese again because I can read the Bible says okay yeah it's just the way that\nAre right and then were cooking everything on the grill it that that's really interesting to well you know that it's healthy right or you know kind of kind of we just got a great the diet out the window [laughter] oh during the hurricane\nAll I did was eat it was like I had the nerve a lengthy\n[laughter] that's okay you know what you guys are doing good and it takes a while you know make sure that everything's all back in action and uh but certainly our our hearts and our first goes to everybody that has been affected by that hurricane especially as it continues just to keep moving on\nUp the coast um so I understand you have a question about the smart a speakers once you get the power and once you get your Internet back\nRight yeah yeah I mean I just heard a lot about you know everybody getting them saying that everyone should have and I'm like you I really need one and what would I use it for\nYou know it's a really good question because as one of these gadgets that initially when you get it you go wow that's really cool I mean so you can say you know tell me what the weather is tell me what the traffic's going to look like order\nA more toilet paper paper towels or whatever it may be and then you start moving up the actual lungs so then you say turn on the light and you can also say goodnight and when you say goodnight is that the alarm system will set the front door will lock\nThe lights will go into night mode and then suddenly on the smart speaker next to your end table some white noise is playing to sue due to sleep\nIs all that happen automatically\nKnow of course not you know that [laughter] if they like you to think that but you have do you have to buy all the gadgets along the way I write\nA height you gotta buy the lights the smart lights and the smart locks and then you have to program those but it's not very difficult to program at\nA there are a thermostats that like the ego be and the nest that work with the Amazon Echo so that this way if you're sitting on the couch and you don't want to get your lazy but up and you can say you know turn the air down to Seventy six or turn the heat up the sixty six or whatever it may be\nAnd so it takes a while for you to get indoctrinated into it so to speak or no pun intended with these smart speakers but once you once you get it I think that you'll understand like this is exactly how it's supposed to work of I'm going to put together some links for you over at

money on line quickly because there's so many scams\nWhile there is one scam in particular that I Want to be on the lookout for until you more about that and just a moment but first here's a phone number one triple eight eight to five fifty to fifty four is the way to join us and of course when you're calling in there's Andrew but been skiing that Kim commando show man cave hello there Andrew\nKim Eric use in Cincinnati, Ohio and this is the first I mean I've been answering phones here for a long time long if you have to say how many years seven Seventy no no sixteen years there's gonna be Seventeen then it's almost Seventy a\nLong time we should probably talk about not being and in turn anymore you know what I'm going with it OK yeah less pressure\nI'm and I'm like you ... when I said Seventeen I Know can [laughter] sixteen pretty rough [laughter]\nGod Andrew ... co [noise] so Eric\nYes or he wants to be able to anonymously put photos on the Internet\nAnd when someone normally call for that I usually have a one line like hey that sounds like you want to break the law we're not going to put you on the radio to break the law but he actually has a good ... you know what 'cause it sounds like revenge porn or sure yeah something like something shady yes uh but he has good reason he used to have four adopted foster kid and he wants their grandparents\nTo be able to see what they look like but he's not ready to fully dime in on the whole communication from an interesting question\nYeah that is because it's so so Eric you want the grandparents to watch the kids grow up\n[laughter] yes that's exactly correct but\nI Know I was gonna say so is this an open adoption is that what happened\n[noise] no we adopted these children earlier this year they had been in foster care for four years prior to us getting them and we had them for a year before we adopted them so they've been out of the biological home for five or wow okay\nAnd this year the father the biological father passed away in a way I Do um we have some feelers for people who have just in contact and they asked if we could bring the children to the funeral and we said no we're not ready to do that yet right\nUm but they said well is there any way that we can we do watch them grow up so I was looking for some way that I could anonymously for present them pictures that they could see but I also don't want to just throw them out on the Internet for anyone to say I want to be able to target who can say that\nI get that I get that you know first of all what big heart but you and your wife and I have to take him for kids how old are the kids\nAre right now they're seven eight ten and eleven\n[laughter] wow okay it's a full household [laughter] it's a full house for their kids of our own so that we have eight [laughter] that's awesome that's awesome a couple of thoughts\nCome into mind or of course when you post photos you're going to make sure that there is no identifiable characteristics you know\n... and so forth\nYeah I Would take out all the all the men of data and the E. X. I. F. data and you're going to have to use a photo editing program to strip all that out right\nSure uh because a lot of people don't realize and if you're like what the heck are these two people talking about is that if I put in a picture up on the Internet and I pull it down is that I can open up the hidden data and then pretty much see where that photo was taken what type of camera et cetera are just on Google Map and so we want to make sure want to take all that stuff out\nA couple of thoughts you might want to consider I mean you've you have Google you out of school photos number one\nOr you can put them up there there's Yahoo Photos but one of the things that that came to mind when I was listening to your call\nIs that if you go to say for example a photo sharing site like shut her fly okay shutter fly will allow you to create not just photo albums but a particular website if you will that contains all the photos\nAnd so if they had and you'd have to figure out the best way to get the grandparents the the Web address but if they had the Web address they could just keep going back there to refresh it or say once a week or once a month and so they can start seeing and then in addition to that you get a record of them\nGoing to see it as well [noise] okay uh so I just had orders shutter fly and then sign up for an account and again you're going to be some options\nWhen you do this that you're really looking for your own unique website\nAnd then once you do that whoever knows that address that there'll be able to access all those photos and again aside from just the medical data is make sure that there is no identical characteristics with the kids as far as any type of school logos\nOr anything else that might show where they're actually physically located at any of those shots of course you can always use any photo editing program it just kind of waste that stuff in the back and [noise]\nAll right let's talk about one of our great sponsors there're works relieve their works relief\nLike many of us do you suffer from muscle cramps and your legs in your feet well to experience relieve do what I Do you want to use their works relieve\nFast acting phone get their works relief today at the end of the pain relief file at your local pharmacy or at their works relief once again dot com\nOr before the back of your phone calls I got to tell you about a phone scan that's offering phony Amazon dot com jobs because especially this time of year\nAs a matter of fact we just did a pod cast command on demand about the whole gig economy different ways that you could earn some quick cash just in time for Christmas is that job scams are claiming to be from Amazon or totally on the rise\nIn here is how the scam works listen up you get a voicemail inviting you to apply for a job at Amazon it sounds like a pretty sweet set up I mean you can earn anywhere from twenty dollars an hour or two maybe even as much as six thousand dollars a month catfish you're working from home\nUsually those are websites with fictitious names like a Amazon cash Amazon cash website Web store jobs you name it\nBut here's the catch when you go to fill out the online application you were asked to purchase a two hundred dollar enrollment kid and then once you make the payment poof\nScammers got all your money and your dream of\nA telecommuting and earning cash in your bunny slippers so any job that issue for some sort of a front pain that should should set off warning belts and if you are looking for legitimate ways to earn extra cash maybe you want to be an online tutor of virtual assistant or maybe you want to even watch TV\nIf money enjoying that look no further than the official home page I became commando show which is of course Gail M.

interesting I didn't ... crossed my desk and screen that you need to know about first to which\nThe state of California is banning weak passwords that's right\nIt's a new law the state of California you know all those Internet connected devices all around your home you have cameras in thermostats routers garage doors the smart light bulbs the smart crock pot for some reason well most of them come with these ridiculously easy to crack\nPasswords for example many routers and Web cams Evan default admin password like admitting or password so the idea that when you set up your new gadget you should always change the default pass for\nMaking something strong that the scammers won't be able to crack\nBut that doesn't always happen so too many people are just leaving the default password in place making themselves targets for criminals and hackers ... cameras All right so lawmakers in California you're trying to make that stop they just passed a law that goes into effect the beginning of twenty twenty it makes it illegal for companies\nTo said week default passwords on devices but here's the gab yet made and the state\nThe problem is most of those Internet connected devices I just mentioned they're made in China so the new law is going to require manufacturers who've said complex unique passwords for all the devices they have to maybe come up with a startup procedure in place that forces the user\nTo change the password I mean this is a long time coming when you think about it I mean but how effective is really going to be ... probably not so much because as I mentioned everything's made in China\nOr a Google was in the news again this past week not just because they announced a whole slew new pixel phones or because they had a major security breach\nWell they said it was a bug well that's what they always say it's a bug actually nobody was paying attention they explode the private information of about a half a million people for about three years thank you Google Google has its own social media site called Google Plus they announced between twenty Fifteen and march with twenty Eighteen\n\nAre we start talking about smart TV [laughter] the thing that

thousand color pages learn more apps and dot com slash eco tank Kim epson exceed your vision\nRight having a smart TV is one of the great benefits of modern technology\nBut when your TV connects to the Internet it becomes vulnerable well news out this past week but if you if they don't eat and ... a TV you really need to get into the settings and do a system update because there are no three critical bugs so that means is that hackers can come in\nAnd they can come in and take over the the television and then once they're in the television they can take over the entire network\nAnd anything else that may be connected to\nAnything else that may be connected to it rather slow to learn more about it and links that you might need and to check to see if you're probably is on the list look no further than commando dot com that scale M. A. N. D. O. dot com and winter there hit that show picks button stay right where you are you're still on Facebook some three D. photos are coming your way you're on the came commando show [noise]\nFrom coast to coast [laughter] how strong your source for\nAs a business owner I rely on down small business technology advisors I'm came commando now you and I both know\nThere's nothing small about our businesses are reputation is always on the line and that's where the Dell small business technology advisors comment reliable del PCs was intel core processors are rock solid\nI get it but where if you pay them a certain fee that they\nWill spotlight pure business you'll have more tools available to you you'll have other ways to say I want this review to be front and center and I don't want to be I don't want this review to be on the top anymore\nSo\nSo in answer to your question instead of signing up with a service to do this and I haven't heard a lot of good positive feedback from people who have signed up for the service and that's why I'm encouraging you to for you to do it yourself\nOkay is that to to accentuate that positive okay and to work with search engine optimization and to learn\nWhat it is before you hire affirmed because there are so many scammers out there who purport to know everything about as CEO and they say over five thousand dollars we'll put you at the top of the Google Search results\nThat well right All right well you know you can be at the top of the Google Search results right now\nAnd it's not going to cost you a lot of money because you can do a cost per click campaign so somebody types in whatever your medical profession is in your town within the ZIP codes you maybe pay ten cents for every click\nBut you're not going to be at the bottom of page you're not going to be on page too so you start thinking of different ways that you can market your business instead of putting that money and depending upon somebody else to quote unquote get rid of the bad stuff on line\nOkay does that make sense\nFor us you say um I I Do promote like customers or try to allow them to go on and put on a positive review for us it was just to get on to do it because they're like a should I Try to at a pet or something\nYeah and that's a rank and then so they can you do it here now\nYeah you put an eye pad right there exactly uh that's really smart and\nNumber you know and you could have a forum where they fill out you know positive and then they check a box that says this this can you know this goes up to health\nGrades or whatever it may be but the other thing too is you can have a basket their gift basket and every thirty days we pick a winner from that gift basket okay\nSo we pick a winner from somebody who did who left a positive review or somebody who left in ... review for us\nLight and so and that's that can\nBe on that little card or that can be on the printed receive that could be part of the email confirmation or the tax that they get confirming appointments and you know so you start to you know sit down and just make a list of all the different touch point that you have with that particular customer\nAnd then think of different ways that you can give them an incentive\nKnow maybe they write a negative review that's okay if you learn something from it you know you move on you make itself better but you start going in you start telling them what you want and that's the thing about people most people want to help you most people are really good nature but they may not know that this is what you need and\nDo you tell them at least four times to the average person has to hear something four times before they act\nAs that hopefully they'll get in there and do that now if for some reason this doesn't work
