hot\n[laughter] yes yes this is going to be quite a transition going from a brick and mortar office to my home office where I can either use my Mac laptop\nOr even my eye pad and iPhone right yeah so um I just didn't know if there was a way that I can do is ... feet check to see you know if the lighting is okay maybe the background the position that the camera\nI Know you're supposed to look into the eye of the camera and not the actual screen right things like that so I did I wanted to know what I can do to prepare before I actually get out and start thinking\nWell you know the big thing is is that we want to make sure there's a good light on you okay and in Chicago you have sunny days and you have cloudy days right\nYes and you have a cold winter days I've been there and like that so I'm the best case scenario is that you get what's called a Ringo light I don't know if you've heard of this and it's a it is a rank and uh I can put a link to one for you that I Would recommend free over at Amazon dot com\nAnd so what does it has it's for a facial ... like portraits of people use that for it's also when you're on when you're using a webcam\nIs that you have a tendency to be washed out okay with the ring light is exactly what it is is that it's going to illuminate your face and so that this way people are better able to see you and you'll actually you will actually look better lit up than dark a lotta people say\nOh no I live better in a dark restaurant nothing not so much K now when you're faces illuminated what's in the background will appear darker OK okay and so you being a doctor\nI Would want to see your credentials on the wall me anyway I Want to see those diplomas you know what I mean even though I Can't I won't be able to read them\nI Want to see all

you to or you don't strike me as that person but\nYou know we've interviewed people before like this guy you know for jobs here\nAnd you know and you look and they have this like there was a hoarders behind them and you're like ... what is that a child that too right so we clean all that up\nNow there are ways when you have faced time for example that you can hit a button is but it's gonna be hard but what I Would do is I Would just\nRecord say a couple of seconds and\nThen you don't have to worry about just taking pictures of you know record some video of yourself for thirty seconds\nThe big thing too that a lot of people don't realize funny is that you want to smile OK\nOkay and because when you smile you look welcoming\nAnd I'm sure you've done that you know where it's hard to deliver bad news but you might have a little bit of a smile you know a a is there's a whole side of\nI mean I have a lot of friends who are doctors might I hear a lot of the bad story but I also hear the good stories you know yeah and um but you know so being letting your personality come through have you ever done this before\n[noise] uh only end wedding hours but not actually as a patient doctor saying\nThis is so cool I'm so excited frail um the ring lights are about\nSixty bucks okay and it makes like I said it makes a total difference you're going to love what you see when you record a couple of minutes of yourself because at that point you're going to say yes a little extra blush sometimes works too when you're on a webcam because\nUh you seem to be a little bit washed out even if

it's just like you said before giving people out of their money\nBut how about this one this is a little different when we order or my sister's kids came over for dinner throwing which has got a bunch of barbecue shall we go on Amazon restaurants right a bunch of barbecue and I get the total and it's like a hundred and twenty five dollars and I was like that's a lot more than I was expecting right they automatically added on her twenty five per cent tip\nAfter also charging me a delivery fee\nOkay that that's really tough because they don't even ask you yeah and you know door dashes notorious for that and also who breed because they'll say like price things search okay and so they add another five dollars if you\nOrder something that's under ten dollars there'll be a small order delivery charge you know or whatever it may be\nBut maybe it's like being a server at one point in my life I actually will tip the whole foods or the Amazon Prime driver or whatever it is I'll actually add more like he's like okay I got a whole foods the delivery yesterday\nAnd it was probably I think it was like a hundred and fifty dollars\nSo you got two things yeah I had seven and broccoli [laughter] which is probably about it and some sushi okay\nAnd the tip was a recommended to was twelve dollars it and so so I was ten percent okay I ... I gave the guy sixteen I gave him an extra four\nOr five I Wonder what I mean the research has got to be out there but this worked otherwise the apps that are doing this the squares and stuff like that they wouldn't included\nWell and because you know remember they're making a percentage of the total even on a tip yes okay because they charge square and the other one said two point nine percent two and a half percent of as a transaction fee of the total amount right okay so if they can get that total thinking about this if they can get the total\nAmount up by five dollars I Would think the ... dollars no no no you pay the whole transaction than what the ... what is that what is the bottom line transaction then\nYou have to pay a fee for them collecting the money and doing things like that and he does have a minute I'm Still not tipping well it is hard it is hard and\nYou know I I don't know maybe I'm maybe I'm just a nicer more generous person than you are there is no maybe about uh the I think that you know but I but sometimes it is kind of awkward\nYou know tipping again for just like what is normally\nAnd what we should be considered like just part of the experience\nLike somebody handing you a napkin [laughter] so things here's ten percent instead of having them after limited use use the cash that you're expecting me to get him to my face something like that\n[noise] All right let me tell you something over the years epson printers may have earned my trust which is why I'm a committed user and you'll see what I mean you have to experience the economical Epps an ego tank forty seven fifty it's a fantastic wireless all in one corner loved his friend is my printer choice\nOr for a couple of reasons well first of all is cartridge free don't you hate buying printer ink cartridges oh my gosh what's in there anyway golden no it's colored IQ\nBut the epson ego tame forty seven fifties cartridge free comes with up to two years of AIG riding the box that's enough to print up to eleven thousand color pages\nThat's the equivalent of thirty a cartridge that now if I were to run to the store and buy thirty cartridge that's yeah do the math it would cost me about Fifteen hundred dollars\nWas ego take you easily refill the printers ink tank and seconds\nThe ego taken the compact space saving printer that's truly cartridge free and it's available everywhere\nYou can learn more right now epson dot\nCom slash eco tank Kim let's each CEO she a and cake him and for a limited time between now and November first you're going to get free overnight shipping whenever used to promote ego tank him a check out when you buy any ego ten ... or so whenever I talk about his friend and\nPeople are always sending me emails you know what was the model number or how can I learn more about it\nDid you really say cartridge free with up to two years of vague right in the box yet I said all that here's the Web address SBN dot com slash ego tank Kim once again that's epson dot com slash eco tank you\nAre right we have a letter from our listener mail that we're going to be answering this hour it's all about anonymous browsing and there's a browser there by the name of toward T.

with Karen and she is in spring grove Pennsylvania she lives spring\nGrowth that sounds like a nice place to live doesn't it doesn't really horrible place I live in spring grows right next to a garbage\nTown Pennsylvania which is not very well populated not at all she uh she lives in rural areas and she's thinking about switching cell phone providers currently she has ... and for home wireless because she was in rural and she has her for her so even while\nThe company that she was thinking about switching to use the rising towers she's like oh well they use all the same stuff is going to be all the same connection and then she went [noise] what advantage whatever's worth [laughter]\nWhat if it's where I Need to call them and it's so frustrating\nThough isn't it I mean when you don't have a decent connection in your house I mean you know we just talked about you buy a new house right now is a lot of millennials especially millennials are you a millennial you know I think I missed it by yeah you're right on the U.S\nIs that a lot of millennials won't be won't buy a new home if it doesn't\nHave say a fiber optic next I mean that is now requirements like you know two and a half bathrooms three bedrooms and a fiber connections so then this way\nYou don't have to worry about what's going on so don't care and you don't have all bars in all places that's what I'm hearing\nThat is correct [laughter] and there's no way that you want to move to the big city ah no no we're going to stay right here okay so so when you complained of arise and what did they say\n[noise] um they really can't get many answer I've been I've been with them to think twenty twelve okay\nBut the past month it is just so slow here that the Internet's almost useless [noise] so I'm looking at switching to Comcast for my Internet and income can't say well we also have noble and so I thought well that might be a great don't service but\nI'm concerned that maybe it won't be because they do use the same price and towers and would switch between for I think ours and Comcast hot spot you know I don't know I like\nI I don't I don't know if I'd Lincoln switching between the hot spots um [noise]\nDidn't you know what you okay ... you know what you could possibly get and I don't know ... varieties and you know would give you a deal on or sometimes if you complain loud enough you get it for free\nIs that you may be able to get a little what's called a ... for your house and so it's kind of like a repeat or off of the cell tower itself\nAnd but the thing with the ... and this is why I can rent a robot Comcast is that\nIf Comcast is using other ... to increase your reception in your in bars I don't know if I like that either um so my first recommendation we go back to arise in and say listen I Need to have some type of Microsoft or something that you can I can put inside my house that will repeat the signal\nFrom the tower that you have nearest may\nSo I get a stronger signal and then they'll say no we can't do that because you're only talking to a rap but\nFrom the tower that you have nearest me so I get a stronger signal and then they'll say no we can't do that because you're only talking to a rap\nBut if you get up into a manager a supervisor level and explain to them that you're paying for the service and you're not getting everything that they promised sometimes you can get it for free if not that it's like a hundred maybe two hundred bucks okay\nOkay now let's talk a little bit about the cell phone towers is that even though the life of arising and AT and T and Comcast or maybe they can share cell towers\nThey often use different frequencies in technologies so they're not actually sharing the hardware on the tower makes sense okay um and they're usually\nOwn now the towers are owned by a leasing company not even by the provider anymore because the providers figured out that they could sell the uh the towers and they don't have to carry that debt and they can make\nMore money so the thing that you can go back to Comcast with as they you know ... which frequency\nIs Comcast on a tower and how does that compare for rights that this is not that you're going to know what all this means but just this way if the numbers are different than you know that that it should be different of that one service might be\nBetter and I and Comcast senses of cable companies some of this band with maybe coming off the cable to now there is hope on the horizon and the hope on the horizon is five gee\nAnd it's supposed to get better for all of us that are having cell phone problems um is basically you're talking to an for gee you're talking about one gig abet a per second speed versus on five gee you're talking about multiple databases and so\nYou know couple of solutions that you might want to try before you just dumped ... do you think you could call ask one of your neighbors if they have Comcast\n[noise] I could try that we don't have a real real close to ... I'm afraid of 'em [laughter] I knew that we know but um [noise] but I could try that\nBecause sometimes you know and of course you know they may say it's great and then you get it and then you're ... very right if I could be you know here's where I'm at you know what you might want to do\nIs explain to Comcast what the problem is at Comcast turn turn on the line you try it for a couple of days see how it works\nExplained to them I don't want to sign up for a long term contract right now I Want to be able to at least ten and put my tone or she when I'm getting\nAnd you don't let me tell you something the cable companies are struggling right now they'll do anything to keep occurring customers to get a customer so getting might have to escalate it's a little bit up higher but it's definitely something that you might want to take a look at doing just having a conversation and Karen thank you so much for your call Gary in South bend hello there Gary what's going on\n[noise] are you doing are looking or an hour\nThat I can secure the sun money to a private party\nUm [noise] I was in a small car accident and rather than go through the ... center it's a it's a friend of mine\nWho liked to take care of it personally sure I'm I'm just looking for secure at that I can send her um payments or I'm not not something we all use all the time that something that can vary articles on here in the ... and so\nI you know a couple of ways you can do it you know [noise] just\nJust a real assemblies when you're sending money to friends be you know you have to be really careful make sure that you have everything done correctly because they don't issue refunds okay\nA couple of options you've have Google Wallet you'll have pay pal and one of the most popular ones out there now is something called ...\nAnd all of them charged two point nine percent as far as to make this wire transfer a bit the exception of pay pal they charge two point nine percent plus thirty them but if you're looking for a safe secure way you don't want to give out your checks or maybe you don't even have a bank account anymore\nIs that you want to take a look at as I mentioned Google Wallet probably pay pal is the one that's most commonly used then mow it seems to be getting a lot of traction though as time goes on Gary thank you for your call it the right where you are we have our money to coming up and more of your phone calls that you don't want to miss here on the came commando show [noise]\nLook now bring on marriages digital cameras on them\n\nOver the years I've tried and tested every way that average people can and should back of the debt on their computers I'll tell you that I drive it's simply the best cloud of backup service there is for big reasons why\nAnd the August ... is the best but\nWhen you start looking at locks that they have different system so you ... you can't just buy the lock and it goes on the Internet\nIs that you buy the log and then it connects to a hub okay so you have like a smart things have or you have what what I have is the next year up okay and then within the next\nYear Hubbard is where things have you'll find that there are other things that you can do so like if you wanted certain lights to come on in the middle you know say from eleven PM to six am when nobody's there\nSo at least illuminates maybe less likely for somebody to break in\nIs that you can program the lives for that if you had certain cameras you could do that as well if you were worried about a water damage when nobody's actually there and it's snowing and the pipes are freezing you know what I'm saying\nIs that there are water detection sensors you could also put in there that you can get alerts so once you once you get the hub Charles what I'm saying is that once you get the hobby started thinking about OK\nWhat more can I add to that right it is so good ...\nYou know so if there are there any other things that we can for a couple of hundred bucks because that's all you're talking\nAbout right that that's also luggage\nYeah then it might be worth it okay so when\nYou start looking at different products the smart things though this is where it gets confusing is that you've got the wave and ... and those are different standards\nAre ... and that works with the smartest things next he uh everything works like um I have a a train air conditioner that I can control remotely you know on the next year or so so so that's what I'm trying to it so I'm trying to expand your horizons but once we had the ... what else can we\nDo if that law took things yeah exciting I mean it's really cool to doctors all states with the holograms turning Oliver\nAndrea don't you think that you and I would be excellent at doing like a theatre version of the game commando show absolutely agree making a musical\nWell I don't know I could think commando them he was that one but I don't [laughter]\nI don't think we'd go past one night I don't know I mean just so anyway popular demand women I don't have a say in an grape in Canada that was [laughter] we didn't even make into like Lincoln Broadway in ... that was it that's off off off off\nAuthors runs wet or the ... it's more intimate yeah absolutely [laughter]\nAll right so the next the assistance going to set you back eight dollars and Ninety nine cents a month\nOr I'd say\nThat's it not a big deal to take a look at the ... to the show leg since\nAnd connect OK okay the next ... is about sixty bucks a lock is going to set you back a hundred and fifty and then you're looking at say just for giggles ten bucks a month and\nThen it allows you to program all those codes get reports whose common and what's going on with that and then if you could set it for twenty four hours and then if somebody does do you think something was wrong you can just kill that code and killed it automatically there's no delay\nYou can also un slit\nYeah you can set up a code really ... you know if you're if you're doing anything remotely\nA really makes sense that you start looking at smart stuff and order to be notified and get alerts and things like that hey Charlie thank you for
