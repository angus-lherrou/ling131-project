WHM be news information and they are\n[noise] [noise] [noise]\n\nOkay later on is our letter from our listener mail I'm Wondering if I can see everything that Google has tracked about me is that possible or\nDo I need a court order for that we're going to give you that answer again still to come this hour the came commando show but the phone lines are open one triple eight eight to five fifty to fifty for once again it's a way to join us and when you're calling again there's Andrew but been skiing that Kim commando show man cave Kim though there Andrew\nSo Scott in Charleston South Carolina called him and he said I just got back from months in Europe and Russia and we're worried about Internet Security\nAnd ice and Scott you just got back shouldn't\nHave been the hall you mean by that point when\n[laughter] just you know just a little head up Scott [laughter] next time give us a call before you got [laughter] I mean he said yes I sure do but we're planning on going back and it got me thinking next time we go to Russia how can we prepare ourselves to be secure\nOK so a friend of mine who lives in London in ... or you know okay is that um she was telling me that she went to Beijing and\nSo she had her windows laptop they're connected to the hotel\nWhy fight right [laughter] okay and she said all of a sudden the the hard drive light like went okay and it stayed\nConstantly illuminated for the next eight hours wonder why\nDo you think they were copying the entire hard drive not the Chinese oh they would not do that at all gosh God neither would the Russians what are you worried about\n[noise] [laughter]\nWell I Would love to add up to you talk to you before we called but that was not an option and in fact I have a kind of a two part question number one the the rumors always been ours devices or less vulnerable than Android or PCs\nNow if you just first confirmed that then I Want to talk about the peons\nOkay um [noise] the the reason why that people say that Iowa devices are more secure is that there are ... that apple keeps a hold on everything okay\nSo in order for you to penetrate through the operating system is that you have to go through multiple levels of encryption you can jail break an iPhone or if you wanted to and basically take all the security and the trolls are right away\nBut if you are trying to get a piece of now we're onto an Iowa this device that it is more difficult than say Android or window so yes that is true\n[noise] [noise] well what I did do [noise] sorry on this trip\nWas caught a little bit of a fold\nDo us a it's a VPN and but I wondered if that was enough or if there was more the U.S should be doing in a situation like what\nDid you do everything while you were overseas I mean did your bank can pay your credit cards and check Facebook in business and stuff like that\nI did have to check my bank once or maybe twice but I Try to avoid that didn't do anything with credit cards except of could obviously to pay ... a it was mainly just to cooking meals\nAnd then did you do everything through the VPN or did you fall like that where where you got like well just can check the mail one\n[noise] it was so much that if there were several types it seemed like the VPN prohibited me from getting on a website and I don't mean that particular website it it just like anything getting on the Internet period\nAnd it could do that depending upon what lockdown can be in a particular community and a particular country and so I'm a lot of VPN when if you look at their coverage map is that you want to make sure that they have multiple access points within one particular city\nAnd so that this way you can get out if you want it to ... you know it's it's a it's a really interesting topic because in my email this past week I also had a note from a gentleman who was in China and couldn't go anywhere because he was in China you know of course the they had the great firewall there\nAnd they're stealing anything that they can but that's a whole another topic\nWhen you are ... traveling in countries like Russia and you do come back you know the general rule is that number one before you go is that you make a complete backup of everything [noise] ah so that this way if you need to restore it then you'd be able to because sometimes coming back in the country or going to a country believe it or not that you may have your device confiscated\nAnd if it is confiscated weather here or abroad or three or six months you might be able to see it again but quite possibly a year ... and nobody wants that to happen so that was not your issue I Would recommend that you change all your passwords to any account that that you have had access to\nA especially your even though you didn't use a VPN\nBecause I wouldn't want you to take any unnecessary risks and then be sitting here thirty days after a trip and typically they are going to wait until you you're at home for thirty days and then you start seeing some weird stuff happening you know what I mean\nUm and if you haven't already set up some type of authentication on your bank account I Would definitely encourage that but in my wallet I carry a\n... about the size of a thumb drive I don't know if you've ever seen the news and the thumb drive has\nA rotating code on it and even now I can tell you I can show you that there's a coat on it and every thirty seconds I get a brand new code if you don't have that code you can't have access to my bank account so I Would try\nTo ... I Would encourage you to see if you can still some of that type of\nA extra layers of protection as well and they sent me for you though because it's called we're here for you um but congratulations on a great trip at a safe return but again just spent some time and change all those passwords [noise] it was and I have to tell you if you haven't heard about the brand new commando ambassador ... super excited about this\nAt our commander dot com slash ambassador you refer to your friends to the Kim commando show and they came commando show newsletters and you can earn valuable prizes\nI'm a laptop or a blue to speak or I mean really great prizes you do not have to be a Kim's club member to bridges debate we're talking about commando dot com slash ambassador or in your newsletter scroll down to the bottom you'll have a direct link to your particular page\nReally excited about that the right where you are talking about the history of the cell phone now boring coming up here on the ...\nYou know bring your general marriages last\n\nHere's some exciting news as a company simply save is now valued at a billion dollars not only that more than two million homes are not protected with an incredible simply say system simply safest comprehensive protection for your home with\nSee yeah that that's crazy I didn't realize that it went that far back\nI had no idea I would've guessed the late seventies most yeah I would've said the seventies in the seventies Motorola they came out with their first ever put public cell phone or that was available and they made their first ever public cell phone call on a device that weighed two and a half pounds\nThat's a big phone that's a heavy phone ... imagine a cell phone if the technology did not advantage and we were still\nCarrying around a whole lot I got to get my phone [laughter] because you live that formula back is killing me just hold it for just a fact okay so we we jump forward another decade okay in the late eighties\nThe GSM standard I remember that the mobile standards were established world why would you basically opened up the cell phone industry so it now it can begin to grow commercially so Nineteen Ninety two you know what happened in Nineteen Ninety two\nUh the first text message was sent you just read that story [laughter] ...

are the same there's something beautiful about the fact that like that uh that music as this unbroken chain leading so far\nBack that's something that I I I was lucky enough to learn all the time in

you know the feeling of just staying at the end of kind of a you know it just that the rope and then like something something snaps in ... in you know you you're you're a different kind of emotional\nPlace than your word before you know there's always that feeling like potential for that to happen and writing dreams was about like what I wanted to write a story about someone who who\nUh

like that that really do like I did a justice like there's there's a lot of songs about depression you know like you know it's one of the things\nSongwriters do [laughter] but um but like I sort of felt like what I wasn't feeling was his depression so much is this like this like a constant ... feeling I was like a like a constant turn or something like that uh that I needed something to the lyrical he could could\nKind of be in its own way kind of unrelenting overpowering just sort of like that are worth something to this feeling what it was washed over there and like the only way to do was to be as explicit as I possibly could trying to describe\nA mental state and a certain way you know it's like you're the only way to really I feel do it justice is to describe it is plainly as you can you know\nHere's a little more on dreams come Josh Ritter on the river and\nTo the doctors and made it went down to send me to a doctor who's been meeting room and that's where I waited when the

I. dot com oh this is Josh Ritter and you're listening to the river [noise]\nThat was the way he handled that are from the twenty news storm teams you have night when I'm Around sixty partly sunny weather chances some sprinkles\nOn Monday in a high up Seventy two she didn't stand ups partly sunny and warm or high Seventy five and we could see how high up to Seventy eight on Wednesday with temps in the seventies all next week I'm Denise ... unless one side and one of seven five nobody may Tempe [noise]\nBaseball clarity on to the Boston Marathon friday October twelve from six AM to feed off\nOf those being Paul elbows accent [noise] nobody region piece Bob ... he is going to play pinball for him to raise money to support refugees who left their home country\nAt a table tennis any Santa Barbara\nBattle mayors minister's hands and mysteries you solve it is one of the nation or Catholic charities welcoming refugees sign up to play ball right now I don't even know you shouldn't be dot com or just stop by Bob Larry's Bonnie Bonnie\nFew years that have or fix that are similar to T. G. three eighty seven\nWhat is causing them to have these orbits and that's where this becomes interesting because it's drawing them or think\nThat there is in large planet out that ... that may be bigger than the earth but perhaps smaller than Neptune this is where\nPlanet nine or I Would say find a ten a comes into play big ... and this is ... and it's spectacular because they'd up predictions you can look at the orbits of these outer bodies like this T. G. three to seven we are talking about the way out in the solar system right I mean many times farther away from the brutal\nAnd there is then mathematically people can predict that their orbits may be shaped by in large gravitational pull grab a file for large body that we have not seen yet how if we go ahead you're way out there did we miss it\nIt's a really big\nFan [laughter]\nSo you haven't seen in ... in the u._s. can do that you are right on the flu or the Colorado like you know\nTo me and my friend who lives in Colorado I said it's a small universe\nSo so but this is really cool that we can actually predict based upon the orbits the existence of unseen bodies\nNow this particular body treat a T. G. three eighty seven it has been detected as part of this search for this large planet out there we haven't seen the last name because people thought oh this may be the one\nThat says if the large planning another elliptical orbit and that's why we haven't seen it\nThat that's where I really think it's going to be up to the its orbit is predicted by looking at how these dwarf planets and moving we think that these dwarf planets orbits are being impacted by the gravity often other unseen planet\nNow I should clarify sometimes people think of a that's a big large body as like you know sometimes people talk about these\nOther star that coming close to where this hidden start no it's not like that it's just a large planet like the like like the bigger than they are saying well you don't know if it exists I mean it's just that we think\nThat the way we are looking at we are the are bits of these dwarf planets these orbits have been impacted by the gravity of an unseen\nBody so we're talking about the kind of gravitational pull of the earth hands on the moon that sort of thing\nAre less than that uh because a while I mean it depends because uh the planning would be bigger but these bodies are smaller but they are much farther away than are tend to say it's it's not circling\nOr we're not talking about these dropped buddies orbiting this planet we are just simply talking about like the way Jupiter may impact any um asteroid coming into our comic coming into the solar system this is how Pluto was down in the first place to write because of the effect on Neptune that right well All right so so that we were trying to explain\nThe variations in the orbit of Neptune and some people\nAnd that's the reason why they were looking for it and then they find Pluto and then I mean I Would say whatever you find like you know it should be just like a kids no matter what like and I used to love\nThem [laughter] but they said\nNo it's too small I was like you know so what I like to know it just ... anyway so I digress but a little bit smaller than earth's mood for those who don't know right I mean it really is small and\nUh one one other thing I should mention that are right now it is kind of cool and mostly astronomers know about how cool that is to predict an unseen body and then we find it it's pretty cool but ah the discovery of Neptune or in the early Nineteen century I think it was in the Nineteen forties uh Eighteen forties or Eighteen forties\nThat was amazing because that was discovered based on the orbital a perturbations in orbit off a urine\nAnd astronomers purely by calculations purely by calculations getting them in with his Eighteen forties they said look if you point that telescope in this region of us got someone to your question about eight in the border to see it like as a big space\nAnd throwing it was predicted like given that if you point your telescope in that direction you were going to see a planet that nobody has ever seen before\nAnd in fact that they did find it or they did a big controversy between whether it was a the calculations word used drugs on the fringe or the British But that particular discovery of Neptune it turns out or captured public imagination and really put trust in the power of science\nThat in the sky you look up you don't know what it is you point you point that telescope in that direction you're going to find an object that no one has seen before so again a this is\nNow the twenty first century we are still doing the same thing but now people are used to it even though they may denied climate change and other motives but scientists actually cool it actually can predict things were going to take a quick break and be back with more of a\nProfessor and astronomers ... right after this [noise]\nHuman showing that he was one of the odyssey bookshop south happily independent book selling since Nineteen sixty three\n... jumpy morning new began\nTo

to have in the studio with me once again in ... the least of the ... brothers welcome you guys how's it going it's going great in the next round and\nIt's my pleasure that's the least brothers latest album is life in the dark and you're going to be playing the Shea internists falls tonight with spirit family reunion I Can't wait to be fun\nIt is going to be fun James one of the highlights of my recent concert going career was your Halloween show that that you did a couple of years ago pro street and\nAnd also cleaner festival is great yeah so what do you have plans for tonight we're going to\nDo our thing mostly I think right to do our thing we don't have any like specific special plans but it's sort of be awesome show I think\nYou just have to see what comes out of the male the route happens that ... it's been like a little bit of a challenging week maybe you might say yeah you want to comment on the election\n[laughter] ah I think it's pretty horrifying ... I don't know I don't have words of wisdom I just think the the good qualities that people are going to prevail over you know the bigotry and stuff I'm just concerned about you know the climate and his lot of different things\nLike every single land yeah yeah I agree it's the climate around us and the environs to yeah how 'bout you James\nI asked the same way disappointed and ashamed and so many people say a sheen yeah tell me why say shamed just to share\nYou know this this is our country now and we elected an absurd person\nIn every possible way unqualified and articulate an intelligent belligerent noxious says we shouldn't be ashamed yeah yes bummer [laughter]\nYup it's a bummer Leonard Cohen leaving us a bummer also so let's go to the shape tonight and have a good time yeah exactly have a good time hanging out with the police\nBrothers I was on your website I Love your velvet Bambi T shirts oh yeah\nI hadn't seen those before people love those shirts yeah we've had it for a few months\nWe had them on tour and they got bought up pretty quick but we have a great more now\nThey look kind of like a ... a Bambi ... it's pretty special it's a very special base and they feel really good I highly recommend you go to the police feathers website and get one and they have girls cuts to social thank you for that you are welcome you grew up in the same house obviously did you\nKnow actually I'm using every other weekend every other word for it right and the other half brothers well we all have complicated family so I can only get that um who go into music first\nMe early in the ...\nYeah in ... definitely was a music first we gave me my first Neil Young tape when I was like Thirteen or something is that's when I got in the music with Iran and whom and they would say yeah fall by Randy Newman tape sail away which still my favorite record of all time [laughter] and started a lifelong obsession with Randy Newman\n[laughter] clenched Canada your brother never have any pets right", "show_name": "Kim Komando Show", "year": "2018", "city": "Greenfield", "day": "07"}
