have two teenage boy it's you're updating their [laughter] video game or X. box and and what not and\nThen my husband and I like to look at things on the Internet and then I have another one that has an eye pad he likes to get games and it's just to the point where I was just\nI'm frustrated so I was wondering if a we boost for the home it's a cell phone signal booster that I've looked at and you plug it into one of the house and plug it into the other end of the house and I was just wondering if something like that would work for us\n[noise] no [noise] no [noise] um\nIt's all it's doing at that point is it's boosting the signal okay and so it's amplifying the signal so the whole idea is that if you don't have decent sailor coverage is that you can buy this booster and then instead of having like three bars you might have for bars okay [noise]\nUh and it does it by amplifying the connection with than a certain area around\nYou okay I'm a ... so that's not gonna help you um I assume that you this is the only option\n[noise] well I'm that's why I'm calling you because it it's to the point where we've gone over to a friend's house the Internet to uh teach\nBut you know what she 'cause you know it's you know you can get fifty gigs but if you're blowing through ... you know Fifteen gigs in four hours I mean what's the sense right I mean you write\nThat ah there's always satellite\nAnd yeah we try well we've heard our neighbors to gripe about it\nYeah if you don't want to especially when you're looking at games and you've got three guys in the house that are trying to do games that's not going to work or doesn't work very well\nIt also crawls um have you looked into a DSL line\nAnd that comes from a company correct because we've called our uh TV company and that\nIs that those Bactrim\nYes okay back them an charter and nobody will come down our wrote that followed them since two thousand for\nUm [noise]\nI just for giggles okay let me tell you let me tell you a couple of things from Kaye\nIs it a friend of mine recently purchased a home and north of ... there's probably isn't going to be moving to but north of Scottsdale, Arizona okay [noise]\nAnd so you have Phoenix you have Scottsdale and then you have like this stretch of road where there's nothing okay miles around and and she bought this beautiful house in the middle of five acres\nOkay All right it's in the house is like a thousand square feet but she likes it because there is she has no neighbors right right now she's\nAlso a doctor on called\n[noise] and so before so she has a house in escrow and she's totally Cosby she freaks out it's like\nOh my God what am I going to do I don't think there's Internet and we I have this house in escrow so I told her just to\nUh I I did some homework for her and I found a a a gentleman who lives about a mile away from her who who has the line and has set up a\nPoint to point Internet access service with some of his neighbors\nOK okay and she pays fifty dollars a month and\nShe said she's got Netflix she's moved in she has no issues you know things like that her kids are now in college so she doesn't have to worry about you know three kids gaming she has five kids and no she was worried about that right [noise]\nBut but still she is able to get to to fight in and she has to look at you know X rays or whatever it may be just look at them in real time right mhm\nSo but she's able to do that through a point to point service so I'd see if there were any options in in a if you just Google your ZIP Code with point to point\nThat's what it's called or sometimes it's called fixed point wireless and basically all you need you don't need any lines you need a line of sight okay so is there a lot of mount or the ... mountains around you know\nOK okay so so if they're sometimes if you have a lot of mountains the ... it doesn't work\nBut years ago was that I Believe it or not I live in the center of Phoenix and there who are the cable company wouldn't come down the street and I actually had to have a fixed point wireless lined put in on the roof but I could go down to South Mountain from my house which I Know that doesn't mean luck to you but it's like twenty\nMiles by the bird flies okay so uh so I Would look around to see if there's any type of six point wireless I Would also call wins train in your area\nUh to see if they have any options for you as well you know other than that you know you don't waste your money on a booster a cause you you know these game updates could be a gig right there\n... and then I started playing you know you're you're looking at even just a movie could be three gigs and ah so you know and then and then of course you're going to have to tell the kids that you know there was a time not too long ago when you used to walk to school on the railroad tracks\n[laughter] in the snow with no shoots the exactly [laughter] so they're just gonna have to go to the

you remember when everywhere everywhere you turn around that somebody put an AOL disk and the cereal box you went to store it was everywhere that was really genius marketing right there\nBecause how they did that behind the scenes is\nThat and I ... I can talk about it now I'm sure I'm not under any more non disclosure agreement says we'll find out Tuesday [laughter] that with AOL is that if you gave a desk\nSometimes you'd make ten dollars at that person use that is that person used your desk to sign up for AOL you just made ten bucks\nSo we always got them from another place that doesn't exist anymore and that was blockbuster video so you're telling me when we got our Fifteen hundred free hours of AOL's blockbuster was making my yes and then they would make money every single month I mean oh wow yeah it was really crazy for a while\nI mean this is like in the early nineties I was I was banking like ten grand a month\nJust on AOL do is just how are you getting them in people's hands just stand on a corner chopping them up and people\nYou know like I spend the time [laughter] no I was I Would put 'em in like 'cause I have the\nComputer tutor videotapes oh okay I put 'em in the videotapes and then people would use them to sign him one day they just said we're not doing this anymore we're not paying for this any more\n[noise] yeah you know what happened is that so you know so I'm like I started the computers to actually get this whole AOL thing going on okay and then they changed managers at the top right and they actually called me up\nAnd that month I had gotten and it's all numbers I've gotten a check for twenty five grand for the month just by people using the disk you handed that it was the disc and then taken using the computer section okay and I I that I managed and this was my job right okay so all of a sudden\nThis guy calls me up but he says you know how like we've been paying you every month\nWell now we want you to pay us\nThat's a bit different in a different character I said well that's going to really work for me [laughter]\nAnd so that was when using key word commando instead of going to AOL that I knew we negotiate I negotiate that it would go to commander dot com that's when you watch the website with that is also when I learned a very valuable lesson\nIs not to depend upon the company\nFor the marketing of your company so that's why when Facebook came out I was so like I Am not sending anybody to Facebook Saturday getting screwed over by AOL right so why would I Do that which speaking of one last one and can you make the sound of a dial up modem\n[laughter] [laughter] what was that anyway [laughter] yeah one on one hand shakes that go the handshaking no ...
