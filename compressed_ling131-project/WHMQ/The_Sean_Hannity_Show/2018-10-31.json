over the years when the uh the the kids were playing hockey for instance I could I could boil water for spaghetti I could make Mac and cheese you know that kind of thing\nI think I told you before

little milk in it you know just doing\nAnd uh for some reason we had a a gallon of milk in the refrigerator\nThere was all like with ours lettering and stuff that made it look like orange juice or something right\nSo I remembered that okay to make sure I don't make that mistake and instead I take the real orange juice and dumped that in with the macaroni and cheese so that went over real well

do some of the cooking you know take a little bit of the the heat off Amory this was many many years ago I'm sitting at a dentist office okay and I'm just flipping through the pages and there is the

hostile to civil rights in voting rights the gun lobby prevents us from even debating a bill to\nExpand universal background checks for ban bump stocks we need to take the money out of politics and we need to get health care costs down we ought to be strengthening Medicare strengthening\nAnd expanding Social Security figuring it out how to be better stewards of our environment instead in Washington it has become a place where trivial issues get debated passionately unimportant ones not at all and that needs to change and it's just a moment\nI think people are going to look back on and say what did you do\nHow did you stand up in the fight back I Know people out they were concerned about what's happening but nothing is going to change unless you vote\nVote for Democrats in the golfing on November standing and\nI'm Jim McGovern candidate for Congress and I approve this message paid for by the government\nThat we won't see patients if you're a patient who's coming in with a cardiac events the nurses are saying please Michele his chief nursing officer don't tell me that I Will not be able to treat the patient that's coming in that need to my care\nSet the scene for us right now you know what goes on the hospitals right now or the nurses save if there is not sufficient time to spend with each patient and it's a it's affecting patient health they also talked about people come to the emergency rooms and there's not enough for personnel to comfortably move them to the rooms and you to do and that's because when they were that's been painted right now\nOkay so I'm going to give you this is a real life scenario that happened to us\nI'm a gentleman and his wife are taking the granddaughter out to lunch he feels like he's having a little ingestion they dropped a granddaughter off driving home and the wife says you don't look good and he says I don't feel well either drives to her husband to Bay State noble hospital's emergency room is treated put on a monitor immediately and found\nThat he was having an a cardiac event okay if this were January eighth okay and this law is enacted they could come into the emergency room he could register as he would today and they could say I'm really sorry\nWith the nurses on duty today I cannot treat you you're going to have to wait in the waiting room now and and it's a numbers game behind the door I could have\nIf I'm an emergency room nurse I could have someone who needs to have a suture put in\nI could have someone who were waiting for cultures to come back\nWe could have someone who is waiting to have someone come into said I'm a break and yet those patients are just as important and are the numbers that would be delegated to that nurse and the patient waiting out in the waiting room is not going to be seen\nTalking to a registered nurse Michelle urban ... chief nursing officer and sheep administrative officer for basic noble hospital\nAnd we are talking about question one about the stuffing them nurses this is a patient safety act by the way our number down here is falling three five and six seven one for all if you would like to pose a question to Michele urban ... ... what is your husband looking to do how would you react to them\nWell we have put a group together of their leaders from the hospital and we are looking at the gap analysis between the staff that we have now and what we would need and there's two main areas of of um that we're going to be focusing on that's behavior house there is a behavioral health crisis in the state in the country\nAnd the best practice care guidelines for behavioral health patients isn't that a nurse driven a best practice it is a team approach with critical with mental health counselors with social workers and nurses inclusive\nThis act would this proposal would\nPut in nurses in a primary role right now there's a shortage of behavioral health nurses for ... well I don't know if it's an area that's a ... of\nThat may not be of interest right now um I I really can't answer that question right now but the truth of the matter is we would have to cut our inpatient census by half\nAccording to the nurses that we have until we could continue to hire ... the other area that's a major major concern to the emergency department um right now the nurses problem solve evaluate acuity\nI'm patient conditions can change in seconds what could be stable today are right now in a moment later could be unstable and so\nI could then delegate my simple suture to someone else so that I could be one on one with the critical care patient and unfortunately that's not going to be the way that it will be um played out in January were recruiting always ...\nBoth so much in California I think he got through thousands for something very similar or passed in California um the other side say that the recruitment of nurses went up dramatically or when the past ... that sounds like a pretty positive thing would you agree ... well\nI don't I don't know what the exact definition of recruit is from their vantage point but I have to tell you that at any given time at a hospital right now I have\nAbout ten to twelve or small hundred bed hospital\nTen or twelve positions that have been open for quite some time and that we have posted that we're in a nursing shortage it's critical state medical center as a whole\nThere's two hundred and twenty positions that are posted presently ... so there is an enormous nursing shortage and I don't really know where we're going to be able to get nurses to do this no one thought that we've talked about it nurses from neighboring states Connecticut New York\nVermont New Hampshire and Maine Rhode Island will seek license you're potentially in the state of Massachusetts polling nurses from those other neighboring states which will then affect patient care and other states and not just hours\nYou mentioned California California initially had a one to six singers patient ratio which was presented\n'em when they initiated that it took years in order to implement this act and as it turns out in the med surge area\nThey downgraded to a one to five and the state of Massachusetts did to one to four nurse patient ratio the other big difference in California is there is no fine associated ... to think about this on any given day if a patient comes in with a cardiac event in the emerging\nThe other big difference in California it's there's no fine associated ... to think about this on any given day if a patient comes in with a cardiac advantage in the emergency room and we treat that patient okay\nAnd the nurse upstairs on the ... let's say has uh an illness and needs to leave before we can replace or we could be fined fifty thousand dollars that's a lot of money that's an annual salary for health care worker\nAs a nurse yourself yet Michele urban um a lot of people do talk about nursing burnout\nAre no it's it's ... it's pretty good pay is pretty good benefits it's all that it always used to be a very lucrative thing that people would get involved in the people who couldn't wait to get into nursing especially the the kid and I went to high school with\nYou there were a burnout factor here are you yourself who have worked in in in in in different words do you feel about yourself is that the reason why there's a shortage why people are getting into this like they used to\nWell I I Know that there are many people I'm graduating from nursery schools the issue is that we don't have enough instructors to get to the nursing schools so that classes can be larger\nUm I think there's burnout every career I'm now a days I Will tell you that this mandate is not going to help that problem\nWe're talking about the question one that the patient safety act and the nurses staffing though that said November six of the day where people can vote already I guess there's been early voting I voted early last year but I forgot all about it this time\nAnyway we'll have more with a registered nurse Michelle urban chief nursing officer and sheep administrative officer for ... noble hospital sports weather coming up more with
