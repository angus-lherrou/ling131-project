about the being of um equal ability the two of us were very very evenly matched and uh we went the whole three games and ah she beat me best to two out of three\nAnd a really really spirit of games every every game was really really close and if she can be a good about of course she was dressed in uniform to develop and everything else on so\nShe might have been slowed down a little but uh yeah

library took me to school and it was pretty good pretty good time uh Dennis spit ball by the way a Northampton city councilor who showed up and boy he was he he can move man he uh he's got this big wingspan and he can really get after the ball\nAnd he'd be being as a result won the red Sox tickets to the red Sox tickets for next year a pact organs have gotten into real estate that donated those to the group and the knowledge that the the next person who comes in in a can beat me will win the Sox tickets and he came in around noon issue\nAnd uh and it took me on and the and he was re was thirsty for them Red Sox tickets I'll tell ya\nAnd assess for next year and a the schedule doesn't come out until January for next year so we hope that this will be the defending the defending World Series champ Boston Red Sox real but a good pretty much guarantee that it won't be the New York Yankees uh where we mentioned in that\nBut anyway he says are a great one uh Emery once again beat me for the second straight year of the beat me and the thing and it was really good and up and then uh maybe my favorite match with the day was a with Bill Newman our own bill Neuman of the bill Newman

fact his wife was mad at him because uh when he returns he returns it so hard will take your teeth out\nAnd do so I was ... by ... and also the back was killing me at that point and so I didn't think it had anything left but something inspired me he was hitting the ball so hard that I said oh is that right and so we had a great game and he finally beat me the the best out of three only be me by a couple of points but the that I don't know how I I really didn't have anything left at that point and uh\nBut uh yeah so it was a great metro anyway we raise the uh several thousand bucks\nFor

helped by Catholic charities and the welcoming home represents a project or he engage me and he could really get the ball that you'd not never play ping pong before but he really immediately I picked up on the game and he could return the ball like no one else\nAnd so how much is offering this thing are IT guy Alex\nOr where he will put a block down for every time the ball over that so the two of us were made an agreement we just hit the ball back and forth over the net\nAnd uh so you're not up uh thirty seven who hit the ball at them and let me not to meet me [laughter]\nAnyway we got thirty
