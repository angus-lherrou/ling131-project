Eduardo I think is there the younger one rare and he's very tall is that it's all there are some of the bike path not long ago it was like whoa he's either in the NBA or he said walk on the court to talk about these people for ... because I don't think people understand where these people come from what the hardships they have to face before\nThey get into the pipeline to come here it's an awfully long vetting process and\nOh yes it is um about what to say that most people think that the ... I hear what they want to be here it's not that's not the case you know they're here because they have no choice was the you'll go to the you know camp every themselves\nWould they UNH the uh they don't know which country you know is going to take them as a you know the refugee some being separated some would be you know taken to a fairly or some to Canada or something to the United states\nThat the constitution requires representation in the house of representatives and the the electoral college to be determined by a states and the country's total population which includes voters and non voters children and adults long term and short term residents citizens and non citizens a like\nAn accurate enumeration the Constitution's Eighteen century word for a census\nIs a prerequisite but the Trump Administration is disingenuous ... trying to circumvent\nAnd as usual requirement by inserting into the twenty twenty cents is a question about citizenship which serves no legitimate purpose has not been included in the Centers for some sixty years and targets immigrants\nAfter all who would answer a question or fill out a form that could cause law enforcement thing immigration and Customs Enforcement ice to target your parents or your child or even a distant relative or friend living in your home for possible incarceration or deportation\nThe answer is no one would do that which is why Seventeen state attorneys general have sued in federal court to stop the citizenship question from being included in the sense is to stop the Trump Administration from making immigrants invisible and rather to ensure that in America every one is counted\nBecause everyone counts the civil liberties minute is made possible by the ACLU because freedom can't protect itself [noise]\nHey it's Kathy hands Steve from ... America's you store here in North Hampton joined us from any fitness W\nH ... n piece that he made a show about knitting every Saturday morning at nine start if we can offer more money in conversations with the world's cyber artists can get another twenty five hundred episodes are available by cats that blonde dot Yahoo dot com\nSaturdays at nine AM which has kept me in the mountains of labs America's yarn store [noise] [noise] [noise]\nThis is the W. H. B. morning news with Bob clarity and Denise suppose allergies [noise]\nTalking to him neural caseworker\nFor Catholic charities remember our tongues are falling for refugee resettlement in the north Hampton area coming up on October ... volunteers for that to\nTry to get involved in Africa ... raise as much money as we can\nUm the clients that you deal with um the clients that you're talking about here they have harsh treatment from the Trump Administration when they're talking about America the folks that you deal with the folks that you meet at the planet the at the airport or do they get quite Trump with America or do they see the American people or something different than the American government\nYeah the American government and the American a citizen or like two different you know or they come from two different\nWorlds because American people when they go there at the uh they try to help\nWhen they come ... come here they see these group of volunteers\nAt the airport a welcoming them and you know helping them and you know not only here even you know about called all the Americans will go there and you know try to do the you know school either in San Antonio towels to you know the young girls over there\nAt the types of health but uh when they look up the government the see that that like the government do to them and they think they call him down the last few months ago they call them you know as a whole country\nThis really really you know it really impact in buttons people\nBecause they used to look out for America they looked up to America and uh for democracy for America needs to be a good example for we will ... will lead us and we want them to become like a medical lead to democracy and not being corrupt in you know helping you know but right now not so much ...\nThe a tremendous version has just released the the numbers that they're going to be allowed into the country and it just keeps going down and down and down and down a dome so you've got people in the pipeline that are trying to get in not going to be put on hold again\nYeah and this is it really affects people because of its psychologically and that people saw bad because we have how single mothers or that you know we're hoping that there'll be United suing with that has been in that you know that we know that they don't see that happening ... goes out\nTo be honest right now we don't know what will happen tomorrow because things have been changing like every two minutes we hear like a new policy is a new law and every so\nPeople don't know if any of my clients would come to me and asked me a thing that I Would use to give them a ... right now if they asked me I I don't know I don't know and nobody thought them and I think what happens tomorrow and this is really really affecting people\nYou're a personal heritage grandparents were from Somalia yeah people from Somalia aren't even allowed in people from\nAll that allowed in Syria and you know Iraqis Muslims they missed it you know it ... the being like liberals as a not good people you really you know affect us you know I'm a I'm a Muslim I'm Somali if I see this happening\nI'll ask myself why and you know I'm I'm working for Catholic charities All right it's a Christian organization I Am doing God's work helping the money the idol case a client\nIs Muslim if a client is Christian if they have no religion my job is to make sure that they have a ... with a dignity as a human being that they should so that's how our profit you know came from Medina\nWhere the Arabs they kicked him out and then he went to Ethiopia obscene you and the profit was welcomed it was said in the church was protected in a church and so\nA ... a Christian or a Muslim to me that the older brothers to me I you know I don't I don't see differently ... and so when you see that somebody else is trying to divide of\nReally really you know affect it even affects me if I feel like because I Want my president to be lead by example\nAnd but when they see like he's pointing fingers to set in a people from sort of religion color you know gender and all that really really you know because as I'm listening would believe that only God can judge us nobody nobody else can judge can you know and no one can judge you only go inside you\nWhen you see like somebody else's trying you know pointing fingers at just pray for him\nSays for for just pray [laughter] to try to try that try to [laughter] for for Donald [laughter] well it's a great one neighbor who has\nBeen with is a case worker for Catholic charities
