I think it's going to me so I guess ... to be back on the bench again because\nFor some reason the hottest hitter and baseball I just won't bad against left handed pitcher but anyway\nAh what a game last night and as I said earlier I was a little bit outraged that ah they're not to play in broad called in\nAnd do it struck me kind of funny because Alex core is a utility player himself when he is baseball career was as a backup he played two or three different positions and he was a pack of user back for the red Sox\nAnd uh so you are hope that a backup player can make an impact will have backup player the ... cold it was a tremendous impact in the past couple of years especially this season\nOh you would have thought that he would be no light of all of a rock and but now you know that's all managers do it but anyway they switched up along it last night and I kinda like it when they do this uh all the guys who were in the limelight ... third base or\nA Christian Vasquez was the catcher in the course brought quote was that second I'm well they've been in the mix the whole time it's not like they're all of a sudden you know drag out a mothballs they've been in the mix the whole time in the ... I was kind of admire the way the corps has ... the only time I criticize court was yesterday for not playing ... but on\nThe way he has done the ... it's almost like a youth ball team right everybody plays and the reason why you do that is not 'cause you're this great you know Democrats you know you're on the Democratic when it comes to a team\nOr the way you do this because everybody fresh everybody's fresh and everybody's ready to go and all that that's why you play everybody so nobody just sits on the bench and dogs and then you know three weeks later you ask them to go out and pinch hit\nThat never works and it has never worked in baseball history and so I kind of like the way they're doing it it's it's a little bit like a used ball not all you fall is done that way but some coaches who ah have a little bit of you know because of some kind of savvy in them and understand that uh\nYou're you're only as strong as you weakest link they like to play all the players so I'm sitting right that's it it kind of reminds me of that\nAnd since he is a utility player at heart Alice car he would understand that and the plays the ... will make for using these ... player on the team and he will make plays and no one else can make and sometimes he feels in that short stop understands when the the runners what runners fast runner slow knows he has to gun it the first I've seen it make many many many plays here\nAre probably no one else is paying attention because the people to comment on sports on the radio ... so that's all they pay attention to they don't even watch the game have you ever watch some of the the the knuckleheads that are on a Boston radio if you ever see them at the game than ever watch uh single minute of the game they're always\nOn checking stats and they're always on their laptop so so that I don't know that kind of says a lot to me anyway and uh\nI remember earlier that are in ... when they were looking for a second baseman remember during went down and they had to go all and they had to bring up a you know a relic from the past ... second baseman standing right there so I don't know\nUh but anyway so I guess we're feeling pretty good right now about the red Sox in their chances of a going to the ... so but that can change with the weather so who knows um by the way you can find a first person column or\nFrom me I've been doing a few of these lately but anyway this is a service spinach slam it and just show up this Friday for the second annual pong a fond du pont onto a refugee resettlement that we did last year this upon it on to it's going to be ... and there's a picture of me you can see me I'm In action in action\nPlane at seeing from last year ... so you can see one of the state of the art tables you can see me at the table and the first person accounts that uh I Do uh that I did on the on this a column for the house you can go on because that now that you can get the ah\nThe hard copy as they say of ... today and you can see the ...

imprisoned like that within those concrete walls and you know she came there like in the aftermath of a date with one of these guys and there had been a lot of drinking involved\nAh the terror that she must have felt a and I I assume nothing like that it ever happened to her before she ended up dropping out of school nothing out of college because of it\nAnd it's shockingly similar to sort of an amalgam of all the stories about Brett Kavanaugh what happened with Dr Ford or what happened with the accusations of a gang rapes at parties um it's like a combination of all that kind of stuff that he exposed himself to one woman at a party\nAnd it just it brought back a lot of memories of that situation that we're really uncomfortable and and really horrible uh and it's something that that that one isolated incident where I was just peripherally an observer of it many years ago\nAnd it gives me that's something that happens thousands of times a day it seems like all across America even now you know get the UMass case from oh yeah a couple of years ago yeah so and and those are just the ones that we know about you are so many of these things that happened individual women\nWho don't say anything because they're going to get crucified for it you know the idea that the president of the United states and members of Congress would say well if she had said something at the time\nPeople do say anything to nine where they don't say anything because of exactly the response that they get from people like\nTrump yeah and and and in fact most of the ... the young males involved in these sorts of actions are pretty well taken care of oh yeah you know they've got their to pull us with the community and their fathers are going to get them off and and all that so it was the deck is stacked against uses there's no way Thirty years ago that you could have come out and do anything about\nOh yeah and and back in college I remember the worst that ever happened or even when things would there were so many witnesses in so much information about it\nThe worst that ever happened was that you know it reminded me of Animal House or in a fraternity would be put on double secret probation or something like that and there were only allowed to get like ten new members one semester instead of twenty\nSo there were no repercussions now no one was ever kicked out of school and you know this this poor young woman withdrew from school none of the men involved I I ... well\nNone of them graduated because none of them actually stuck around long enough to graduate and pass enough classes to graduate but uh yeah they they never had any disciplinary action at all\nThe uh a thing that really struck me was when after ... gives her ... version of the events and then ... and he's had obviously been coach she'd been coaching number one you've got to really display tremendous anger here new show your outrage at these liars so you've got to come right out and do that\nAnd secondly he starts crying so that was also coach\nAnd he was right out of Trump's playbook the word ... speech and everything that you gave blaming the Clintons blaming the Democrats as all big ... big conspiracy by by the Clintons yeah it was right on the Trump it was written by Trump ... am I the only one of the season so\nYou're not the only one who see that I see it too I I remember when he started I was thinking this could have come directly off of one of those All right ... you have a you know talking about that this was all just a conspiracy to destroy his life because of anger over the election of Trump\nAnd uh what was a well funded left wing organizations and when he said a revenge by the Clintons or revenge on behalf of the Clintons or whatever the words were\nI just thought you know my immediate thought was the original title for this article which was Brent Kavanaugh disqualified him something\nThat's disqualifying for the Supreme Court if you want to have even the slight appearance of being impartial you can't just give it away like that and yet it didn't matter because Republicans were the ones nominating Republicans were the ones voting Republicans were the ones investigating\nA it didn't matter at that point because the Republicans had rubber stamped him to be on the Supreme Court\nWhich honestly I don't understand there are doesn't\nDozens of people who are more qualified than cap and all who will be just as anti abortion justice pro gun\nOr justice anti labor all the things Republican role and there's all ... ... ... and pro Trump pro executive

very combative and all that and you said that\nYou could easily see you could put your the combat ... drunk so yeah the last ... remember you know just an that performance this is a man who's in public on national television and I assume sober he has every motivation in his life to be at his very best and what he showed us was far worse than anything else we seen from him in public before\nAnd people kept saying you know this is a job interview you don't act like this was at a job interview and actually wasn't really a job interview it was an evaluation for promotion because he's already on the federal judiciary which is a scary and I thought\nUm but he was applying to basically be promoted from the federal bench to the Supreme Court ... if you if I went into a promotion uh interview like that or an evaluation was supervisors or a a hiring committee aboard a promotion committee\nAnd I acted like that I couldn't possibly expect to be promoted or in fact I'd expect to be reevaluated for the position I was already in it it was just disqualifying and yet the value waiters who had the votes where the Republicans so the rubber stamp them\nWe'll talk more about this

H. B. morning flaring and [noise]\nSome of the spring and summer rains\nI talked to a farm or the other day during the year we'll watch for food event and boring hurting farmers are hurting out there still correlates with is the executive director of seasons the community involves a sustaining agriculture looks like she's going to come to the rescue here some of these folks\nWell I don't know if the rescue but were there were there every day for the farmers in the valley and we're reopening up ceases emergency farm fund\nAnd we're opening up for the same person that you just began the segment with\nWe've been hearing from farmers and we've been seeing it first hand that the rains that started at the\nEnd of June and just continued and continued and continued and it's been a very challenging growing season or harvest season for farmers and even though most of us don't notice it all the amazing produce is there for us and still is getting that produce to\nAll of us has been very very hard and puts them in a tough situation ...\nExactly and that's really the purpose in a lot of ways for this emergency farm funded sudden no interest loan up to ten thousand dollars and the farmer doesn't have to pay anything back the first year and it's a three year loans so it hopefully can carry a farmer from\nNow until uh the next time they're going to see some cash them in the door to some degree all naval them to put they um fields to bed and to repair some equipment maybe get some infrastructure and start thinking of what supplies they need for next year\nOut to people apply for this all they need to do a we have an application at by local food dot org it's not complicated application it's to the end of October but we really encourage farmers to\nGet it in a little bit early so we can look it over and let them know if there's anything missing from the application you've done this a couple of times now but yeah resurrected this program this started actually way back now we say way back in two thousand nine eleven with Hurricane Irene came through here\nAnd we were really trying to think well how do we respond to a weather event like that and we came up with the idea of Vermont had done something similar we decided to turn to the community in both the local business community and individuals\nAnd we raised two hundred thousand dollars to create this revolving no interest farm loan program\nAnd it's again in an emergency program is regarding natural disasters and we also just see ourselves as a little bit of support addition to what the federal and state governments do but often times we can turn around quicker and often times or a smaller farms that just don't qualify for some of those government loans and write\nThose the deadline those yeah it's October thirty first and again the applications that by local food dot org when the exciting thing well exciting depressing both deciding to be able to be there with community support for farmers and a little bit of a downer because um it was just an unfunded growing season\nFor so many young or I'm just talking to a fellow just be able to do and you're just shaking his head like almost like doesn't know what the future holds\nWell that's true for farmers every year whether you've been farming for two years or for fifty years every years new and different and certainly you know climate change is added to different spiked to this\nThe fact that in one day you would see three and a half inches of rain which would have been the same for the month and the fact that we saw Seventy five percent more rain in July and August and September continue that week so far I Believe have gotten as almost as much rain in nine months as we\nUsually get in twelve incredible like Seventy five percent raise the money that you have a reserve you're the money that you raise in these these fundraising campaigns did you did several years back or if ten Fifteen farmers come forth here and that's going to exhaust the funds that gives a rugged well it's a revolving\nLoan fund so even though we've helped twenty four farms since two thousand eleven those farms have paid back into this ... emergency farm fun so if if we get overwhelmed by the demand the farmers will turn to the community again I don't expect the need will be that great I think we can handle ten to Fifteen farms\nThe emergency revolving fund resurrected by the ... for the third time\nWhile it opened up in two thousand eleven we did it three times since then ... this is the fourth time since two thousand eleven creation\nHe'll Corman has been with is the executive director proceed to the community involved in sustaining agriculture which are which their money where their mouth is you know not just a and where your food is focused to write and once we can go give people the uh the details how to get involved in this and how they were\nSo we asked him every non farmers to talk to farmers who knows if
