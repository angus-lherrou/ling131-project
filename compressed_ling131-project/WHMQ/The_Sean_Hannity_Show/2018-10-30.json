this ordinance at all you know this ordinance is really for people who already in how to drive defensively and feel comfortable doing it and it's not really going to I don't think it's going to get anyone to suddenly radically change their behavior\nIn terms of you like game and by the way from cycling savvy I'm One of the things was was brought up was that motorists cyclists I should say coming in from other towns who are used to this idea of taking the lane\nThen they come to before the ordinance was changed then they come in East Hampton they could be population of the law so a lot of this was was sort of compliance right\nYeah that that's how some of the counsellors saw it as as I said I I really see this as a change in emphasis ... not in the D. notation of the law but it certainly is it changing emphasis that encourages people to interpret it in a in a way that's consistent with with other laws whereas before they they might have been tempted to misinterpret it\nSo if we if we go and he's camping out here in the center of town and you're going to say take a left there by biggie or something you're going to get on the street and you're going to work your way if they're caught history sure do streets would be a perfect example of this yeah the traffic was fairly slow\nVery narrow this'll be the ideal time to take the lane we've seen in for safety and for many other reasons\nAs you go further along now you're off the street you're going to take a ride on to Holyoke street traffic is going to be going faster the length of water that would be a situation where you would move over to the right\nThere is no kind of always do this never do this there's there's really an enormous number of factors you have to take into account so you have to look at OK Holyoke street the lane is yes it's a little wider\nBut it's it's not even close to wide enough for cyclists in a motorist to beat safely going next to each other in LA and right\nAnd you know instead of having about what like\nTen feet of useful Stacy maybe a twelve feet of useful stays in right proper use going faster though yeah traffic is going is going faster that's true it's definitely narrow enough that I Would control the laying quite a bit of the time\nBut also there there's another technique that we teach called control and release ... where you can use you know certain spots are features are gaps in traffic to kind of help motorists pass\nOr so for example I might control the lane when there's oncoming traffic 'cause I I don't want someone to try to squeeze between me an oncoming traffic\nBut then when there's there's a gap in oncoming traffic than I might move to the right and maybe even wave may have someone on to you know to to help and say yeah now is a good time to pass\nOn quiz Inskeep point here should there be signs should they be signs along especially on a place like cottage street or something like that should that be something that would be obvious to me a lot of motorists who've never been these happen before a lot of cyclists who never been in these happen before should be some kind of science there to let people know like what's going on well\nSo they said they'll they'll on East Hampton isn't any different dino tater believe from the law anywhere else right however there there are signs and and markings they're often used to try to get that message across a there's the bikes may useful and signs\nAnd there's a the pavement marking called a a ... or shared lane marking which\nHas the same meaning you see you see them in a lot of places\nSometimes used correctly sometimes use incorrectly my personal opinion is that they can be really useful for starting a conversation but you have to have\nSomething to back it up something when people start to see that sign or that mark and say what's that you have to be ready with a good answer for them otherwise it's a wasted opportunity\nAnd I see a lot of these things put up with
