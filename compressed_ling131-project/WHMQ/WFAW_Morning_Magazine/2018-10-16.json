Nineteen sixty eight with my friend guinea bird so also in the conversation here but I think is remarkable about this book is that and Jeannie alluded to this if you were to say when I talk about to Ivy League schools but\nFall season in one year culminating\nIn this one game at the end of the season\nI probably think man I Love football but I don't necessarily want to read about college football from the Nineteen sixties but how many historic moments and figures appear in this book is truly remarkable\nAnd then the athleticism the football and also you write in such an amazing way that its captivating to read about these games so before we talk about\nThe important figures that appear in this book talk a little bit about why this particular season in college football was important to these ...\nThese days Harvard and Yale their football teams are in division one a but back then Harvard and Yale were a bigger deal and football terms and in Nineteen sixty eight both Harvard and Yale came into their season ending game undefeated Yale was ranked as high sixteenth and the country that you're a head of\nAlabama and Nebraska two of the all time behemoths of college football\nA Harvard was ranked twenty fours going into the game there was talk that if you will be harbored convincingly they would vote in to the top ten of place no Ivy League team had been\nSince the I think the late forties so the game itself was a big deal it actually had national implications for Harvard and Yale alumni it always has huge implications it's a great and exciting event\nAnd the game as it evolved a Yale is favored by a touchdown but most people felt they'd win by far more I Believe six of the of the players on the team went on to be drafted by the NFL and they rolled up to a twenty two to nothing lead\nA they were leading with three and a half minutes left to play they were leading by sixteen points at which point Harvard's a second string quarterback for Harvard led the team to sixteen points in forty two seconds for those of you know who know football\nYou'll know that that's nearly a mathematical impossibility unless you're Tom Brady and much your Tom Brady and even he would have to have an unfolding that one off and they tied the game not twenty nine to twenty nine leading to probably the most famous headline in college sports history\nThe Harvard Crimson the Monday after the game\nThey're headline was Harvard beats Yale twenty nine twenty nine [laughter] because of course for Harvard this seemed like the greatest victory in the history of their long a football history and for Yale it felt like a horrible horrible stunning defeat show the game itself was absolutely thrilling\nFascinating and its resonated throughout the years um so I had fun writing about the game and then of course the game was set in this extraordinary year and many of the players of course we're connected to some of those extraordinary events\nAnd then many of those players and or people that are going to the colleges gone to greater fame and important including the quarterback I this is what I thought was most interesting so many people know that Tommy Lee Jones and Al Gore were roommates Tommy Lee Jones is on this team yes Al Gore appears in this book several times Meryl Streep appears in this book\nAs does the quarterback\nFor Yale but in a fashion that people may not recognize him can you explain a little bit about that well\nYes Brian Dowling was the quarter back his nickname was God the daily news called them God because he was such an extraordinary football player he was also a as handsome as a Hollywood matinee idol and his as sweet as the altar boy who had once been\nTo back up to a a junior that year in Nineteen sixty eight a very skinny junior who'd last ... played football in middle school but turned his hand to ours was fascinated by the football team like so many Yale students were at the time and he was fascinated by Brian Dowling an admired him greatly\nAnd he worked up a cartoon strip and he called it both tales he took it to the to the editor of the daily news and said you know would you be interested in running a cartoon strip called ... here's a few examples and the editor looked at it and said well you sort of shrugged and said well we publish pretty much anything\nAnd that young a junior was a Garry Trudeau and of course\nBoth tales would evolve the following year into a cartoon strip called ... which would go on to win the Pulitzer Prize and be renowned\nAnd B.D as a character that and do very fans beyond adjusted this year of Yale and Harvard has of fame that lives on an Internet itself\nYes B.D B.D is still a character a very important character in Doonesbury fifty years later\nAnd it's amazing to think of that this is the quarterback in this remarkable year in history and it's remarkable year in football for the ivy league Harvard and Yale\nGeorge how cold author of the game has a book event at roadside in
