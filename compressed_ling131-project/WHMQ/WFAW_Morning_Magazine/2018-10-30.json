L. L. A. at Gmail dot com a lot of people have no idea\nWhat I'm saying when I say I suppose I let her both however some of those a lot better at it as a V. as in Victor ... E. L. L. A. so yeah it's this Thursday night\nFrom six to eight it's an open house and you can come any time as a guest if you can't come this Thursday nights are open house you can email me and joined us any time as a guest at one of our meetings\nJust to check it out see if it is for you we're hoping that it is how could not be exactly there there's a real sense of community with our group and and I know gene can attest to that ...\n... [noise] uh yeah I Would encourage anybody who's even curious to show up because I think there's a Woody Allen lines I maybe not like the hardest part is showing up at a party or you're breaking the inertia and just getting there\nI also would like to encourage people who don't have much experience and speaking or don't have a lot of confidence around this to show up we've had speakers in the group who are not native English speakers we've had youngest ... speakers we have an older speakers um\nIt's been really wonderful to have a diverse community because it's interesting for us to hear when another stories and experiences and we all learned from that\nThough I really hope a more people can jump on this that\nAnd I think it's a it's a very scary to show up at something new we don't know anybody and it's also scary to think that you're going to be giving a speech in front of a group of people see combine those two things in it I can understand that has a tendency\nFor someone who thinks that well I don't know if I Want to go to that but really it's obviously there is no obligation to join but you just come and see what it's like and it's really a supportive experience lenses overdose\nLiving Savage do so who is a state rep who well she will be a state rep because she has no opposition in November\nIs going to be joining us and she's going to talk about what it means to be a female voice in politics in two thousand Eighteen and ... and why it's so important that we have female voices in the legislature I Can't wait to hear from\nHer one of the things would you do a ... or or find intriguing is that you normally teach people how to speak up for themselves not necessarily a public speaking role bought another rules as well but also the speak without notes the three of us are in the studio here we've been talking to the last Fifteen minutes for none of us are using any notes\nDo so I think we're very valuable to people and ... would be one of those who can speak for all we all know this is a I got really appeals from exhaustion or the other way will be reached up off of cell phones and not anywhere as near as a ... when\nIt's one of the the skills that we do offer in the speaker sisterhood north Hampton um is four speakers to learn that skill because usually when we do begin speaking journey\nA women will stand up there with their notes in front of them and read it they'll read the speech that they've written and that's perfectly fine and that's what a lot of speakers do they will read speech that they've written but what we want to encourage\nAnd what we see women doing through the process of this journey is that they get to a point where they don't have to do it with notes or their notes are minimal they have bullet points or circles in which they've even put pictures so we we offer those skills\nAnd I'll add that beyond the speaking part there's this idea of breaking out of the box behind the lectern I don't know how many of you sat through stultifying PowerPoint crime or the present or it's just you know is on the screen and you see pictures flashing [noise]\nUm so I feel like this group gives us confidence to use gestures and animate ourselves but you know in an authentic honest way and also if necessary you know bringing some props or tell some stories\nBut the idea is to learn to engage your listener and yeah I think that is best done without a sheet of paper between you and your audience definitely and we talk about things like eye contact\nAnd all those skills are so important and as dean said gestures\nOr so there is a curriculum that takes\nThe speakers sister through the uh for the first year of the club\nAnd a lot of our members are wrapping that you're up and Angela Lucy or who founded speaker sisterhood is going to be joining us\nAn unveiling the second year its curriculum so I Can't wait to hear that to know this is going to be Thursday Thursday night this Thursday night six to eight pm here WHM PAX to speakers sisterhood north Hampton first anniversary open house there's going to be cake\nAnd please a email me are the ... at Denise those out of law at ...\nRoll back to the news or news director at ... thank you for coming in lake Eugene Oregon an essay out for using the word ... which is a little\nBit all she has great great vocabulary such a pleasure\nCruise affected you think it's actually we've got a twenty eight in the morning here on the one at one point far W.

heart and soul of this team a Broncos did not play the first two games at Fenway Park and and some of us who have you know followed him would say jeeze what do you do and how can you take that die on the line up especially in big games 'cause he's such a clutch guy\nSomewhere along the line core figure this out and then went with hope for the entire uh uh three games in a a Dodger Stadium or it seemed like he brings a tremendous amount of energy brought Cole does to this team and it seemed like court recognize that would you agree\nYeah I think he's definitely need the guy that his teammates respect and things that I think he's a uh I think he's definitely a guy that they count on to break them centered energies that he's not as good defensively it's simpler but he certainly has the other thing that the ads\nYeah and he seems to have it you know sort of baseball ... even though he's not a natural second base when he was not a natural shortstop he becomes so the when the when the when
