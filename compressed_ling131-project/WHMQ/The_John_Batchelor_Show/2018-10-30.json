New Jersey from that point on 'til Seventeen eighty three the very end of the revolutionary war a New York city is the British center of military and political operations in uh in North America for the war it is the place during which the red coat armies and navies\nA venture forth against the continental army and the south and the north and everywhere else and I'm\nA it is a place that is populated with loyalist or Tories um there are certainly patriots in the town who were\nCovertly or in some cases spying for Washington in sending dispatches messages invisible ink uh uh to Washington wherever it's headquarters maybe by courier a but it is a Tory town and um and that's another aspect of the city's history which which we easily forget\nSteve who burned it September first Seventeen Seventy six and a the British a right to claim they caught arsonist and execute them but is there any definite understanding of who burned the town\nIt's still remains a conundrum something a historian still argue about or debate about um the the my my take on it is that a fire begins accident accidentally this is just shortly after our um Washington's troops\nAre kicked out of Brooklyn cross the Manhattan in our on our basically in upper Manhattan what we now call Harlem camped out the British have retaken the city of New York which at that point is really lower Manhattan\nFire starts probably accidentally in a waterfront building spreads quickly from roof the roof and these in these ... are you know uh these wooden buildings [noise]\nUm but the red coats also the ... the British troops in the street start executing summarily executing people who they catch a where they claimed to be reading handed Savage tours people who seem to be carrying a a a a arson materials [noise]\nUm and so the the probably the safest bet here is that the fire started accidentally but then a patriot\nA agents and Savage tours in the town more or less spontaneously decided to help it along to burn to the ground what had now become again the British a center of operations\nWashington thanks to the French marches from the north of the city all the way to Virginia and that becomes the surrender of Cornwall less than\nThe uh the penultimate event there were events after eighty one about the treaty was signed peace breaks out\nNew York is now a prosperous training center but Steve talked talked into New York I wore a wonderful episode in the early part of the nineteenth century this has to do with what we all recall now is Eighteen twelve\nIt is true however in the period between nine the nineties and the outbreak of war once again with the ... a with a Britain\nThat it was not clear whether the American support in France and the French Revolution and the new men throw off the king or whether they remained loyal to the crowd you have an episode of the embassy Scott the British the French break it off the coast Sandy Hook with the Boston a British ragged and who is New York rooting for the British Raj\n[noise] ah well that's a good question um most of the times is Seventeen Ninety three this is ... ... shortly after\nUh the French Republic that revolutionary French government the government goes to war with a with England really beginning the whole period that goes on until Eighteen Fifteen with the French Revolutionary War isn't it up and then the Napoleonic Wars [noise]\nUm and a New Yorkers are are divided at the time and Seventy Ninety three there appears to be a popular or perhaps plurality are majority in favor of the French the after all the French Revolution\nA appears to be at that point really emulating the the the commitment of the American revolution to liberty and equality and freedom\nAnd New Yorkers actually go out this is a this is a a a sort of a dual a maritime dual between these two warships just a few miles off a Sandy Hook or right off the harbor [noise]\nUm and a New Yorkers actually go out and little boats in and watch this thundering cannon aid between these two vessels\nUm and actually take some of them are betting on what the outcome will be ultimately the MBA Scott the French ...

September ... was striking about it is that Bob describes\nHow American sailors are on board our destroyers right off the smart it's a large ... a port\nA city of Greek port city on the western coast of turkey along the Aegean Sea and the sailors are on board with their movie cameras taking pictures well some of those movies are on YouTube you can see the burning of murder\nThere's a battle the Greeks lose the hell in his degree clues and they were treated into smarter why is the navy there why do they why did they why are they offshore watching this massacre Bob\nUh well first of all are are they are there because Americans are there there are American the colleges they're they're saying American YMCA there's a wide WC a there are there's a a console ship a council the song constantly that I guess you'd call it in a in smarter so they're there to help protect the Americans who were there\nAnd eventually they get drawn into it also um the band ... has sent down his um his the people who do a relief from I'm\nFrom Constantinople to help out any refugees who need help and so they end up doing a great deal to supply food to the refugees throughout this sort of the crisis\nAnd a smart I think I have the dates right this is September as a twenty two is that right and I started writing plenty to\nTheir offshore and the town is filling up with refugees to come from the crunch inside these are Greek passing Greek people uh agricultural base and they flood into this large town stone built along the shore and on the thirteenth a fire starts during the day\nAnd they the people who are in the town are driven to the coast while the city's burn raging around them\nWhat do we know about who set the fire without an accident of looting or was that purposeful\nMarjory dumped can a devoted her whole book\nTo the question as to who who uh started the\nFire up and I think a a ... from what I've uh seen among the American sailors accounts and other American accounts it seems pretty clear\nThat the Turks set the fire there were no I'm the Armenians a or a Greeks uh who were um ah you know not scared out of their wits and hiding if they hadn't been killed or work\nSomehow otherwise I'm a fled the area that we're able to uh to set the fire besides American saw some of it taking place by happenstance\nUh that were able to uh to shut the fire besides American saw some of it taking place by happenstance that the wind up from the Turkish quarter towards the um uh the European quarters and Armenia quarters and therefore the burn the whole city but herbal ... evening\nBob has picture of a boat being overturned because so many people are crowding honest to get away from the flames and the Greek massacres they're cutting ... such as wild this crowd is on the dark side who is a said Jennings what does he do\nAre you suggesting he says they are a YMCA worker a boy's worker boys club worker in a and he's he's working in a sport where he has been for some time but fairly after a while there are a couple of hundred thousand\nRefugees on the keys along appear there in a beautiful pier and smarter a and um the uh the Turks I don't do it as much towards that or the ... the um the Greeks\nAnd especially not towards the Greek women and children as they do to the Armenians so there are many people left here are left alone but the Greeks or oh the Turks and or anybody else in the harbors doing anything else to help them and so up\nA Jennings or all of a sudden the gets I'm a ... is is a tormented by that and goes to try to get some help\nAnd he sees a battleship has sale anything since an American battleship it's the old Mississippi she gets\nTo um it gets the ship out to fourth and uh with about three thousand refugees to a ...\nA ... a a a capital of an island nearby and he sees their um all twenty Greek Ship transport Caesar's ships it carried the big army awake way apparently they're back to Greece but are just sitting here on this island and he he's ... and and the and the people all crushing when they see these ships because they need\nRescue and hear the ships that could do it\nAnd he sees an American battleship in the harbor a it turns out it was called the joke is so was an American battleship it have been sold to the Greeks\nGuy and he goes to talk to the captain and the captain simply facilities radio facilities to talk of the great government [noise] and uh and I'm Out\nAny mountain rescue effort so that the Turks allow the Greeks to evacuate all ...\nHe announced a rescue effort he is given command by the up is given command by the Greek government of all the all the ships in the GNC and he's become a comet or even though as he said the only thing you knew about ships up to this point but it's hard to get sick on them\nNow that the Turks were not generous they singled they separated men from their families and they just allow women and children to evacuate\nThat's correct the um when they took these ships and that was\nCharacteristic for for that period and then on later or that they are kept any one of the military age anyone really between Fifteen and fifty\nAny males are they kept them there and in fact most of those people are staying there most of those people died eventually the males are there um but the um the uh Japanese was able to rescue with\nThe help of the American ships because the American destroyers or were required to buy the Turks to enter the harbor is courting the Greek shifts the Greek ships couldn't fly their flags and the Americans help a board\nThe refugee is on the ship send that maybe there were two hundred thousand people actually around two hundred thousand people evacuated in the last seven days of this and a half a September\nThirtieth that was
