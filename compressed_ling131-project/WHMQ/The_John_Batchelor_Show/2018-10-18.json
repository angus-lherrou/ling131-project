Nineteen fourteen as they invade Serbia is we see that these troops even\nThough they are technically the long service professionals or anything but and that's because the Australian Gehring army was so\n... that it it it didn't keep the troops very long with the colors and then when they and they and they would furlough the troops frequently and or in other words instead of keeping them two or three years of constant service they would just send them off for six months back to their villages because they couldn't afford to pay them\nSo these guys were very lightly trained they had very

regarded as being a different kind of place than Galicia the rules were supposed to be more strictly enforced English there were no rules in Serbia because there was a great hatred between the kingdom of Serbia and the Austrian\nEmpire the Serbs called the you\nKnow the ... you know birds with borrowed feathers because they felt that they were camped out on Croatian territory Serbian Hungarian polish Ukrainian territory but what were the ... the the Serbs called them ... because they came from southern Germany\nAnd they thought it just a in a way that this south German dynasty that found it in the thirteenth century it was still governing Serbs and Croats in polls and Ukrainians and checks they thought it completely\nObsolete and the hamsters reviled the service for treating them that
