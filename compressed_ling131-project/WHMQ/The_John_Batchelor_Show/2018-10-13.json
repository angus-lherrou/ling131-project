ground combat but also I learned from the new book indoor encourage\nWell the age of speed by John Ross ... define how automobiles came just to win the hearts of America racing automobiles first and then the family automobile\nJohn a very good evening to you and congratulations for your extremely careful work over a long a period of time in which everything was inventing itself the automobiles inventing itself the airplane was inventing itself air combat was inventing itself and America fell in love with going fast\nLet's begin in Nineteen fourteen in Des Moines at the Iowa State fair August September Nineteen fourteen men by the name ... this one is twenty four years old\nI'm matches up against a man named beaches and they're going to have an unusual race what is\nWell John thanks for having me on it's such an exciting period and you kept up with that example Lincoln beach it was a daredevil flyer who was up by plane and this was a pushover airplane so he was out like he was playing it beyond the piano right out in front and the propeller was behind him\nAnd Eddie reckon backer who was a famous race car driver just at the moment there\nWas asked to compete in a race around a circuit in front of a huge crowd\nOr this and so that the crowd could see what an airplane could do and bought a car could do and it was like a bear against a lie and I was like a circus these things where it this technology these technologies were so new and so explosive was taking people's breath so way\nThis is August September Nineteen fourteen exactly the time the world plunged into catastrophe we're still living with which was the guns of August\nThat is where we're headed with the written bunker but we need we need to recover his racing car period because that's the first time he invented himself in Nineteen fifty a beach he dies in another stumped with his aircraft he drowned them to leave after racing in San Francisco but\nIn Nineteen Fifteen Eddie reckon bunkers one of the most famous racing car drivers in America is racing for a firm run by the Maxwell is and he's battling his old firm run by the ... shows and they're the juice and birds as well but he's not working for the men and he's racing men who\nAre extremely famous in America all the voice in America knew their names Dario ...\nAnd uh another man by the name of eight and a happy John aid can\nWell you know white than the you know he was they were nobody knew that the car everybody had an idea that the car was the future but they didn't know it was going to be electric if it was going to be gasoline um if it was going to be a electric you know a steam so\nWhat they did is they had to work things and listen to it listen how the engine plane they had they were inventing as they went along oh that reminds\nMe Eddie is ... and ... and whisper yes that takes that skill into the sky what ... what was hearing he could\nTell he learned that if a at an engine running to rich there was too much fuel you could tell that if it was running to lean he could tell that he could tell the sounds\nWhen something was wrong and by that he he had a relationship with machines where he would know how to push it harder\nBack off what was wrong with it and to tweak it you can't just remembered that that the engine the internal combustion engine was built but then the next generation of people came along\nTo tweak it and to play with it and to finesse these things to learn what it was all about and he was a prominent you know not an inventor as much as a weaker\nAnd he could drive the machine and these days they were committed to racing because it was a novelty he meets a man named relief fryer and she's going to be kept by Lee fire to become what is known as a mechanism ... what does that mean well it's a crazy\nThing uh in back in the early car racing days in the early early Indianapolis five hundred Z there was not just a race car driver by next to him sat him that condition and the machinations job was a couple of things one was to pump\nThe oil ... because they didn't have a mechanized oil up to keep the oil pressure up speed but the big thing was to look behind and because they hadn't figure it out\nYou're a view mirror that the ... that the driver could look back so the mechanism would look back and see if a car was coming up and then tap the needs of the driver to tell him to get out of the way or to speed up or whatever was was needed now this was in a day of course with no\nSeatbelts no windshields no hard helmets\nSo the map condition who actually often got the worst of it was only just holding onto a little strap on the side of his\nUh his chair so when they hit if they hit a fence or they hit a pocket of something often the both of them would go airborne were more likely the ... airborne because he didn't have the wheel in front of him\nLeave prior got up to sixty miles per hour and that was considered fast he runs in the first twenty four hour race it's important to mention that they were in sending the whole idea of racing going around the track and then it about this time the Indy five hundred gets put together by a man named Carl Fisher who will become important to us we'll get to him at a moment\nBut money is the motive here any needs money he's very close to his mother\nHis mother depends on him winning money and there is a thing called the Vanderbilt come for ten thousand dollars which even sounds like a lot of money today I have the Nineteen oh six Vanderbilt Cup and that becomes a magic\n... a golden ring that they want to capture what what are you didn't mean to them I understand the cash but what else when\nYou got to remember too that Eddie grow up in a place so poor and his experience was watching\nMen going to factories day in and day out and anonymity that he just didn't want and racing which is extremely dangerous and the Vanderbilt Cup on a road was a road race so wasn't within the confines of everything of a of a ...\nYou know the Indy five hundred for instance would give him an opportunity if he won if he made some money if he got a ranking no one could ever take that away from him one\nAs amendment Barney Oldfield it's gone now but it means everything to do it what is what who is Barney\nBarney Oldfield is one of the original Beth I Love terror alerts shot that you had a best picture of him is he has a big cigar and in the middle of the race he would be true in he would chew that and it would often go out but actually what he used it for\nWhat so did his teeth wouldn't because the rocking the shocks were terrible the road surfaces were terrible it would shake you up so badly it would not people's teeth out so he kept a cigar clamped but he had this big burly\nGo at it a hundred miles an hour speed he was the first to go a mile a a a sixty miles an hour and a he just had he just exude at this new broad ...
