fighting\nRight they've gone across the Blackwater they land them they're cheered viva er into ease their in Hindus and we know as readers that and\nYou include the fact that the eight hundred

the beliefs that they would get their freedom or that in earnest younger\nNo no no it's in an hour and I mean hey you know he writes about that I mean they said when they [noise] you know they ... they were promised land on Monday and also you know that they would be best to [noise]\nGo conditions for Indians after the war and obviously it was it was the disappointment and the fact that that\nYou know the the empire didn't deliver on that that led [noise] you know to the whole you know Indian independence movement in after the you know first in between the two wars\nYou've included a Ernst Young girls rushed puts which is a piece of his war diary Nineteen fourteen to Nineteen Eighteen I'm immediately afterwards and you have to discover the irony here is appalling to discover that corpses in decomposition make noise that the soldiers could hear\n\nWell I mean those are those are the kind of those are the Indian cope says that you know we you know previously so kind of happy and being fated in my say um [noise] you know this is obviously you know ... what happens when they were on the battlefield\nBut you've committed it together in such a way that uh the first piece has an ... they did this wasn't published like that you found a from a German point of view what comes of the Hindu the seaport troops he talks about\nAnd again even from the German point of view there is the futility of the battle as if we're not getting anywhere as if nothing's happening and their only concern with the is whether they get through that night and they don't really have any expectation of ever returning once they go out on patrol\nWell you don't go I mean the younger is is amazing because you know he he was you know he was an army man and\nHe was very much informed with you know middle of tree values um but at the same time\nYou know he was critical so you know that's you know I think it's particularly interesting you know about his writing\nAnd you know it's it's unfortunate that this the diaries I'm you know from which they extract comes you know have obviously being published in in German and in German but then not\nTranslated I mean a lot of the material in the book [noise] um is has not been translated it's previously on translates hit it's not available in English\nUm let's go to a choice that you were flagged for me live view rubber no ah this is another front entirely or the author a Hungarian war what attracted you on this piece when you chose it well\nI mean it's just that you I mean you see the whole\nYou know [noise] collapse of the stroke Hungarian and uh and I are and and this is a very uh ... it's a it's an autobiographical novel\nUm rubbery on news brought the um this is this happened to him he refused to fight a fellow Romanians\n'em and [noise] you know was court martialed so\nIt's you know you actually see how within the astro Hungarian empire um you know people have to fight kissing can Romanian offices are sent as in as in this extract to their remaining in front to fight and obviously it presents [noise]\nYou know a tremendous overwhelming moral dilemmas for them\nThe ... empire was a Milan of many different ethnicities there was no rationale to it and the emperor and his court in Vienna understood that and believe that the battle would feel them together when in fact it turned everything and do do that it's been broken up many times since we're still seeing\nThe crack up in Eastern Europe these are the early moments of it reminds\nMe of another story and we'll go to this is Arnold by snow from the case of sergeant Grisham I only have a piece of this ah this was one of the burn books I Believe\nUh that Hitler turned on\nBut it's an incredible story again it's an otherworldly story they got the wrong man and they're going to shoot him how does it go\nWell I mean he's ... convinced that this guy is is a Russian\nRussian spy which you know in fact he is and um [noise] and ah he you know it's the sort of the book is the ... you know his struggle to convince them that he is and who they think is um but\nThere are upstream Lee sympathetic to the German guard and the whole thing has written as if what can we do your death is being for or drained we can't stop it if the\nIf you get the sense that even away from the front line they're caught up in a a legal wisdom that we've lost that it's been a race that was that was stamped out and we can only guess that it from their points of view\nBut I think that's one of the the greatness as of the book is that the Germans or a no portrayed\nYou know as as evil they're portrayed or just people you know who the core top you know in in a kind of bureaucratic nightmare that they you know they would like to get out of the but they do\nYou know a cool job you know in in a kind of bureaucratic nightmare that they [noise] you know they would like to get out of ... but they don't you know they don't know the way out\nWill turn to the women observing the ... the the female voices some of the great unfair Britain and Willa Cather when we come back because this is not behind ... line that far we're going to the nursing and the wounded and the caring for the dying the book is no man's land from John ... [noise]\n\n\n[noise]\n\nThe response to Wilson is a my notes says on the twenty first of October the cabinet replies to Wilson\nThe Kaiser at this point you picture him chattering I expect him he's added chateau or he's at the hotel Britain ... spa and sometimes they go back to Berlin to confer with the government\nBut the the Kaiser is no is no strength whatsoever they they send their note and they're looking to stall they're stalling because they're concerned that the Kaiser is going to be forced to abdicate it sits there as if this moment they're struggling with the idea that the Kaiser has to go\nYeah absolutely I mean the Kaiser has made it very clear that he does not think that is necessary and that if he goes he's going to be complete chaos in Germany and he of course thinks that the army's loyal to him Naomi would not accept him going\nBut the cool so that granted it becomes clear that the American oh not going to deal with a gym in general they're gonna have to deal with a they want to deal with an a with a gym and government that is represented in democratic and of course that puts more and more pressure\nOn the establishment in Gemini on the ties to make some kind of confessional some kind of knew then that will allow piece to be full because there's a growing feeling that the Kaiser is prolonging the war to maintain his own position\nAnd of course with the growing upsurge of revolution of bullshit isn't of socialism\nIn Germany are particularly in the in the new than a poll sweater fleets is heavily contaminated with communism and of course in bill in a huge and it was a trade union so that the whole situation begin to become a I think one correspondent describes it as feverish lighter moments before a great still\nThere's a moment here that's very important it's twenty four October it's when looting Darth snack and becomes angry and in ... it's in response to a a note from Robert Lansing the American secretary of state\nWho uses the term that apparently set this off the piece of justice that's in quotes what does that mean and how do the Germans read it\n[noise] um that the the Germans would say that send a piece of justice effective they are compromised peace where they could keep the gains maybe in the east and pops give up the gains in the west but keep their empire in the East I'm of course they would regard\nUm I mean the the term piece of justice has bandleader out by the law um but of course justice on the the\nThe kind of Jim and regime in Nineteen Nineteen is very much meaning ... so it's it's a term that should be ah I think scene with a lot of 'em are sort of critical lie really\nThe Americans are not going to go along with the Americans are making detailed demands you have to stop submarine warfare\nYou have to stop wanting destruction you must uh of surrender and I think will come to ... demands rolling stock and the bridges over the rise of the Americans are in no position to negotiate I don't know that the Germans accept that but they snapping of looting Darth\nIt's striking to me if this was an opera yeah this is where the music comes up and looting door ... self on stage at a desk writing\nAnd all around them as gunfire\nAnd there's nothing but darkness in the theater you wrote that the next that's how I see it\nHe's writing a note you emphasize that can be I'm On the twenty fourth hand Hynden Berg of just taking the train back to spot what does he riding\nWell basically after they received this note I'm Lynn ... basically say they can't accept it and um they won't accept it\nWell basically after\nThey received this note I'm ... basically say they can't accept it and um they won't accept it any soldier with all the ... possibly accept this terrible slicing the terrible insult to Germany at the gym a nation so they're not going to accept\nIt and this is effective for them is\nIn some ways a full of mutiny against Germany civilian rule is um that basically sat and they don't want to they want to play anymore um and again it's an indication of have fall lewd and often end Hynden but I have to go to realize what's going on that they\nYou know they tried to get an armistice would suit or interest in that would allow them to break off contact with allies that it's failed and now of course they're they're realizing that I room to maneuver is um is decreasing by the day and I think at this point when they\nThe generals basically saying no way that they suddenly print smacks on the civilian leaders that have no choice but to tell the ... you know these people have to go if we're going to get peace the\nGeneral has to go\nBack to them all around the twenty fifth the first time the allied commanders ... put-on\nUh hey Pershing and their deputies come together again this

hesitant a ferocious irritable however at because of hey have certain pessimistic why [noise]\nWell yeah no this is a very interesting little development because for most of this period and you know most of the war have has been very aggressive very bullish\nBeen making pronouncements some months on end that the German army has this time and they're going to do this time they're going to collapse that then nearer to defeat it got no matter how they're gonna collapse and there's a point where the gym and on the is collapsing\nHave suddenly seems to loses Mitt than actually begins to\nThing actually maybe the war's going to go on maybe we shouldn't press them too harsh demands maybe should just get what we can um I I I don't think we should be too critical Hague\nClearly this is a very fluid situation yeah I you know the Germans have been close to defeat the fall but they haven't quite got the um\n[noise] but it's an indication I think of the strain on all of these men are the strain is absolutely crushing the pressure is unbelievable on these meant to keep going and keep their armies going um despite the huge slow so they can see every day\nThe Americans are about to
