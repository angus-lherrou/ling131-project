good evening to you have an example in your neighborhood in Washington of whole foods which you report has been shut down for Eighteen months because of a tenant landlord dispute quite independent of the fact\nThat Amazon now owns whole foods and his retooling it\nFor America what does this whole foods in your neighborhood show you about small business and how it deals with large a large successful change good evening to\nWatch out what it shows me is that the conventional wisdom about the impact of large big box chains on the little guy or the proverbial corner store is exactly backwards because if in fact big\nBusinesses were pushing out the small from retail areas what we would have seen over the past Eighteen months is very basic with the whole foods the biggest seller the biggest most dominant store and global park in Washington DC shut down for Eighteen months\nLogic dictates that the other business there would have been thriving during that time since the store that captured so much of the consumer dollars that's been out of business during that time but in fact the exact opposite of that is taking place [noise] whole foods was the lawyer\nThat exposed a lot of these mom and pop small businesses to consumers with whole foods and not in operation\nThey are suffering much reduced business simply because people no longer come to Glover Park in the first place to buy their groceries not come in there for that they're not patronizing all the other small businesses that don't have a national presents\nThis makes a deal of sense when I applied to you

recently in the end of work however before that he's the author of who need the fed well apparently the fed and he says this is the largest employer of anonymous in the United states John we'd go immediately to the federal\nReserve and what makes it sleepless why people wander around worrying and mumbling to themselves and this large collection of economists\nI picture of vast room kind of Nineteen eighty four vision of everybody at their desk worrying about what's going wrong when the economy's doing very well thank you very much and apparently they worry about inflation why John\n[noise] they worry about inflation because we're inside the fed the belief is that a growing economy\nIs the cause of inflation they say that it leads to higher prices of everything which is one hundred percent backwards basically a growing economy is driven by investment what us investment it's just it's it's just more\nCapital flowing to perjure up production such that we're able to produce more and more with less and less and so in in the real world inflation is is going to be most prevalent\nAh when the economy is growing the leaf simply because there is the least amount of investment one of the economy is booming that's a sign of mass investment which is a sign that the prices of everything are dropping\nVenezuela you use that example in your article what is then it was well or show the fed that it could learn a Venezuela's economy I mention quickly Venezuela's economy is in the hands of a dictator and a regime that imports brutal brutality from Cuba and from Russia\nAnd at the same time that people are either fleeing or working in the black market because the currency is completely collapsed so much so that they are ... that they're projecting something called the\nPetro some fantastic crypto currency because they no longer can handle their deaths in the world please continue talking\n[laughter] Venezuela is to our eyes that's the other thing precisely because their currency no longer works it's increasingly dollar eyes to major paradox but Venezuela is evidence of what true inflation is the boulevard there has collapsed and value and that and it's collapsed so much that that that\nRestaurant owners are constantly having to change prices reflect\nThis truth but think about that\nIf you're constantly changing the price because you don't know what you're going to get that means\nA lack of investment who would invest in a country where you don't know what kinds of returns you're going to get in so Venezuela's evidence of what inflation is which one you botched the currency and in doing so you drive away the very investors that that that power economic growth\nThe fed is worried about economic growth ... cause and rising prices but we see in Venezuela and other countries the wreck their currencies\nThey're actually experiencing rising prices but the big that that the truth source of inflation\nIs one you destroy the currency that's the traditional definition of inflation the fed is somehow changed it in the last ten Fifteen Twenty years and it's something that have plainly isn't and never was\nAnd the puzzle about inflation is that they are going to worry about they're going to continue to worry about it and they also worry when there is an inflation they weren't both directions these economists wandering around brooding and worrying to themselves this is built in to the Federal Reserve right John there's no way to get it out of there they\nThey warship the idea that inflation is bad and therefore we have to stop it but when they try to stop it what tools to they have aren't they aren't they aren't they without without success\n[noise] how would that the fed for one doesn't have any control over the valley of the dollar there's this myth the fed targets the dollar in fact it doesn't and it never has the dollar is a treasury function\nAnd the fed can only view inflation through this new way of focusing on economic growth and trying to control it through the interest rate and so we're seeing right now with the ...\nSet economists and the rooms obsession with the our storage this notion of reaching in interest rate that such that that that money is neither too tight to slow that the creditors neither too too easy north ... nor too difficult\n... and ... our our star then translates as Goldilocks right it's the Goldilocks\nGoing locks which absurd and economies just collection of individuals we take it back to inequality grow it unequal people grow much faster than three and four percent but the fed text of the economy needs to be managed like this\nBut there's no way the fed could achieve this the interest rate is a price sat around the world based on infinite decisions\nTaking place every millisecond of every day so the notion that a bunch of economists at the fed working with limited information could come up with the our star with the proper interest rate that that basically balances the needs of savers and those who want to borrow from savers is too ridiculous\nTo even to even contemplate or discuss but that's what's being discussed inside the Federal Reserve today and it's a reminder\nThe feds power is vastly overstated if a group of a condom is so diluted\nCan actually control credit the U.S economy would Be Sober assessed as to not even be worth talking about it would be yesterday's news yet a boom booms precisely because the fed is just not that important\nYou are star are hyphen star\nThis is um the the remark of fed vice chairman Kevin wars\nTalking about the our star quote idea most invoking central banks circles does that mean our star is in Europe as well ... and the central bank of Europe are doing this and the central bank of Japan there are all central bankers who do are searching for Goldilocks\nOh absolutely and and what if they always done it the fed the central banks are just another bureaucracy in search of a purpose and so they've got one we're going to try to create equilibrium\nOn on interest rates but back to reality interest rates are set in the marketplace the fed nor any central bank can alter reality and so while the central bankers are talking about how they're going to achieve goldie locks\nThe simple truth is there's going to be a lot of credit during economic booms because there's going to be a lot of resources during slower periods there'll be less credit as those who have access to it limits the ability of businesses to misuse it\nEconomies are self regulating mechanisms the idea that central banks actually regulate regulate them defies basic common sense\nCentral planning died in the twenty century with good reason this notion that central banks or the last vestige and actually control the the economies of the world is just not serious and I contend that and the next few years it's going to be accepted wisdom that central banks are just not that important that we forever overstayed their
