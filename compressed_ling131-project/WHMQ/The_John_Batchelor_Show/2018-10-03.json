tradition they're also using many a prophetic ideas that are circulating some from the middle ages which uh ... how I'm a great and bra agreed saw\nA is destined to liberate the middle east to destroy a turkey I I Am so the Russia they support is a it is a mass panic a nation\nIdeas like that and not just found among you know a few excellent uh peasants that's what\nA mainstream intellectuals I think in Russia which at this time is going through what one of the great religious revivals of the twentieth century seems hard to imagine that in a in like what we know is going to happen with the revolution but the Russia that goes to war in Nineteen fourteen years aren't religious Christian\nNation it's concepts perhaps as a you know any nation that has existed since the middle ages\nWas striking about Philips a presentation is that we've named these Christian nations Britain\nFrance Germany and Russia but they pull in the colonies who are Christian or are Christian icing the the colonies in Africa also they pull in not college said that the Ottoman Empire eventually coming in on the German side\nAnd that is the end of the ... that's the end of the police or as the Ottoman Empire is fractured in divvied up afterwards\nSo the language of crusade\nHas paradoxes that's the way I can express and fill up certainly the current state of uh the crusade\nOf of the Christian churches would have been a sharp odds with the crusade of the Ottoman or the way the Ottoman regarded crusading did the Ottoman have conflict with Germans when they came in on the side of the central power because the Germans were using crusader language I\nKnow partly because the uh the ticks themselves are also desperate at this point to avoid being a petition to avoid having the nation are destroyed they'd like to have the ... the Germans\nAre there to protect and the system but the British must be very very careful not to say that a load because at this point the British Empire is the world's largest Muslim empire a it controls the world's largest Muslim population the British don't want those people going into revolt\nSo they have to work very hard to stop this natural urge people to say you know we we are taking Jerusalem this is a this is the final crusade a says that crusade to language is very dangerous the the Germans managed to keep it under wraps ah the the British really drunk\nAnd they they fight going on in that campaign until the end and the crusade ends in Nineteen Eighteen with what I regard is one of the great ironies with the war the British when the great victory in the middle east against the Turks act where else Armageddon\nYeah oh yeah oh for McCain does decide to vomit get ...\nAh yes will touch on Alan ... will get Valentine's entry into Jerusalem just one more detail Austria lapsed plug empire we call it also Hungary but it was in fact a blending of tribes in groups all jammed together it didn't much work it had been\nFalling apart on different shows up for about several decades now but in your book I learned that the Russians managed to come up with the way of denouncing\nThe ... there's a ... there's a drawing of a Russian poster showing what looks to be the devil with Kevin had power the Russians denouncing after all the parts for Catholics Dr Roman Catholics\nRight um so right away if you're from unorthodox point of view than uh the uh the the ... the yeah the Catholics are a a a deadly western enemy\nAnd when I came across a picture of the person who are trying to do not know what it was it just seemed to be a picture of a ... with multiple heads but when you read it you look at it you see that it's um amongst with seven hats and the way they've created Germany and Austria\nIs um they've taken the individual in the states like a king ... me and made each your head\nI'm the one to get to the magic number seven on the uh the reason for that it's very simple because they've read that book of revelation they know that one of the signs the apocalypse one of the signs all the times would be the rise of this great seven headed cracking\nOn the Russians are saying well here it is it's in the central part of it in Germany and Austria and no matter what\nOf violence we have to do to geography we're going to turn Germany and Austria into a seven headed a beast for these images all the\nAh ah the devil the beast or on a pervasive through the ...\nAnd there's a conflict that is ... is every chapter of Phillips' book this is ... is this is a fight between Christian nation yes the caliphate is at the edge but it's chiefly\nProtestant versus Catholic versus Catholic versus orthodox and they struggle ... what I learned from you everyone was confused by how it is they can define the other guy as the anti Christ\nRight right so the only way Christians confide Christians in that way is if they can present the enemy as being less than Christian or anti Christian so one country have to look at another one I think well they may appear to be Christian but\nIn fact they are so even though they're so bad that prove how hypocritical they are and that that even contributes to a making them even more a more diabolical so if you consider another Christian denomination that's good if you can say\nThat they're doing something very bad by along with non Christians and not that that's very powerful but the school is the enemy may seem to be\nChristian that in fact they're not just anti Christian with a small they they are anti Christ let's\nTurn on your turn to how they proved the Germans were wrong right away from Catholic France's point of view of the great in holy war fill the tank and this is the author I'm John bachelor [noise]\nOld tired of the whole problem with trying to police this this drug trafficking which is that they make a lot of money in this business and what do they use that money for they buy weapons they recruit soldiers\nAnd they corrupt and bribe a law enforcement and institutions inside the country Colombia courts are very much corrupted by drug money\nAnd this is just an example I mean the the special piece court was supposed to be you know uh the one where would interview them and find out what their crimes were and write them all down and this was going to be a way to sort of have a cleansing a spiritual cleansing of the country because everything would be out in the open and the criminals would have confessed\nBut it turns out that there's already corruption inside the Peace Corps they're officials inside the peace court that have been cooking up a false ... Martinez described it and and fraudulent testimony in order to help\nFor you know these FARC members basically escape and and and go off and do whatever they want to do so the court is corrupted\nAnd you know he says that he is going to prosecute this particular um series of people that he caught if the court can be corrupted like that it will be corrupted again and again and again it will be very hard to keep up with it\nAnd you know one of my big problems with this court in general is that why should you have a parallel court system why shouldn't you say somebody if you kill somebody over there you have to go to jail for Fifteen Years\nBut if you're a card carrying member of the FARC and you killed somebody or you killed five people all you have to do is come and tell us and you get to go free creating a parallel justice system is fraught with problems\nAnd aunt now you have another layer of problems on top of that which is the parent corruption of the court\nThe report you have from the southern district of New York seems important here Mary because we care about the u._s. was participation over the years in solving Colombia's crisis you report that two members of the FARC who were due to take seats in Congress\nAre now part of an accusation by in New York in the southern district of New York\nFor conspiring to import tons and tons of cocaine who do some Greek\nAnd Marlin marine oh who's the nephew of an important negotiator for the event of group\nSeems married who seems incredibly persuasive\nHas this got the attention of the new State Department that we then we signed on to an agreement that isn't complete violation of our laws not ... not only just Colombia's laws and the the security of the of the new worlds but our laws our own ... burdening are prosecutors\nWell you know I laugh when you say that because there were so many red flags before this thing was signed but the Obama administration John Kerry Bernie ... ... and we're all you know just spent on\nBurn errands and was the representative is that who doesn't speak\nWho doesn't speak Spanish I mean who knows what he was doing sit around Nevada I don't know [laughter] but um you know that this was all very apparent but they were bent on having this because they thought that it would be a legacy item just like opening\nTons of cocaine as a legacy item I well\nNow you're touching on what you said you know our our is the U.S now aware of this what the us away is aware of is that the area of of ah Columbia that is used now for cocoa crawling and the increase in a cocaine production has shot up\nAnd um you know now or as I said in my column I mean in many ways we're starting over again a president or ...\nOr had basically pacify many of the rural reaches of the country because he he returned the presence of the state to those areas\nPresident Santos pulled back from that he he basically gave an olive branch to you know all these different criminal groups while he was having this negotiation in Havana and he basically told them you know what we're not going to hold anybody accountable so what do you think the consequences of that are going to be people are going to say well crime pays\nAnd why why should I be sitting here earning minimum wage when I could be could be in this business and the other thing is that you know if you get these old guys who were the um you know you you mentioned the two that are out we were looking\nFor recon marine buck the nephew of Marquette right exactly and he's\nDisappeared these older guys you know they have all the money they want that stocked away and you know offshore bank accounts and so forth so they're all said\nAnd what they want to do is come in from the cold and be able to put their feet up and act like politicians with this money\nBut you can bet that there are a whole bunch of you know sort of mid level managers in this business who are going to say hey wait a minute I could be the next couple and that's why so many of these guys are returning because the money is in the cocaine\nAnd in these illegal businesses and to think that you're going to sit down in Nevada also those did really was carve out an amnesty\nFor these old guys who have enough money and are kind of tired of the foot rod in the jungle and want to come in and he didn't do anything about it actually changing the dynamics of what makes the FARC of violent\nOr you know a drug trafficking organization\nJohn Kerry a President Santos Bernard errands and rock Obama have any of them commented on this district ... southern district of New York issue or the fact that the violence is increasing in Colombia or the fact is that the\nHavana negotiation and twenty sixteen is now demonstrated to be in tatters they commented marry\nWell not to my knowledge I mean I Know that Santos said a publicly that if these guys had violated that the um their pledge not to being cocaine trafficking after November two thousand sixteen that yes they should be\nAnd he was even in favor of the extradition um but other than that basically apologist for the FARC agreement are saying well the problem is the government because the government has it you know felt that night housing for these people and they had a you know re integrated them into ...\nMary is really that they were supposed to have you that\nThe government hasn't delivered on its side of\nYou don't give it to a gym so we go back to coax smuggling that\nWell maybe it's not quite gymnasiums although they did ask for that but they claim that you know they they they don't have they they vision one thing about what they would get to sort of be welcome back inside it and the government is capable of giving them something else what a surprise\nMary Anastasia already of the
