headlines we're now in early June Nineteen Eighteen the second division twenty seven thousand five hundred I'm following\nThe reporting of James Carl Nelson Jim Nelson his new book I Will hold\nAnd our protagonist cliff Kate's commands the Ninety six company that's part of the deployment of the overall sex regimen but they are told\nThat there are going to hold the line and advance and in particular place where there's a hunting for us to his own aristocratic counting forests called the Bello would cage is given the role of advancing on a village Bora Shay\nAt this point Jim cases understanding moving into the wheat fields because that's what surrounding him you make a special case that the Marines were completely out of date they were believing in amassed mocks country\nAnd advancing in a line not taking into account that they were going up against machine guns and artillery\nYeah they are overpowering belief in overpowering rifle I shouldn't use many times but they believed in the rifle and they believe the marine merchant ship 'em so they they a lot of different forces learn this in the first World War doesn't work you know the dancing in rows and be mowed down by a machine gun\nIs not a good way to fight a battle um I Want you to at the Bella would a court case was still he was a second lieutenant um the company commander was Donald don't get 'em but they decided they made a decision to attack\nWould which indeed was a it was like a royal hunting area you have to keep the earth stuff in there the Germans were coming south and then they were heading east they're thirty five miles from Paris so they're getting very close and they sent the second division in a to a bend them off and the first to arrive was I\nBelieve the U.S twenty third regimen so they put them at the far eastern end of the line to block the road from many Germans come from that way and just by happenstance the Fort ... regiment was first and then the fifth regiment was came in after took line in front of Belo would\nOtherwise you might not have heard the Marines um the regulars got kind of a of shut out of the picture from that because it didn't really assault Bella with themselves\nAnyway John harbor James harbored who was the fourth a brigade commander was certain that there were hardly any Germans and the word he was just certain of it but it's that they had infiltrated chase the French outrun it built strong a machine gun positions ... positions all through it great rocky craggy place\nAnd on June sixty Americans decided to attack it\nSo they sent the fifth regiment basically on the left in the morning to try to do that than a general ... movement assault was order for the afternoon\nAnd it was at a salt on the far right or east end of the line that the Ninety six company carried out on the ... village of Russia's was about five o'clock in the afternoon and basically like you said that kind of spread out on line across the five hundred wide yard a wide open field and attacked us\nVery powerful a German position that precious many machine guns artillery a rifle man and a Kate's\nWith leading his platoon sport but soon and that in the men were literally bet at Dover as if they're walking to a rainstorm and as he has bent over a bullet playing up his helmet and knocked and cold and let this huge density kept a helmet throughout the rest of the war um\nBut he he ... he didn't even know how long he was out and uh he said his first impulse was to run away [laughter] so it's kind of unusual visitor erode character but just first battle really it looked to his right they saw some of his men over there being and he made his way through us if you're a rifle power and machine gun fire to them\nAnd one of his men started pouring a wind from the canteen out the window in his head and said hey you end up in my head give me a drink so he took a long drink of fortified he picked up in a band in French rifle led twenty men into brushed\nRyan twenty ... um the fifty six men that ... up the platoon that started a gyms reporting thirty two casualties so twenty four reached village of note here at this point\nA surround there's no way back they can't go back to ... ... they just can't continue to go forward they are mass before machine guns that overwhelm them they capture the village\nAnd yet at this point there is no good communication and they're missing their company commander Roberts continues to ... to disappear I have a headline to supplement gyms book because\nI it's great fun to read a book that this well researched and go and go to the New York times headline\nHim or member now this is introducing the marine corps to the American people and nowhere in this story do they mention that the United States Marines who take these villages new advance by our men goes they head towards the end ... Shea stormed into drive on six miles from\nEnemy lots of very heavy each man get a German don't let them get you was the Victor slogan\nNothing stops aren't there rushed twenty five of them fight two hundred in towards the German debt free deepen places and then this from the story are captured German says he did not know that it was the American supposed to the Germans he thought the troops were British as they weren't English how much\nHe added that the German soldiers no longer hope to reach Paris all of them are sick of the war and he was glad he had been made prisoner\nSo the Marines get no noticed here Jim and that's part of your story uses the Marines' fight spectacularly in these massacres and yet or the army and purchasing overall get all the headlines\nWell in a way um I Would tweak that to say that actually\nUh they they did start getting a notice to the chagrin and anger of the army regulars regularly to the first division not not in the second to be so much but ah what happened was there was a correspondent for the Chicago Tribune went in with uh the uh\nOh this is Floyd given the one who's shy media yes\nWent in through the wheat fields took a bullet in the I knocked out and before he the advantage he been tipped off about the advance a had written a story that mentioned the Marines are purchasing it laid out over the no units were to be identified\nThis is the Chicago Tribune is that what it was yeah\nYeah so one out on the wires that story about marine storming Bello would and this kind of stuff and uh everybody thought given as was dead so it gets to the censors off as a person's headquarters in Paris and he says well I'm a I'm going to let this through because it's the last thing I can do for zero Floyd you know see what it through that the Marines\nI wanted to rape victim that's why the a peacock story here doesn't make any mention of it because this is via Chicago I see yeah is that the only way I mean they had right\nIt it it may you know ... everybody ... actually it was like the Marines were the only ones fighting the war after that to a lot of people there was like you know they never really hurt but they captured the American imagination\nLet's take them into the village themselves because one one of the aspects of gyms book that is always worrying that once they capture a mission once they complete their mission and capture a point it's going to get worse\nYou know because the German counterattack and in this instance while they park themselves in this village the Germans then start using\nMustard gas over these next days and\nThey are the mustard gas is especially bad in the villages June eighth through eleventh Jim is my ... year that's when they just get rained upon by mustard gas and they don't retreat they they try to survive in their math than many don't make\nNo what happened was they were in the village and they were getting pretty well pounded by artillery or and they were really worried about a German counterattack um there's a very vital point eastern and below what they could have a lot of the woods from there any Americans is attacking\nIt so it was real it was a strong point they needed the gas is not actually used until later a Cape spent several days with this man by the by the night of June six\nHe said you know he had like an entire regiment of people that are basically held any town with a number of people who came in the reinforcements um it was on the night of a drink their teeth he's actually been pulled to the back lines and sat around and there's cops in trees basically there's a company\nAnd the Seventy eighth company and they were spotted by German a balloon is all day and write as they were getting the last feed it about midnight or all hell broke through a mustard gas a high explosive shells just rained down on him for about an hour\nAnd basically what it was all over hates would write home that his company was formed a base it was just as of a bloodbath\nI Will hold is the book were going on in the worst battles they had Jim Nelson James cone Nelson as the author I'm John bachelor [noise]\nH M\n[noise] fortunate showers are likely
