Sebastian Gorka my colleague from many is the author of a new book why we fight defeating Americans enemies with no apologies what is it fresh here is that there are two new follows that through the Obama administration\nAnd the Bush administration and the Clinton Administration it\nWas not clear to those of us who watch national security that the U.S what's going to focus\nOn ... threat we're now focused let's start with Russia or your experience with Russia from your dad and mom is that no matter how they dress it up their aggressive and they're aggressive especially along the boundaries of the empire\nIs it your opinion that the Trump Administration is addressing it adequately now after the failures of the Obama administration to see what Ukraine represented\nI think sending ... anti tank missiles to Kiev instead of socks and blankets is is a very a serious improvement from the Obama years\nSo yes and the the personalities while making the decisions not just in the White House but but elsewhere for example the gender the joint chiefs general dumped it fully appreciate that uh\nUh KGB total is always they KGB colonels and the the important way to look at Russia is not as the Soviet Union of you'll\nBut what I like to call them and the status quo after constantly looking to destabilize but we we tend as Americans I Love my fellow Americans we tend to posit good faith on behalf of the other\nRight I'm okay you want to be oh yeah I I say something and I'm a maintenance and and like I'm not a lot to do business that's the best yes the Kremlin has never work\nLike that whether it was run by a song whether it was run by Stalin or\nBy KGB cuddle so we now have the requisite knowledge and understanding that these are bad actors not the Soviet Union\nThis is a nation in the in demographic an economic collapse but a nation that will constantly endeavor to create Eddie is will that will wins and we'll tools which will destabilize certain regions often which they can do was exploited to the old\nHand there's a there's eight phases and then we won't go through the details there in the book but right now I Would say all those eight phases are present in a number of geography is across the edges of the empire from Syria to uh the Baltic states including Ukraine\nSo the eight phases of Russian doctrine today a I credit the Latvian ministry of defense that defense the Institute\nThat wrote an excellent English wanted it targets ... one of the primary ... above the Baltic region um they wrote a wonderful English language study that I pray see in in in my work\nAnd [noise] it's nothing very new that there's a lot of in the belt way people talk of hybrid wolf fast seven generational graves vote that's just wrapping on an old phones irregular warfare\nWhat is different it's a combination under serious ... the seriousness with which they apply irregular warfare\nEverything is in direct the focus is on the will on the norm\nKinetic they'll send in a little green men eventually but we now know unclassified open source of prior to seek a Crimean intervention Russia had been undermining the Ukrainian nation state for a decade with sub version with ah other means of\nTelevision they were ... they were so they say yes they were preaching propaganda millions\nOf dollars worth of propaganda being pushed into the region into the Baltic region as well right now so it it is it is the comprehensive this of their understanding of irregular warfare that is the\nDanger when you've got to the national defense university ah as the son of a man who fought the Soviets did you perceive that they saw Russia and Russia's action Russia's very good at this and always has that did they see it\nI have to admit when I arrived a there was that you could take many courses on two cities right you could take many courses\nOn Guadalcanal and and the the the most loving thing you could do the most relevant thing you could do is take courses on the Balkan Wars\nOf the Nineteen nineties so that was it was an aspect of the the syllabus of the J Pierre meets the drawing professional military education system was kind of frozen in the Nineteen nineties\nThis is during the Bush administration when you are right yes and the Obama administration did not improve on a model one more detail because it's always in the news now\nChina is our phone is off oh ...\nMeeting with my palm pale yesterday was a demonstration of of Chinese aggression by Wang either foreign minister the Decatur incident last week again and again and again when you arrived in the Bush administration when you lived in Washington teaching at the marine corps university did they understand that\nChina was a photo six people\nNot not as an institution not not as the five sided\nBrain of the defense industrial complex no they were rare\nMoments of of an allied movement in individuals who would into jak now and again but as a nation no because we had bought into the kissing Jerry than heritage yeah that liberalize they shouldn't of economics will bring liberalized racial politics\nIf you give the gangster everything's a gangster we'll we'll come by you quote from child Leon and Wang Shon sue the two colonels who writes the same doctrine that Abu ... road\nThey ride it in Mandarin right they don't write it in Arabic but it's just say and it's\nPublic now without that since Nineteen Ninety nine unrestricted\nWarfare it's three hundred four hundred pages but you can read it in English now with all official Chinese documents\nCaution twenty to thirty percent is propaganda meant for the white man but if you read between the lines you will see some sue has been so internalized and they are ... the the the concept is\nRight and who are who are the troublemakers we owe the troublemakers\nUnrestricted warfare that is not regional ... head you know that's unrestricted warfare challenged by the United states and defeat the United states\nI liked the Russian doctrine essentially there is no peace there is no dichotomy of reward abuse you are always a war may not be kinetic but you will always politically propaganda economically ... with the

understood by the Obama administration as an extra ... acts of central threat that we have to live with a generational friend I I\nIt's flabbergasted to review in the language at the time I guess I can argue that they were so burned by their collapse in Libya they didn't want to engage anything else that\nPredated that predated the collapse of Libya if you think about the fact\nSo I just won a illustration that near the end of the administration there was a very as a speech the president gave a press conference where those uh\nOvertones of ... where he said what difference is it what I call the threat do you remember that yeah it's it's as actually addressing candidate Trump bought differences that what I call the threat\nWas clearly in twenty eleven it made a big difference to the Obama administration because then twins eleven before ISIS befall it'd be before the collapse of Syria\nThe White House decreed in a memo to the shadow of the joint chiefs and to the attorney general that you must not use the word jihad and you must not mentioned Islam in all federal counterterrorism training of federal agents or the U.S armed services\nWell which is John is it relevant what we call the threat or do we have to have\nOh well Ian ... speak control in twenty eleven of what we are allowed or not allowed to say about those who call themselves jihadist that was the schizophrenia of the Obamas\nAnd candidate Trump and then transition president elect Trump and then President Trump addressed directly to his military we when they lose\nAnd unleashed them right I I I don't know if I mentioned in the book but there was this moment two months into the administration where\nWe had a group of soon to be Green Berets who just about to finish the cue cost the selection qualification

recall what may wish to call it\nI I've puzzled sometimes ...
