Jerry ... in the United States Navy maybe at a time is at the television group inviting for example\nNorthrop Grumman building aircraft carriers we're also looking at a paper that Jerry Rohde at his last days at the center for new American security just published about the challenges for the navy and the air force for the U.S military in the Pacific especially off the shores of East Asia\nAgainst an aggressive predatory state the Chinese with their Russian allies after the year twenty thirty when Xi Jinping the president for life\nTells us that he expects his military to match and match the United States Navy their chief a threat to their tyranny in the far Pacific Jerry we've spoken on the air wings and the shortfall we've spoken of the carriers even the fourth for class carrier\nNot having an answer on telling us the navy and the air force work together for deep strike but you write have something called the fine fix finished kill chain dealing with ... percent of weapons that can travel very quickly\nAnd this other element that doesn't exist now although I understand it's being built and they're the Navy's debating at an unmanned platform both as a strike platform and as a tanker platform what does that means you are and what what are they building\nWell what what is important here is is minimizing what we call late and see which is the time separation between when you can find a platform\nOr find a target you want a fix its location you want to track it and then you want to be able to then targeted for elimination so if we have a a a space based asset or an overhead a intelligence surveillance reconnaissance drone\nThat is watching and it has to watch uh almost persistently to see any subtle changes in the movement of platforms are geography once it detects something that looks like a target then you want to minimize the amount of time between a classifying it as a target and then putting a weapon on that target\nThe problem is all too often now or were either using overhead space based I uh I us our assets or\nOverhead I'm a unmanned platforms that are not equipped with weapons and so the idea of having a platform that can penetrate into a very advanced a surface to air missile environment of that means that that platform would have to have a low aspect stealth are all aspects self uh all the way around it\nAnd then would have to have a deep magazine ... eventually once you have that platform get in there you want it to persist in that environment for a period of time uh so they could hit perhaps multiple targets\nSo uh the the problem there becomes you know how long can men sit in a bomber or an aircraft and still be combat effective\nOr if you're in a very large bomber like the new be Twenty one than perhaps you can do that you get up and move around and have a little bit of stretching legs but sport naval aircraft it's very difficult to do that and you're almost limited to ten hour profiles\nSo the idea of launching an unmanned platform from a carrier\nAnd then having a platform refuel on its way to the target so that it can extend its endurance\nAnd then look for targets identified them hit them and then move on to a new set of targets that's really sort of the holy grail of this ah find fix finish a triangle that we look at\nAnd so this is where a naval aviation ought to be going with it's designed for a long range fixed wing a bomber but dust far has not\nUm in fact it it seems to be hung up on on F. thirty five an F. eighteens which are both find aircraft for what their original design was which was sort of a light attack mission\nBut when you want to go deep you want to go with the heavier load and you want to be able to persist there\nAnd so the navy is falling short of that over the last generation and a half\nIs the navy fighting in the last war Jerry that is the curse of the twentieth century\nSo we we actually talked about this we we think that the navy gets up every morning for parents to fight the battle of midway um and so it's not just the last war it's perhaps three wars are\nWon that great victory at but asked seven minutes to change the course of the war\nAbsolutely absolutely and everyone you know wants to be able to go to a point lock and know the game plan to execute and the army for that sense I mean I I I think we're the U.S military sort of fixed a strategically and sort of the larger wars of of the second World War without moving on to the environment we actually exist in\nAnd so looking to the future if the navy was looking to that than it would be wanting to move its carrier air wings or to a new um a mix of aircraft in order to keep them relevant into these future environments that we can see coming\nWhere missiles and directed energy and longer range weapons systems are going to dominate but that's far we have not seen that in fact we seem to be can last in in the Nineteen nineties when we could park a carrier in the ... seat and then take a Fifteen minute hop over into the former Yugoslavia\nUm and and no one's going to shoot back at you so the idea of being locked strategically into permissive environment seems to be the mistake that we've made over the last Thirty years\nIs the carrier secure now as a as a deploys into the Pacific at Kennedy defeat China now carry\nA show that that's a great question I Would say that we still\nMaintain that advantage over the Chinese now both geo strategically strategically at the operational level and perhaps even tactically but the Chinese are building capabilities and resources very quickly and at some point in time you can you can envision in your mind\nThat sometime within the next ten years I Believe and the twenty twenty five to twenty thirty timeframe\nThat there will be at the marsh and um and they will call our bat and we'll have to make a decision whether we're going to lean in and come to the age of an ally or partner or whether we're going to feed\nThat portion of the ocean and that portion of the world to a Chinese sphere of influence and I fear that we will not be ready for that challenge\nAnd the U.S navy right now in the debates they're looking forward they're talking about a three hundred and fifty five ship navy perhaps by twenty thirty would that provide the ... of the security that the carrier needs in order to penetrate the Pacific\nSo it will head in that direction because we certainly do need more platforms in order to surround our aircraft carriers and give them adequately defenses but this other part that I raised in the paper which is we need to invest in a new generation of missiles new generation of radars and sensors\nThat will allow those ships or be they cruisers destroyers or ... or to better protect that carrier and its air wing as its executing mission we also need a new generation of a ... to do to\nThe day to day presents operations to preserve the peace in the interim between now in that war and then they'll serve an escort a mission once a war begins and and I think the navy is beginning to think about that we've set the number right three hundred and fifty five ships\nWhat we haven't set is what\nType of ships with in that number so that has not been decided on\nAnd I noted that the air force in this last week made dimension that they needed to grow from three hundred and twelve squadrons to three hundred and eighty six so they have a number\nBut again they're debate is how many squadrons of what type how many squadrons of bombers versus how many squadrons of fighters I Would argue they need many more bombers than fighters in their future for scotch\nKevin Jerry Hendrik United States navy retired writing for the center for new American

was he was concerned that the Americans would learn 'em that he was\nIntercepting American messages and to his dying day I'm In in the late Nineteen thirties early forties he never admitted um how he

counselor State Department Foggy Bottom Frank\nPoke carry a has a ... it has the telegram deep coded on coded crypts analysis on his part with the code book\nAnd he sees the document he sees the revelations\nHe doesn't get to take it to the president of the United states until the next day Sunday at and at this point he introduces to Woodrow Wilson a a plot that it's so fantastic\nThe question is will Wilson believe it and Thomas Wilson is convinced that America must stay out of the war when he sees this telegram\nYou write that Mr pokes memoirs suggested Wilson took immediate action then he very much present the cases the state department and the White House moving together the president moving together\nWas Wilson reluctance Wilson have thoughts in his mind that this might be a fraud\n[noise] um well\nI mean certainly he asked the question you know is this real can we trust is I'm I'm a you know he knew this was coming from the British I think\nI think he he he he never really believed this was a British forgery I don't think he he he thought the the the Brits would be so primitive to try something like that on him um\nBut the interesting thing to me was when I read about Wilson's reactions and it's it's\nDifficult to gauge because he did leave any more so you have to read it through you know the memoirs or the notes of other people um ... ... of course he he he's not very happy when you hear that um I don't think he's seriously believe that you believe the United states is is in danger of Mexican invasion\nBut as I said earlier and interview he was\nEven at that point still hoping that um you know he could bring about a peace between the warring parties that would be immediate buddy noted states now when he sees the telegram of course he understands the Germans are really not interested in um in peace they're preparing for war against the United states he at that point\nSee this all efforts to bring about a negotiated peace\nAnd uh so the telegram doesn't doesn't push him into the war that will be too simplistic but I think it's fair to say that he stopped believing in bringing about media to peace and then eventually it takes a series of steps that brings the United states into the war so it\nIt it didn't precipitate America's intervention but it's certainly accelerated it um but it's also interesting to see it Wilson's reaction when he is told by by Lansing who returns think one or two days later\nAnd he asks Lansing well how did the um\nOut of the Germans transmit this telegram\nAnd Lansing tells him well it was probably done throughout by our you know thrown cables and it seems to me was the most almost more offended by the fact that the Germans were abusing this this you know American hospitality and\nWrite writings I'm used to the cables then by the content of the telegram itself and if you know something about it we'll see you know he he was very high minded he was something very more\nBut somebody moralistic and but it costs you all she could also be very petty and take things very personal and I think there's you know until I was a good example of that he is personally offended that the
