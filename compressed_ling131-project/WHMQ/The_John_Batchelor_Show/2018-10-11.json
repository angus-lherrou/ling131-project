narratives that are critical transforming the war that we now know is the second war but at this time doesn't have a name into a crusade against evil and the free narratives are used consciously\nBy Churchill becomes prime minister replacing Neville Chamberlain in Nineteen forty during the worst of the three narratives are Dunkirk and the retreat the victory of Dunkirk\nPulling out what's left of the British expeditionary force without its weapons the battle of Britain never have so few that famous line from truck show and then the blitz\nI've called the bombing in American homes to bring home the threat of a bummer\nDavid I ... and I ask you I turn it a little bit as you do these three narratives work topped by Churchill and his allies in London and by FDR and his supporters to involve the art involve American the war\nAs a way to explain how the\nUsers and winners of the first war must now be looked down again and Britain represents civilization\nA ... it's an incredible feat of imagination to project first of all a dunk or cause obvious how do they take the battle of Britain and the blitz and interpret Britain which crumbling London street as a as a civilization itself\nWell I think the full beyond that John I think we just have to remind ourselves that the fall from Nineteen forty is now seen as a familiar indeed inevitable policy the story that the events those events the full of from a walk make this rule\nFundamentally different from the law because the fruit Nineteen fourteen Eighteen there is a west from problems in Nineteen forty that western from collapses in for\nUh the British just about get off the continent of Europe with at home is\nThey will not lie and the game in from for four years they do say than with a massive American expeditionary force with

and admirals but it's about the little ... the the the fairies and the boats that help to get the mental beach so it's a kind of triumph of the common man\nAnd this story at the common man he's the narrative that really comes up again and again in Nineteen forty it's that in the in the blitz this is a story old ordinary people going about their business despite the the ... and the the reality of cold air raids\nAnd all this is so different from the the the fourteen Eighteen where the fighting is a long way away from Britain in the trenches it's often stack take a hit as drama\nA dead days um heroism over the cliff sold it was hard to find the heroes or it in the first world um who stories you could in Egypt retail\nAnd certainly for American reporters like ah like my row above all um the uh the what they get up by being in London this tremendous sense of drama or the history of history being made\nIt down deeply moved by it and it's it's he's propaganda but he's propaganda as it comes from the hard this is a different kind of Britain from this Rob a suit pine and an authentic and all that walking doing much in the Nineteen fifties deceased now so many say it we'll Britain has come a long way the game\nYou make the points that have had the largest British Army ever assembled sixty nine to sixty seven divisions in Nineteen Nineteen for that ... for the hundred days the last hundred days and it was the Canadians and the Australians who led the shock troops to break through\nThen Berg line however that last Churchill who was in the trenches briefly but it was associated with the defeat of deliberately and Brooks a commander of the overall commander of the British Army\nFearful hesitant reluctance shy to commit large numbers of troops in on the continent again which was the origin of the underbelly strategy that Churchill always wanted to follow does that mean that we should read Churchill as I\nHesitant crusader on the on the continent that he was he was more peaceful peace Nick\nThan ... than the memory of him the warlord\nBut no I ... I think he's all for a man who was trained for what he was military could that he said he actually killed men in black hole judge will himself is gripped by war but once he is not willing to pay as a political leader is the\nPrice for the possible price oh max warfare on the pumps and once again he results to a tradition of British Rule which takes us back to the days of war against the podium which is a war of attrition a war using Britain naval power\nA war of wearing down the enemy on the edges of his and hot out\n...
