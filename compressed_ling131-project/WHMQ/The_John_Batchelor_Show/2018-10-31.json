dealing with Russia gate right now 'cause it's a week before\nThe midterm election where the allegation goes\nThe Kremlin will once again be in the field to corrupt democracy we're dealing with the ironies of history how in the old Cold War they didn't tell Margaret Thatcher\nThat the Kremlin really had an agent in the election was their opposite number Michael Foot in labor party and in the new election\nOr they did the the Obama administration their intelligence apparatus their FBI their D. O. J. shouted to the rooftop Hillary Clinton shouted that Donald Trump is in it as a Kremlin agent with no evidence that the world we live in the new Cold War is a ... with farcical elements but\nThere is damage here and Steve I Want to begin with legitimacy what does the allegation a week before the midterm do for the legitimacy of the American government\nWe talk we talk about the potential and put a implications ramifications of this Russia the allegation that the Russians were manipulating the outcome of our elections\nIn the case of Trump in two thousand sixty and as you say the media's pushing this now in regard to the house congressional elections\nIn on November ... so we talked about this a little bit and it is a subject in my book war with Russia there was a question mark after it\nAnd the war I think about this I don't see this going away in the sense that as you said damage is being done we need that sense of process so here's what I asked myself and it's it's more a question\nThat an assertion but I think our folks listening ought to think about it or\nIf you say\nAnd you say it's for two and a half years even though you have produce any evidence that the Russians may have put Trump in the White House what are being done to the institution of the American presidency\nBecause it won't end with Trump because the idea that the Russians could do this the crumbling do this and now they're saying the Chinese may want to do it but that a foreign power\nCan choose our president potentially de legitimize is the president is seen as an institution to cast a shadow on it or let's go to what's going to be the normal reaction the next Democratic president is going to get the same kind of style thrown at him or her\nThat the Democrats have been throwing at Trump it isn't gonna end so what we have to ask ourselves first we get\nA almost a daily generalizing our elections as a process\nBeginning with the presidential one or two sixteen now going into next Tuesday these questions had been race so I have no doubt that if the Republicans hold\nOut going into next Tuesday these questions have been raised so I have no doubt that if\nThe Republicans hold the house a\nRemain the majority that segment of the Democratic party and its movie will be saying that the Russians were behind this or that the Russian ... you know tip the scale because they wanted to protect truck so would we then have a shadow over the presidency and over\nThe next Congress that's fairly serious in my ... my mind John and then that raises another question in my mind\nIf these people take this seriously what are they saying about American voters\nAre on the American people now in democratic theory and you don't have to be a political philosophy notice the bedrock a representative democracy is that the agency\nLies with voters and voters will make a rational a functional democratic decision and you live by their decision\nYou would agree with that ad democratic offers you begin with a premise that go on from there to talk about institutions are representative government but you can't have\nInstitutions are representative government uh and less you have people to elect otherwise and some authoritarian systems have outwardly democratic parliament Sr example correct but they're essentially appointed and control\nIt's called managed democracy but a real democracy and representative democracy is the one we know\nHow you need the voters but if the voters are said to be as they are in these Russia gate allegations\nForever susceptible to a hundred thousand dollars worth of ads out of about forty billion ads bought or whatever it was a by some Russian wacko social media operation in St Petersburg what does that thing about to mark and people\nI mean we've got to think this through at about of people you and I John who lived are higher life inundated by advertising on television that we don't believe for a man that\nI mean I Know that if I buy that beautiful car it is not going to get me all those beautiful women that are leaning over the car I mean we have been raised to be intuitive leap skeptical\nOf the things that come to our attention I think that's fair to say I mean advertising agencies try to manipulate us but we know what's going on so to say that the Russians are capable liberating American voters you're saying something less about the Russians and about our own people but that is what these Russia gate allegations are saying\nIt is striking to me Steve remembering the election and just I was participating as a reporter and I was watching on Twitter I could tell when the Russians were on line because it was morning time in Petersburg so I Would often wish them very good morning in Russian\nAnd they would never respond because they didn't have a sense of humor they were working for money I understood that but it wasn't a threat it was kind of cheering\nThat they were so keen on trying to influence us with awkward statements like Tennessee for Trump you know that kind of thing right [laughter] it's really very first flight the very thank you very much picked a real hard date there for the Republicans imagine that as a self I it never occurred to me that it would be\nIt would be concocted to be a threat to democracy it seemed it seemed kind of sweet of them that they want to get it that they that they wanted to get in on the process because they don't have anything comparable\nAnd Rick cause we talked about this I won't go into it but historically whatever massively or interference the Russians did into sixteen was\nPart of a long history of ... of all it let's turn to that just moments the birth of America meddling in their elections where we'll check when we come

I mean it's ... that this guy is this broken soul down in Florida I decided\nSomewhere you for some reason to post a story about Syria what do they care about Syria we don't know yet what matters is as he got it out of the New York times Washington Post\nI I Want to put it shapes on media and ... and when people walk up to me in the street and say Steve ... is ... I'm going to decide is putting gonna throw the house\nTo the Republicans the Democrats they aren't kidding and whether they get this they got up in the New York times the Washington Post or they got it from cable TV which gets their segments from the New York times in the Washington Post that's why it matters that's one of the virtues of the John ... so\nYou are kind of alternative source of news and news analysis but you only got so many million viewers a what a big country and a lot of people do leave this stuff\nOn the I Want to go to what is to be done with these allegations a one version of what has to be done in censorship how we see that underway right now in all directions because the social media sites are acting uh intermittently and\nAnd non transparently to censor or weed out Russian interference or other things they're doing but where I'm concentrating on Russia right now Russian interference\nHow that actually affect the election I Can't tell you but I Do know it sets up the possibility that whoever loses on Tuesday is going to blame the Russians\nIt also sets up the possibility that there is never going to be a safe space for elections that America in perpetuity if this if this theme continues tape our elections are always going to be vulnerable we can't shut the door fast enough\nAnd we have to find another way to go forward as the government which means distrust the mob trust the leadership that's where we're headed deep trust the people who know best\n... that's what worries me among other things and that's a theme and a a a Bible or the worst is leading\nUp to me and you got to get the language right Russia gave has been an elite project and one of the things I Do in the book is I trace it back to the CIA and Brennan maybe even before to sixteen and the story to the extent that it's known\nI put in the book I don't claim to know at all because you never know everything that the intelligence services do that's why they're called intelligence services I guess but the problem here is is that they set into motion these narratives about what's going on people believe them they would come to a moment\nAs we know it's a week away where one week away from the election and as you say are the losers are going to blame the Russians they will we've already had that in off year elections\nShow where how do we get our elections back now one thing we do you and I talked about it I won't go into it a great like that I heard something the other day that reminded me of it we did a broadcast maybe more than\nOne on the long history of American meddling in Russian election or Russian politics or\nNine ... Nineteen Ninety six we throw money at it\nWhat we could start with Woodrow Wilson who sent troops to ride a bike ride Russian so I ... I mean it's a century long and we've kinda gotten used to it\nBut the problem is we don't recognize this Russia gate phenomenon is really is a rather modern day minor episode in this behavior somebody said the other day I'm not going to say who was because he's very famous\nUh I don't think he's alive ball but he's held a lot of really important positions he said that we would that that he was in the Clinton and the uh\nUh the Clinton Administration\nAnd he remembers that at that time when Yeltsin was up for reelection in Nineteen Ninety six right yeah and he was like seven percent in the polls\nSo Washington mounted a big campaign to save you often but the one thing we didn't do this guy said is the main Greivis against Yeltsin was he hadn't pay pensions in two or three years\nAnd we didn't help them pay pensions\nThat's absolutely not true\nA it's a matter of public record Clinton got ... and and the international Monetary Fund loan I Can't remember if it was or billion or a billion dollars\nBut it was specifically so Yeltsin could pay pensions and unpaid wages and that was arranged\nBy that and that was a critical and new establishments fact when we talked about food and if the threat of the pensioners that on that I'd make the Kremlin tremble\nIf we think about it and we think about our parents and our grandparents\nAnd the role of the Social Security is played I played in this country for for for decades\nAnd we think about how tensions today or a political subject in the United states and the other way in Russia to uh [noise] you could almost I have a double negative you could not intervene more intimately and another country's\nPolitics\nThan by intervening in the pensions you see what I'm getting half yes I mean how intimate that is to the survival of families and yet we did it now people might say well it was a good thing that Yeltsin won because of the communist would've come back to power you could say that but to deny\nWhat we did to have amnesia about uh are very intimate intrusion into Russian election\nAnd then get our wound up by a handful of Russian social media uh uh a what a post\nAmerican electoral cycle seems to me to be strip of all of this\nSocial media a what a post in American electoral cycle seems to me to be strip of all of\nHis ... at the we have very dangerous we have to turn to the other elections where the Kremlin is accused of bad acting I'm speaking with professor Stephen F ...

E. S. for example in July of Seventeen to twenty thousand casualties wounded in action by the gas attacks by the German system ... this\nIs not just mustard gas is also Fox gene and they're still using ... ... so while there were ... volunteers into the gas service at no point C O did I get the sense that the volunteers understood their risk and what would happen to them the rest of their lives\nOr if it's not entirely clear to me to be honest with you I think there was a sense of 'em\nAre kind of excitement to be on the part of this cutting edge effort the way that it was talked about in the press with often\nAre using terms like fighting fire with fire on the news it was very little that really describe the um the actual reality of what he would like to be on a battlefield\nOr with chemical weapons in instead there was a little bit of a a kind of gee whiz uh a new kind of weapon um and and these soldiers were kind of\nPulled in by the attraction of being on the cutting edge kind of weaponry without honestly like a real understanding of what that actually meant I think\nMeanwhile back at American University the first effort is defensive they want to develop a gas mask\nThat is useful they can they can sell or provide to the British and the French remember for a long period of time the U.S has been making a great deal of money\nOn the first war before it gets involved but it's now in the war and they failed as their first gas mask which tells me that despite all the chemistry that they've gathered together they really do not understand the risks the oh\nI think that's true I mean there was also something else did they did not understand with it you know these are first you a man and they were all men were brought into this effort to create the first gas mask these are scientists their academic\nOr they deal with a theoretical uh problems in question what they don't deal with something like industrial production and so\nWhat they did is they set out to ah create a kind of theoretical that gas mask without really understanding what it would mean to have to make millions and millions of them I'm In a very very fast paced\nAnd so the scientists really had these very inflated expectations and how quickly they could do this and how well they could do it and the very first Mac there was created which was meant to be an American math\nOr as distinct from the French a math and the British math\nUm where as you said they they were failures or they failed in a number of ways on and it was considered it's a great embarrassment for these soldiers who\nAre excuse me for the scientists who were at the top of their field or some of the top research universities institutions around the country they believe that it should be very easy and it turned out to be much much more difficult than they thought on and it took them a great deal longer to come up with the uh the first American mask that could actually put in a mass production\nOn September of Seventeen there's a headline in the U.S papers following the story is if here we go to war us prepared for barbaric the ... on unquote\nWhat the army does is very carefully look for who can manufacture gases and gas masks and\nHe's seals reporting is exhaustive Dow Chemical gets involved of course old Barry electro chemical of not now ever falls no longer there Americans instead of color company in Stanford Connecticut\nOr they find a proven ground gunpowder neck in the ... and the Chesapeake uh Chesapeake Bay or they are setting up a chemical production facilities across the east coast and into the mid west of the United states this is the war department spending money but the whole time the oh I got the sense\nAgain that they wanted an American stamp on their gases they didn't just want to imitate the British because if they did they would have just gone completely into mustard gas\nI that's true that's true I'm One of the uh features of the uh chemical weapons arms race was that essentially the Germans were always one step ahead\nUm and so just when the British and the French had a created a gas mask that would a counter or the newest German gases they would unleash a new weapon and so the uh the the allies the British and the French and then eventually the American\nUh we're always one step behind the German so the American you're right they wanted to they wanted to find a new weapon they wanted to find something that they could use a that the Germans and their allies did not have a that would be as much of a surprise for the German as the types of weapons that the Germans had been using on the allies\nUm so yeah the ... immediately it as part of this enterprise at American University and it all the satellite labs all around the United states it was this effort underway to find new kinds of chemical weapons or that hadn't yet been you know\nDo find one that they eventually called Lewis site for the inventor in Illinois campus ... chemists who invented at a on American University Catholic university in Washington it will go to Cleveland to be produced and we'll follow that story when we come back because they're feeling their way through
