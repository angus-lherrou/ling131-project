German government for the Russians and [noise] with which will [noise] they're hoping for an arm of\nSome kind of end that at one point Matt neck us or you characterized that has some sporting end where you get to withdraw and we'll we'll take up different positions and stop shooting at each other and everybody will be intact\nHowever the first note to Wilson on the sex and then Wilson replies on the nights because he just trust the Germans is he right to just trust them at this point in there\nWell I think he probably is I mean the um the gym and government had been very reluctant to\nEngaging she liked peace talk or even the the idea of any kind of negotiate you to compromise peace throughout the ... um that has been something that they they have not felt it necessary to do um and I think Wilson I'm\nLike a lot of the allied leaders they're just not sure what has come from the actual who sent it necessarily whether it whether it has the authorization of the high command or not or because obviously there is ... splits in Germany where there was a civilian government political\nOr losing too often end in the the gym and I commend basically all dictators in ... name so of course there's a real initial attempt to try and find out if this is this a real deal is the real thing\nThe Americans are bogged down in ... in fact the whole of the offensive is slugging very heavily forward because while the Germans is deteriorating they have the defensive positions with machine guns and artillery\nHave the upper hand unless you organize your supply train and the father had you get another words the more you advance against the Germans the farther you are from resupply from shells from tanks\nFrom communication this is the moment when nic tells the story of the last battalion and I want to emphasize this neck because it's a legend here in America the three hundred and eight infantry of the Seventy seven division\nLiberty division they get lost in the woods I might note said six hundred and Seventy nine men go in less than two hundred come out with a celebrated at the time or was it considered a reversal of defeat\n... well I think at the time it it's pretty soon afterwards you get the sort of currency that that something happened here that was would you\nUm commemoration ... celebration that some offices time complain that the idea of a lost the Taliban was incorrect they will no it wasn't a battalion identical say we never really lost the Americans always knew where they ... they just couldn't get to them because of course it was surrounded by Jim troops um but\nIt becomes a sort of symbol of ... those are the sort of a legend in a in a bottle which seems to be inconclusive and difficult here is an example of good old fashioned heroism is a limited it or very small number of American troops hold out against vastly superior opponents\nAnd we know thanks to professor Lloyd that the Germans were not vastly superior at any point at this point they were breaking down there ... there are rumors there's panic\nThere are people who are accused of being war for longer as if they fought stay and fight some Germans run some German stay and fight to the end\nThe ... a middle of the month the exchanges continue Wilson second note by note here to the German government is on the sixteenth of October flag this\nJust make sure we get it in on the thirteenth of October a runner for the sixteenth reserve battalion of the six but very in division is hit with a mustard gas attack his name is Adolf Hitler as he evacuated at this point\nI'm ... I'm seems to be the case and that seems to have been evacuated suffering from those symptoms you have any mustard gas the a pain in the eyes ... that sort of temporary blindness and plus the scars on on my hands and feet\nUm and of course this is I'm a this is what Hitler writes in mine camp ...\nI'm suffering from the horrible pain and they sort of an agony of being hit by mustard gas Nicholson than when he's covering hostility or the has the news of the the negotiations apiece\nRats were telling that story thanks to Nick because\nThe mess that the army was betrayed becomes Hitler's opening arguments to the veterans in the Nineteen twenties ... leading up to the depression and the collapse in the Nineteen thirties that forms the document the or just a legend\nFor the third Reich in these weeks is the ... are the seat of the catastrophe of later in the century but we'll stay now with Wilson second note\nUh the charge here is that Wilson must make them stop submarine warfare must make them stop stop destroying as they were trade do the does the German government lifted are they ready to listen they're\nNot really the the gym and government certainly prints max and his colleagues are horrified when they got the second night because they um they ah they realize I think that the Americans is serious and they're not going to be able to get what they want and\nOf course the selection that the realization that the Americans are not going to be able to be played within sent sold the house the Americans are far why he's a ... than they had anticipated them and they certainly ah it's a very sort of shocking realization from them that actually wants saying stop to this crisis\nIs not going to end well for them and they're not going to be able to control it in the way that they would like because of course they go for Wilson 'cause they think he's going to be a soft touch\nLloyd George and apartment so are they worry that Wilson will give them more than a they deserve\nOh absolutely this is a real fair a British and French that Wilson is is going to give it all the way a Wilson's going to negotiate behind that backs\nI'm On a ... Wilson is not going to be as I said to him and don't Jim and surrender oh it it would seem so I'm only fair that Wilson is not amused hard on Germany that's certainly the French were like so I mean this is a very um\n[noise] this is you can see the ... the ... the British and French that they're not going to be up to control and will the Americans are doing\nIt is beyond the reach of next book except for the fact that these are the predicates for what\nUm well the Americans are doing\nIt is beyond the reach of Nick's book except for the fact these are the predicates\nFor what goes wrong at the ... peace treaty because Clemens so and lowered George Will lead the demands for reparations and for revenge\nOn the German that will be pumped come part of the legend that Hitler tells all Germany tells Nineteen twenty to Nineteen thirties when we come back we come to the council of war Seventeen October ... days the campaign that end of World War one Nick Lloyd is the author I'm John ... [noise]\n[noise]\nGoing and rage down\nAnd so to facilitate and an orchestrate the massacre of the people in my grandfather's camp\nUm this is actually ... went and met with some of the um the clans and tribes north with the the ... the north to the north of Paris or and organized for them to um to the ... to do the slaughter of the Armenians\nSo he brought in killers and they were just variants colors and they were using swords and clubs and and weapons as well but they they they would separate people the twelve year old boys\nThe males above twelve years old the women they would strip them of their clothes and either they were so exhausted they die or they'd clubs and by the river and pushed them in the river is that what your grandfather ride\nUm there were there were a different you know there were different massacre sites and so my grandfather would be for his his caravan was slaughtered he would see\nYou know a Armenians floating past him on the harbor you know several of them tied together and um I'm from my grandfather you know the the massacre\nTook place behind a hill which is um my ... and when I was there in two thousand Seventy thousand nine there was a small memorial I'm at this\nRight that's up from where you first came up on the ... river there exactly or\nThe um the ... we have to tell the escape because we have to get him all the way to America and that would accept the New York okay and and his burial in Hollywood yes it's all the head of the road into your daughter's part of it I he escaped by thinking through\nHow to get through the ... on that the Chechen law\nAnd then he walked for five or six days with no food and very little water there's crowds of them some survive some don't\nHe walked and walked and walked he captured again he walked and walked and walked\nAnd then he comes to outside of rock and Arabs shake shake all ... and what does the shake do for your grandfather\nSo this this shake it shake hallowed I'm Glad he was this I'm very powerful shake along the ... the um during the war and my grandfather heard about him and my grandfather\nUm at first my grandfather disguise himself as you know a a Muslim Arab of the area and changed his clothes and and and went to the shake but the shake wasn't fooled by my grandfather's parents any new\nMy grant whom my grandfather was that he wasn't Armenian and the shake except him and accepted him and took him in and ended up you know treating him like a son and my grandfather stayed with a shack and what\nResonates with me is just this this shake ignored the propaganda of the time that these Armenians were dangerous people\nAnd I'm couldn't be trusted instead did the opposite and took my grandfather and\nAnd they just had the ... and saved his life and so to me that was one of the most important parts of the story\nI had to close the circle you return there and two thousand seven and again in two thousand and died and you were ... they they make a meal for you you're the honored guest you sit down and use your hands because you've been to I've never\nDone this dog so help me you dip into the pot that has the laminate and you pull it out with your fingers and they they show you a plate and what is the significance of that play\nSo they you know I found them and it was just incredible one of us incredible moments in my life\nAnd what is the significance of that play\nSo they you know I found them and it was just incredible one of us incredible moments of my life and and then they told me that um the Potter we're eating on was um\nThat that my grandfather would have eaten off that Potter ... class that they've kept it it was one of their prized possessions in the in the village and so it was just incredible you know you're kind of stepping through time and you're able to thank these people who were just as beautiful as that I read about\nIn Ninety One years later that's what really still there and they connect layer mother now I understand I had a mother just like this they never throw anything away you come from\nThe heart of the world [laughter] you have it all your\nI mean you you never know when you might need it and besides the plate is good for Ninety One years if you care for it\nYes yeah there was this beautiful big plot er and um and and it it was it was absolutely it was just such a special moment to be with them and to thank them and I'm One of the the things that I remember the most is that when they had heard that I was coming there it was after we found them they\nHad thought that I was in need like my grandfather and so they were ready to give me refuge and so you think about the people of this area and now they're in need of refuge\nYes they're under the bomb that's important to establish where where Don Was that it is now a war zone\nThe Syrian Army is to the west or at Palmyra\nThis is the ... river valley and that's a no go that's ISIS and uh the American army the American Airforce bombs that ... allied Airforce and we're told the Russian air force so the family you visited and the last you heard from them there are still intact is that correct\nAnd most of them\nOut so yeah that's a war zone a hundred years later now your grandfather a comes a time when the raiders or in the area and the shake rides off just as his chance\nTo escape but you're never very escape very long when you're in the first World War he caught he's in prison and she can scripted he becomes part of the work battalion for the Turkish military they transporting meet the transport him when he's made a slave again\nHe survives your grandfather is the dirtiest human being have you've got his genes you'll live forever don't\n[laughter] I I I I I Am a shot\nOf him he was he's incredibly one of the things that I think he picked up and his story to me is that you know even if he goes through all of this his his he had incredible courage\nAnd and and he he his story is so inspiring to me because he just he just keeps his his will and his faith that he's going to get home one day to see his family\nAnd that's what keeps you going to get back to his time\nYes yes and that's a timeless story of
