what looks to be a fresh information about what happened to the Jews in the Austria Hungarian empire that by the Nineteen thirties Nineteen twenties Nineteen thirties they were scapegoating by such as the national socialists\nThe dislocation of the Jewish villages in ... is co tournaments with these offensive action the enormous numbers of army marching through the blasting and the threat those Jews are what they're they they travel naturally to Vienna force part is that correct Jeff and that's where\nThe Jews half cylinder again having been driven out of their villages and they participate

and Jews but there was a a large a very large Jewish presidents an extended from collision northward into Russian Poland which is why the Holocaust is is focused principally in Poland in Ukraine when the Nazis come that way is that was the old Russian pale of settlement which\nExtended down into Austria Hungarian Alicia as well um and\nSo what happens is the uh because of the Russian tradition of pogroms and because this intense Russian anti Semitism I mean the Russian moves sheiks the Russian President soldiers whenever they came into contact with Jewish capitals are villages they would you know rape and plunder steel and a harasser bully the inhabitants\nAnd uh so and and there's many examples in the book where I talk about their treatment of of of Jews at the front and uh so that the Jews would just gather up what belongs they could take and they would take to the roads and head west and they had to get out of Galicia and then once they get over the card paid ends and into Austria Hungary they just march on to Vienna\nIn most cases and they take over the uh\nSecond or ... the the ... part of Vienna\nUm and er which which if you go there today it's a it's an incredible because

ah they were all sent a troubling ... and and ah exterminated\nSo um it was it's a very sad story but they they end up in Vienna because of this war so the the the the Jews have delicious felt very
