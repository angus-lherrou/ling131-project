this is a James people's Princeton University he ... he ... he reports to you from the point of view of a cosmologist the enigma cars how few stars are are in this boy are there are speculation as to why that happened do we have theories kept\nWell the question is are there in fact\nAdditional galaxies in the local voice that we don't know about and the answer is we don't but no one knows the answer to that but perhaps amateur astronomers may supply that answer let me explain the problem that the local void maybe present that\nNow as I mentioned earlier as the universe expand she'd do expect that the under dense regions are going to get more and more under dense and so the voids are\nPerfectly compatible with standard cosmology and theory predicts that a void should have about ten percent for the mean density of the universe\nBut in fact when we look at the galaxies that we know of in the local boy and calculate what is their number relative to the mean in the universe it's only about one percent so there's a factor of ten shortfall in the local boy and that leads to the question well where are the galaxies and where are the stars\nIs it possible that there are galaxies in the local boy that we don't know about and the answer is a definite maybe and it's terrible that amateur astronomers working at very dark site\nVery far from city lights armed with good telescope could perhaps discovered new galaxies in the local boy\nSimply because the nearest parts of the local Boyd are fairly nearby so there's a potential here for astronomers especially amateur astronomers to make discoveries that would help cosmologist reconcile theory\nWith observation now on the other hand there are other people who say well this problem actually isn't that much of a problem\nBecause in a void you expect that\nMaterial may not have been able to create stars so that in other words the matter is still there you still have this ten percent matter of the of the universe in a void in including the locals away but it just hasn't been able to convert itself into stars and so that's the reason\nWe don't see these galaxies so you might have a very dark galaxies out there that consists basically of dark matter and maybe a little bit of gas but no stars and so the reason we haven't discovered those galaxies are simply because they met no radiation\nSo right now it's a it's a mystery to question and we we do not know the answer we do not know if there are more galaxies to Fifteen nearby in the local boy or whether it's a local boy does actually pose a problem for standard ...\nJana how ... how recent does this discovery of the local void and the local sheet and the questions that you just ... about where are all the stars this is something that's been going on for Twenty years Thirty years how how recent\nLittle local boy was discovered by Britain totally and\nRichard Fisher in Nineteen eighty seven they they were measuring distances of nearby galaxies which used to be a much more difficult thing that is today with you know the very large telescopes we have today and it you know you can measure distances quite easily today but back then it was a struggle you had to do each galaxy individually\nAnd they published an outlet in Nineteen eighty seven and a ... totally notice hey there's a whole sector of the sky that basically empty of galaxies and that was the discovery of the local boy back in Nineteen\nEighty seven so we've known about the local void since then and even before then we knew about other void in the universe so it's not a surprise in the sense that there is you're given a that the universe is full of\nClusters in super clusters and voice it's not surprising that there is a boy that is the very nearest one and that is simply the local forward as far as the shortfall of galaxies in the local boy\nThat is a a paper that was published in Twenty one by James peoples\nAnd that's when that problem which costs avoid phenomenon started to be known to astronomers so the the discovery of the local void goes back about Thirty years but the the problem of with a shortfall of galaxies in the local Floyd is a is it more recent\nProblems and your are your formula of how quickly we're moving is that a new discovery these forces that are compelling as a A R pushing it pushing and pulling us that's six hundred and thirty kilometers per second is that fresh\nThe actual number there goes back many decades but the explanation as part of the local boys are really goes back to a very important paper that appeared about ten years ago and twenty eight\nA lead off it was ... at the University of Hawaii and his team showed that to you need the local boy in addition to these galaxy clusters to explain our full motion through the universe I'm now I should say that there are some galaxies known in the local the local void\nThe two near a story about twenty five million light years from earth they're dwarfed irregular galaxies they can see pictures of them in the sky and telescope article and there is surprisingly normal you know despite their very bizarre environment to their rather similar to pour for regular galaxies in the local group so the message seems\nTo be that even if you live in a in a void you can be a fairly normal gal are they moving towards us or we gathering the men\n[noise] yes yes and in fact a yes vote the local Boyd is basically trying to eat these galaxies or another way to look at it is\nThe galaxies in the local sheets are gravitational pull is called I'm pulling of them toward us so that yes they are fleeing the local void and if we could wait a few billion years\nIt's entirely possible there'll be part of the local sheet or at least much closer to it\nThan they are now but in terms of you know forming stars are having no problem making new stars they've got gas which is the raw material for making the stars and so they seem to resemble fairly normal gal says but as you say they are indeed fleeing the local boy\nDoctor come across well the article is the ah the ... says sky telescope the local boy the boy next door ducks come across well as the author of the lives of

at least it's a more solid\nOr data or a reason scientists use it doing surveys of the outer solar system to try to see if they can locate an additional planet I'm doing that they've discovered an extremely distant object they think it's about two hundred miles in diameter\nLet's Albany in the sun from six billion to two hundred and Thirteen billion miles that's how\nDistant it's all that is its closest approach is six billion miles which is about the distance of Pluto but it can go out to six hundred to two hundred and Thirteen million miles which puts it out to the you know or the clouds which this means dishes may be the first\nReal evidence of an on cloud existence that you know that actually is Albany then that distance [noise] um [noise] base extrapolating the three objects we presently no that exists out there in these far distances that scientists have extrapolated that that could be as many as two million objects\nBigger than twenty five miles in diameter out there\nAnd to put it mildly there is a lot of uncertainty in that extra Appalachian\nBut nonetheless they found the third they call it a GOP the toppling they nicknamed at that because it's so far away it's skating\nBut Bob just this disrupt the search for planet X. or the speculated large body that has just term the court rebelled and perhaps even the inner planets over these last tens of thousands of ... according\nTo the scientists no in fact they say it's presidents\nFits the president models that say there's a large body out there um but I haven't found the large body and uh you know you're looking you'd think you'd find the bigger object first drive around but they have it so it doesn't prove or disprove anything and I think that the models and the daddy here is so uncertain\nAnything they say is waiving hands and shouldn't be taken very seriously\nNow a moment to enjoy yourself there was an article in the wall Street Journal these last days read by young women I Know ...\nAnd it turns on a papers that are submitted to journals academic journals I Do not know about academic journals I read nature and science that are not academic really their professional magazine\nIt turns out that peer reviewed magazines or be are publishing articles so bizarre and so disconnected from my experience not specialized language but weird interpretations of human behavior\nThan it was possible for three academics or two men and women a woman to submit papers based on complete nonsense get them accepted and published online I get some of them in magazine form and the question here Bob is\nJust this connect to all of the peer reviewed magazines or is this just in the social sciences where they're moving around after\n[noise] I I personally think this applies to the entire academic community which in many ways is becoming increasingly bankrupt we've talked about the corruption in the climate field which is hard science but it's so hard anymore that vicious\nPoisoning the entire academic community this is not a new story what these academics did these three academic says they were very disturbed by the by the what they call ... tree\nOf a lot of these ethnic a woman is a feminist um a LB ...\nY ... gender or ethnic uh departments and the journals set a publishing academic house just like nature and science and those are not professional those the academic journals as well that peer review\nAnd they were disturbed by the lack of rigor and the science so excited to get together and they they they created twenty\nFake papers they sent out they said they could have done a lot more but they had to end this finally seven got accepted several ... pending rewrites we're probably been accepted with time they expected they could have gotten half these fake papers accepted\nAnd the subjects that sometimes have sure one of the most absurd absurd one was uh uh they ... they wrote it\nDog parks are an example of rape culture that dogs in dog parks getting humped\nOil that was just nonsense Bob and it was obvious that was nonsense it's obvious the moment you say it it was obvious everybody read it in the wall Street Journal and it was like I thought it except\nJournal they published it and they gave it an award for a great example of good research in in in gender studies they also did a paper in which they read they basically took a chapter from Hitler's bind calm and they reshape the slightly using feminist jogging and it got published\nThe one I liked about is the one in the fat studies I I thought ... was it send it fooled me I I I I'm In fact by we could sound journals right now that might get accepted you know we'll be right for example a excellent moon colonies we could we could put up a journal like that and probably get papers [noise] hey\nYou know the thing that you could actually be more real their knees or ethnics gender feminist\nOr a woman much is is not what it is right it's a whole is this in hard science is this ... in\nThe academic community there is bankrupt I stop buying off I care about hard science is I don't care about the softer science and social sciences do you measure that this is going on

Bob Bob Bob you've got to back off on the ... are no feminist ... sets a center\nRight no there was an actual paper that argued that and\nAnd it was published in one of these journals and are there have been a a journal articles similarly stating that uh uh engineering and math can't have a feminist aspect and it is oppressive the modern math that\nWe have a physics we have any good it was hard sciences ... do the hard science is published these are these in the social science like\nThese are the social science but here's the problem a lot of the thinking in this and this is what these academics ... by the way that the flies left wing these three academics\nRight and they also I say that they don't believe they'll get jobs again or they think there'll be punished for doing yes\nMore important they say they think it's poisoning the entire academic community because it's teaching people false knowledge what they call ... history and it's not real knowledge is not real search for truth and its poisonous and I'm On my big problem with this is that this is not a new story\nAllen so called did exactly the same thing the sociology or trying to sociology general in Nineteen Ninety six\nEveryone said oh my God this stuff is junk we should do something about it instead we have more of these journals\nAre I've got I Wonder why I Want to leave it by giving them like we've given them too much time if they do a magazine called XO moon gala colonies all by Bob's gym and then he keeps a website behind the black when we come back space engineering hard science I'm John bachelor this is the John ...
