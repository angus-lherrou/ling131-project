Stevens up in I Believe it's rose there Hey Steve walking to show\nA warrant great to talk to actually it's Rosendale were up in the Hudson Valley a couple of hours north of the city\nUh-huh okay I Know there's a Rosedale on Long Island where I happened to grow up I didn't know rose\nI Know I Know I remember yeah what can we do have a lot I can tell you start a we\nRecently adopted a rescue dog to be a companion to our eight year old should sue poodle who's a wonderfully sweet dog but we lost our other dog with a Maltese two years ago suddenly so we rescued this new dog\nHe's turned that we did a DNA test on he's mostly Chihuahua and a little bit of Sean so it's like a Chihuahua and be Sean clothing like the combination Barker he's a year and a half\nOld uh he's great he's very sweet\nThey get along fabulously the two dogs love each other the problem is main problem is\nHe's very afraid it's a fair thing a big dogs he's kind of hyper nervous a lot of the time so we don't know what his first year and a half or so was was all about but when we go on walks boy oh boy if he sees a dog bigger than an even several blocks away or if it happens to be right next to each barking like crazy out of control\nAnd we've been working with a trainer through the rescue place you know if it's when he's around it works great with doing it by ourself dystrophy tells sometimes of what\nWhat what are you at what are you let's say you're sitting at the park you have your dog he sees another dog what happened and what do you do or\nWhat we've been doing is where we try to get him away from the situation\nHow does that resolves well how does that resolving\nA well he'll try and put we we tried to get them away when he gets calm\nAnd how how does how does how does getting him away from the situation that is creating a problem and resolve the problem\nWith the idea is to to give him when he's calm give them a treat and you know it works\nGreat but they don't listen listen to me carefully okay the dog react like ooh Joe he sees another dog and he goes crazy with the training told you to do is remove them from that area and calm him down and give them a treat what did you just you\nKnow I heard before it's reinforcing\nExactly just totally dog that that's what happened to use what you need to do and this is so important to understand that when you have a dog beach reacting you need not to react the minute you react you're creating more reaction on the dog's part\nThe mid ... the mini your dog sees another dog and starts reacting utensils you pull back on a leash as long as you pull back on a leash\nHe's going to pull forward on a leash becomes a tug of war making him more assertive that's how guard dogs are trained what you need to do is when you're walking him and you take them for a walk you should follow your trainees instructions\nAnd do your basic training dogs need to know how to heal six day down income I understand that but\nAs long as you react to the dogs misbehavior\nIn some way where he is getting attention for in a treat for it you're not going to resolve the problem here's the resolution your dog learns how to learn to understand that when he walks to pass the big dog\nNothing is going to happen nothing good is going to happen nothing bad is going to happen nothing is going to happen so here's what you do when you're walking your dog and he sees another dog he's ... he's a Chihuahua mix always on the horns\nAnd you're walking past another dog and he starts reacting rather than stop rather than say anything you just continue walk if you want you can say it's known you concern and don't stop\nOnce you're on a block or so away passing them a pat on the head if you want don't make 'em do any training at that point\nBut the bottom line is he starts to learn there's no need to react that way you're reacting to his reaction the resolution to behavioral issues is to get the dog not to react in the first place and the way to get the dog not to react to let him know that this is no big deal\nSo your trainer is okay and I know what you're saying in a lot of training approach it that way but the ... let me tell you I have taken dogs out of the worst dog fighting rings in New Jersey and New York\nI have worked with dogs that have been on the streets in South central LA that dog fight every day of the week that is the resolution not being tough with them not being asserted with I'm not taking them to a different area but making them understand that walking past ... nothing's going to happen therefore there's no need to react\nDisaster resolution I Would recommend Steve\nIt makes sense but I've just one question about that when he's polling and pulling and barking like standing up and all this is like direct to get him to keep walking is basically dragging him along the street but you're not going to just walk it it's not it's the gentle barking\nWhen we bought here's here's what you need to do you need to walk them in a situation where let's say you were I don't know the type of area you live and maybe there's a dog park or maybe there's an area where people walk their dogs will you can start out walking in an area where he's not right on top of the dock in other words maybe he's not reacting to the dog at all after you've done that for a couple of days and he's not reacting\nThen get a little bit closer if he's reacting go back to the further distance\nLittle by little when he realizes that nothing bad can happen he's just going to stop doing companies pulled me a little bit at this point in going to the other dogs you don't want to react that way anyway follows me Steve I'm going to put you on hold I'm gonna send you a copy of how to get your doctor do you

to get down then the dogs for the call Warren on the front of the war and they're making me crazy isn't that the definition of neurosis\nSo when you're working more training or educating your dog or you can it doesn't make any difference consistency is really important decide if the dog a lot to sit on the couch its dog allowed to be in bed with us if so then deal with it and enjoy my dogs are allowed to be in bed with me they're allowed to be on the couch me there can be anywhere I Know but that to me\nBut make sure that everyone in the family is working exactly the same way everyone knows
