T. as David said that I was like oh [laughter]\nOkay um\n'cause you don't know exactly how the business going to go how how quickly it's going to be profitable how much it's going to grow how slow is going to grow and I want you to be careful because you buy a home you got a fixed overhead there you rent you know it gives you more flexibility\nOkay how are you for the business\nI'm a combination of sun some cash and to some some alone time so we wouldn't be less than a franchise is is there out we're going to go and then um we have a twenty percent down saved away for the home they need to delay we sure can\nYeah I Would really I'm I'm really asking you to put that just on the shelf for now\nBecause when you start a new business you don't know what your cash flow needs are going to be you know you know the franchise people are going to promise you that oh yeah our trend line is you're going to be casual positive and how many months do they tell you\nI promise anything they show is their best guy their worst guy in their average guy and and I and even their worst guy would be okay with us\nOkay All right well that's good I I and ... either you you say we as at you and your husband are going to\nYes on his have either of you worked in the industry before that you're going to have this franchise we have not so I'm just all\nA stop signs and red lights right now I'm OK fan of one of you going to work for one of the franchises doing\nAnything and everything for at least three months mhm\nBecause you got the rest of your life you can own the franchise but I really light for you to uh experience at one or both of you to experience the business before you're all in\nOkay\nAnd I don't know if that's something you've considered but with any business whether it's a franchise or not having some experience when your money's not at risk you there's so much you learn in a relatively short period of time\nThat eliminates a issues concerns mistakes you might make once you're owning a now operating it\nYeah that makes sense\nSo I put your whole life on hold that you wanted to talk to about\n... okay [laughter] well um you know I respect your opinion and I thank you
