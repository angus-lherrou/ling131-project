I. P. C. did anybody mentioned SSI PC to you\nI've seen it at the bottom of the page when you're looking at the site\nAnd S. I. P. C. as a vastly inferior protection for you than what you have added a credit union through in the u._s._a. or at a bank through FDIC\nSo aside PC is a privatized version of protection and the most contentious cases of involved where a brokerage has been crooked\nAnd S.
