required to do do not be surprised\nIf in the next few weeks you get a notification from your bank credit union brokerage whoever it is you do electronic deposit where there will be a phrase they require\nThat you are right on the face of the check you're going to deposit\nAnd that will be something white for mobile deposit only or something of similar wording that the bank is requiring and that is\nWhat you'll have to put on both for your deposit will be accepted the idea being that will lemonade you trying to deposit fat check the second time somewhere else who knew people would try to run a game like that anyway [noise]\nYou're listening to the Clark Howard show [noise]\n[noise]\nHanging valley leather rainy today my new forty four when things are tight fitting lamps for our little to no snow cumulus\nThe upshot of this is first of all this is a fight there for the government isn't the way to win and second of all if the drug industry is for us to litigate yes what they'll just pass those costs on us\nAll right so let's go to the core or something and this is something I've heard from several doctors ... this is very frustrating to them with the with the ads for these pharmaceuticals on TV because they all have patients come in\nAnd they're already pre sold dog I Want you to write me a script for blah blah blah because I saw it it's going to do all these miraculous things\nAnd suddenly I'm going to look like those people on the TV and addition to curing white males me and so the perspective I've gotten from physicians is that we're the problem more than anything else and that we're allowing ourselves to be too influenced by these ads running on TV\nYou know I've heard the same but it's also it's important to remember that at this point\nIn the U.S health care system it's all about turnover or Catholic Haitian in healthcare terms which means they've got to get you into the office and out of the office as fast as possible so if a patient is digging in his or her heels and said I Want drug X Y Z and I'm not gonna take no for an answer [noise]\nA lot of doctors will simply write the script just to get things moving along and that's\nKinda why the drug industry now\nPuts more money into marketing to delve into research because they know what's affective they don't need to get everybody\nDemanding a prescription med or a brand name mad what they need to get it's just a a significant number\nTo make it defensible and justifiable and keep you in the brand name fold and that's where part of the problem is and let's also underlined disappoint Clark and that is there are only two nations in the entire world that allows so called direct to consumer advertising a prescription drugs and that costs\nAnd New Zealand and that's it\nEvery other country especially developed countries like us have looked at that practice and said no we see that as doing more harm than good because let's face it these decisions are meant to be made by trained licensed health care professionals and not\nAmateurs like you and me and everybody listening and therefore it doesn't serve the public interest to do this in fact the American Medical Association has called for an end of his practice because they see this just inflating drug prices and steering people into expensive treatment regimens there would be much cheaper alternatives for\nSo is the best way you and I can do is we can't change that a momentum and we're not\nThat powerful sorry [laughter] I Can't change that momentum so we've got a\nDrill back to basics and that is at the core most of us are going to do just fine with the generic mad that already exists for a condition that ails us\nI think that's absolutely true I think also\nPeople need to be more open minded to the idea that their doctor when they come back at you with a idea that well there is a generic or there's an alternative drug you might want to explore this cheaper or covered by your insurance you certainly want to listen because this is somebody who's read all of the academic papers\nAnd on all the research that you haven't done so yeah you want to listen to that person\nAnd I would also encourage people to write to their elected representatives because indeed if we do want to try to bring the drug industry focused once again on curing ailments as opposed to moving product getting rid of these direct to consumer ads would be a big step in the right direction because that's\nBillions of dollars that would therefore be redirected backing to Laurie useful endeavors such as basic research and wouldn't require me to explain to my son what ... what are watching sports together on TV\n[laughter]\nBest thing you said was that [laughter] was\nGosh I Can't get past you have a new explained that to your son the best thing you said is that there are now spending more money on this marketing than they're spending on are indeed to actually make drugs that will improve people's lives and that is a real miss direction a national wealth\nTo have all that money going to the ads and so don't mind them change your mind don't make those ads influence what you are going to consult with your doctor about\nIn fact I don't even pay attention to those ads because let's face it they are not imparting sufficient amount of information for you to make an informed decision and therefore they're not worth your time\nWith David Lazarus from Los Angeles times thank you so much for joining us and you keep that passion and by the way how did you explain to your son when he Diaz says family radio\nWell I Would say the things that lasts for four hours probably aren't good under any circumstances [laughter]\nVery much [laughter] [laughter]\nOkay\nCorey with us on the clock tower did show whoa Corey how you doing\nHi Clark I'm good how are you great thank you [noise] Corey you've got\nSomething that happened in your life it's not a laughing matter\nIt's a good matter I mean we we were able to acquire are but unfortunately a those after my wife my wife's dad passed away\nWell I'm very sorry about her loss hello thank you\nSo how can I be of service and the situation\nThat cause us to take a look at our a auto insurance because we ah we added another car we had really looked at it in a while\nIt kind of realize we might be paying too much for auto insurance and we started looking at our policy and we're kind of trying to figure out where we can save money with where everything's set out as far as our coverage so we're going to be adding a\nSix sixteen and Seventeen year old son onto the policy within the next six months\nOh oh oh oh\nI just have your wallet just take that and I even stab your wallet a lot you know 'cause that's what happens when you get a teen driver on your insurance\nYes yeah we're lucky enough so that we didn't have to buy a car\nTrue so or saving money there\nAny of the cars you have old enough that you can avoid taking 'em collusion comprehensive on that vehicle\nYes and that's a matter of trying to sell that to my wife but that was one of the first thoughts along with um raising our deductibles\nYeah I'm a ... fan and raising the doctor moles okay and trying to raise those two thousand that's usually if you're going to have any vehicle you have has alone that may be the max you're allowed to raise it to okay with that helps and you\nWere a hundred now so\nYeah it's a raise it to the thousand because you don't want to make a five hundred a claim on something between five hundred thousand dollars anyway no because the insurer will just eat you up on premium so you want to avoid that and then how old are your vehicles\nSo our oldest vehicle is it's a thousand and four\nYeah you only want to have liability on that one\nBut that's okay but I was thinking too\nFor yeah you only want to have liability on that one\nYeah that's OK let's stick to the other two are newer we have a two thousand Fifteen and they are we just got his two thousandth ... so\nYou're a teenager needs to be driving the oh for if your wife or permit that\nYes I don't know how much longer we're going to have the ... or but yes that's going to be the one that is going to spend the most dynamic for sure\nSo as you in this case there may be an advantage in talking with an independent agent\nOkay or you know some people really don't do any more but there are agents that are like free agents and they quote various insurance companies\nAnd they'd been there done that for a long time most of them are older because a lot of young people I have no interest in becoming\nAn insurance agent and they're very experience and can tell you based on how rates are set in your state and situations they've done with new drivers with teenagers what's gonna be the thing that will get you the best overall total premium okay great\nSometimes depending on the state and how rates tend to be set in the state it may be a advantageous to have\nYour son is the owner of that vehicle over here and be on a separate policy and then in other places it may be better for him to only be named an additional driver with no specific vehicle assigned to him\nPerfect that's where the independent agent become so valuable because they know\nHow best to quote it and they can quote from many different companies\nThere are some what are known as direct writer companies the ones that you probably see pretty heavily advertised on TV they will not commission and independent agent and so the agent will not be able to quote those but they'll have enough\nDifferent companies they can quote to you that they'll be able to guide you best\nPerfect perfect yeah we've got some phone number is already from friends later on down that path and it seems like it'd be very helpful to have some of these specific a self us\nThen you've got to make sure they're not what's called a captive agent for example State Farm and all state the agents that right for them or what are known as captives they only write for those companies and independent agent is not assigned to a specific company and they can quote many different ones\nGreat so independent nature okay\nYou're listening to the Clark Howard show\n[noise]", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Mike Slater Show", "city": "Greenfield", "day": "27"}
