it costs to to live in one year\nAnd once you hit that target whether it's in your thirties forties fifties sixties or never that's when you know you have enough money built up for the lifestyle you've grown accustomed to that you can afford to live in definitely\nOn the money you say and it I Know that's an oversimplification but it really is that simple as soon as he went on to say the power that you need at least five or six million really you might need ten million dollars\nTo retire securely and respectfully I strongly disagree with what Susan said there are people who easily\nCan get by for the rest of their lives when they hit the point they've saved a million dollars it means they're living a\nNot a a barebones lifestyle but they're living more careful frugal lifestyle\nBecause what you want to see one enough money saved that you have invested that you can throw off enough cash to live on each year and at the same time have the piled a stash you built up\nHave enough in it that you can earn enough on it in the years following to cover the cost of inflation\nBut let's go to a core principle\nIf somebody is a Mac saver\nOr today a proponent of the FIRE movement and they save like a maniac and they get to a point\nYou know let's say in their mid thirties that they've saved enough money that they've created real financial security it doesn't mean they don't ever work again it means they only do what they enjoy\nYou know I retired at thirty one and here I Am working now talking to you at sixty three\nAnd since I was thirty one I've only worked when I wanted to and doing what I enjoy because I had that financial security when I was thirty one\nSo don't let somebody tells you oh you're never going to be able to retire 'til you have twenty million dollars [laughter]\n[laughter] oh boy anyway you know that you have to have a goal you have to have a target you have to be realistic about it and you have to live your life in a way that you will accomplish that you know one of the things when a years ago\nMy book living large and lean times came out and then the companion book that came out later living large for the long haul is I learned so much from people\nWho had adjusted their lives to live a more frugal life and to be in a position where they weren't living on borrowed money where they were always saving money and I was

service been listening for years and I love your program in which he is a community\n[noise] ah three children I'm moving from a home schooling environment to a an an elevated home schooling ah environment where they're now needing access to mobile laptop so I Know you're a huge fan of the chrome look\nA done some research that red great things about them\nI just don't know how well they will perform and if they are designed for um a more traditional setting where I'm going to be using excel power point spreadsheets things of that nature\nUm onto the additives that you have\nTo be a connected to the Internet on the chrome book and I just wanted to get your opinion on that\nRight so schools have been adopting the chrome book is their computer of choice in massive numbers in the ... now completely dominates the educational environment there are still a particularly in the private school environment where\nThey're using Mac books but overall the chrome book dominates not totally but gosh it's moving that direction and Google\nHas a suite of programs that are similar many of them in nature to the Microsoft sweet you were referring to\nAnd for the educational environment those are generally free and they can be used not just on a chrome book at home they may use on any computer anywhere even if it's not a crime but so\nThat's why the schools have been adopting if they don't have to I have a an IT department or anything like that since everything on them is Web based and you're right that to make a crumbled useful you have to have an Internet connection for most everything you would do on it\nSo it it would be a good question for you to ask going from a home school environment to one that is a more in a traditional classroom to find out if the school they're going to be attending is a crime book school\n[noise] okay that's a perfect point Clark or to follow that quick like um tell me about\nThe call looks ability to function in a disconnected state meaning stand alone or not having a access\nTo the Internet by yes okay they used to be a complete door stop that if you didn't have Internet it was basically a worthless piece of furniture taking up space when it didn't have Internet connection\nNow there are a handful of functions you can do off line that then once you go on line they the items are then stored in the cloud\nAnd that's why a number of chrome books now have more storage on them but if someone has intermittent or rare Internet access or chrome book is not going to make it particularly happy\nOkay All right well thank you for the price\nAnd the good news with the windows computers is they've suffered so much\nBy comparison the chrome books that windows computers that are nicely featured are widely available at a hundred and fifty dollars and up now which is a big change from where windows pricing used to be\nGary's with us on the Clark Howard show hello Garry\nClark how are you great thank you

and being a rancher I've had all my ah ... covered\nAh when I was accurate weight and it's because of the uh the rental companies do that for you the insurance companies\nSo the renters insurance
