Bush\nAnd boom you know\nBut suddenly and the two thousand election the exit polls were off\nAnd they were off substantially uh not everywhere they were only often six or seven states but they were off substantially and by the two thousand four election exit polls are showing discrepancy is as much as five points\nNow why would that be\nWell for years a lot of us thought it was because the electronic voting machines were were\nYou know lying to us\nAnd certainly there's problems with the electronic voting machines but it looks like the electronic voting machines are actually probably relatively accurate\nObviously you know there's a big problem in Georgia I'd I'd say the two thousand ah two or two thousand four election was ... was literally flipped upside down by voting machines in Georgia but that's the ... you know those kind of incidences of fraud but really what it was was that people\nHad been thrown off the voting rolls didn't realize that they were given a provisional ballots as a result of the two thousand to help America vote act which invented this thing called provisional ballots and they thought they had voted\nWhen in fact their vote was never counted\nAnd so you saw you know states like Florida where the exit polls clearly said Al Gore won in Florida State wide\nSomehow it was fifty fifty well turns out\nJeb Bush and Katherine Harris through between Fifteen Ninety thousand African Americans off the voting rules where there's this massive so called felon purge using George W. Bush is following list from Texas\nGeorge W Bush's brother Jeb Bush in Florida took that fell in Texas felon list and compared it would be voter registration rolls and Florida and found fifty thousand people who had similar names\nSame first and last name not you know forget about the middle initial forget about the date of birth just similar names\nAnd [noise] you know most of the felons in Texas are black and there's very common black there so it success\nWith little help from the Supreme Court voter suppression along the White House for the Republican Party in two thousand and they've been doing it ever since the days went\nFrom just a couple of states from just this past in Florida and that and the and the other tests will the media notice I mean the ACLU sued meaning seated a report

I'll take my comment you you could uh\nYou can go to the next call but I I just think that Democrats the to argue\nThat the Republicans are not there were about to finding the constitution only for themselves and not for any one else\nOh absolutely originalism is a disease that has only practice a psychological disease that is only practice by Republican judges\nIt's literally in a ... a Republican thing this is in in Seventeen Ninety five Thomas wrote a paper called dissertation on first principles of government bread thanks for the call dissertation on first principles of government and he wrote and I quote\nThe rights of voting for representatives is the primary right by which all other rights are protected to take away this right\nTo vote is to reduce Amanda slavery for slavery consistent being subject to the will of another and have that has not a vote in the election of representatives\nIs in this case\nIt effectively in slavery\nAnd that's you know yeah that's where we're at John in Minneapolis say John what's up\nYeah I just wanted to say that voter suppression in disenfranchisement is so bad\nThat even the United nations will not monitor our elections so this is\nA they cannot monitor our elections they've they've tried to monitor our elections in two thousand and two thousand four and ... and the Republican state so that they wanted a monitor which were the ones where most of the stuff was going on refused to allow them\nRight and also at this point they just we we don't even meet the minimum requirements that they would uh have have have us be at a to B worth their while apparently\nHonorable paper ballots yes\nYeah [noise] uh for the governor so by the way John\n... it's an ... absolutely astounding problem that needs to be taken care of like you know it should have been taken care of long time ago but\nI mean that's that's the call for action in my article is that the number one our number one thing has to do to stop this this yeah this is now they're single technique for winning elections\nAnd and and that they have succeeded in essentially a you know stealing democracy from everyone and making themselves the single party that's ruling\nThe rest of us this is not what you know\nPeople want single payer they want a you know a free education they want minimum wage to be relatively high they want all these things but they're not getting them because you know we were not there is no voice or to represent them in achieving those things so\nIt's a problem for everyone but particularly obviously minority groups who are ... are you know hardly disenfranchised one point four million people in Florida alone or disenfranchised because they were felons as far as I'm concerned\nIf you served the time you're done you've served your dad you should\nNot be a second class citizen that's just not a you know that's Jim Crow is just Jim Crow and and the most of the felons unfortunately are are you know they're targeted for them the most ridiculous reasons are smoking marijuana or whatever it is and then for the rest of us\nAre are you know they're targeted for them the most ridiculous reasons are smoking marijuana or whatever it is and then for the rest of her life they they cannot vote\nFor it and then and there are disproportionately black and bad yeah I Believe it's only five states than is still have that as a as a forever thing ... courses at the top of that list you know and I also wanted\nTo say I mean you touched on this already a deep structural fear in psychiatry is talking about that and I think that this has been proposed by many people including a\nBishop of the Orthodox Church in Canada who said that uh you know these people are so afraid that they're willing to overthrow their own morality um and uh you know just vote for you know their own interest on the basis of that fear\nThey are overcome with fear and uh it could be\nThat their brain damaged and I know that sounds pretty outrageous but I think it's an interesting idea for\nBicycling I think they are brain damaged by the fear\nYeah you know constant quarters all does you know the stress hormone does change physiology as well as psychology and then it becomes a you know there's this vicious feedback loop and Trump is selling fear and the Republican Party has only if they're constantly John excellent points all ... in

American Legislative Exchange Council a yeah\nIn fact the center for media and democracy wrote a report detailing the plagiarism alec exposed Wisconsin the hijacking of a state and since then that was twenty twelve that they said he's Nineteen times\nHis right to work bill and twenty fifth in another ... like what would be a legislation I mean you know it's just over and over and over again they're just plagiarize in from the billionaires\nSo do you think it's possible\nThat some Roger Stone type character went down to Honduras and said hey let's organize a caravan to go up to the United states to give Donald Trump something that he can yell and scream about and that that will scare the bejesus out of Fox News or white guys who watch Fox News\nAnd if so how do we find out\nLaura in Chicago and Laura what's on your mind to it\n[noise] yeah hey I'm really a lecture integrity community and not in the U.S\nWe totally Arab posts lose voter ID laws and the and the voter suppression there's no question about that yeah and one of the things that what we want it to we do want to expand the conversation because um that's the trick is in Harvey lost men claimed it perfectly\nThey wrote a book called the flip\nAnd the strip ... so the voter ID laws and the voter suppression then the Republicans are so little supported across the country that they have to go to great measures to keep the\nElections going in their favor\nRight to make it looks like the elections aren't going in their favor so they have to strip the voters of their voting rights that voter ID laws the voter suppression and then they have to fine tune the election fraud with the lifting\nOf the votes are on the electronic machines and also on the central tabulate ... some of them control this this you know main calculating of\nWhat we saw this ad on single moms election in Alabama or you know there was that one county where in the middle of the night the guy suddenly discovered Fifteen thousand one five comma zero zero zero or voters had voted off all straight democratic down ticket but they voted for Bob Riley the Republican at the top for governor\nAnd I think it's bad and they had an end of the day before they'd all voted for on the one but you know hey and I was just enough ... Thirteen thousand votes\nRight and we notice for\nAnd we saw in ... County Florida where they were the boat into the ... the vote for Al Gore actually went backwards as the vote as people voted throughout the day the number of ... the number of votes what they were reporting in real time actually went backwards\nSee that actually more often than it is and now that has announced on the news fear it I'm sure so it's the strip\nAnd the slip blunt instrument of the strip and the ... now some of the solutions okay in some states you can re register\nThat that deadline has arrived yet you can re register is a lot of the voter purge has happened um farther away from the election or the sixty days out Ninety Days out\nAnd so we encourage everybody to go online and check your voter registration and then re register in some states like Illinois we haven't seen that five hundred and fifty thousand a voters\nA purge in Illinois\nBecause the county election divisions actually get to decide who is purged from their roles and there was an outcry and not to cross check list so we haven't quite seen the full five hundred and fifty thousand people getting\nA purge but in Illinois we're liberal\nSo we haven't quite seen the full five hundred and fifty thousand people getting\nA purge but in Illinois we're liberal voting state meaning you register to vote and vote on the same day during early voting and on election day you bring to pieces of ID and one to prove who you are one prove where do you live and you can register to vote and vote\nThat's a good lawyer up because Greg palace right now on his website as all five hundred and fifty thousand names in Illinois or purge you're going on your name your first and last name and and your ZIP Code I think it is and boom it it'll pop right up if you've been purged he's got the whole list or regret ballast dot com\nBut we can overcome it in Illinois and in some states everybody needs to know their own state laws they need to know their county election officials\n[laughter] yeah yeah and this is really a big meal and and I think this is probably out of the screen provisional ballots to those two when when the law was passed a really to the other three when I started writing commentary and and this is a big deal and if you get a ...\nHour offered him about white as white hell because in all probability Ninety nine percent of them will be outed Flora thank you for the call we'll be right and\nYou're listening to the Tom Hartmann program called too old to ...\nNinety nine twenty so voter suppression of cancer at the heart of Australian democracy or ... quarter we do about all this stuff [noise]\n[noise]\nThe big question is this how our strategic investors like you who are paying attention and well informed without foresight to know that the markets real estate and the dollar all or risk how do you protect your wealth\nIn a way that furthers your independence from volatility identifies opportunities far safer than the u._s. dollar and goes beyond sustaining your lifestyle and Saturday delivery and for the future\nMore importantly how can you accomplish these goals even through a complete financial collapse that is the question I my ... not only give you the answer but health care bill the plan if you're a strategic investor looking to secure your assets an edge against the most volatile markets since two thousand eight\nCall my friends that I Am trading at one triple late own goals asked them for their free goal investment guide and joined the top one percent\nOr accumulating very specific types dates and qualities\nOf physical gold and silver one triple aid own goal that won an eight eight eight O W n\nG O L D ... or does one thing they do a better than anyone they create a hundred percent custom window treatments bill ... measurements about every little detail blinds ... more than just the blinds are a lot of big\nYou're welcome to the area and that is true of most of the states in the union but the the old south you know particularly Florida if if you've done time you'll never again vote and Jan speaking of Florida in Boynton Beach Florida age and what's up\n[noise] Hi I'm\n... I'm my primary concern is the fact that Rick Scott when he came into office change the three here waiting period for um felons\nTo five years and it only took four votes in order for that to become the legislation so if we're going to elect\nA governor who did this right after he became the governor for no apparent reason what is he going to do as a senator\nOr ... cause not to vote for him yeah among you know take these things into consideration\nYeah a lot along with the fact that uh he made a hundred in fact ... we've got that Rick Scott ad we need to to that thing up and and play it I don't know how quickly ...\nYou could you'll be able to pull it up but there's there's a there's a a a new anti Rick Scott ad out that is just absolutely amazing here here it is when they play it for you engine\nScott get rich Rick Scott get rich you mitigate repeat automatic here Scott Moran I held yeah we know that Dr ... dollars for a lot of little girls got got three hundred million dollars since he was forced out the door there we go over leaving Renee would you restarted\nAt at that volume level because I don't think people can hear it a\nHere with rooted Rick Scott getting rich answer ripping off Medicare as a CEO Scott ran a healthcare\nI'm quite an error throated Rick Scott getting rich answer ripping off medical care as a CEO Scott ran a health care company that was fine one point seven billion dollars for Medicare fraud that's got got three hundred million dollars since he was forced out the door as Governor Scott got even richer making five hundred and fifty\nMillion dollars on one transaction hidden from the votes everywhere he's gone Rick Scott has stuffed in his own bug Rick Scott you just can't trust him\nAs a as a Bill Nelson add so Jan is that a is that ad making you know have you seen that on the air and Florida is it is it out there or is it just or something I picked off the Internet\nAll the absolutely it has so much money that he can take their ways at any time that he wants ... concern is that if we can if it takes for people in our state to vote 'em to allow people not to get their voters who writes\nAnd that hasn't been re instituted and that we need to repeal the Eighteen eighty six or whatever it was\nOf felons having their voters right removed right and there's no reason we need to start saying why should you lose your voters right than ever yeah if you if you go to jail and you're you're paying the time for the crime that doesn't have anything to do with your voters' rights yeah\nYeah absolutely Jen thank you for the call thanks for reminding me of the weight and we've been we've been sitting on this ad since last friday I many Thursday even I intended to play it and then and just you know things happened and then we are busy and uh you know I space to Scott in Portland, Oregon listening X. ray FM Hey Scott what's up\nDates from thanks um I just wanted to put it out here in Oregon a vote by mail\nYeah I voted on it might I voted on Saturday yeah\nAnd if you don't even I don't even know if we should call vote by mail because I've had people say oh I don't want to put it in the stance on it you don't have to there's all kinds of places that you can drop most libraries um there's even look you know the Hollywood district\nHere in Portland there's a drive through a window at the mc Donald's but housing official well lemme county ballot box\nUpdated if pretty busy\nBut the other thing is that we we still get them scammed by a machine so one thing that I felt was could they put like a ... a soup of some kind of a number or you know one of these things tag each boat ... and then posted it online so you can look up your ballot and see how it was cast\nThere are proposals to do that using block chain technology right and am which makes him call him a lot of sense\nAnd you know of course the banks are starting to use ... technology now and and uh not for currency but for transactions and uh you know and I and I'm not an advocate of of block chain money you know of bitcoin and that kind of thing\nBut um but the technology is is extremely secure at least so far but you know frankly I think a much simpler solution Scott is for a Oregon and Washington state the two states that do exclusively vote by mail\nAnd basically any other state that scans paper ballots\nTo stop buying scanners from voting machine vendors who are sketchy and in many cases partisan\nAnd instead by scanners that are that are running open source software and my first of all they don't even by the scanners they lease them so they're actually still only our our boat as being ... by a private company\nSo instead of leasing these things by them\nBy them and and and have open source software running down\nAnd have technicians who are employees of the state you know people who are going to make this their career they're going to work Thirty years and get a pension and retire right\nPeople who are who are do not have a political agenda and have them do the maintenance of the machines and at that point I Would be very very reassured I I'd I don't think that we would need to worry\nIf if we did something like that and if we must have voting machines we should do the same thing they should be they should be built from the states that should be open source software that anybody can see and the process should be entirely transparent of course right now we've got black box machines\nOr less a black box voting law uh what's her name is Beverley Harris says\nAbout Harris's Web site so you just got what you think yeah I think that would be very good and also by the end of life for eight hours of law a lot of people can just can you\nGive them a satellite radar they have to work and so and that's you know that's why you saw it you know a lot of the sixteen percent cut in ah in in black voter participation after South Carolina\nGovernor ...

oh yeah absolutely hear that and they gave him two billion dollars worth of coverage during the election yellow I Need them along to other callers but thank you for the call and thanks for listening to us there and they can tune in\nA I appreciate it I'm a good talking to the tune in stream as is getting all over the world now it's also on Alexa and uh all these other devices that uh you can you know just say listen to Tom Hartmann and boom there it is Julie in Austin, Texas Hi Julie what's on your mind\n[noise] [noise] Hi I'm I'm just calling to express that concern I Know you talked about\nIn recommend that people don't do provisional ballots are in here in Texas um a lot of you know especially probably Democrats encourage voter registration and there was a big push right at the end it's a lot of people\nAre registered late and what they're seeing on the news right now I'm In the state of Texas you cannot register online it's all paper so most of those late registration um things are not ready to go for people to vote in early voting started they are and what they're telling people to do is go ahead and\nEarly but fill out a provisional ballot\nWell if you do that and what you have to do is within a day or two of the election of first of all if\nThe elections are not even close than they don't even open the provisional ballots when John Kerry ah a\nQuote lost or who was a conceded Ohio back in two thousand four\nAh he had lost Ohio by you know I'm doing this from memory in my numbers might be wrong but but I think it's in this neighborhood uh my recollection is he lost Ohio by like a hundred and thirty four thousand votes and there were over a hundred and sixty thousand provisional ballots that had been out it and those are probably almost all from black neighborhoods in you know where the voter purges ... been going on in two thousand\nFour in in Ohio and um so you know they don't even bother to count on once the election's over\nBut if you do want to hear provisional ballot to be caught and you have to end it varies from state to state but I'm pretty sure that this was also the policy in Texas you have to go to your local election office\nOr to the secretary of state's office with your ID and and if you have any sort of a receipt that you actually registered to vote and then prove that you are who you say you are and they were illegally registered and had it may be that even that won't be enough because your name won't be on the voting rolls yet because they haven't quote process them\nThey're doing the same thing in North Carolina there right there taking time to process and George ... and you know this is why ... got fifty seven thousand votes out of ... new voters on hold in Georgia\nWe just don't have the time to check these people hours you know right it's a scam it's a scam but yeah I mean we bought a provisional ballot if there's no other way to vote and then if nothing else the number of provisional ballots will give us a clue as to how extensive the voter suppression was the voter the election fraud was being done by the Republicans\nI'm a but it's a very unfortunate situation that in America we've got a political party committed to preventing people from voting a you know it is it's obscene it's just absolutely site\nJulie thank you aligned goal and and good luck there in Texas that's it's a Andy in River Falls Wisconsin Andy what's up\n[noise] how're you doing John good when you're buying a good idea for this ah for voter the voter purging and I thought I had a if people register as Republican [laughter]\nWell yeah but the problem is there's a I you know I get it and and Trevor Noah ... did the skin about this last week as a as essentially as a joke on the Daily Show oh\nAnd and uh you know on the surface of sounds good but here's how they do it in among white people because white people in this country come from a whole bunch of different countries that have different language groups you know you've got people from the Balkans you've got people from Russia or you've got people from France you got people from Germany\nAnd you got people from Greece they all and all these different languages produce all kinds of different last names so there's an incredible\nDiversity in last names among white people on the other hand most African Americans and Hispanics and Asians come from a fairly small pool of names now it's not obviously not all\nBut there are probably thirty or forty for example here last name as Washington odds are or eighty percent you're African American and and so there there's the small relatively you know if you take the top forty\nNames of the most common names among black people\nAre among Hispanics and among Asians and among Asians aside even forty I mean you know it's it's it's like maybe twenty or thirty\nI'm a ... you take those top names and you account for probably about three quarters of all the motors in those among those three three racial groups and so if you if you want to purge people are voting lists\nAll you have to do is say we're looking for people who are people who have registered twice who are phoney baloney voters they registered twice and so you've got you know age a an Albert Washington a in a registered in Georgia but there's also you know and Albert John Washington and there's also an Albert Richard\nWashington but we're only going to do the purge based on first and last name so we're going to take out all the Albert Washington's and and ... and that's how these voter purges work\nUm or you do it the way then Jeb Bush did with George Bush George Bush gave him the\nFlorida or the Texas felon less than a apply that to the Florida voter list and of course most of the Texas pythons are black and so you know again I knocked off mostly black people in Florida so no matter what you register as you end up you know ... is\nStill end up being purge based on race and this is why you know if if we did not have Republican appointees on the U.S Supreme Court this would have been declared illegal forever ago I think as a teenager and a racial voting you know election fraud voting suppression so\nBut anyway you know you if you get points for for for trying to think that's a good idea but uh but it won't work anti thanks a lot for the call what she can't vote in primary most states\nYou're
