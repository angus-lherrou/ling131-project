whatnot and I'm not sure exactly what effect it had on the tissues but they treated them with mercury they would get you know they'd run mercury all over the course they get mercury all over their hands and you can observe mercury through your skin\nAnd they became crazy\nThey became I mean like a psychotic crazy\nAnd this was the result of the mercury poisoning so you know we as a as a country as a people we said enough already the the number one source of mercury in our environment\nIs coal fired power plants\nCall has a lot of mercury\nAmong other things I really am and cadmium and and uh you know even a uranium\nExcuse me the waste from coal fired power plants has also radioactive very mildly but so it but it is so\nThese are not clean power sources but the Trump Administration loves

barons\nAnd so the mercury and air toxic standard is called maps and may TS Mercury air toxic standards\nWhich has been a long standing feature of the environmental protection agency which basically says that\nIf the cost of pollution\nIn this case with mercury\nIs greater than the benefit from that pollution\nThat is to say the electricity created\nThen you don't do the pollution\nAs we're getting a better a as the cost of electricity gets cheaper and cheaper from non coal sources right now the ... the main one is that the main competition is natural gas but you've also got solar and wind that are exploding\nAnd on the on the one side on the on the benefit side of the equation and on the cost side of the equation as we're learning more and more about how destructive mercury is and how in many cases permanently destructive mercury is\nYou know we don't even use mercury for felons and teeth by and large anymore\nWe're we're avoiding mercury like the plague\nAnd that's that's a ethyl mercury not matter that's metallic mercury methyl mercury which has been biological process which is the kind of mercury you find in coal which is a many times more poisons\nAs we're as we're getting here the Trump Administration is planning to roll back that go to those matts standards as mercury standards\nSo that coal fired power plants can produce you know all the mercury they want\nNo

dramatic\nAntics that for the first time would require\nThat workers in Mexico the secret ballot elections on their union contracts right now\nThere's like a there's like a whole rackets were these companies basically get paid by the boss to register a union they are themselves you know written down as a union but it's a business and the constitution and Mexico requires a union to be registered and so these guys come in before the first workers higher than the plants being bill they\nThey negotiate I contracted they register it and the ... the the workers come in to a brand new fancy

never voted for any of that crap so there's ... mix\nThat would get rid of that requires all those fake protection unions must be replaced for years and that Mexico must provide secret ballot elections for contracts going forward now that could actually be made sufficiently enforceable\nThat can make a big difference for people's lives in Mexico and that would help stop drag of Mexico's very low wages Tom Mexico's wages now\nI'm forty percent manufacturing wages are forty percent below coastal China they're down in real terms NAFTA will so this is the only reason I don't say you know how the hell with it\nIs because this guy Bob ... has made some real changes on some real important things and if they can follow through and actually make those labor changes enforce it all\nAnd the

Gerry what's up\nA town well uh I have a point to make and then I have a couple of ah just suggestions um we keep talking past each other and they were not getting through and we're not we are not convincing anyone but I'd like to make this point\nDr Ford has already passed a polygraph in and another woman has agreed to it judge Kevin huh uh I heard in the media has written a legal paper supporting the use of of the a polygraph\nA and he said he wants to prove his innocence and clear his name and that he will do anything in that regard\nNo no he said he would do anything the Republicans on the committee asked him to do and we certainly\nHearing but I Believe he said in other instances all he wants to do is clear his name he said that on Fox yeah okay [laughter] I Know ... uh\nHe uh we know that a a a polygraph there's not a admissible in court\nBut we're not conducting a court hearing we're trying to use tools to get to the truth and I'd like to point out that many job applicants were for mundane jobs like retail or a police officer or a even a national security officers are subjected to\nPolygraphs and drug tests even you know and if they don't want to take them they don't get the job so\nYou know ... ... C I F the FBI and I would\nLike to ... I Would like to see if the if the Democrats are true about this I think the only way to get past this impasse is to really push Kavanaugh on taking a polygraph since and and I would I Would suggest that in the media and newspapers radio TV\nThey show the his paper in and point out his own words in terms of supportive of polygraph and then and then to demand that he\nBe willing to subject to that and and one more point I N dismissing Dr Ford refer people he met a members on the way say well she's confused in you know this and that and the other thing well I Would ask people out here to to get them to try and uh that relate to her memory\nDo people that are old enough to remember JFK's assassination of course they do\nNow is clearly that's all very heavily emotionally charged events particularly where you'd say life is a danger I I still have a memory and a car accident or that I was in you know where I went flying through the car I was actually a a van and the guy wind van and I was flying out of the driver's seat into the back of the van or with the dog how about how nine eleven years ago\nSold these if if we have those memories imagine the memory and the intel ability on the memory of of someone like Dr Ford\nYeah no I absolutely I I I absolutely agree a her narrow science is correct B I wrote a book about it and it's called walk in your blues away about dealing with traumatic memories and and you know in the hopes that that you know maybe we're going to help all of us he'll ourselves\nAnd and the and and he's at and and and it's also entirely possible I mean two things can sometimes they write\nThat he was so drunk and the mark judge was so drunk that neither of them remember it although that's not his argument his argument is not I don't remember his argument is is absolutely didn't happen and that as in my opinion no credibility Jerry spot on thanks a lot for the call Joan in Chicago and John what's up\nYes I'm calling because I'm I'm concerned about the you know I was having a fair investigation I read that the FBI his already I maybe you can confirm that the Afghans already I'm finished up the interview portion of their investigation and I just recently read that the guardian\nWashington DC shut that I'm surprised surprise um coincidence the FBI Director Chris Wray graduated from Yale undergrad and Gail law school both or top students and re was just a couple of years behind him and they both had a we're in a circle with Alex\nAzar or I don't know how to pronounce his name with the health and Human Services we're going to see what you know\nWe're just wondering maybe the FBI directorship record Hughes themselves from this because he was and it directly after a Trump\nI don't think we're going to the same school is is going to qualify I'm I'm far more concerned with\nThe fact that the FBI has been constrained in what they can look at black white by Don McGahn on behalf of Donald Trump and then Donald Trump goes on television lie about it that's what they all\nWorked for Bush together I mean this is my though yeah in the same legal circles where they were in the same I'm not saying that they're involved in the drinking or anything like that and I'm saying that this is the fix could be and and I think to get rid of any kind of question about that we should um because\nAh to get a get out of jail free if uh you know\nWell that's a that's his whole point and and and that's why the gamble decision is moving its way into the Supreme Court right now I'm waiting for cap it ought to be on the bench this was the decision that will say that if Trump parties somebody said\nProsecutors may now go after them with our partners absolute and ah you know we'll see where those Jones economical\nYou're listening to
