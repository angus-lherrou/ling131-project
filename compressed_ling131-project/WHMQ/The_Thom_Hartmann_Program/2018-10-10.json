seen the result firsthand my wife Louise who like so many has had her share of die of frustration\nI'm Hi good morning and I just had a um thought to be able to say to counteract a Trump lies that anybody who's on Twitter at they replied to a um a lifesaver for when he kept saying they're Seventeen Democrats and the Mueller investigation team\nPeople start tweeting back and asking on who can he name leader named these people and they can't ...\nI didn't think you could it must be a lie and then just keep feeding it backed him turn the lights back on\nIt was a Jennifer there was a really interesting study that was published in one of the psychology journals last week I mentioned it on the show but it was like one little you know one minute mentioned out of a three hour show and ah he really needs more amplification\nAnd that was that when people are asked what is your most reliable most believed to source of news yeah only forty percent of people say\nThe news right television radio newspapers Seventy percent or if it was above that I had my recollection Seventy two percent but it might be wrong but it was within a point or two Seventy percent said friends and family\nMhm so ... whether we realize it or not\nWe are the principal and most credible news source\nFor a lot of people in our lives and this is how people get their news via Facebook they followed friends on Facebook and and they get their news there\nThat this is how people get their news from just conversation from you know the the meeting in the diner or you know clubs and civic organizations whatever it may be\nSo all of us now and are you to Jennifer all of us now have the opportunity knowing that we can be the most credible source of news for our friends and neighbors to because of that and I\nHave you with that too and but I also said to have that immediate dialogue if you can with the president because the press certainly can't ... aren't pressing um where are you getting this information who is your source and the and then just to prove it it's not a lie right at that moment so it just doesn't hang out there anymore\nYeah I agree with you I agree with you Jennifer thank you for the call a well said lonely and cotton wood California hey lowly what's up\nWell hi thank you so much for taking my call [noise] hey I'm I wanted to kind of talk about the what I see the agenda of the Republicans in terms of a kind of getting rid of the social safety net ...\nIt seems to me that they want to basically\nDestroy a financial uh sources that ah you know pay for a Medicare Social security um\nAll of that yeah this is why they're jacking up the national interests and so\nSo that's that was the purpose behind a you know getting rid of the um uh you know that the tax cuts\nAnd giving it to the rich or it has been from the get go when one was that\nThe present and so you know\nTrump is saying right now is that the Democrats are going to get rid of\n'em you know Social Security and Medicare and all of that well that's a set up that's looking that's looking down\nThe road after they depleted all of these sources where you know that's their agenda of getting the Democrats back in and then forcing them to make cuts down because they you know their sources are depleted a of I'm supporting Medicare and\n... and they have done this before by the way ... proposed is in the Nineteen seventies and the wall Street Journal and an article about the to Santa Claus theory Reagan put it in place when Reagan came into into office there we didn't even have a one billion dollar deficit it was eight hundred million to eight hundred billion dollars\nHe tree almost tripled that I took it to over two trillion dollars\nAnd ... and then George Herbert Walker Bush shattering another trillion dollars to the first Gulf War by the time when Bush left in Ninety two when Bill Clinton came in as soon as Clinton hit the ground as soon as he was sworn in\nThe Republicans are started screaming we can't afford the social safety net stuff and sure enough Bill Clinton said okay we're going to end welfare as we know it and this was and and it was all done I in fact Bill Clinton did\nFor balanced budgets and that didn't satisfy the Republicans I you know you're going to have ... ...\nYou know and and this is their strategy when Republicans are office Raleigh massive debt and then when Democrats get control yell and scream and force the Democrats to shoot their on Santa Claus to shoot the those social programs that people love that the Democrats put into place so we'll have nailed it you know they held it\nYeah and and and then they also scream physical responsibility when the when the Democrats are in\nYeah fiscal responsibility but yes yeah absolute but it it\nDoesn't you know that doesn't count when they're in\nYour ear actually it does I mean this is very well planned this is those totally this is ... like I said\nAnd I I don't know I don't know how we can get that message out that this is their plan but I mean people need to read this they need to see the bigger picture of what their agenda is so they can make sense because if people just see little bits and pieces of this they don't understand what's going on\nAnd you know it it just drives me crazy I just want to get the message out about their you know the big picture of their agenda so people understand that\nYeah I I uh you know I absolutely agree with you and you know FDR warned us about this I mean you know this is exactly what Trump is doing um you know FDR warned us about this years ago and uh it's\nA you know I'm I'm starting to more they're here I'm just so uh so uh infuriated\nBy the I Know I I get there too so but anyway the point that I wanted to me so I appreciate you listening\nOkay thank you very much a great book than just saying let me get my call screen here we go thank you very much like good to hear from you this is a FDR can you can play audio out of my computer here Shaun okay this is a FDR talking about this very thing\nLet me let me let me walk on the nation against me for a bank\nThat sense of loss we believe these things we believe in Social Security we believe in and work for the unemployed we believe in saving ...\nSome time\n[noise]\nBut the first amendment spring is doing my job is um [noise]\nWere doing them we gave him\nAnd he's been doing all of them will not\nCost any body and it [noise]\nAbout telling me that that is not exactly what Donald Trump in his tail level when he was campaigning health care for all
