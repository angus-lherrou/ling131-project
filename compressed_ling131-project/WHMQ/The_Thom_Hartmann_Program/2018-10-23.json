had a\nBut I didn't know anything about him beyond that when I first met him we were teaching a seminar together in as I recall Amsterdam\nFor a company that did consulting work for travel for the travel industry I owned a travel agency in Atlanta at the time and I was I I did a lot of consulting work and a lot of training work all around the world on behalf of this company and also for some of the cruise lines and the airlines and whatnot\nAnd Arman was a he did the same thing he was a travel consultant an international travel consultant who you know was teaching these workshops with me for travel agents and and and people in the industry\nAnd we did this together for\nTwo or three years\nLike eighty four to eighty six or thereabouts\nAnd then I moved to Germany you know we sold at the Louis I sold a travel agency and we moved to Germany with our kids for a year and when we came back I had kind of lost touch with our money\nAnd we moved to Portland\nAnd Arman called me up one day I hadn't heard from many years and he said Tom I've written a book and I'd like you to look at it over\nAnd I was like sure\nAnd so we got together he gave me that when he gave me the manuscript for the book was you know two inches thick\nAnd he said um\nI don't think I've ever told you this\nBut on the last day that Adolf Hitler was alive\nThere was a sixteen year old career\nWho brought him in the news that the war was lost\nAnd after that courier delivered that news to Hitler in person\nHitler turned around and walked into his private quarters with Eva brown\nAnd that's sixteen year old

like them I mean we've got to know each other really well\nOutside of that little part of his life and I don't know why he always felt like he had to you know keep it from me and from everybody I mean when he first came with the manuscript it was like he was just horribly embarrassed\nAnd he and I talked about this on a number of occasions after that you know how did this happen and he was like why do I was a kid\nRight I was part of the Hitler Youth\nAnd in the last year or the war you Hitler said anybody over fourteen becomes a soldier and so boom I was suddenly a soldier and because I was

was up to you know I was really helping them or not hoping but you know the the idea that there was a Republican down there helping organize was that that was a big deal But Kevin thanks a lot for the call and for the information gym in Sacramento and Jim what's up\nYeah I I reviewed that a documentary about eugenics and of course that was focusing in on problems in the Nineteen hundred see early Nineteen hundreds prior to a Second World war\nYeah and it was actually really that he had taken the Nineteen twenties in the United states\nYeah at his peak there but it started a Nineteen oh four so yeah and you know I just kind of got the supporters when the uh actual scientific\nA harbors years of that theory just proved it in thirty two they still campaign with that and got success in traction and had in that report they were talking about uh sterilization so that was successful\nAnd if you overlay that map the only exceptions today for the red states who's California Oregon and Connecticut those are now blue but everything else is intact so what I'm saying is that the root cause that eugenics fat on\nWas that they were saying it would cure almost anything unemployment a a sexual or promiscuity or the Temperance movement everything had some benefit\nBy practicing eugenics around the science\nWhen if I if I may jump Randall or don't know what we're talking about eugenics was the pseudo science that that was rolled out in the in the first couple of years of the twentieth century\nOr by a British scientist I'm forgetting his name I got picked up in a big way in the United states or even Woodrow Wilson essentially endorsed that states started sterilizing mentally retarded people and African Americans and Indians\nNative Americans um like there was no tomorrow I mean tens of thousands in some states or or a period of years and then in the Nineteen thirties it lost its luster here in the United states but Hitler picked up the American eugenics posters and PR campaigns\nAre from the Nineteen twenties and use those in the early Nineteen thirties and the British ones as well and said see here you know America and England or on this uh you know we have to purify the German race to back to you\nJim the appeal to the American people was on the basic bread and butter problems in other words if you had employment or you had a unproductive workers are and you practice this eugenics\nYou had employment or you had a unproductive workers are and you practice this eugenics are you getting them out of the way the it'd be more judge for everyone else right and they also we categories of foreigners coming in immigrants\nAs failing IQ tests and therefore they should be sterilized right now you said in your presentation that it all kind of petered out at Second World war but the sterilization laws carry forward and they had their advocates\nOh I'm In the Nineteen sixties as I recall in states\nLike California and Connecticut and every place yeah so what I'm saying is it still why why would such a cocker maybe scientifically falls a theory carry such show weighed in Americana and it's because it's\nBogus benefits appeal to everyone now here were\nOut there doing it again\nNow for example one of the IQ things on all the schools was done in two thousand and eight they tested all the uh you know high schoolers at that year\nAnd they found the tops or schools which you would expect New York California stuff like that and the bottom which was Mississippi and the Arkansas now what's the range pretty serious range or Arkansas was eighty nine by cue which is on the threshold\nJim I got to ask you to get to the point because we're and had a break here and a second\nOkay what we have to do is work on appealing solving these people's problems in other words they're getting their jobs now by people that are running prisons and\nMaking people in prison guards population is more than happy to have a job yeah\nYeah the whole basis of a good point you're thank you for the whole basis of eugenics was we're going to clean up the race right we're going to purify the human race and the rationale that was uses the same on the theme is all white supremacy still use oh look at the differences between dogs there must be differences between people\nWho are genetically it makes no sense whatsoever their apples and oranges and\nYou're

we're going to have term limits man for these people all of them because I mean that was corrupt and the whole government\nHere's the problem wisely when you have it 'cause term limits is this is something the Republican Party has been pitching ... since the Nineteen fifties early or actually since Roosevelt got elected for the fourth time the Republican Party has been pitching term limits and it may have been put into place in a number of states\nAnd the results are in we now know what happens when you have term limits\nAnd what happens is that there is a permanent infrastructure that develops around every political structure no there was around every legislature\nEvery Senate you've got up a semi permanent infrastructure of lobbyists and they know how the system works they know how things get done and they don't have bills get written they know how they get introduced they know where the bodies are buried they know who has power and who doesn't and how to get it and all that kind of stuff\nAnd what happens with term limits is that the new people coming in instead of having the old people to mentor them\nA new senator doesn't no longer has a John McCain has been there for Thirty years just say here's how it works\nA young man or woman as the case may be let me show you how these things get done instead\nThey have to go to the lobbyists for their mentoring and so when you have term limits what you find is that the power of lobbyists is more than doubled it's wildly amplified and those states that have Institute of term limits are basically turned into corporate ...
