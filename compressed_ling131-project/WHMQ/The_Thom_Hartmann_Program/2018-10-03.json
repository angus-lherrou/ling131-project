street slowly despise the basic stereo so it's just for issue is uh she works for her father\nIs built so the other Scott her\nAnd my two sisters who are your your you know or which is the single issue a single issue voters is Fox News both in the abortion issue\nBut it isn't isn't a woman's right to control her own reproductive system\nOr ... or ... surrender her her uh agency her power to a to government agencies basically run by men and the laws made by men to control it\nIsn't that I'm really a subset of this whole conservative women's ideas that that you know let just let them and take care of everything I mean I think I saw this with my mother my mother was a brilliant woman I mean as you know she graduated from MSU Sigmund comb loud and she she uh type issues is very very smart\nBought or I shouldn't even say bought 'cause I'm not sure it has to do with being smart she was a product of her times I mean she was born and I think Nineteen twenty nine and and ah you know came of age during the great depression World War two\nAnd and when she married my dad she was a pilot she was flying airplanes sheen obviously drove cars she made her you know she put her work her way through the MSU as a lifeguard in the summers up in Charlotte point where she was born and grew up\nAnd um but after after I was born or maybe after my my brother Steve two years after me was born\nA she stopped driving she gave up her driver's license she basically you know didn't leave the house that much after that and uh became mental housewife just a fulltime you know she raised four boys which was a lot\nI look back and you know while uh but you know her her thing was you know Carl is going to take care of us all you know my dad and and and and that kind of world view might incline itself I mean I've never had this conversation with my mom and she's been dead for a while now\nBut um that that kind of experience in life might incline one toward a world view of well yeah and you know men or you know kind of nasty so you have to tolerate that but on the other hand uh you know the women shouldn't be speaking up whatnot you know am I making sense I don't\nThink it's pretty they've replaced a man and there was the religion in the you know what ... they go to church but I agree with you I mean there's\nJust so this is a little warm it's Meg for her so then you know it's a decision shift the you know based on her personal beliefs but what do\nYou are saying basically the bottom line of what you're saying that word is that you know for many of these women that comes out of the abortion issue I get that thank you for the call and and I think you you may well be right but I think this goes way beyond that I think that is a reflection of this Kathy in Edina, Minnesota Kathy thanks for a sexual of saying what's up\nHigh in the diner a diner thank you I\nFind I Do think that um many upper class women are benefit from the painting that patriarchy\nAnd that are totally willing to go along with it to maintain their lifestyle I don't think they think about it that way necessarily right but I think that is a part of what's\nGoing on but I also think that is rapidly changing with the younger people\nYeah I well I mean part is rapidly changing 'cause you can't maintain a family with one income any longer\nExactly unless you are in that are done or your husband makes you know ...\nThousand a year yeah and then the other part is that there's a the overwhelming number of people that support Trump their main goal is to see roe v Wade overturned they aren't even aware of the economic risk factors that are involved in continuing just part Republicans\nBecause they have not encountered those risks in their lives is that what you're suggesting\nEither that or there I I work with people like they're just not paying attention [noise] oh yeah there are so busy working and picking up extra shifts and just keeping their head above water they're just not as aware of that they no longer they know he's corrupt\nBut I tell the economy really has a big fall they're not going to grasp it fully\nYeah watched I I think that's true regardless of gender\nBut to to the issue of women like ... like the story told by my mom I mean ... and that's that's an ideal that is rapidly vanishing from the American seen my dad worked in a tool and die shop today I think\nA a man working until I shop but I have a much more difficult time supporting a family particularly if they were higher than the last Fifteen Years right [noise]\nAnd I don't think I'm I I think some people don't realize that the overwhelming number of people support a woman's right to choose and even if it's overturned enforcement is going to be really

wouldn't even let\nMe ask a question um so it's as you see an end of the papers recorded on this incident later saying they knew I that I was there\nA at and they say it's seen me there so they decided to literally blocked me and the and then they threatened to arrest me the cops threat the recipe that are working with Kim\n... or because they said the owner of the property you want to be off the owner told the papers no I didn't I've never checked on anyone off my property\nBut the main thing is it's not how they mishandled me it sounded mishandling the voters Georgia I Will say Tom that I have put up I did get from camp\nA response at the last minute it's incomplete we're still going to go to federal court\nBut he gave me the name of every person and their address at the purge it's now up Greg palace dot com right now if you're in Georgia right now go to Greg palace dot com type in your first last name and ZIP Code and find out if you're the one in ten\nOr of the negative lottery where you lose your vote in Georgia it is astonishing while\nNow how many how many people have confirmed for you that they still live in Georgia they thought they were still registered to vote but they've been purged from the rolls have you have you started that ought to process that contacting the yes I was a\nYes or two things number one we we sent out the word and we're already getting flooded with people saying I was removed that so I'm actually staying in Georgia to get a few of them on camera um and I just really want people to get this information\nOut our lawyers are now considering whether we should seek an injunction to extend the registration period which ends on a in one week on October nine and frankly it they should just put these names back\nBecause we've checked with the post office contractors not inexpensive by the way to do is we check every single name\nAnd overwhelmingly almost all those people\nAre still are at their voter registration dress they they haven't moved anywhere in of course you can the smell of Kris Kobach is not far away right uh they are using the cross checklist is one way to purge voters\nWhich raises my last question Greg right into it too but to what extent you know ... it certainly looks like this is a a a a criminal conspiracy frankly in Georgia by Brian camp\nOr as secretary of state controls the voter rolls to purge as you point out one outta ten Georgians off the voting rolls up presumably predominantly in communities of color um and and now he's running for governor against Stacey Abrams or who would be the first black woman governor and the history of the United states\nOn it but to what extent as the ... same thing happening in other Republican controlled states I'm assuming that's not happening in any democratic control says\n... percent Ninety notice is a federal law suits to twenty six states in fact I'm going to Jesse Jackson's birthday party my coat plaintiffs in Illinois I'm at a uh so we're hitting many states are Kansas of course and Ohio Michigan\nUm Indiana has been was real bad in fact one of the people said looks it looks like we missed because they had according junction against you can cross check and their people inside that\nLooks looks like our people are still using cross chicken violation of an injunction\nFor guys all over right we've got all over the place yeah yeah\nSo so the call for action here right now is for if you know anybody in Georgia if you are in Georgia a contact them or if you just you know have a wife if you vantage origins are watching you know reading your Facebook feed\nForever or put a link to Greg palace dot com and to all these people in Georgia that they can check\nAnd see if they're on the purge list and if so then you've got one way to to reinstate here you're a right to vote in the state of Georgia which has been taken away by the by the way Republican secretary of state because he doesn't want the black\nI'm Democrat Stacey Abrams to be able to win the election\nYoung people to are really affected it gets kind of like Obama's campaign young\nOr as much as as black folk who are of backing Abrams\nAnd they are really affected by this perch um because they don't distinguish they pull people out for moving but they don't distinguish as Stacy able to point it to me when she saw the list that they're removing people who engage in Georgia the new young voters moving into Georgia are being purchased um it is but again it\nBecause they moved into the worst ... because they know they went into the stage\nOf the state they have literally and Stacey Abrams discovered this by going through my list I've asked both candidates to comment ... by the way it did not have the arrest it just so you know they don't want a blind camp\nOr an ... listened said my God they're removing people are moving in to the state of Georgia and she showed me the the registration dates are mismatched the second date coming into Georgia\nIt is astonishing thing it is ugly and a campus denying a vast\nWhat he's doing but he's given a swing voters feed your name yeah there you go go to Greg\nPalace dot com for all the

continuing our conversation from the previous hour about what is what is the deal with Republican women Seventy percent of Republican women support Brett Kavanaugh and ... and then a higher percentage of that than than that so many like ... percent support Donald Trump\nWhich seems kind of like a position of women wouldn't want to take given Donald Trump's history and what we've learned to Brett Kavanaugh's history\n... you know what the what does this tell us about this group of people it's probably Fifteen or twenty percent of our population\nApparently believe in a hierarchy and patriarchy and such\nBut well I guess that would be a conservative world view you know if things are as they should be and they should continue as they are with minor adjustments kind of the definition of conservative William F Buckley is just a a conservative as a man who stands up for the arc of history with this handout shouting stop\nIn other words yeah we want to move forward progress but we want to slowly gradually carefully calibrated now that that's a historic meeting of conservative but I think probably many conservative women would fall into that category no certainly many conservative men do\nBut then the modern day definition of conservative that emerged with Ronald Reagan presidency\nHas been reformed to be basically conservative means in favor of whatever is going to benefit really rich people and big corporations\nNow there are these issues the kind of float around the bottom that have popped to the top as major issues things like guns and abortion\nWhich don't seem to

she was actually a very successful in her career she just retired last year and she didn't bring better than it has been very very smart a lot of common sense\nI think my sister tend to see things in
