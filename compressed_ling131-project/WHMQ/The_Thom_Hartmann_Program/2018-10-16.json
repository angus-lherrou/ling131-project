yeah\nVery interesting well behaved as you continue your research into this would you would you keep us up to date\nYeah and if I can make one more point Tom please do so um\nThis is problematic in of itself but it has the danger of becoming a self fulfilling prophecy because when you tell voters um that your candidate who support he has no shot at winning then\nAs by the way the pollsters were speaking about Andrew Gillum in Florida for example\n... right and right now in Maryland and jealous who the former leader of the N. double ACP he was predicted to be neck and neck in the primary he's the third black urban ... gubernatorial candidate\nUm and he won a landslide primary victory that none of the pollsters predicted right and now the polls have him way down to the Republican um and ah Larry Hogan\nIn a state Marilyn that is two to one democratic um\nAnd when you put out\nInto the media this powerful message that the candidate has no shot\nIt's not just voters voters are busy ... election day ah people have a lot of things to do and if you tell people you're Canada's no shot they're more likely to stay home and also donors yeah nobody wants to back ashore loser\nAnd so this is very dangerous and this is why the Associated Press in updating it's a piece dial book earlier this year it said it said because polls are so often intoxicating for journalists are that that we are the eighties updating his style book\nTo a with this word of caution to journalists\nPoll results that seeks to preview the outcome of an election must never be the lead headline or single subject of any story\nAnd yet time and again this is what we're seeing\nWell particularly on television I mean a television in the worst of those 'cause they're always oh breaking news here that line you know ... and ... they don't even talk about issues they just started about horse racing personality\nAnd this and not talking about issues is really significant you could pull on any number of things but the key pulling on just how much do you like the candidate ... but not on the issue that if it's not that they don't ... it's much more ah seldom and it's not as prominently report it now if you had an election here in Maryland on the issues\nAre for example a Fifteen dollar an hour minimum wage Seventy one percent of Maryland or support that\nAnd you're going down the list of ... and that's a central planning to jealous his campaign threat but that's not what's disgusting stuff that's how popular Hogan is in I'm In my reporting I look at the Washington Post which is\nLife by many on the left and because of its aggressive reporting on President Trump and I'm all for that\nBut the post if you take away if you take from out of the picture a nice thought\nWhat exactly is it that the post is against it it is anti labor and organization as they call them it's for every war and it really exists to defeat candidates are that are progressive that are pushing Medicare for all and a Fifteen dollar an hour\nIt can say that of virtually all the major media\nI think yeah I I haven't studied well I think you could say certainly networks are they should do right\nUm but posted been particularly pernicious I'm In how it has given just the most favorable coverage to Hogan saying he'd bipartisan ... moderate you know this is someone who has\nBacked by the Koch brothers who is with an organization the Maryland all the policy you or\nI mean office that ... that had coke donors support um\nAnother little detail it almost never makes it into the press I you know the Koch brothers a drop in three hundred million dollars in us elections Shelly Adelson has got ten twenty thirty million I forget the number [noise]\nUm and you know they talk about oh gee it looks like this racist tightening up I Wonder why and nobody says well maybe it's tightening up because they just dropped ten million dollars into that state you know to win slash slash and burn attack ads but in many cases are are just plow flat otherwise\nYeah and then the poll will say well how do you feel about this data the other rather than hoarding out what people actually want as far as where we go into the future um so I think this is I think this is dangerous stuff I think\nUh I think the pollsters are little arrogant to I don't think they they are really up to seeing what's coming and I think the media has a much greater responsibility to oh and I'm appreciative of the opportunity to talk with you I think you do a great job of bringing forward\nSome of the issues that they need to be discussed rather than just only people who likes to what what are the issues that are at stake you right\nBut that's you know I think that that's you know at at the at the at the core of the the central core of everything that has to be the issues and that's where our media does so poorly because it's all reality you know their their their reality\nTV model is what's been embraced by by news [noise] so you know they sit around with a couple of pundits talking about something and everybody's opinion any but they're not talking about the issues\nWe're talking about you know who likes to and it was just

going to get it done here and then we'll then we'll get to your phone calls or this is from April fourth Nineteen forty four\nHenry Wallace was vice president of the United states\nAnd he he writes this was an op ed that was published in the New York times\nOn April fourth Nineteen forty four\nHe says on returning from my trip\nTo the west in February I received a request from the New York times to write a piece answer in the fall and questions one was a fascist to how many fascist have we here in America three how dangerous are they\nIn any answers those questions\nIn fact the article titled the articles but danger of American fascism by vice president Henry Wallace\nIs the really dangerous American Fascists or not those who are hooked up directly or indirectly with the access with Germany and Japan the FBI has his finger on those the American fascists would prefer not to use violence is method is to poison the channels of public information\nWith a fascist the problem is never how best to present the truth to the public but how best to use the news to deceive the public into giving the fascist and his group more money or power\nAmerican fascism will not be really dangerous until there is a purposeful coalition among the cartel us the deliberate poisoners of public information and those who stand for the KKK type of demagoguery\nAre we there yet still another danger vice president Wallace wrote still other dangers represented by those who paying lip service to democracy and the comment on welfare\nAnd their insatiable green for money and the power which money gives do not hesitate surreptitiously to evade the laws designed to safeguard the public from monopolistic extortion\nThe symptoms of fascist thinking Henry Wallace wrote are colored by environment and adapted to immediate circumstance but always and everywhere they can be identified by their appeal to prejudice and by the desire to play upon the fears and vanities of different groups of people\nIn order to gain their own power\nIt is no coincidence that the growth of modern tyrants has in every case been heralded by the growth of prejudice\nAre you listening to the words\nOf the vice president of the United states in Nineteen forty for the American fascists or most easily recognized by their deliberate perversion of truth and fact they're newspapers and propaganda carefully cultivate every Fisher of this unity every crack and the common front against fascism\nAre you starting to think about Fox so-called news right wing hate radio\nThey use every opportunity to impugn democracy they use isolationism as a slogan to conceal their own selfish imperialism they call them they hate and this trust\nThey claimed to be super patriots but they would destroy every liberty guaranteed by our constitution they demand free enterprise but there is a spokesman for monopoly invested interest their final objective toward which all of their to seat is directed\nIs to capture enough political power so that using the power of the state and the power of the market simultaneously\nThey may keep the common man in eternal subjects and\nWe all know the parts of the cartels played in in bringing Hitler to power and the rule\nThe giant German trusts the plate and Nazi conquest monopolistic fierce competition who dissed trust democracy because it stands for equal opportunity would like to secure their position against small an energetic enterprise\n\nIn an effort to eliminate the possibility of any rival growing up some Annapolis was sacrificed democracy itself\nWe must not tolerate oppressive government or industrial oligarchy in the form of monopolies and cartels\nAnd what do we have now literally every industry\nEvery industry in America is now controlled by a you know you can call it a monopoly money basically that's where the buyers have maximum power rather than the sellers\nI'm so they control the marketplace but uh I Would say there are there many monopolies right I mean you've got you know basically in the airline business you've got three or four or five airlines the pharmaceutical industry have it as a pharmaceutical companies or control you know in each case they control anywhere from sixty five to Ninety percent of the market right that that's a functional monopoly\nIn in a processed foods in in the growing ah you know the raw material foods in a you know hog operations ah you know the some of the largest ones are not even American their Chinese on um you know cattle operations um the uh you know like ...\nThe Internet\nYou're television network I mean a picket right pick anything pick any area\nToothpaste I mean you know whatever it may be\nWhat you will find is that the vast majority of the market is now monopolized\nAnd the these corporations are feeding the politicians who keep their monopolies intact\nWhich would be by and large the Republican Party\nWhich by the definitions of Henry Wallace is the vice president of the United states in Nineteen forty four means that it has become a fascist party [noise]\nIs it time to start using the F. word fascism\nAnd without hyperbole without exaggeration\nSaying okay this is exactly what Henry Wallace was socks and\nYou're listening to Tom Hartmann program called ... to ...\nNinety nine twenty five\nCalls right after the break sticker\n[noise]\n\nDo you feel like the

check our elections I mean this is where I'm at is is you\nKnow you know they try to do that in two thousand four and the John Kerry election and the Republicans in the state as I recall it was Ohio or the Republicans refuse to let them come to the polling places\nYep a fascist America with our fire power is not good for the world yeah I mean we need to think about that\nThere you go or they've thank you for the call ... in North Hollywood, California and Zach what's up\nMourning Tom boy this ties in perfectly with what you guys are talking about oh we're fighting fifty years of propaganda driven sentiment on the on the Trump side a and you're right the nine eleven was a springboard for what we're seeing now but I think the media or needs to\nEmbrace and get more familiar with the spectacle of handcuffs and prime time I think they'd be surprised at how well they do and we have a whole new crop of people to put handcuffs on so uh my question for you as\nWe know we know what happened Bernie had the bigger crowds and more juice than anyone in the twenty sixteen primary including Trump and Hillary but the media gave Trump their blessing we know that so we all know they've been cheating to vote for Eighteen years\nThey machine that vote since reconstruction right I mean how were you when they're an intern what\nThey're doing right now or is are the same damn Jim Crow things that were being done back in you know in Eighteen eighty it's just that they're being done in a in a slightly more sophisticated in subtle way\nRight I'm not throwing my hands up here but how is one mid term going to have the effect we want if we still don't have checks on a fair vote and ways to prove you know the cheating and enforce infraction\nThis is why we've got to Iceland his own I mean we've got we have some we have to show up so many voters we have to turn out so many voters that it overwhelms gerrymandering that overwhelms\nThe the the the ringing up the electoral system by throwing people off a machine right\nEither by count or removal\nYeah no I Am yeah and we just we have to fly zone and that and and we need to be doing it with this election and we need to be doing it two years from now and the twenty twenty election and we need to be doing it big time and if we don't we're screwed Zach the the thank you excellent point and George in Chicago and Gerard she wanted to talk about polling efficiencies\nWell I first wanted to see a big thank you for the wonderful conversation you had with Pete Tucker that's why I and so many others make it a point to tune in to your show every day that was fantastically informative\nThank you and I had hoped to one aspect of polling\nHave been a trust in the conversation and perhaps you can do it with Mr Tucker on a future interview\nBut it's my understanding that traditionally polling was done by calling people at home on their land line telephones and we're all pretty familiar with the fact that particularly with millennials and younger people\nAre they're not they're likely to have wind blowing phones and particularly with black and brown younger people they might be using a ...\nWell wait cell phones that they use for a while and get another one with another numbers so I'm just wondering about the mechanics and the nuts and bolts of being able to phone a large enough representative sample or a so that you can get a good result\nYeah I I I understand George and I don't know the answer to that and that's a special that question I asked paid I yeah I said you know why is it that the supporters those voters\nWho are going to vote for progressive minorities are not being counted and you know I Will say that because there's been a radical increase in their number that hasn't been picked up by the pollsters and he said he thought that was part of it because they're they're metric is not you know the benchmark excuse me is not\nThe two year old ago like election 'cause that was a presidential year but rather the four year ago a lecture and that was before Trump and that was before a you know grab 'em by their crotch all this other stuff that was before Brett Kavanaugh that was before a you know the Muslim band and the the Mexican rapists and all this other crap that that has just\nCompletely energized and activated the progressive base\nAnd and and uh you know people of color realizing that you know\nThis this and now the Republican Party institutionally is on a daily basis using racism to go after them but you know\nThe mechanics of it I don't know and and then he didn't seem to know that for him to be\nThe number on their\nI mean if they don't recognize and if this is a pollster vase hang up\nYeah if I could be I mean I don't answer\nNumbers that I don't recognize as just as
