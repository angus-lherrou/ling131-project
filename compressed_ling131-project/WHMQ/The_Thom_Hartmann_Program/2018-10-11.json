I've been looking for the link through this and the documentation and I've been unable to fight it um\nBut you know one of the stories that I heard is that this was actually a press release that was set out to the media that some\nEager beaver editor at a at USA Today and looked at and said oh this is cool I got this ah let's see if we can put Donald Trump's name on this and publish this and they contacted the White House so I said sure go for it and boom there it is\nBut if\nIf I was a reporter and I'm not I'm an opinion person right this is not this show is not news that we talk about the news\nBut you're getting my take on it and I'm getting your take on it and it's more like a national town hall but uh you know I was a reporter at one point in time for seven years I was a reporter in Lansing, Michigan for W. I. T. L. A. M. F. M. and\nI can tell ya and and and we also published a trade or industry a magazine Terry OConnor I did for a couple of years I can tell you that back in the days when I was actually doing\nJournalism if a political party or a politician or in the case you know I was in Lansing, Michigan so jury grapes the mayor and they use the ... for the all the entire time I was working at will\nUm [noise] or they'll get the governor you know war to send out a press release to my radio station or to our trade publication to our newspaper\nThat was literally filled with lies that would be the story\nWrite the story it would be looking at this the mayor's office just sent out a press release that's got twenty seven lives in it what the hell is going on in the mayor's office that would've been the story\n\nSo how is it the u._s._a. today gets this this literally pack of lies and the Washington Post now has pointed this out literally it's a pack a wise\nOr a stack of lives like she could call it and instead of running an article and I just insane that the White House is sending out news releases filled with lies instead of writing that story which would actually be reporting USA Today how delicious knees lies under Donald Trump's name\nAs an odd that\nI mean this is\nThis scares me more than a whole lot of things that have happened in the recent past this is this is why Weimar Republic kind of stuff this is this is one of the press becomes the lap dog of ... of the government of the leadership of the government\nNow I yeah I Know that we've got this from Fox News we've had this on Fox News now ever since Fox News was created Fox's was created by billionaire Rupert Murdoch the same reason that he created much of the\nPress and said he owns in Australia and in the United kingdom to promote his own political viewpoint to promote the political and economic interests of the billionaire class that's why Rupert Murdoch did this and it's obvious to anybody looks at\nUSA Today and can add pretending to be new\nSo one of the White House sends them a bunch of lies [noise]\nWhy don't they write a story about how she and the White House so much a wine and\nYou're listening to the

doing this for over Twenty years and I've covered over two million windows and know exactly how to get you the right blinds at the right price they make it easy they made it easy for me to go in and order\nYeah of course than it is a disingenuous talking points to say it will cut it cost us dearly to act because reality as it would cost us dearly to not act on it already is I mean look at hurricane market well absolutely\nAnd and the devastating extreme weather events a wild fires and drought floods that we've seen summer I'm already the the cost of inaction is so much greater than the cost of actually taking action and so that is a disingenuous talking point and and it's predictable the forces of denial or out in force trying to distract\nThe public and policymakers in the in the wake of this devastating new BCC report and here's the irony Tom\nI'm this report is overly conservative as the BCC records over a always are and in terms of the budget of carbon how much carbon\nDo we have left if we can burn and still avoid warming the planet more than that dangerous two degrees Celsius warming um we have argued that the the ... the number that the DCCC is using is probably a factor too too large uh and in part because\nWhat it gets into some of the details here on the way they measure how much the planet has warmed I'm obviously you need to define what the baseline is what is the pre industrial base line now they use the late the late Eighteen hundreds to define the pre industrial base line\nBut the glow that already warned several tenths of a degree\nCelsius in response to greenhouse gas emissions that occurred before the late Nineteen centuries so if you use it more realistic definition of what was the pre industrial climate were actually even closer to two degrees Celsius and we have even less carbon\nThat we can afford to burn so whether the number say we've got to bring our carbon emissions down by between five and ten percent a year over the next two decades and basically bring them down to zero if we're going to avoid warming the planet more than that dangerous two degrees Celsius warming\nRight and this and this by the way it would you create millions of jobs I mean it would be an explosion for the clean energy industry you know rebuilding our power grids red solar rising every house in the world uh you know I mean there's ... it would be such an incredible economic opportunity\nBut at the fossil fuel barons would take a hit the billionaires the Koch brothers the the uh the stockholders of Exxon Mobil and whatnot they would all take a hit and uh you know therefore they're fighting tooth and nail it's it's just absolutely absolutely bizarre\nYeah no I mean the ... the great lie you know and it has been that um [noise] we you know that uh\nWe you know we can't make this transition it'll hurt the economy or when in fact uh the rest of the world has moved on the rest of the world is moving on to recognize that the future of the global economy is in renewable energy and the more we continue\nTo remain fixated on fossil fuels the farther we as a nation fall behind the rest of the world and you're right you know there's some coal burnt barons in and fossil fuel\nUm you know a companies that stand to profit um uh the longer we stay addicted to fossil fuels but the rest of us in the planet lose out\nFor a ... and let's talk for a moment about the the actual impacts of this um you know I\nHave\nAccused of having my hair on fire around these issues in the past particularly when I talk about a mass extinctions you know the revisiting the Permian but\nLet's talk about just you know kind of a middle point here civilization where we've already seen\nAnd like I Believe as a consequence of global warming and please reality check me on this we've seen the desert move south or I Believe it's over a hundred miles in the last two decades in the in the northern part of Africa and the middle east um and and the consequences of that was you know the farmers being wiped out moving into the big cities\nAre the big cities then becoming unstable and countries like Syria Libya and Egypt or and so forth\nAnd a leading to what was referred to as the Arab Spring apparently was provoked by by climate change that and then you've got all these refugees flowing into Europe at a rate that is difficult for the Europeans to assimilate which is producing a right wing backlash so now we've had several governments in Europe\nPoland Hungary or you know a Italy maybe on the edge of this ah basically flipping from democracy the strongman autocracy\nA yeah rejecting democracy\n... and and and then in other parts of the world Bangladesh a you know saw parts of northern India we're seeing you know just massive movements of people millions\nConsequence of climate change at what point a so clearly a it's already destructive to democracy this fragile form of governance that we've kind of evolved over the last couple of hundred years and be\nAt ... at a at the you know they didn't tell me if you agree with everything I just sat and and then if so be at what point do we say and this actually endanger civilization\nYeah well you know these are granola chewing radicals known as the Pentagon um and a four star generals are are a national security community\nUm they are firmly on record uh in terms of the threat that they see in climate change they describe it as a threat multiplier it takes existing a competition for diminishing resources\nAnd and it increases that competition and it creates conflict and and you can connect the dots between this epic drought in Syria and uh the organization that terrorist organization ISIS that arose in that atmosphere of conflict and instability\nUm so it's you know even if you dismiss climate change her all the other reasons if you're a national security hawk\nI'm you ought to care about climate change because it is our greatest national security threat in and our forces understand that and our national security a community understands that the Pentagon understands that many of our business leaders understand that as well because they\nYou know lose out I'm In an unstable or a con world economy so\nYou know it it it used to be the case that climate change was sort of thought of as a you know an issue that only the environmental left a cares about or should care about\nBut it doesn't matter where you are on the political spectrum the impacts of climate change are already very real they're hurting all of us and we should all care regardless of our politics\nYeah yeah this is this is a serious stuff this was very serious stuff and we need a treated as such Dr Michael man his name his latest book the madhouse effect by what was

Donald Trump's a column about you know the distortions allies he put about explaining of that but I I look at it two ways one um Reuters had a poll about a month ago where Seventy percent of the people in the country support Medicare for all including fifty two percent of Republicans I think they're trying to do a little pushback\nYou never know what's behind the gateway city I've been to

Air America crews\nOn the all American cruise line called ... peninsula and we sat with you and Louis at it for ... for a booth for for um my positions are\nI oppose everything that the Republicans stand for um especially Donald Trump Mike than ...\nI've always been Tony Tony ... I'd like you to get to your question though if you put it in my question\nIs specifically um [noise] what can I Do on a local state and national level to advance my values and goals\nAnd I can tell you what I've been doing so far if you're interested congressman\nTony ... first of all a great question and I get that I'm\nAlmost daily here back home and and let me off for a couple of things one uh elections have consequences we learned that from two years ago a in less than four weeks we have a in a very very very important election especially for you in Michigan you also have a governor's race in a Senate race in a number of house races or get get folks out\nTo vote do everything you can to be part of the electoral process between now and November six and then secondly I find those progressive groups that aligned closest with your values\nAnd support them so if you think indivisible um which was the organization of the year for the progressive caucus this last a year a is doing a great job and they are because they have people across the country and grassroots movement um they have ways you can\nCall into districts in Kentucky or New Jersey wherever they may be a key member and you can call the people who live there\nTo have them call their member of Congress because quite honestly you calling a member of New Jersey or Kentucky isn't going to have very much effect\nBut it will if you can get their constituents to do it so I\nFind those groups that you agree with the most and doubled down with them support them financially I support them a V. their efforts or take active part in there are various actions that they do but\nThat's what we have to do we just have to be more president than ever we have to make sure that this is about a movement and not a moment has been said be previously and this is really November six\nI Can't stress how important this election is going to be a make the next four weeks a used a very very wisely and then work with all those groups to help us enact that change\nRich in cetera woolly Washington You're on the air with Congress and focus on\nYour boarding Tom and congressmen and if I'm Wondering who's our ... got a towel Trump out there writing this oh go a editorial who's sitting down and writing our account her editorial about getting that public where it's not a Senator Schumer\nI mean when you're dealing with a cold fury when you deal with the cold weather immediately jumping\nOn their faces when they tell you a lie and say no that's not how it is I I Want to know who's got the uh\nThe power that the press can make more bigger below the although maybe Bernays who is both for chump author jump in their face and counter the Clay Carson\n... rich the good news is um I I bet there are a bunch of groups and individuals writing those right now I think Bernie Sanders would probably be\nThe most prominent person since he's the lead author in the Senate a privilege I pollen Debbie Dingell and others in the house are going to be taking this over from Keith Ellison a those are all folks that might be active as well\nUh I don't think you're going to see the Senate or house leadership because they have not formally uh taken a position on Medicare for all\nBut we have people like Bernie Sanders and others who are well respected who can certainly put that out the good news is I've already read numerous articles that dissected\nLiterally as Tom said earlier sentence by sentence the lies that were put in Donald Trump's column so there is a lot of pushback happening but my guess is the best person to do that we Bernie Sanders and there's also a number of groups that have been very articulate on this issue as well that I'm sure a pending their own columns\nAlso Chuck Schumer gave a speech on the floor of the sun it yesterday in his office on a copy of it to me an email I'm On their press list\nAnd he took it apart too I just thought that was not covered in the news nobody reported it\nSo you know which is kind of a sad thing the good news is we already had somebody was Martin\nSeventy percent support that's mind body Congress in March and taking your calls for the hour as the Thursday our number two edition of mid days with Martin will be back with more your calls for Congress in ... in just a moment you can check out his website ...\nYou're listening to the Tom Hartmann program called ... to ...\nNinety nine twenty he's the co chair of the congressional progressive caucus you can tweet us ... mark Pocan\n[noise]\n\nThink about the amount of time you spend every day in your office chair for most of us it's over two thousand hours and ... year so if you're spending all that time in the wrong chair is it any wonder having back problems trouble concentrating or aren't as productive as you can be that's why\nGuys hey Rick uh we we need to change the messaging on the way Medicare is explained everybody right now Medicaid is what I'm On handicapping really really poor people and Medicare is elderly people retired people\nWhat we're not getting out is the fact that medic what we will have will be for everybody from the very first born to people on their desk that will cover everybody there will be no more out of pocket you've done right\nYou'll be covered and we're missing the point fingers are getting the crap scared out of them that oh God my Medicare will be gone no we want it will be enhanced will be much better ... Canada has gone we've got to work on the most and I ...\nI think one thing when we say Medicare for all we say the for all part right so we are saying it's for every single person so to exactly to your point that's why we're trying to keep it simple and talking about it in that way but also I think you know Donald Trump just put this out there that somehow you're going to lose your Medicare\nBut I don't think anyone's buying it no senior group is jumping on it or if he's being called out right and left for his allies that somehow Medicare won't exist and you're right we want to actually\nExpanded and make it better for seniors are including things like negotiating for prescription drug prices so um I I think the message is largely is out there trying to put this misinformation out there I don't\nThink they're succeeding again not when you have Seventy percent support Medicare for all and writers polls um but I Do think it's important that we talked about it as you said that it's for everyone it's not taking away anything from any senior in fact the seniors will have a better program they currently have but everyone then we'll have that same good program\n... center in New York you're on the air with cars and poking\nHi um I just wanted to say um when you were commenting that every time a Republican comes in the Democrats have to come in and ... I had been saying that for a bird I cannot understand how people see I never followed politics that much but I could see it\nOver and over again now I'm wide awake and I'm In politics but it it's just why are people not seeing that I mean even your Republican seniors should see that\nThey go after our Social Security and Medicaid ... I just don't get it\nYeah kind of you know their hind with putting big lives out there and they put really big money from you know Sheldon Adelson and the Koch brothers and others behind delivering those messages that run completely counter to their actions I think the good news is people are pretty well\nRight now this election cycle I feel like I'm the reason that we are as good as the places we are on the house of representatives and I'm picking up a bunch of governorships around the country is because of people realize that\nIn twenty sixteen elections had consequences a lotta people didn't come out and vote people aren't happy with the direction of the country and the tone of the federal government under Donald Trump and certainly a under Paul Ryan and Mitch McConnell\nSo this is our opportunity to have some lasting substantive change but um you know you're so right on this thank you for saying that county and you know we're trying to get that message out to that you know so often what they say doesn't match what they do\nAnd that tax bill is like a classic example when eighty three percent of the bad if it goes to the top one percent and they increase the debt two trillion and then days later Paul Ryan says we have to go after Social Security and Medicare you shouldn't have to say anything else than just that\nW dairy New Hampshire hey W you're on the earth's congressman folk him\nWhy thank you guys very much time in ... ... ... on that you guys do I sincerely mean that's in the ... I think the world would be much better place if we could clone you to change the game now you're very welcome thank you guys again\nUm so I had a couple of things um how can we make election day a national holiday\nYeah so I mean and that's something we could legislatively do and I think that's a actually a really great suggestion because\nToo many people are we want to have maximum participation everyone who's legally able to vote should go out and vote and you know Wisconsin used to be one of the top three states in the country it was Minnesota Wisconsin in Maine for turnout\nOregon now with their new system is starting to get up there\nAnd we had the biggest drop off other than I think it was Mississippi and twenty sixteen because we have a governor who is dumb things like photo ID requirements and ending you know as early voting as we used to have and doing all kinds of other changes to the process but you know if you had a national holiday no matter who you are if you're working two\nPart time jobs that day and you can barely get around a you wouldn't have to that day because you'd be able to get to vote which is the most important thing you can do in our democracy so I think it's a great suggestion Debbie and I think we really should be having a national conversation about it\nKaren in Hagerstown, Maryland you're on the air with garbage in Tokyo\nYes good afternoon I'm next to our men and congressman [noise] um I just want to call in to make a comment\nI Am very very upset and angry and very it hurts a lot can see I'm trying I'm\nAt the rally keep mocking the meat too little men and women and saying that they they've got think things are names he's calling the Democrats\nAnd I'm at age Thirteen I was um my last big by a family member and he had no idea about how hurtful it is and I think the saying\nYou know over a national TV all over the country telling women\nTo be president of\nCountry he's drawing this ties between all he does and here we're out in the town yeah yeah\nWell so you're on my apology I didn't realize we had a heartbreak you're forty five will have cars and folk and pick up a respond to right after the break I'm five oh All right and like your truncated\nWasting to Tom Hartmann visit drama Hardman ... audio and video or\nWe'll be right back with cars among poke ass mid days with mark Thursday edition credit [noise]\n[noise]\n\nHi I'm Randy and this is Dave were the founders of bomb makers of the most comfortable socks and the history of feet so comfortable we sold him donated over eight million pairs yes donated why\nWe learned the Sox are the number one most requested clothing either been homeless shelters so we started bomb us with the mission of donating a pair of socks for every pair we sell to donate and saw a lot of socks we became obsessed with comfort we reinvented the sock from the ground up using the best materials available\nLike the soft is the most comfortable ... getting rid of what wasn't working like that annoying toasty and you can probably feel if you wiggle your toes right now\nAnd inventing a few new comfort innovations along the way like our support that feels like a hug around your foot at work people tried them love them told her friends about coping selling donate over eight million pairs\nTry them out at ... dot com slash Tom and get twenty percent off your first order not to be O.
