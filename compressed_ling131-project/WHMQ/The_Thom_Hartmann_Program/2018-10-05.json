Danny\n... and I'm not calling on West Virginians to vote for the Republican opposite Joe Manchin what I Am saying though is I think that this vote no matter and the main point or what I was saying is new Joe is damned if he does and damned if he doesn't because right now he has to depend on a lot of Trump voters to get himself reelected and\nThose people increasingly are calling themselves Republicans in watching Fox News and they're not going to be inclined to vote for him and if he throws a you know if if he if he's the guy who pushes I'm Kevin ... over the top\nI frankly doubt that there's going to be enough for Republican voters Trump voters in West Virginia to reelect Joe Manchin based on that when his Democratic based desserts fame because of that vote\nAnd on the other hand if if he votes against a Brett Kavanaugh now you know joins the other Democrats that's going to satisfy the Democratic base but he has failed to energize the Democratic base because you know he's he's

not\nYeah you would think if somebody goes to the effort of showing up at a polling place that's a substantial effort you know only about a third of us do that in mid term elections congressional elections if somebody's going to go to that effort and the state has no record of why they're there I Would say it's incumbent upon the state not upon the voter to find out why that record doesn't exist\nIn exactly the way I see that is because we need to keep us alive after the election so if something happens that's terrible people need to know all my vote didn't count or did count yeah and they used to be informed on because otherwise they just say oh I voted and it goes away\nCompletely agree that Rob ... you know well said uh I and and this is something that we need to be paying attention to thanks Rob for the call Susan in Montpelier, Vermont faces and what's up\nHigh town printing so much for hearing they sure what's up I'm getting used to live\nYeah Louis I Lived in Montpelier for she's about a decade I think\nWell I Am calling I Am ... years old fifty years ago I was sexually molested it resulted in a pregnancy\nAnd I want to tell you I never felt so stuck in my entire life but I just tried to make the best of it and making the best of it was trying to stay and stay in a relationship for ten years with a heavy user wow and now that I'm older and much more riser\nAt Seventy years old I Know that stain that relationship was not healthy for either me or my son\nRight and so this thing goes on intergenerational from that experience and so my greatest concern about the ... court procedural vote today\nIs that we are sending a message that sense it's okay for boys act the way\nA a ... at Cambridge communities what Seventeen to twenty it's not no I'm all\nRight Andy marks nearest normal for boys to act that way\nI I agree and Fox News is is not only amplifying that message but they're also saying that if those boys are wealthy and white than they are they're going to come under attack because they're white\nAnd you know they're adding white grievance to this whole thing and and making cabin on the victim of presumably some black or brown people and the only the only people I can think of in this case would be you know Cory Booker and camel Harris who are you know in the Senate Judiciary committee and are both African American\nOr it's it's bizarre but yeah I see your point is that is that women have had these experiences can see through Kavanaugh's at the bottom line here says no\nAbsolutely I can see through him and I think he is very clever because he brought up the calendar he bought a ... year book yeah because he knew that\nYou need a summer job and you know we learned in basic research course\nCat what do you see is what

Bush he worked out in the Bush Gore campaign he was a white man right wing hit man with a law degree working for Ken Starr in the late nineties during the Clinton Administration\nAnd and you know he went from being a right wing ... ban\nUh you know against Clinton and then on behalf of Bush and then you know a a a counselor who was advised in Trump presumably the torture is just fine thank you very much\nHe went from that to being a judge on the second highest court in the land with no judicial experience no law experience and then now they want to put him on the Supreme Court and that to me is the most mind boggling part of this\nYou know here's a guy who's got you know no qualifications for this I mean they are the most qualified guy ever yeah he went he went to Yale is the legacy student 'cause his grandfather went there give me a break from Tom tom absolutely thank you very much for calling Glen and Winston Salem North Carolina and says you want to disagree with me\nPuts up when I ...

O. two in the atmosphere is way less than one\nPercent the amount of oxygen in the atmosphere if I'm remembering my high school biology chemistry is around Nineteen or twenty percent and he's adamant and then the biggest chunk of the rest of the atmosphere is nitrogen\nAnd uh so we've got lots of elbow room we can do just fine and Seventeen Eighteen percent oxygen and environments for example\nUh we may not you know a a these super fine but if you look at people who live at high elevations they've got the less oxygen available to them and they they can do just fine they prosper they may be shorter I mean you know look at the people that live in the in the ... mountains and in the\nIn the Peruvian mountains um and that may have something to do with not having enough oxygen to grow rapidly I don't know but\nUm but other than that uh I think the big concern is that\nThe oxygen that is being used by these forest fires is being combined with the carbon in the trees around and the byproduct of that is carbon dioxide and we're now introducing carbon dioxide we're we're adding to point I Believe is to point one\nParts per million of carbon dioxide to the atmosphere every year this is the fastest rate in history we have never before added this much carbon dioxide to the atmosphere this rapidly\nUm you know during during the ... well I don't have all the numbers in front of me so I'm not going to try and represent them but the but that that I Know and that is that's the real the real danger they it's not a matter whether we can breathe or not it's a matter of whether or not we can eat or drink\nBecause what was happening as as a greenhouse gases increase the atmosphere is holding more heat as it holds more heat\nYou're going to have more intense storms you're going to have more intense flooding you're gonna have more intense droughts and fires and for the fires associated with them right and and none of that is good for growing crops and droughts are not flooding is not\nAnd and they cause our weather patterns are now routinely stalling out instead of moving because the jet stream is collapsing as a consequence of the of the warming of the Arctic and it's going to get really bad when all the ice melts up there which is probably going to happen in the next few years when that happens\nWe're going to be in a rural or I mean we're already in a world of hurt and and global warming is already largely responsible for the so called Arab Spring and all the unrest in the middle east you know outside of George W.
