Obama didn't do this Bill Clinton didn't do this go down to list\nThis is a very different presidency or with someone who I think you know really a is closest to being a reality star in many ways than an elected official and he operates in a different way and uh they know that it's toxic to our public discourse so uh I just wish\nThat Paul Ryan who once in a while during the campaign said something that showed he actually cared and got it you know he's been MIA ever since uh down Trump got elected so um that's been our problem when when Mitch McConnell and Paul Ryan don't stand up and stand up\nFor their separate co equal branch of government ah we're not going to hear it on the news media and in many of the\nConversations are private conversations about Republicans who also ah have great uh discuss tore this level of toxicity Lola in Salem Oregon you're on the air is Congress would poke him\nA congressman poke him and tell them I'm I wanted to ah get your thoughts on this study twenty fourteen study by Martin ... and Benjamin page\nThat showed that the will of the average of voters has zero impact on policy\nAnd uh to kinda\nCounterpoint that with you know how do we actually get things moving and done when like for example like our occupy movement did you know was able to accomplish nothing are anti war at our entire rock or what was I mean\nThey still went into Iraq so it's it's like we we have no impact on anything that happens\nYeah so low I mean I'm not familiar with the uh twenty fourteen ... page study that you're referring to but you know I guess you from doing this for twenty five years um I I have seen when people speak out and they do it in effective way they have a voice\nUm I Would argue all occupy occupy was probably one of the early movements that was out there\nAnd moving right now is significantly different with groups like indivisible and move on and the FAA and\nAnd others that are doing just an amazing job in connecting people to their elected officials that mean indivisible really has been a breakout group I think of of this presidency in in you know letting people who live in Wisconsin\nCall a key district in California to people who live in that district to call their representative that's very scientific technical smart ways to influence people and I've seen\nOur foreign yet to people who live in that district to call their representative\nThat very scientific technical smart ways to influence people and I've seen things not come to fruition that the Republicans wanted to do\nBecause of that so I Would argue my practical experience from watching this is if the people lead eventually the leaders will follow a leaders aren't always the first to do it but they do it uh after enough people have brought them to the point they have no other choice\nI think we now have the tools a place to make that happen so I'm actually very optimistic that if we take the majority for ticket by five it's gonna be more difficult right I mean I'll even say I've got probably a good ten or Fifteen people my caucus that the first to spend life and the fetal position\nA rocking in the corner before um you know I Wish they would do more ah so you know it gets tougher advice\nEven the already but you have any money by the majority and he's got to be doing what they need to I think we can have smoking and which is

unfortunately I forgot that I ran out of a couple of medications and so it took went to a pharmacy in Germany and got got the medication\nAnd this one I got to take for for diabetes and one for the heart so I Do have some problems but anyway so I purchase those as soon as I'm not sure\nIn Germany's to buy the medication it was the American medicate American Made a same medication I'm ... and ... and they come in pre package a pre packaged up like any other\nTypically a blister packs in Germany\nCorrect so I got those thirty the supplies so one month supply one a medication I got for the diabetes was a\nA Cosby forty four euros which is or maybe fifty eight dollars or something like the ... I paid the last time I pick that medication up here for a loop some dollars\nAnd the other one was for the hearts saying things thirty they supply\nFor a loop some dollars and the other one was for the heart of the same thing thirty they supply\nI paid forty eight dollars so buck sixty or sixty two euros about sixty or sixty two dollars\nI paid almost eight hundred dollars for that medication here and it's just it's the same faith it's the same medication and are made in America\nVery it's a horror story or what's your question for congressman poking\nThe question the question is that we must go to a single payer insurance that's where the prices come from the American company that sold those medications in Europe they did not sell them at a loss you know\nThey wouldn't be in the marketplace if they had a ... thoughts on this thank you\nSo I mean I completely agree why we need to move to a single parent but also let me just add on the prescription drug front we also uh I think can walk and chew gum at the same time because I think that one we can address hopefully quicker um there's no question that a pharmaceutical companies many of them are\nAre ripping off the American public are at an incredible rate or what you just gave her two great examples so we had a press conference when Pfizer was going to buy an Irish company or to through a legal loopholes and not pay us taxes and we put a list of all the drugs a major drugs they have\nA what they charge in Ireland and what they charge us in some cases it was one twentieth of the cost for the same drug uh there's no reason we should be ripped off and we need to be much more aggressive in fighting the Senate statistic that uh I used I think it's important for us to use between two thousand six and two thousand ten of the two hundred plus drugs\nThat were approved by the FD FDA all of them had part of their research was paid for by our tax dollars through the national Institute of health and age so they can't tell you all that money is for research and development because a lot of your tax money is going to that and then they rip you off when you're buying the drugs and the U.S that's exactly what we have to address\nWhat again was the time period and the number of drugs\nTwo thousand six to two thousand ten time I get to the exact number I think it's like two hundred and ten drugs could all get you the exact it\nFelt great thank you I I Love statistics yeah a game in Brunswick, Ohio you're on the air with congressman folk yeah\nHello congressman poke in I have a question my question is basically on the consumer protection act and the dust and Frank all you know the Glass Steagall my question is is how do you plan to protect it or expand it so we all do\nDo broken be unemployed and not have any money to support our families\nAnother bank nailed down\nYet so let me um take it a little bit uh upper level if I could you know part of the problem we've seen is once a Dodd Frank was passed and while that had many um protections in place in getting thankfully was born with her expertise was instrumental part of getting a lot of that done even before she was in the Senate obviously\nUm we've had rolled back under this administration and the this Congress so\nUh first let's go back to shore and get up where we need to and then you know with any time you pass a major law like that you're going to find some areas you missed\nLet's go back and get those cleaned up for what we don't want to happen is exactly what happened in two thousand eight when the economy crashed hard uh when you know banks were casinos are doing things with derivatives and other practices that\nClearly are we're not in the best interest of the public and we're very for very short term profits for very few in the bank so\nWe need to get those are back in place the the Dodd Frank regulations that have been rolled back and then let's see what else needs to happen next and um I I've been on a bill to restore Glass Steagall but uh you know there's other things too that we can do along the way\nCars or we're going to hit a heartbreaking twenty five seconds or what do you think the chances are of any of those kind of stuff passing if the Democrats take the house even with a slim majority\n[laughter] see that's that is a hundred thousand dollar plus question I'm at a time is you know we have a ...
