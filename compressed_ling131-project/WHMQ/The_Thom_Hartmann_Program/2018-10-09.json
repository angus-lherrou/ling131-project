reality show\nAnd TV loves reality shows why because they're cheap\nYou recall back in the in the late nineties early to thousands there was a big writers' strike in Hollywood and the TV networks you know they had contracts they couldn't they couldn't put shows on the air that were written by union writers\nAnd the union writers and walked out some water where they're going to do while the

produce you didn't have to pay writers uh you know the producers and directors didn't have that much to do it was just there was simple\nAnd ... then the reality shows wants the writers were back then they started actually writing for the reality shows\nLike Celebrity Apprentice or The Apprentice Donald Trump's two shows and those shows were carefully scripted to make Donald Trump looked like the wise successful businessman that he isn't\nAnd to make the people coming in there as you know the ... who are going to learn a brilliant lesson to be so grateful when they're done well\nWhat they

news we talked with um oh Lorie last week about or say what yeah uh uh about uh the uh the whole NAFTA thing and\nThere's a really interesting piece in Huffington Post right now it says that the the ... this new NAFTA rewrite the Trump is written\nIs like\nA lobbyist paradise\nIt provides and I'm quoting from the article other the headline is Trump's new NAFTA shows what he really cares about generous protections for Republican aligned industries including big pharma and fossil fuel polluters\nNo meaningful environmental protections weak consumer safeguards and no mechanism to enforce the moderately improve labor standards kind of player but to say\nOh yeah we're going to raise the minimum wage to sixteen dollars an hour and Mexico\nNo enforcement mechanism so it's going to be laughed at of course that part of it and that's the only part of it the setting good but they\nCan enforce however the we're going to let you pollute we're going to let you poison and people were going to let you know where you'll at big pharma raise their prices\nU.S Chamber of commerce is guinea Thomas Donahoe says\nThis is wonderful is modernizing NAFTA the business roundtable which is a law brain operation that\nExclusively represents CEOs they said we're encouraged by this agreement\nThe pharmaceutical research the manufacturers of America better known as farmers positively duty if you're a corrupt monopolistic chances are Trump's new NAFTA has something for\nYou the ... it's just amazing\nNow the one thing that people have been asking about is what can you do\nAbout the situation with the court\nAnd I just wanted to give you a little bit of history here in Seventy and eighty nine\nOr right after the constitution was ratified Congress passed a law to ... ... doesn't set up the ... the Supreme Court in the inferior records it gives Congress the ability to do so to say I was just the Supreme Court but but but it doesn't say how many people or anything like that so and Seventeen Eighteen on the same year the constitution was ratified\nCongress passed the law is called the judiciary act of Seventeen eighty nine\nAnd established that the Supreme Court would exist and would have six members they didn't even create a building for aren't these guys ... like you know in the basement of the ... of the ... the capital\nA buddy in Eighteen hundred when Thomas Jefferson was elected in John Adams was on his way out and Adams hated Jefferson or in the lame duck\nThey wanted to make sure this was the federalist we're leaving right and Jefferson just trashed the federal is the federal is this was the last time the federal is controlled both branches of but you know where the atoms both branches of Congress and the White House they just lost terribly it was kind of the beginning of the end of the federal is\nSo in the lame duck session before Jefferson came in and Eighteen hundred they reduce the size of the court down to five members so the Jefferson wouldn't be able to appoint anybody now after the new Congress came in they reverse that but that's that's what happened\nSo number so you've got one precedent for changing the number of members of the court for purely political purposes right based on who is president\nThe second one was Lincoln the the number of uh as as new ... circuits circuit courts were opened each time a new circuit it was open they had to add a new member to the Supreme Court because the Supreme Court members up until Eighteen Ninety One road the circuit was the phrase\nA couple of months out of the year and so they were up to ten members of the court when Lincoln was president when Lincoln was assassinated\nAndrew Johnson came in and he was a pro slavery in fact he was a slave owner in fact he had bought his first slave a fourteen year old girl named Dolly and produce three children with her a and Andrew Johnson the the president the United states after Lincoln was killed\nOr they didn't want him to be able to appoint any Supreme Court justices because they know this is the radical Republicans anti slavery Republicans they were afraid that he would put 'em you know right wing Democrats on the court\nAnd so they reduced the the number of uh justices down to a six as I recall and uh and and ah you know which is pretty remarkable I'm Sorry I just sat and they took it out of seven and then in the election Eighteen sixty eight a Ulysses Grant who\nWas anti slavery became president and so they raised it back up to nine which is where it's been ever since so\nAfter Lincoln was assassinated they change the number of Supreme Court justices to mess with a president and after Adam lost the election of Eighteen hundred they changed the number of members and the poor\nSo I think that change in the number of members of the court should the Democrats take the house the Senate and the White House [noise]\nChanging the number of members in the court to eleven or Thirteen is entirely forming Tom\nHartmann program called jewel to NATO away\nNinety nine twenty five and in fact I think it's going to be one of the loud prize the here and going to share should that day come that the Democrats are once again a control freak branches of government\n[noise]\n\nSummer as this and I've got the perfect formula to help out and wind Cameron Hughes ultra premium one can't purchases direct from boutique wineries

uh is is mind blowing of mind boggling to to to me because it's so much that ah the Trump Administration is doing with the Kavanaugh thing but the FBI investigation which is really a a a fake background interview\nBut I I look at I look at that if they would have\nA question a cabin off he would have perjured himself and at the same time what ms Ford really need is day time and place\nAnd they know if they want to get them to speak I think there's a statue in Maryland for a thaw in rape cases are are I think is unlimited correct\nIt is now it wasn't them so you can't prosecute somebody

I Would uh awful perhaps have you pick up that story when we're off the phone but I mean we are this is a a Saudi journalist and correspondent who seems to have been\nLured into the Saudi consulate in Turkey last week he has not been heard from since the Turks alleged she may have been killed and extrajudicial executions within the conflict which would be horrific\nThe U. S. is finally quote unquote speaking out here but they're doing so in such a muted way that I'm afraid that we're getting into a situation where Saudi Arabia doesn't even see the need to provide evidence that this guy's alive they can say look we don't know what happened\nTo us and say we try to do something and then the messages and for critics of the Saudis and not even try to speak out it's a pretty horrific\nResult of the a buddy buddy thing between Jared Kushner and a the prints it doesn't help way you're not getting any message from the U.

nearby\nDo you feel like the investment cards are stacked against you recently I discuss how corporations are buying back their shares to manipulate the market\nOr the actual executives are cashing out\nWell we certainly see in the fall as a consequence of climate change of the Egyptian Libyan Syria and the civilizations a Tunisian\nUm and and probably others and yes it is I mean this is the thing and then what what the hype ACC is is suggesting they don't use this phrase but what they're suggesting is that within twelve years we will be looking at a planet that is hostile to what we call civilization\nAnd I that's how I had my book\nI write I follow the facts nine degrees and nursing by ... and science and I yeah I Want to science class I read the N o a report\nAnd I know and in fact but what is put out ... everyone on the news as propaganda and allies and I think we've got such a fight politically just to get to scan jackets and true in our country\n... there's not that much time in ...\nKid when both fight and I'm usually pretty hopeful but I I'm you know the round then it went down to the kids get get Lincoln and the kids to Denmark and it's usually because it drought waters to ensure the climate change\nOr in the case of the minds and they asked him because it was uh the flu it was a diseases brought by the Spanish ... but ... and ... and then certainly there's no shortage of viruses to get us to [laughter]\nBut you know all that said Lisa I think that the human species is extraordinarily ... resilient and extraordinarily resourceful\nAnd as this becomes more and more obvious that people like you know the politicians who are funded by the fossil fuel industry and its billionaires are going to be seen increasingly for what they are the thing that gives me hope Lisa is the late nineties\nAnd in Nineteen I and I forget what year was the big tobacco lawsuits but the year before that I think I think it was Ninety eight or Ninety nine year before that\nThe most powerful lobby in Washington DC was the tobacco lobby the entire Republican Party and half the Democratic party was claiming the tobacco didn't cause cancer it wasn't settled science you know it's all in doubt Bloody Bloody blah\nThat lawsuit happened they laid out the lives of the tobacco industry they won in court the tobacco industry had to own it\nAnd they had to pay millions of dollars in restitution\nAnd two years later the tobacco and to this day the tobacco industry is almost a meaningless power in Washington DC and I believe that the fossil fuel industry is going to go through something very much like that as a consequence of climate change obviously is back oh industry went through it as a result of a half a million Americans a year or dying from tobacco\nAnd ah I I'm I I just feel like this is where we're going to see this all over again and we're going to see it in the probably in the next year or two and all it's going to take her a couple of really really big natural disasters um you know which we're getting we're getting whether we want to hang up so\nThey are human species and we will invite your best but I don't know if our civilization are on social what am I trying to say and way of life is\nTo be yeah I Do I\nThe living in ... but hey you know let's remind ourselves that when the people that when people lived and cheaply isn't a blues they lived in a sustainable fashion\nEgg and and they had you know happy lives and good society and they had very little warfare um you read some of these first contact or reports like Peter farm compiled in his book the rise of civilization and the Native American\nUm and uh you know I'm not sure that that would necessarily be a disaster for the human race and certainly wouldn't be for the rest of the species on the planet\nBut an ad for that I'm not planning for that but you know if I you know the the the thing that scares me is if we hit a tipping point where the methane starts going in the Arctic and went out and when that happens when you're talking about the actual death of the human race and that is something we can recover from\nSo we have to be doing something now Lisa thank you for the call I I have to move along to thank you very much it's great to hear from you Nate in West Chester, Pennsylvania innate what's up\nWith some heat for my call\nThanks they take now speaker phone okay\n[noise] yeah yeah oh well I'm just put this message with them um you know along the speaker phone so I can hear you on hold them\nMade this is very just courteous to our listeners who are ... and the people of the people patiently waiting to get on the phone became sort of been using the ear buds that next time or something like that any at what's up\nOkay well what's the uh I think the the rust belt back or the Democrats should consider swinging back he's forty chairs the only reason we lost\nThe Democrats have always supported Sarah ... when the reaction of the corporate Democrats any Bill Clinton didn't support terrorists but the majority of Democrats support terrorists would always have the the entire congressional progressive caucus supports terrorists\nUh Sharon Brown and other you know there's a Bernie I mean there's a whole bunch of Democrats who support terrorists always had Trump's stole that along with he was going to protect Social Security and he was going to protect working people he stole all that stuff from the Democrats and that's I think one of the reasons why he was able to get close enough that he could win\nYou know and I think you're right I I think the other the other thing that we could do is ... is support price caps for help their health care is very overpriced in America and\nPrice caps ... bring the cost down and I think that would be an issue that you get a lot of those with a lot of business do that here is overpriced families are paying too much and I don't think there's anything wrong with price so I think that's what it is just Medicare and Medicaid is the maximum that a doctor or hospital in charge for anything\nRight that's that's one piece of it I think the larger piece of it um and I'm I'm just this is just from my own experience back in the seventies Iran accompany Terry O'Connor in Iran to companies in Michigan where do they ever company and tear graphics and we had at at our peak we I I think Seventeen or Eighteen employees and we offered health insurance all our employees\nAt that point in time my recollection is it costs me around thirty or thirty five dollars per month per employee to provide full comprehensive health insurance to everybody and the reason why it was because in Michigan at that time and I think most states had laws like this\nIn Michigan it was illegal for health insurance company to operate on a for profit basis the blue Cross Blue shield that I provided to my employees was not for profit number one and number two in Michigan at that time it was illegal or on a hospital on a for profit basis who was also illegal to run schools on a for profit basis but let's keep us to health care\nAnd as a consequence in Lansing we had in medical which was ... owned by the county ... county which is ... you had the same uh same to St lukes I think any of this one named after a saint that was a Catholic hospital and there was sparrow hospital which was also a non profit and I believe it was sponsored by the city the city of Lansing\nAnd uh they have all gone for profit now and therefore we see in our costs exploding health insurance companies are for profit hospitals are for profit and and I think that saying this stuff is important let's go nonprofit is also an important way to do\nThis and we had a way to to solve this problem but great solution say thanks a lot for the call her really well done we'll be back his are coming up on forty seven minutes\nHas to be our sexually forty six forty right now\nWill be back in just a few minutes with more of
