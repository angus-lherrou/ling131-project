your\nCalls for the hour and a congressman Kevin and Kevin in Long Island New York at it on the line Kevin you're on the earth and poke you\nGuys are good afternoon it Kevin\nI was I just I've been hearing a lot about um you know especially\nWith Santa flight was was confronted by victims of sexual assault [noise] you know I'm a victim of a false fabricated sexual assault allegation that's a place that I could tell you that the Nineteen months to ... that I went through before that was resolved and I was exonerated\nWas the most painful most depressing and the most embarrassing time in my life and I almost lost everything that I worked hard for all those years you know just said that you you said you didn't appreciate the way the\nCardinal reacted to the Senate as well I'll tell ya I felt his anger because that's how I still you know and I feel it's unfair for\nSomebody to judge somebody else in that situation unless you're walking by and when their shirts and the other issue that I have is due process here you know if by the standards\nThat you know some people are advocating for where you know accusations are treated as fact I today would be considered a sexual offender or violence sexual offender for an act that I absolutely did not commit and I would not have any opportunity to be in the points that I Am right now\nAnd it hurts me to see that I see that within the bill of rights as ... writes due process you can't the person's life liberty without due process I don't see anything in there where there's a right\nFor a person to be able to have to have justice on every instance it happens but it's it to me it's a bigger deal and it should be a bigger deal to many Americans if you deprive person I mean the nearly full right over ... over you know\nThe fact that you're a victim of any crime may not get the justice that they deserve it's an imperfect system but the system that we have what differentiates us from\nOppressive regimes and all those dictatorships Kevin let's get the congressman's response\nYeah Kevin so first of all I mean I think it's horrible for someone to make a false accusation because you will go through something that um as you explained you yourself went through here here's the problem though and Brett Kavanaugh on his reaction\nHe was asked I think five times by for at least by five different senators and I thought Dick Durban nice I did it probably the most aggressively would you be open to an FBI investigation I think Kevin you would have been because you would have had your name cleared by a third party source and maybe not had to wait all that time\nBut the fact that he wouldn't you agree to it and they only did it after Republican potential vote Jeff Flake said he wouldn't proceed unless they did it tells me it doesn't pass the upper Midwest smell test you know why wouldn't you want\nThat third party validation which if he did nothing wrong or should have been able to come out so that's the problem and the difference\nI'm not saying that it's fair whenever someone has falsely accused but I thought she came across a extremely genuine and I thought his answers on a number of questions were untruthful as we all know from what that testimony that day but the fact that he wouldn't ask for the FBI to clear his name to me\nThat that alone a set an awful lot\nVicky in the upper peninsula of Michigan have achy or on the air is Congress in ...\nHi I'm I just had a question in regards to Cavanaugh I'm getting through or not how would this affect the gamble versus us\nI'm being that he would be the fifth one to then I'm pull over the separate sovereign or the double jeopardy where it wouldn't be able to be just federal it would be state\nYeah I mean I think we might have ... a little bit less anything if he gets on the court um you know he's a very solid fifth conservative vote for the court and um you know I think a lot of things are could be in jeopardy especially along\nThe choice and or some other lines that we saw maybe Justice Kennedy was into a pure a hundred percent conservative you know Kevin ... is and that's why they're fighting so aggressively for him\nSo in that ... in the gamble case though there then this guy has been charged by the feds and charged by a state by state by state court and he's saying that the the exception that was made to the double jeopardy clause in the constitution and the and I think it's in the Fifth Amendment\nUm that that exception and that was made a hundred fifty years ago by the Supreme Court that said that if you are prosecuted by the feds you can still and and and you are than part and\nYou can still or even found not guilty you can still be prosecuted by the state he's saying that that's that's several jeopardy and if they all agree that that's double jeopardy that means that if Trump issues apart and demand for it or anybody else\nThat man that that part and we'll work at the state level as well as the federal level and that's what's got a lot of people flipped out and bought a ... day after Anthony Kennedy announced his resignation\nAnd and that's kind of where I was going with it also just the fact that Brett Kavanaugh has said do you think is you didn't think you can go after president while they're in office for another reason that for Donald Trump provide some protection so those are a couple of more reasons why Brett Kavanaugh is especially\nUm troublesome or because he's one vote but he could be one very strong willed coming in with that attitude in a becoming more purpose in court\nYeah Congress and we're just a thirty seconds out from the brighter or at the bottom of the hour which is a heartbreak I'm ... how do you see this plane out\n[noise] um I I think you know the real test will be whether or not they have a full FBI investigation I think I was I was told unless they have the report done by tomorrow it's very difficult to do a friday vote and I assume they're going to want to make sure they talk to everybody and there's a lot of logical things that whether you're a Democrat or Republican if you're going to do the ... FBI investigation\nYou are right and I think there's going to be some debate about that I don't have the vote or not this week if they do it\nIf they knew you think it's going to go and go which way\nI well I think if they do that means that they do in this case it when they look\nGuys are taking your calls for the our hair on the program is the Tuesday edition of mid days mark we'll be right now\nYou're listening to the Tom Hartmann program called ... to ...\nNinety nine wanting you can check out Congress and poke hands website ... house that gun you can tweet them at ... folk and there'll be back with your calls right after this [noise]\n[noise]\n\nYou feel like the investment cards are stacked against you recently I discuss how corporations are buying back their shares to manipulate the market or the actual executives are cashing out the FCC verified corporate buybacks are hiding insider trading and just as casinos aren't built on when\nNeither is the stock market is called the welts transfer and you and I are the ones that Red Sox are high was a high downside and gold is low with a high upside right now gold and silver are bargains ever and the strategy by low sell high\nIf you want to make insider moves to hedge against the volatile market call my friends that idea I'm trading and find out why smart money is cashing out of high risk stocks for the safest currency ever created\nSpeak to an IT I'm precious metals expert and learn the smart money strategies and gold and silver ask for their free investment guide which outlines how you can use precious metals as your ultimate safe haven asset call one AAA only goal that's one triple\nA.

listening to be a TNN Wisconsin you're on the air with Congress in Tokyo\nYeah one thing I'm worried about listening to Michael Lewis interview which\nWas his book should be very very good his articles in Vanity Fair we're absolutely frightening [noise] but I think we're in a really grave situation if Trump doing something off the wall like you know parents wherever that would really upset China they would cut us off I mean other than you know the um [noise]\nStuff to make our missiles and everything but like everything you need in the hospital including our drop are from China is there something without appearing to social less you know that the government can do to put this in reverse [noise]\n[noise] yeah well I think Nancy and when it comes to China you know this is all very educated Donald Trump talks a real tough game a but don't forget you know when he became president that's when he started getting some the trademarks for his family businesses right with China and if you really want to address the\nIn my opinion one of the very biggest problems that we have in relation to trade with China its currency manipulation China is a a manipulator of their currency and you can have the best\nOf laws written or you can have tariffs in place and all that can be manipulated by currency and because of the power\nOf the financial institutions or that's not something we are going after so once again I don't even know if his rhetoric matches his actions because he's not going after what would really provide substantial change instead he's doing this chair for which there's a lot we could discuss on that good and bad\nA but he's not going at the real problem because of the financial institutions and if I can add Tom in NAFTA that's one of the areas I think they got weekend was around financial institutions also\nYeah ouch county in Lakewood, Colorado my senator name right\n... or ... yeah I did hear on the air with\nGood Hi there I'm yeah I did you get your take on this I I'm the Kavanaugh hearings and and he's not really on a ... a criminal trial is not a civil trial isn't it more or less a fancy job interview\nAnd they keep pushing it in his life not ruined if he doesn't get the job we'll probably go back to being a judge when he was doing before um\nI I just wanted to get your take on it of course we all know why they're pushing capping off but we're\nSending the rules of criminal and civil trial when he's really not on trial technically but what do you think of that\nWell I mean they're ... they're testing his ah the truthfulness his character or that's what they're looking at the right it is it's a job interview in fact I think one of the best lines from Saturday Night live wasn't in that skit they did of the the hearing\nBut later when I'm I think it's Michael J. ah said I'm generally if you're bringing up your uh drunkenness and a um a sexual assault in an interview you're not going to get the job writing and you'd think that that would be significant\nEnough the fact that these are the conversations and then when he lied to the members of the Senate on a number of definitions and trying to recreate you know let's face it he he told us he likes beer very clearly we know he likes beer\nI think I'm from his actions I've got the feeling he was a pretty belligerent a drunk when he was a younger person and that alone shouldn't be disqualifying\nHowever if ah there are the sexual assault allegations any lying about what\nHappened at the time on other things that certainly adds to the credibility of someone who is to be pointed to a lifetime appointment to the Supreme Court so I think all of these are valid or parts of the discussion that came out and I think you know hopefully the Senate Republicans actually look at it on its merits rather than just they're going to get this because it\nIt loses the Senate on November six and I think they make some huge mistakes and and also just you know on how you treat people I mean I hopefully this is putting a real emphasis on sexual assault and the me too movement I heard there have been a lot more people reporting sexual assaults because of this and maybe it's opening it up\nSo that people can be more informed about what's happening but I'm the oldest is fair game when you want to be on the Supreme Court and when you're lying to members of the Senate about even little things people have to question where you are and the bigger things especially when there's a very credible solve the accusation\nAmen gym in Chicago you're on the air with cars and poke yeah we have a minute and a half to break\nYes gentleman I have a quick question then is that it's not after both Kevin or anything and I apologize for that uh but I've been around about something for a long time and I thought maybe you could educate me is\nThere any law any thing in the constitution prohibiting us as a society from tapping interest rates at like ten percent banks stores credit card companies could charge ten percent and no more\nNixon was the one who took those laws down but it was it was kept a temper set up until Nineteen Seventy two congressmen Seventy one\nYeah yeah I I'm not sure of the year but yeah you can definitely affected I mean we still do often state by state on um predatory lenders on payday loan folks and others so you can definitely um regulate that\nYeah we have national nationwide used MRI laws federal ... kept interest rates have ... percent which one of the credit card companies couldn't charge more than ... percent they're charging thirty percent now\nYeah this is this is this is crazy as a\nPower in Washington is also crazy\nYeah we have about thirty seconds for the break it yeah I Do see any changes in us is there any

good question yeah they're they're withholding hundreds of thousands of pages of documents that virtually everything from the three years he worked in the Bush White House and again\nThe the the the

had a history of such sexual assault whichever expose could put him in a position where he can be blackmailed and\nWhat about the alcohol use where he said oh yeah I don't have an alcohol abuse problem or something like that\nWell he may be a high functioning alcoholic who was in denial you know that's a very very very common thing a lot of alcoholics or you know I don't have an alcohol problem I can quit whenever I Want but every single day they're drinking and say okay if you can quit whenever you want quit for the next three days they're like well I got reasons why I'm not going to do that\nUm and they really don't seek any kind of treatment or help or even try to quit drinking until it starts to impact their health until they start to hit bottom or their job or whatever I mean you know it typically takes some external factor because they're not paying attention to their own to their own experience I may be Brett Kavanaugh but you know that that's giving\nThem the most charitable interpretation of everything that I'm saying you know that he's now ... and knowledge in his own alcoholism\nRight and and the whole thing is that his denial or is the self serving in a way of ... ah in his own mind if no one else is an hour yeah in in that put ... in that situation\nYeah I think that may be the case and that would be by the way that would be his way of avoiding a perjury claim if he ever filled out forms you know for security clearances or other things or in his previous five or six or interviews and the FBI suggesting that he actually did not have an alcohol problem\nOr his defense would be well I really didn't think I had an alcohol problem I guess I Do but you know at the time that kind of thing but you know brand and this is the kind of stuff that we're just gonna have to wait to come out and if the Democrats take control the house of representatives in this election in November they will be in a position to start some ... in this kind of

five thousand four hundred six ... work in Texas a and spoke at a rally which featured a Willie Nelson drew a crowd of fifty thousand people\nWhoa [laughter] yeah for the stadium\nNo it was out doors wow now I've been keeping\nUp every time a Trump has one of his little pep rallies and if they are a little not been pulling up the rain has he spoken near the biggest arena here spoken in only held twelve thousand people and he's been saying that he's failing out twenty five thousand sea arenas\nHe's lying about all of that sure he even spoke this past summer\nIn a high school gymnasium in Columbia South Carolina feeding capacity three thousand\nSo when you see all of this stuff about oh Trump speaking in front of a huge audience so he's not\nRight these are these are crowds that Bernie

the one\nYou spoke with the music that was playing on the pay one he walked up to the podium where's the hallelujah chorus ... this thing is so stage so fake and so poorly done it is laughable\nYeah except that they accept that the rooms keep buying it and maybe that the numbers are small because the only people who are allowed to come into these things are people who have donated to the Trump campaign in the past uh which is their way of demonstrating their their undying loyalty so uh yeah and maybe they've\nGot to fill out a questionnaire and say will you cheer when somebody tells you to
