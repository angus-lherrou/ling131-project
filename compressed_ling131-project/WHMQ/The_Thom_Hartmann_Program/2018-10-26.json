like certified mail you open it up and it's encouraging you sign up for\nAn absentee ballot and if you do to flee did it and sent it in it might work but then all of a sudden you wouldn't have said it in anti to actually get that ballot because by the time they even turn it around the election or to be over\nRight it has a bold red letters must be received by November fifth the day before the

go ahead\nLove your show you are by far the best substitute that I've seen for Tom in a while um you know earlier in the week Tom was talking about Thomas Paine and so got me to do some research and and I thought well\nI Do some reading of ah ah what was it that the [noise]\nI'm trying to remember the name of the pieces that he's talking about but um it's about the votes in about ... you everybody gets one vote representative government it requires that you know we support the concept that\nYou can't buy the book the rich have no more right to take the vote away from the public that from the four right so it'd be Thomas Paine article in on pointed up as we speak\nTalks about what the dissertation or the principles of\nGovernment income let off with this comment about the most important right is the right to vote 'em\nThat's what Martin Luther king fought for the rights of\nWell I think the way that is written is the right of voting\nIt's the right to vote um\nMartin Luther king pop or the right to vote\nWell I think\nThe way that is written is the right of voting for representation in a primary right which are the rates are low from tech did the right to take it away is through refusing man it to reduce the slavery\nNow before that passage it speaks about the fact that there's always somebody trying to limit\nThe voting the voters access and that those people should suffer\nThe same penalty when they just restrict we're right a one person\nYou are ... they're right everyone yeah I hear ya I hear your\nJoe we're about to go to break and thanks for calling the

block voting is they can't win fair and in my own\nMy own reply was it goes deeper than that that what's happening in this movement is that keeping democracy for limiting the power and trench property going back to John Calhoun and then James Buchanan Virginia school is the essence of the movement\nThe opposition democracy is not merely tactical is raise on death row that the\nFight right now is

voting we have the same things going on when people have a negative votes tension in other words when they want to vote against a specific candidate\nThey're basically given the choice or casting a positive vote are casting a non vote there and we should be allowing them as being negative vote if they have a negative voting tension there have been people who are writing anything it's like against Hillary Clinton or not\nDonald Trump laid out a negative ... helped me helped me a dark how negative vote work I see on my ... and I just click know what happens in\nA while it's not exactly know what the you know you didn't have for example instead of just having Donald Trump bought the belly you would have for Donald Trump on the ballot and against Donald Trump on the ballot and again you would choose one just like you do now so if you choose against a candidate\nImmune system we have no you would give up your option to choose to vote for a candidate you'd only get one or the other unless we change the system\nBut no that's a dollar it's helpful or I should say doc the attorney voting systems although right now where I Want to harness attention is on the next nine days including what is happening to the six uh the uh what is happening on election day\nOr\n... I think a conversation with the big sort politically I Would call polarization I don't see exactly polls a but with the big sort geographically with those mix or racially with the big sort ideologically\nOr it is harder and harder to have a first pass the post system as constructed\nYield results I think working at the local level to transform mouse systems can work to broaden the conversation makes ... including voting systems that are kind of like approval voting which sounds like relatively similar or maybe exactly the same as what you're talking about where you can click yes on that we'd be like and knowing that you don't\nIs one way of doing it in fact star loaded\nWe'll voting which sounds like relatively similar or maybe exactly the same as what you're talking about where you can click yes on the baby alike and no one of the adult\nIs one way of doing it in fact started voting is on the ballot right now in Eugene Oregon little town happened to me the town I went to college and it and at a at at that in in that system you'd actually it certainly yeah can you help\nYou get five stars to Kansas you really like to start or you didn't and then the one with the most stars would win or do we have another time for another phone call the uh let's take Rudy\nAh it's beyond Donald Trump a lot of people think like him says Rudy from Atlanta Rudy go ahead\n[noise] hey man you know you you are really a good a good job um you're you're you're you're really\nYeah you ... pitcher to say that we should say\nUh yeah but\nDo you know Donald Trump is you it's a lot of people that\n... what's the word I Would like to use up a noxious just like him that think like I have no regard for no one else the spill but they are and and and and you know you call it a movement I call the ideology it's higher up people that ... like that\nYeah and and and it's all in the end is on the rise and you got a guy that's that that's the president and and you know those people are just attracted to that you can call her to coal but there are a lot of people that they like that and I mean I Do them at all and and and and ... and here's the thing\nYou know over the holidays here we need to stop we we have to find creative ways to go for these people are not found because every uh uh a group of race of people have them in their family we have to stop you know just saying hey you know or you just being crazy or go back to probe\nAshes uncle mailed out just how uncle bill top\nMan we got to cut that out we got to bring these people back to the phones to start making a faint right because if we keep saying hey are they are sick they are they just uh you know it's it's time to stop saying that I Love words are just crazy or they have from\nA man Rudy stay out of all let me stay on the liver apply to this real quick to both of the things that you said so the first one which is it ... it it's not just Trump it's a bunch of people\nAnd by the way that includes it too many moments ... me myself and my friends as a younger man and it is it is not only a movement is not only a cold is also cultural realities in far too many lives and and and I and I totally agree with you and the second thing is\nI have been an editor to add to experiences shame on me for one of them not quite shame on me for the other one\nThat that might that ... one of my uncles would say stuff that I'm not going to say on the radio and I would not disagree strenuously enough maybe to my credit I had my share of arguments about go I'm not going to say his name wouldn't be very nice maybe I should I don't know\nBut the but we would have some pretty strange but other times I'll well that's a circle John I don't want to ruin this particular Thanksgiving\nYou're probably right that we got to be willing to ruin Thanksgiving and if I'm invited back before Thanksgiving\nI might have a chance to talk of brain coach Brett or some really interesting thoughts on how to engage people including people who are close to you when you disagree how do you make sure you listened validate humanity but not tolerate things that are super contradict your values I really appreciate both points you gotta last saw Rudy\nHey man\nThat's just what it is all about this mobile chicken these people to decide and we'll just say oh you know we need to find creative ways to make people see that their\nThat their way of speaking it's not productive to society and it is is this has gone way too long in our society and we we just need to find ways to stop it because his children\nAnd men but the thing that ... seem to work some of the time I think it's probably one of the tool the biggest things just have a good motives an acting upon those motives\nThere probably lots of action them trying not to critique different types of activism I more activism but we need even that's not always the type I might engage in a ... keep a peaceful but generally speaking we need more rather than just exactly the perfect thing uh but one of the things that we would do that would seem to work as a somebody\nWet went over the line is we would tease them mercilessly\nAnd to me the thing is a little too bad because there aren't enough people being teased mercilessly\nFor their views and we make fun of somebody if they said some of the law you know we can tease about being ... everybody laughing and then they were the they were the person wasn't getting cultural approval and at least helping set the tone in our friends are more of a new that
