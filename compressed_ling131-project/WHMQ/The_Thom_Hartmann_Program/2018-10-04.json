for Kavanaugh for their own you know\nBecause it's going to deregulate the fossil fuel and it is going to declare the EPA unconstitutional\nBut the way it's not I don't think that the television

see the white\nFemale Republican were also feel like they have a stake in continuing this cat a paternalistic social order who\nDon't want to lose their status and they fifty three percent of whom

about and this is perfect for that argument in the near term\nI agree and if you look back in history you can see this over and over and over again from you know after the end of the civil war when

to I'm a chill and and then then you've got in the Nineteen teens\nYou had a good year sponsor and and uh I Believe it was General Motors is certainly go to your uh sponsoring legislation Jamaica camp illegal because the amp oil was competing with the fossil fuel oils and I believe standard oil was in on this\nAnd so what did they use to try to make their competitor illegal they said to white men\nThese Hispanic men are going to come and rape your when when they smoke there's no real won a this stuff from left to go back and then they got that they've got that knocked out and then in the fifties when my dad went to work in a union shop in Lansing, Michigan the message was the ... the the the unions were putting out\nWas we're only gonna hire white people because black people want to take your jobs I mean you know and and it wasn't just the Internet obviously I mean this was the message of the segregation is all across so this message or a NATO that you are white male villages under assault\nOr you know whether it has to do with your ability to to dominate the women in your life or their control your your economic future or whatever or all of these was you know negative and positive all of these things or have a nice to have a long history of being successful sales pitches to to white men and\nAll that and is it interesting that you know all of a sudden I think I could

program today a camera here's is in the in the studio with us we're gonna be trying out some winds and just a minute and cameras sitting here with me I'm Glad to have you with us pleasure to be here and we'll get to that and just say I want to start out by sharing this this story this is really quite remarkable and common dreams\nMaking abundantly clear that they will stop at nothing to destroy a net neutrality for good for telecom lobbying groups representing the nation's most powerful Internet providers\nAnd cable companies yesterday sued the state of California\nSaying you know how dare you limit our ability to exploit our customers [laughter]\nIt California just passed the gold standard legislation basically taking us back to where we were before ... pie and and you know the old varieties and lobbyist who's now the head of the FCC blew up the telco regulations that used to be that that uh the uh and and in fact on her Tom Wheeler who himself as a telecommunications lobbyists\nUm but he he got religion and he said okay we're going to say that the Internet is the same thing as phone companies phone companies are public utilities if you're talking on the phone to somebody the phone company cannot listening to your phone call\nWithout a court order and they cannot and if they could listening to your phone call and technically they can\nThey cannot say oh he's talking to somebody or business will charge him two cents a minute oh he's talking to grandma will charge him twenty five cents a minute you can't your phone companies can't do that they can't say the content flowing through here is something that we're going to base prices on\nAnd so the FCC said you know the Internet's pretty much the same thing as a public utility as part of the comments at something we all use we all need and and you know small and new companies needed to start up\nAnd uh the so that was the that was the rule until I pie blew it up over a million people tried to post comments on the FCC's website and the FCC ignored them they said oh gee we got a virus that wasn't virus it was a million people trying to say Cape net neutrality\nAnd occupy lied about that I mean we now know that easy basically you know a kind of walked it back in fact the FCC's trying to figure out what do we do plus there were all these phony comments on there and we and now we know that a lot of these actually were posted by box in Russia\nOn the FCC's website before the you know it is so so many of is a senator a twenty to the new law in California\nThis is a what a Evan Greer who spent on this program many times a deputy director of fight for the future said uh she said big telecom companies pay the California net neutrality bill because it prevents them from screw in their customers more than they already do\nIt so surprised that there is suing but it does make it even more blatant and clear that Jeff Sessions and hygiene pie or working directly on behalf of big cable and trying to block basic consumer protection legislation that passed with overwhelming\nBipartisan support so vast what's going on there um we're going to try something and we'll get we'll get to that I'm going to be getting to your calls in just a matter and and also I wanted to get into this issue of what the Trump Administration their new war on gay people\nAnd what I'm seeing because I grew up in that environment to corruption ripped it a shot and he's ... pitching Khomeini comes and she is act like ... and using religion and righteousness of religion to do so\nBut I'm I'm not seeing a very good future for United States chips continuing because I'd be that might raise those tell me this is not right I've seen corruption in my life I think they should\nI I was twenty five and I came here as refugees\nAnd I think we're going to be that poor walking the streets of United States without getting harassed typically\nSo Helen ... if if I may uh Mike Pence when he was governor of Indiana proposed and tried aggressively tried to pass a law and I don't recall that got struck down by the courts or whether it just didn't get past but it it provoked a nationwide movement called periods for pets\nWhere women were literally calling us as office every\nSo I have to worry the law that Pence wanted to pass was that if you have a miscarriage\nYou have to report yourself to the police so that they can determine whether it was a normal miscarriage or whether you might have been ... and if you induce that you're looking at five years in prison\nAnd we have now how did this story and two days ago in El Salvador there are literally hundreds of women in prison because they they in Nineteen Ninety three they made abortion illegal and there are literally hundreds of women in prison\nWho simply had miscarriages and some man and wife decided that they must have been to a certain abortion\nVirtually none of them they've got one or two who actually went to an abortion is most of these are were women and morning because they had lost ... you know when they were looking forward to a pregnancy and ah you know so when you hear about like\nThis law that Mike Pence tried to pass any still defending that by the way and the moral majority Jerry Falwell he's gung ho for this they want to do this nationally um uh Billy Graham juniors in on this you know
