but he's refusing to put them on the role or for that matter if she loses by less than the five hundred and Seventy thousand that he has purged from the voting rolls in the last year\nUm or or they

thousand sixteen elections\nAnd what can be done now and camp we like to the states for these kinds of activities but\nI think it candidly a one way we're probably over confident in our ability to win and two dozen sixteen I certainly didn't think Donald Trump would win and I don't think many people in the party he thought he would and so uh we didn't do enough\nUh and there was probably a complacency\nUh about uh how much people had already been in franchise and how much we had already won these voting rights battles and what we saw in two thousand sixteen was that's a very naive you and uh the voting rights struggle\nIs still very much alive so I think the experience of two thousand sixteen has made his woke people up and made people far more vigilant\nLetter in South Pasadena,

democracy dollars which would make uh every vote or a donor and what we've said is the way to\nBeat special interest money is give every voter fifty dollars that they can spend a as a credit on a

it will not put you in registration that's a separate form which we will hand the voter inside fixed as you can vote in the next election yeah\nBut you know and and we just can't we just don't want to

people from every party plus a people that actually work for the elections department but there are party representatives who are just regular old voters and they go through every single one of those provisional ballots to determine if something was massed\nSomething had to be done and some get counted and some do not but they are not tough their drawer they are done I have a really good friend

I'm not I'm not a fan I'm not you know I I don't know that much about his life other than a married came crashing right\nYeah ... and that and that's really what I wanted to to really say Tom I'm\nA that was a my observation and I'm certainly not of a professional\nOr in that regard in terms of a mental health but it it clearly looked as though but I have had a bipolar disorder and uh my family and it clearly looks that way a and it was really interesting the dichotomy because she was sitting across the desk from someone else who probably suffers from the same thing\nSo that was very interesting to me but what I Do want to say is that\nUh I have been listening to the right wing radio talking about how Kanye West is the spokesperson for black people you just mentioned that you're not familiar with them I'm not familiar with him and I happened to be one of those black people\nUh I don't listen to his music on the list\nSurging but he is by no means some ambassador to work for black people and it's always strikes me how it is who is it that decides who speaks for black people\nUh I never get these ballots I don't understand that but I Do want to say this you know\nAnd if ... lifting a I really hope that he will understand the damage that he has done to black people first of all to go into the uh uh Oval Office and and use the next politically like him at\nA at a you know and it given the stereotypes associated with black people and language was very very damaging and I don't know that a ... and again given his mental state whatever that might be\nI don't think he understands that understands that I I Want to tell you if I've got if you've got thirty seconds I Want to tell you something that happened to me very briefly for\nAbout a week ago I had to do some court filings are at a local court and went into the clerk's office and there was a white fellow behind me who I was quite long and\nThere was a black woman who was in front of us and she was all tattooed up and she looked like she came from a certain demographic let me put it that way\nAnd she was very boisterous and she was talking about how she didn't have money for cigarettes and she was a felon and she just got out of prison and I'm sitting there watching this display and I'm shrinking and I noticed white guys behind now he knows I'm In front of them he'd better not say anything\nBut at the same time I could feel him I could feel him wanting to laugh and saying to himself see how they are\nI Want to say to black people across this country I don't care what white people do we cannot do the same things because no one holds the history and status in this country that we do we cannot do what everybody else does Kanye West\nI think is it is a disgrace and I don't think the Democrats or Republicans I've ever served me well in this country so it's not partisan but what he did was very damaging\nCan you ought to be a thank you very much by the way I wanted to mention to

Randy and this is Dave where the founders of bomb makers of the most comfortable socks and the history of feet so comfortable we sold him donated over eight million pairs yes donated\nWhy we learned that socks and the number one most requested clothing either been homeless shelters so we started bomb us with the mission of donating a pair of socks for every pair we sell to donate and saw a lot of socks we became obsessed with comfort we reinvented the sock from the ground up using the best materials available like the\nSoft as in most comfortable cotton getting rid of what wasn't working like that annoying do seem you could probably feel if you wiggle your toes right now and inventing a few new comfort innovations along the way like our support that feels like a hug around your mid foot\nAt work people tried them love them told their friends about helping selling donate over eight million pairs\nTrying now at Thomas dot com Tom and get twenty percent off your first order that's B. L. M. B. A. dot com slash th L. M. bombs dot coms last time\nDo you feel like the investment cards are stacked against you recently I discuss how corporations are buying back their shares to manipulate the market\nOr the actual executives are cashing out\nThe little random cancer cells but the body's immune system routinely cleans up and and can be assisted in that process with pot or with lateral or whatever I Would be very careful I uh I just I Can't say that strongly enough I I Want you to live\nSo please please tell ... get some good medical help 'cause I Need to move along but thank you very much for the call I'm Sorry I Can't give you some good news thank you You're welcome chorus in high point North Carolina have Horace what's on your mind that's ...\nS a question ... capital sure uh I don't I was told that if you lied to the FBI that federal crime and if you lie to Congress federal crime shows since July ... why can't chew\nIn ... you can what is the opposite by the process is\nThat a majority of the members of the house of representatives have to vote to impeach uh there has to be first of all you have to have somebody draft the articles of impeachment you know which is basically a A N and an\nA A N indict you know it's so here's the crime he committed here's when he committed here's how he committed it here's the proof that he committed it\nHere's what makes it here a few of them all here are the window says this is our bill of impeachment you put that forward and that was some member of the house of representatives put that forward the speaker of the house then it has to you know a presumably goes through committee I'm not sure which committee but did go through a committee\nOr maybe judiciary and and then it comes to the floor of the house the speaker of the house in this case will be Paul Ryan would have to say yes I Will allow a vote on this and there's no way and help Paul Ryan's are going to do that but he may not be speaker and a few months\nUm the speaker of the house then says okay here's the boat\nYou hold a vote if the majority a simple majority of members of the house representatives\nVote yes then the judge Kavanaugh at that point would be considered him peach but he would not be removed from office he would still be a judge on the on the Supreme Court just like Bill Clinton and Andrew Johnson or both impeach but neither one of them were removed from office then it most of the Senate\nThe impeachment is merely a statement by the house of representatives that we think this guy is guilty and here is our proof right this is in other words it's like a prosecutor's opening statement in a trial that's what the impeachment of the houses and then I moved to the Senate where this side actually conducts an actual trial\nIs presided over by the chief justice of the Supreme Court who would be John Roberts in this case\nAnd in that trial the the there in the uh the person being impeached as an opportunity to present his evidence and you know no I'm not guilty\nThe the senators who uh agree with the impeachment with removing him from office you have to make their argument and then again if voters held and in the Senate to vote has to be two thirds so take sixty six senators\nIn the Senate and if that had an end in the case of Bill Clinton they only got sixty five they were I in fact actually maybe they got fewer than that in the case of Andrew Johnson they were one vote short\nAnd so a ... if you get the sixty six plus votes then Kavanaugh would be removed from office so it's a pretty high live tourist because of that sixty six vote requirement in the Senate that has built into the constitution is not something that you know the Senate majority leader can change by changing the Senate rules so\nI'm going to stay with you but being\nThe documents which have been produced shit\nRight and he had monitoring of our\nBody FBI the Democrats they take charge to go through all of these things and get him out of the ... and ... should do justice properly these things have to be done in\nMy I I I absolutely agree I think that you know it's been a long long time since anybody is held been held to account for lie to the Senate ah you know my my Senator Ron Wyden hey they the the tobacco executives back Twenty years ago lied to his face no senator tobacco is addictive under oath\nRight those guys should have gone to jail but they were multi millionaire so they didn't uh I agree with your is I think that it's time for justice on this but I'm I'm just not holding my breath or you know understanding the political realities of it'll Brenda in Atlanta Georgia have burned what's up\nI'm going to talk about that Kevin off and a director re defended his limited probe in it he goes on to say that it was a standard limited pride then he would not be Iraq on how much in the White House influence while he ask\nHer just as soon as\nHe just goes off on well the FBI is engaged in thousands of terrorist investigations right now I said here currently we're investigating a thousand terrorists case it costs American around the world and I'm thinking to myself\nWell if one in every woman has raped and supposedly the last six Iran one Seventy one man\nThat is a form of terrorism and children that are raped and repeatedly raped who had been raped by priest or\nDistant relatives or their spouse or whatever that is living in fear every day of your life yeah so and it's like he just dismissed it because we're busy investigating parents\nYeah it is it is I I agree\nBrenda this you know the the patriarchy is alive and well and and also the the Republican Party is alive and well they're going to protect their own no matter what like Roy Moore a you know I was just a poster child for those\nAnd ah which brings us back to horses conversation what do we do about it and you know one one thing that can be done is to is to impeach the guy but I but I I also agree with your point that we need to redefined terrorism the the you know nine eleven did not kill as many Americans as the tobacco industry kills every month\nUh nine eleven did not create as much terror as abusive or their husbands and fathers in this country and probably ... and certainly mothers as well as across and and other role and you know as you know happens every day\nUm we've got some serious I'm thank you brought up for pointing that out we got some
