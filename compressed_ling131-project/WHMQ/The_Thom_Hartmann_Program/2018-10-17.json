couldn't care and he said we create realities\nYeah although that was in a different context he was talking about you know we can convince there's weapons of mass destruction\nThis bill is saying because everything we saying here is what they controlled yeah they don't even have report you write about the pressures to train it happy but was political\nYeah well actually there was an economic downturn in twenty sixteen that that it wasn't only report it after the fact um because there was obscured by the rising stock market at and where I Am more proof that the stock market is not the economy Jesse thank you uh you knew your new good points all Susan in Brunswick, Georgia racism was up\nHey time I read an article in a in a magazine and I also looked it up on the government website and it seems to be true and I wanted to make everybody aware of it is it's called save the American workers act and you can look that up and what this is it's\nIt's a on it's going to get rid of the Affordable CARE Act and got that\nAnd all of that but the but in this bill that they're ready to pass what's also stuffed in there is any corporation and part people where they get their health care\nThrough their jobs companies whatever\nThat if you're working under thirty and thirty nine hours per week which a lot of companies uh people are still getting their benefits with those hours but now if you're going to work only thirty nine or thirty hours a week they are going to be allowed to get rid of your\nHealth insurance through your job which means\nThat they're only going to get health care to people that are going to be working over forty hours a week for most people don't work forty hours a week but they're still getting their benefits so they're going to get people working\nAnd most people don't work forty hours a week\nBut they're still getting their benefits so they're going to get people working at only thirty nine hours\nAnd they're not going to get any healthcare whatsoever fun they're a shot and I think this is super duper important and people need to be aware of that we are going back to the Nineteen thirties\nAnd one other point real quick kind if you would\nWell you know your guest on can you really on go over the on cutting of the Social Security and Medicare I Am in my sixties and that's something that's really weighing on me and just what exactly does that mean what age group are they heading and what are the Democrats\nYou know planning on getting that message out or just to be a little\n... the Democrat Susan are screwed scream bloody murder right now is just not being covered much in the media but uh you know the press releases I'm getting the notices of of town hall meetings and speeches and and you know the Democrats are flipped out about this number one number two\nUm if you're in your sixties you probably don't have anything to worry about odds are that they'll do it the same way Reagan to Reagan raised the Social Security retirement age\nFrom sixty five sixty seven but not in you know not in his lifetime right this was done in Nineteen eighty three but it only took effect this year we had our next year I think is actually the the the the big gear\nAnd uh although went up to sixty six a couple of years ago and so you know they'll do it like that they'll they'll do it so that the impact has not seen while they're running for reelection or the impact will be ... you know and literally one generation later\nSo it's the ... the how the young ... and the and the millennials who they're intending to screw their their the those are the ones that they want to they want to steal the money away from it and you know and yeah you know Reagan double the Social Security tax\nYou also my Social Security income taxable which reduce the take home page of pretty much everybody\nAnd you know all these other things so and and it doesn't surprise me at this isn't that the Republicans would a name a piece of legislation that is designed to make it easier right now and it depends on the state it depends on what kind of job do you have and there's all these variables and if downs but broadly speaking\nPeople who work less than thirty hours a week are generally not considered to to have any a legal right to demand benefits whereas people who work over thirty hours a week can and that's why a lot of employers keep people to twenty or thirty hours a week and you're and and you're right if they raise that up to forty\nA you know or thirty nine hours a week suddenly employers are going to go from you know twenty nine hours to thirty nine hours and you know again without benefits or anything and this is just this is the new reality in America\nOr at least if the Republicans continue to hold power which is why it's so important says thank you for the call\nWhy it's so important that we all get to the polls\nAnd the odds are you're voter registration period has closed or is closing today\nBut it's still a lot too late and it won't be too late right up through\nThe first week of November to double check that you have not been purged from the rolls by the Republicans yeah\nYoure

I mean look here's the lives of are made across the surface or\nHang on to say I got to find it here yeah here to\nThis this is a verbatim quote from Republican Congressman Tom Rooney of Florida it has to revert back to the way that it was sort of like the sleepy little classified committee that nobody ever hears about\nThis is the committee that just kept investigating Hillary Clinton over and over and over again you know from ... emails to to I mean you name it\nAnd and of course Mitch McConnell now has come out and said well over ... we saw those tax cuts would pay for themselves you know we're so but not only would it be revenue neutral it would be ... positive but we now have a trillion dollar deficits so we have to take on new entitlements\nSocial Security Medicare and Medicaid we just have to cut these things because we cannot\nYou know a Welsh on the uh the the billion dollar tax cuts that we gave to the rich people who fund Republican campaign to me there's no way we can get that money back from them so oddly enough by the way just little detail here and then I'll pick up your phone calls\nThe federal deficit for last year ... you know the fiscal year that the government's calendar year is not er the government's fiscal year the the budgeting near the year for the government\nIs not January through December it's it's October first to September thirty first so on October first we started the\nTwenty ninth teen budget ear for the United states\nSo on October first we started the twenty ninth teen\nBudget ear for the United states government which means that on September thirty first the twenty eight teen budget year ended and so now two weeks later we can look back at last year\nAnd see what the situation was and sure enough last year we had a three quarters of a trillion dollar deficit in just one year we added three quarters of a trillion dollars to our debt to our national debt seven hundred and Seventy nine billion dollars\nFor Republican policies if you got rid of four Republican policies we would've had a one hundred and fifty six billion dollar surplus now remember that\nWhen the Republicans started saying oh we've got to that we've got to cut Social Security and Medicare and Medicaid oh my God you know if there was no war in Iraq\nWhich we relied into by Republican president if there was no war in Afghanistan which a Republican president took us into\nA you know without needing to we didn't need to take down an entire country to get bin Laden fact Mullah Omar who ran for Afghanistan was perfectly willing to arrest him and turn him over to us this report in the Washington Post Bush said no I'd rather have a war\nWar presidents get all kinds of power you know\nSo if we didn't have a war in Iraq and we didn't have a war in Afghanistan\nAnd we didn't have the Bush tax cuts and we didn't have the Trump tax cuts for simple Republican policies and we didn't have those things this year we would have paid down the pay down the debt on the national debt by a hundred and fifty six billion dollars\nIn fact had and this you know this was an amazing statistic but had George W. Bush not done his tax cut\nAnd his two wars Afghanistan and Iraq\nAnd had Donald Trump not done a tax cut\nWe would have nearly paid off the entire federal debt by now\nBecause Bill Clinton left that kind of a surplus\nThat his breath take I mean that's just absolutely breathtaking so anyhow let's pick up some phone calls from David in Madison, Wisconsin David what's on your mind\nHey Tom ...
