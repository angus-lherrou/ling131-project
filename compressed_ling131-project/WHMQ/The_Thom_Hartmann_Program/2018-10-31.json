the you know I was talking about the the pernicious influence of billionaires on our society\nI started this west has long ago no billionaires dot com and uh well you know or the other one of course this is the big banks and I find that bizarre that state after state after state is is you know running literally billions of dollars in tax\nThe big banks and I find that bizarre that state after state after state is is you know running literally billions of dollars in tax money\nAnd you know other functions through their state every year and that money is ending up in banks in New York who are declaring massive profits ensuring huge dividends and multi multi million dollar salaries\nOr to their senior executives when and said that can be doing like North Dakota did and have a state bank that that just so that the profit from banking stays with the state now one of the ah advocates for this is Phoenix Goodman who is the co founder of public bank LA the website probably bank LA dot com you can tweet Phoenix good minute feeding\nPhoenix underscore good men just like Tom underscore Hartman Phoenix welcome to the program thank you for having me thanks for being with us tell us about a public bank LA and what's going on with a measure be on the ballot and in California\nYeah we're we're as as you mentioned ... working to create a municipal public bank\nA and it's a little bit different than the state bank because it sets a local level and that is unprecedented in the history of the United states\nSo we would take the benefits of recapturing the interest in fees that week that's currently extracted by Wall Street over public funds are and then bring that down to the local level now that's on the ballot on November ... it's measure be ah that that passes that's going to mend the city charter to allow the first step but most process to continue\nWhat we all ultimately hope to do is take a lot farther than Los Angeles we want to spark a revolution across the entire United States where cities everywhere start declaring independence from Wall street\nWhile I I mean it was to be an extraordinary thing are there are there any other public banks outside of North Dakota so far\nThere was one that was recently chartered in American Samoa as a matter of fact well I'm doing yeah where it it just happened very recently uh the one of the most notable examples is in Germany were forty percent of their banks are actually public\nUh and they did have a disproportionate effect on their green energy boom because they were able to provide\nFinancing for their solar infrastructure around the type of bugs apple that we'd like to see the public backing here to identify these important policy needs because everything requires money\nYou're not only want to feed what we need with with appropriate financing you want a star but we don't want like oil pipelines weapons manufacturers private prisons by moving that money away from Wall street\nWhen I Lived in Germany back in the eighties I use the post office for my banking initially as first month or\nThree until until I opened a regular check it out bank in a bank account and uh I I don't know Germany still has postal banking um but uh I Know it's popular around the world and Sanders has been talking about here in the United states\nUm that would be that you know sort of public banking a at the federal\nLevel I'm I'm assuming that post offices are purely federal institutions on a do I have that All right and be um why do you even need a measure me on the ballot in Los Angeles to allow a pie like banks to be set up by the city of Los Angeles\nOkay good question so sad to your first question also banking is retail banking see you as an individual would be able to the causes of your money into a checking account which is the public sector a you know bugs bank by what we're actually looking to do is create a bank at the whose whole\nCustomer is the city of Los Angeles when we pay our tax dollars when we pay for parking by that cetera\nThat get that money gets house or in a in a financial institution and in addition to that one of the city takes out infrastructure loans or they can get very expensive because over thirty year term or looking at spending a file\nTax dollars fifty per cent above the initial cost right all that's extracted the wall street so this is the public sector bang\nFor the public sector and that's the difference between what we're doing and also banking but we're certainly very for ... years well it's there's many colors ... I'm\nNot why do we need it on the on the ballot well there's a\nUm a a ... in the charter currently Los Angeles there's a specific language that that states that the city to not engage in Myrtle at a commercial enterprises in order to amend the charter\nYou do need to make a referendum or out of that to to uh to make that happen but it's been it's been great that that is the case because frankly\nI'm One of the biggest issues of of how do we get this to happen is\nWe had to create the consciousness and the public mind right off of one isn't and what the benefits are after two thousand and eight there were no really revolutionary idea is lying around so we basically resuscitated but those army that fail All right I'm In two thousand eleven when occupy came to the fore they were\nViscerally against the system the banking system but one of the biggest critiques about occupiers ... what is your specific policy agenda what exactly\nWhat is your solution yup and there and we believe wholeheartedly this is literally ... occupy crate with they needed is public banking\nVery specifically yeah and this and this is this is the recitation of that occupy to point do this time with an extremely focused policy agenda\nI Know I Know that a ... there's been some talk about the state wide public bank in California that that to be California is literally providing a something on the order of six to Fifteen billion dollars here profits\nFor the banks and in New York or at least that's the number I've heard correct me if I'm wrong if you know the actual number I'm that add where's that at\nSo that that has not done as far as the public backing movement although we're very forests California state bank as well a from a political perspective it's a it's a lot bigger or a bike to chew off obvious reason a lot bigger of an entity and we have to coordinate across the entire state to make that happen we're certainly for\nIt's already been on the agenda in two thousand eleven those by Jerry Brown I'm this time we do believe that that will end up succeeding as well but well we're focusing on specifically is bringing that to the municipal level to\nUs because we're going to ask them like a small community so you really have the ultimately the vision is banks everywhere Citibank city where most of the nation where turning banking from ... to some to a public\nLike his in Germany you sound like a plant Benny Goodman public bank LA dot com and hang on just a second here for many of them down and\nYou're listening to the Tom Hartmann program called

there's there's a there's just a bunch of stuff here they don't want to get too as we are as we continue through the day\nBut let's start out with your calls Christmas Salem Oregon and Chris what's on your mind\nIs home when we looked at Russell perks a conservative mind and we really you're still down to like the poor philosophy of conservatives and Republicans here an argument being made to eat billionaires like the Koch\nBrothers and Shelly Adelson and all the you know ... this isn't Alex Jones up there on the open the fence advocating libertarian economic it's not necessarily in bad faith that they've still is off if we believe them more stable societies\nAre she buys them ruling everything and all of us the poor ... that's not necessarily not in that faith and looking out for what's their core philosophy is\nYeah I wasn't I wasn't saying that they were acting in a bad thing is certainly acted in their own interests\nYou know they're they want to do the things that will make them richer and you're you're I think your point is well taken Chris oh for people who don't know we're talking about here are also Kirk and Nineteen fifty one or fifty two wrote a book called the conservative mind and this was the the books they kicked off the modern day conservative movement in a really really big way and\nIt was a fifty one or fifty two I'm I Am I just said sixty one or six to excuse me and\nAnd uh in in the conservative minded and this was the books that got Russell ah the ah the to William Buckley going this is the book that got Barry Goldwater and on ah this this is what they got my dad going I mean you know other than he thought was\nThe head of Enron and it\nIt it in fact it opens quoting the British Conservative from the from the late Seventeen hundreds you know talking about you know how people who are not wealthy should not be allowed to vote and you know one of them\nYou know there's a lot of flowery language in ... in the conservative mine but you know at its core basically what he was saying was look out\nIf this middle class thing that Franklin Roosevelt started back in Nineteen thirty three with the new deal\nThis this idea that every every person every ... you know every family should be able to be sustained by one person typically the husband but you know one person in the family working in a forty hour week\nAnd taking a couple of weeks of vacation every year and being able to own a house and being able to buy a car and in all these guys you know that middle class grows\nAnd becomes the the the the those are the largest part of American society\nThey're going to start getting opposite he they're gonna start at they're going to start demanding things are going to start asking for more of our wealth\nThey're going to start wanting socialism and we've already seen the first cracks in this with Social Security\nThe first major socialist program in the United states that you know I'm and I'm not that's not in my opinion it was Russell curse\nAnd and you know he doesn't explicitly lay it out but it's certainly there between the lines in the book that the most stable form of political system is what England had at the time that Charles Dickens was writing and Charles Dickens in this very well his father couldn't pay is definitely got thrown in debtors prison\nOf political system is what England had at the time that Charles Dickens was writing and Charles Dickens into this very well his father couldn't pay is that they got thrown and debtors prison\nAnd Dickens wrote during a time when England had not minimum wage laws\nBut maximum wage laws and it wasn't for the rich\nIt was maximum wage laws for the working poor so that they wouldn't become the middle class\nMiddle class was considered a dangerous thing the the the British middle class was literally screwed you morally\nIt was small business people doctors and lawyers that was it that was the British middle class in the in the nineteenth century\nYou had a very small ruin a late that was very wealthy and held all the political power you had a very small middle class the largely served which the ruling elite\nOr providing goods and services to the working poor\nAnd then you had the working poor who could not get out of poverty because of the maximum wage laws and that's the conservative worldview that that is that is how you have a stable society and by the way we actually know that they're right that actually does produce a stable society\nEngland didn't have a revolution and waited\nAnd waited and Seventeen Seventy six because and little class it emerged\nPeople say oh Jefferson Madison or all those guys they were all ... and you know rich people insanely rich people you know Jefferson died in in a bankruptcy and George Washington died and it broke a in visited Madison's wealth did not even sustain his his uh his heirs\nThe wealthiest man out there who signed the declaration of independence was John Hancock his wealth in today's dollars was seven hundred thousand dollars that's how much she had these guys were the upper middle class they were they ... you know yeah they had big houses but land was cheap\nI mean the land was functionally free and it had a lot of what I now is functionally free\nAnd you know exploiting slavery as they did in the southern states\nAnd exploiting immigrant labor indentured immigrant labor and in most cases as they did in the northern states because so many people are flooding in North America at the time there were lots and lots of people who could cut those trees down and provide you with cheap wood to build a house housing was cheap\nAnd frankly those houses weren't all that big if you look at you know the British Squires their houses were much more elegant than modern ... in fact the thing that amazed me when I visited my cello was how small it was actually\nSo you know it was the middle class that the perpetrator the revolution here in the United states is so you know yeah Russell clerk was absolutely right anyhow enough of that ramp man in Chicago a main what's on your mind\nOr how you doing I'm yeah I'm Out just a one to make a couple of points yeah like a a ... we have to uh uh uh how much do democracy here in the ...\nAnd one of the is a good little trickle down to rake moon economic yeah and and and another one is a a good little electro college did you have one the one woman\nOne vote there you know and and then you know taxes the big and as you know what democracy snake\nIs is something that should be done I mean what what is the all this money they have is just what I did die and say well look I had X amount of billion dollars on my face you know\nI think it's a mental illness you've heard me say this beforehand but I think these guys have obsessive compulsive disorder I think that they you know like people who can't stop washing their hands there hoarders if if\nIf I had not been if their if their daddy had not been a

Adler who's going to be in charge of the Judiciary Committee that will be on\nTV a whole bunch 'cause there'll be doing a lot of the hearing so the good news is Albert or we will have progressed as in key positions of power that will absolutely be making the news um or even a corporate media is still difficult at times but they're gonna be in positions that they can't be ignored\nAnd uh also Albert I gotta tell ya you know I I agree with you on the issues that move millennials on campus yesterday I think something that surprised a lot of people\nI went through a few few issues uh and we had a chance back from people to see on ten city and you know let them know to get out those early vote rally when I talked about legalizing cannabis you should have saw the extra response that we got and in Wisconsin and a lot of places on the ballot in in a lot of counties in Wisconsin\nIs legalizing candidates or a medical um marijuana and we need to make sure we're talking about a lot of different issues but that's one that you know I think a lot of politicians often don't want to talk about unless they're from a state with it\nAnd yet I I'll tell you it's what real people do talk about you know they're negative people being incarcerated for it so I I think we are trying to make sure that we're listening to the millennials and talking about issues that are important in addition to those folks that are going to be part of our leadership\nGrade one minute to the break share and you've got a quick question for congressman poke in from Madison, Illinois\nYeah I Do so my question remains um Trump has been pretty much been using his fully policy it's from the day he got elected and um\nMy question as um Trump has been pretty much\nBeen using its pull it out there from the day he got elected and um and has been getting his message out there to keep his momentum going how are we as Democrats\nA combat in there I remember with President Obama they spoke about the ball they play that trauma ... drowned out everything else that was um going on\nAnd they keep doing this with a lot of other issues so how are we as Democrats sightseeing back to um get our message out there on drought and their messages out which basically it's nothing\nBut if you're going to get together and the bad news of it I give you the bad news first it's always tough whoever the president is going to get a thousand times more coverage or at least a hundred times more coverage than any individual Democrat because\nWe don't have a single person that chair you know Democrats are but the good news is we're all in unison I'm Talking about health care jobs from Washington enough that that is being the national narrative but I think that's positive I haven't seen that tree this past election\nBut yeah it seems to me though is that my parents are saying look around on the other good cars and taking your calls for the hour here on Mondays are more likely\nYou are listening to the Tom Hartmann program

that's neat and our I'd ask dot com crash medium\nProtections at the border so all of this talk we don't want a giant wall the cost of billions and billions but you can have and should have extra protections at the borders but also we need to have a pathway to citizenship for aspiring Americans who currently are here you can't neglected Thirteen million people\nAre undocumented currently live here we've got to figure out how to deal with that right now instead of dealing with is trying to tell you there's thirty five hundred people in the caravan who might in six weeks\nGet to the border so we're sending troops now\nAgain in election ploy to try to deal with it the issues they're saying that were that we want to let people in to give them benefits all the rest it's so ridiculous\nThat I'm surprised anyone actually believes that but Donald Trump has done a great job in a line about this telling you not to believe the media were telling you the truth uh instead just listen to Donald Trump does he'll\nTell you the people who are not ... are not eligible or who are not here legally are not eligible for any of\nThese benefits it's still paying their taxes benefits but they don't get anything\nFor it so we got a net gain but Paul Ryan even yesterday in a very rare occasion you get this about you know less often um you know it but once a year from Paul these days\nSaid the president was wrong and trying to do the birthright citizenship issue because it takes a constitutional change and again Donald Trump is lying about that so let's\nHave a better process for the people who are currently here let's protect our borders in a better smarter way using technologies are but we can look at what they had just two sessions it go and work off of that and not have to go for all the fear mongering at this president and Republicans in Congress are putting forward\nIt sounds to me like what you're suggesting something very similar to what Reagan did an eighty six and the the one thing that Reagan or the one change that he made was prior to eighty six if employers hire people who are not here legally the employer\nBut one thing the Reagan or the one change that he made was prior to eighty six if employers hired people who are not here legally the employers themselves\nGot busted they could go to jail at huge fines and as a result of that the entire construction industry was wells unionized the meatpacking industry was getting paid really good money was while unionized Reagan's stopped enforcing\nThat law and no president since Reagan has been has has started in for installing the books but no president has seriously enforce that\nAnd Trump is neither everybody criminalizes the individual people who are you know looking for a job but not the employers who are hiring them\nAnd so the construction industry has lost you know it's become unionized largely because of non citizen labor the meatpacking industry same thing in fact they're running ads in newspapers down in Mexico looking for help for the meatpacking industry up in up in the upper Midwest\nWouldn't and important progressive part of that be to start enforcing those laws putting white employers in jail instead of you know brown and workers\nAre absolutely in fact right now of this allows not only does it hurt all workers or because of they're able to treat some workers differently but also they're taking advantage of people because if you speak out uh then you can be deported so you actually uh I'd in some ways have almost\nI'm borderline slave labor conditions in in places because the workers can't speak out so again and that hurts all workers so there's a lot that we can do and we need to do but we have actually a pretty good framework we can go back to just a couple of sessions go pass in a bipartisan way out of the Senate and that would be a great start\nYeah and I should I should add by the way as you there's there's a fair amount of evidence that indicates that the reason Reagan stopped enforcing that law was specifically to destroy the unions in the United states and sure enough and in multiple industries that's exactly what happened Paulette in Allen park Michigan you're on the air with congressman poking\nUm hello Hi\nHi I'm I'm a transgender woman I've spoken to you before time about a year ago you might not remember\nBut um I wanted to ask the congressman about this thing that President Trump has been talking about where they're talking about a racing um transgender people's identity\nUm I I'm someone that had surgery and I'm legally and medically female I had been at the time my gender ID on my gender America on my ID I my driver's license\nI'd had a whole bunch of things change but I haven't had my birth certificate change can you tell me um it\nCan he do anything ... ... in reality to hurt us transgender people and what can be done to her stock him when the voting transgender\nYeah Paula thank you for the question the second part let me answer first the way you stop him from whether it be banning people who are transgender serving a U.S in the military or a issues like this\nIs you get everyone you know out to vote in November six so we flip the house representatives and it's going to be a lot harder for him and try to flip the Senate or to get anything done there's a lot of things he says he can do that he'll very likely be challenged in court because again he doesn't actually have the power to do\nUh like we saw with immigration like we saw the challenges when he tried to ban transgender Americans from serving in the military so you know I think what he's doing his election time he's putting up everything that he thinks is fearful\nFor some people that are in his base\nThrowing it against the wall and unfortunately are all too often the Republicans have used the transgender community whether it'd be the bathroom issue or the religious liberty law and being able to not sell\nThings just certain people our most recently what we've heard he may be doing these are all issues he's doing to try to get his base out because he as they're not all that excited about him with family separation another issue so polite be politically active get everyone you know to be politically active and uh if we can have majorities in the house the Senate\nThere's an awful lot we can do to make sure that a lot of these threats he puts out there will never be reality\nMerkel's how far we've come and how far back we could talk on this is really scary I mean when you share a story we come back out of the

like we always lose in these ties to a\nRunoff sheer I don't understand what we lose this time\nWe are finished it as a party the way I look at it well\nWe'll see I I'm not willing to to throw my hands up and and and freak out Donald but I Am very concerned about what's going to happen here the two major variables are both largely structural variables that we can't do anything about until we control the mechanisms of power which will be at least two and a half years from now\nUm and you know 'cause you have to control the White House in the Senate but basically these these these mechanisms that are being used our voter suppression\nNumber one a we know you know and it was constantly through a hundred and some odd thousand people off the voting rolls and then with the id law forty four thousand people a you know showed up to vote and weren't allowed to 'em and and Donald Trump won Wisconsin by twenty thousand votes for\nExample so you've got the voter suppression number one I'm as as a structural thing and number two you've got the Supreme Court having said that billionaires can throw all the money they want a new elections and right now you are watching the ads on TV that are\nFunded directly or indirectly by the Koch network network and other right wing billionaire Shelly Adelson just put thirty billion dollars a million dollars and\nUm yeah the Robert Mercer and his daughter back or putting money in a they're the ones who brought Trump to the White House um and so as long as we have the system where billionaires can pour money into elections\nAnd wear red states where the ... states controlled by Republicans can continue to throw people off the voting rolls willy nilly with no consequences of any ... you know no legal consequences\nIt's going to be a damn hard left\nBut the fact of the matter is Donald as you pointed out in the in the presidential race in twenty sixteen Hillary Clinton won by three million votes and that doesn't include voter suppression if you were to include voter suppression of all the votes that people are trying to vote for Hillary Clinton and were turned away at the polls because they've been purged or they didn't have the right id I'm guessing it was probably closer to five\nMillion issue one by fans and number one number two only about forty percent of of of\nPeople who voted for the United states for their for a United States senator in the twenties it in a lecture voted for Republicans and yet the Republicans control the Senate because two senators for these little tiny red states and then in the house representatives it was about forty seven\nPercent of of you because of gerrymandering got affects\nYour listening to the Tom Hartmann program called jewel to fade away Ninety nine twenty but the only\nWay to fix it is to have political power and right now the only way to get that is to show up in the past [noise]\n[noise]\nTake one out of a diversion and bond with one atom of oxygen and\nYou

thank you thank you thank you so much for being with us today Douglas Robinson a silently dash publishing dot com is the publisher and silently series are the vampire ... that Douglas wrote a let's get back to politics here in John in Niles, Michigan hey John what's on your mind that there\nAre times ah yeah it's uh as far as uh you know the dependence on fossil fuels which uh you know as a major factor in global warming ... well ... why not to you know look into improving the electrical grid like a Manhattan Project\nTo build a hundreds of solar farms throughout the southwest Arizona et cetera even in Mexico and perhaps even using some of these poor folks that are fleeing um repression in ... in Central America to uh give them a temporary visa to to help build some of these along with the U.S is\nYeah I I think that a a W. P. A. level project to Seoul arise and wind dies in the United states is a brilliant idea or are you familiar with John with the a hundred thousand rooftop project that the Germans put into place in the in the late nineties early two thousand\nI'm a a little bit not not a not very\n... let me just summarize a real quick because I it's been a long time since I've done so and and I think it would be a brilliant a model for the United states now is easier for the Germans to do\nI'm a big cause the er at about forty percent of their banks are public banks and they were they were the ones participating in this but uh you know we can we can backstop even commercial banks in the states and do this\nBut basically what they said was um they wanted to the power company and knew the German the power system\nKnew that they over the course of the next Twenty years we're going to need to build two new nuclear power plants they had basically and they were committed to know more coal fired power plants and and they don't have any oil or Germany only has coal\nAnd uh so uh what they did was they said okay what's the cost of two nuclear power plants you know what's it going across the ability to to do their power plants and they they ... so just you know\nPut that in your head from it and so then what the the the deal that they worked out was they said to the banks if any homeowner wants to build a solar array on their roof\nYou will finance it at two percent and we will one hundred percent guarantee that so that two percent is going to be a hundred percent guaranteed profit to you the bank so you don't have to go to four or five six percent because you're not going to have bad loans to worry about so you get that two percent\nNow wants to ... once people have put these things up on their houses they borrow ten thousand dollars and they put a solar around their house they're generating electricity then the government said to the power company\nYou're going to buy back that electricity that that electricity being generated off these rooftops you're going to buy that electricity from these people for seven times the normal retail price of normal electricity is going for ten cents a kilowatt hour you're going to buy it for Seventy cents a kilowatt hour because that's the amount\nThat when you take the cost of two nuclear power plants and you divide it up by all the ... the the the actual gross number of\nInstallations that would be required to generate the two megawatts of power that those two power plants will be creating or whatever it was that's what it would cost so at ... at the end of say a ten year period when all these mortgages have been paid off and and then and then the power companies\nAre just pay a one to one you know whatever ... if you sell it back you sell it back for ten cents a kilowatt same price you're buying it for to actually less than that we can get the point so at that point um you now oh in the solar system you're now delivering the solar power you paid back the bank the bank has made a profit\nThe the uh\n... and the government at the cost of two nuclear power plants has more electricity than to nuclear power plants would produce that was the idea and in fact I by the ... in a a Barcelona\nClaire power plants has more electricity than to nuclear power plants would produce that was the idea and in fact I buy in ... in a a Barcelona, Spain I share the stage with the with one of the two legislators his name was Schmidt\nWho wrote this law and he and I did a presentation there I was talking about ... mentioned sound like the ... maybe ten years ago\nAnd that was so successful\nThat they generated so much electricity that it was like the equivalent of more than ten nuclear power plants and just a couple of years and they were planning for two power plants over a ten year period so many people jumped into it 'cause hey no risk and cost right\nAnd it works out for everybody everybody wins they were so successful at that that they had to stop the program because their grid and couldn't add all all the solar electricity that was coming into it and so now Germany has going through the process of rebuilding their entire grid into a smart grid so\nThat is you know that kinda decentralized part of the power companies want centralized power they want to have a giant wind farms where they can take one power among the line from it and sell that electricity or house now or one giant solar farm where they can sell the electricity into a city\nBut this way everybody owns there aren't electric source and it's it is incredible and in ... and not only producing electricity really really cheap\nUm there was a day this last summer we're we're Germany produced a hundred percent of their power and they were on their trans electricity and everything a hundred percent of their power simply from solar power\nUm and Germany by the way as the cloudy is country in Europe there cloudy or than Michigan where I grew up where half the interests I F R\nSo that's how they did and John and and I think the you know if we combine that with a WPN kind of program like you're talking about\nWe can kick this thing you know we can make this happen in three or four or five years and it would produce and industrial ball in the United states manufacturing the solar plants I mean you know so yeah I ... and that's a great idea and\nAnd uh you know I think that we should pull it off I think you know Germany can do it we can do it come on we rebuild\nOur country we help them rebuild their country
