have to do anything about climate change\nSo I'm I'm a registered dietitian and um I work with a special the population and I tell them to eat a lot of meat love this has really been bothering me\nAnd so I'm Lee one of the things that we can do as\nYou know and in fact as protests and we can do it immediately we can do it today is we can decrease the amount of animal protein outreach\nYup and that will help the actual missions that will help our house that will help our pocketbooks and it's also a form of protest and it doesn't matter who you are and what you do and I you know and I do realize that you know there is food insecurity\nAnd in the country and different pocket and I think\nAside from that knee control we can control we eat ... you know and making protests by what we eat and so I just wanted to give your listeners I'm a little bit of guidance on how to do that because all it over told his decrease your meat or whatever so\nBeef lamb have the biggest um carbon footprint right so I'm basically if we can all reduce\nOur protein our our animal protein intake chi chi two servings a week\nYeah I'm I you know I I I I I I became a vegetarian when I was sixteen but I always ate dairy and five six years ago or we pretty much stopped eating dairy other than you know maybe a a a little bit of something that shows up I played in a restaurant\nAnd ... and ... and starting maybe I don't know ten years ago when we moved to Portland I'm wasted Louis I started eating fish once a month and so I'm basically a Vietnamese fish once a month and\nI feel great I mean it was just like getting rid of a dairy products was just it really made a difference in in my opinion from my own home\nAnd and my blood pressure and everything else so it's like there's good health consequences to listen and there's all kinds of grain for vegetables out there and things you can eat and the less processed food the better processed food has a high carbon footprint and it also causes cancer Kim

I don't want anyone don't want to be in charge of it to my my opinion the most to run this country they are but I'm going to the end of the rich\nJust with you the rich yeah those four things let's we somehow work through this to over ... to get to get over those um significant markers I honestly don't see how we pushed for\nI think the way I think the way to do it Ricardo is to lift up and this is what Lyndon Johnson started with a great society cut poverty in half in the United states in ten years and a lot of at cutting of poverty was happening and minority communities\nUm ... if you view white privilege as well if you view male privilege editor wealth\nAs we bring up women as we as we bring up minorities and say okay we're gonna we're gonna make you as a you know have as much wealth whether it's in the the kind of power wealth essentially that's associated with white privilege or whether it's financial wealth\nYou know they go hand in hand now as we bring those as we bring these things up things will get better but the pushback what has happened is that the Republicans are basically messaging to basically white men\nUm but also some white women um because they're doing it about white in us as well as about gender but the the main message to white men is\nThat wealth you have a viewer male privilege and your white privilege then Democrats particularly the Democrats of color want to take that away from you and they want to have their own privilege they want to have\nThey want to have it so and this is the you know the ... the whole coated thing about quotas and and ah you know that kinda stuff the the black people on a habit so they have more privileged white people have now and you are going to end up on the ground with their foot on your throat and that and this is the sales pitch that has been going on\nThat has been used by by racist and bigoted white people in politics\n... for for\n... four hundred years you know I mean for you know since the since the uh since the initial invasion of this country and that's what that that is that that is the\nCancer this in our blood stream right now that we need to exercise and and you know you did a great job of identifying the pieces regard of sexual I'm going to call ... to me I'm Serious there is\nSo much work that we've got a new way start by identifying what's happening and calling the doctor\nAnd waking people up to what's going on with it so that when they see these Republican racist as they go oh it's a racist and\nYou're listening to Tom Hartmann visit Tom Hartmann ...\nAudio and video our guy goes friday back with more of your calls right after this [noise]\n[noise]\n\nSummer as this and I've got the perfect formula to help out and wind camera and his ultra premium one can't purchases direct from boutique wineries no middleman\nAnd bottles that keeping his sources secret so he can pass the stadiums directly to you often forty eight percent less than you pay for the same wine at retail shipped right to your door so I Want to count as news six bottles sampler packed\nThe luxury mixed sampler regularly Ninety five dollars is now eighty one or the elegant red sampler regularly a hundred and one dollars has now just eighty five bucks the way that I tried a lot five sixty seven the Napa cabernet fantastic definitely a deep full body rich red wine just spectacular for a limited time\nYou can get Fifteen Percent off one of the new radio makes sampler packs plus free shipping go to C.

read what's on your mind\nHey Tom how're you doing good what's up I'm\nJust another day in paradise I just want to get some feedback from you or possibly some of your uh many callers that you have in reference to who decided that white is not a color you know you hear so much about uh\nPeople of color on and off to several different our managers and a\nLight a lot of people considered white and black both neutral color tan could also be neutral so I just wanted to kind of get some feedback on who decided that why isn't a color they are and why it didn't it considered it color thank you for your time\nShare thanks bred for the call I Would I Would refer you to an old riff on this by Gregory um are there have been many of them um and and in fact he once said to me when we were traveling in and Germany as I recall on her way over to your gone to the to is is that I don't know why are you all don't call yourself pink people you know I'm\nWhite and this is a it's a you know obviously I'm not white I'm tan\nOr or or a little bit of orange or paint or something like that I mean it's a but but the reality is the white nose is a social construct its is basically a rule that we create and for society the people whose skin looks and this particular way\nGet this particular set of privileges and and uh then prerogative\nWhereas people who have more pigment in their skin dumped\nAnd the\nAmount of pigment in the skin varies from person to person so you know you you all the way from a you know been Native Americans and through Asians through the Hispanics through African Americans and and there's all you know spectrums within every one of those groups\nUm but you know I I people of color is a term that has been largely adopted by\nCommunities of people of color themselves as a way of saying you know we have solidarity with each other essentially African Americans have solidarity with Hispanics Hispanics have solidarity with Asians at all but collectively a Native Americans on these these groups have a certain amount of solidarity in that they have been excluded\nFrom the wealth of white privilege\nAnd so therefore those terms or to the best of my knowledge Dominic in our guy on the arcade Dominic what's up\n[noise] hey John always great to hear your show and I was just referring to the call that you'll be ... who was doing contract and and comparing with what if the roles were reversed I wasn't sure that you may have misunderstood I took him to say um that\nWhat you feel the same way I mean the idea that you wouldn't part of that weight is you're not understanding what that much and I walk in you as you know you you you you want to demonize\nYou know people from Brazil and Mexico and China so what we're trying to get into our borders and wouldn't you if the circumstances were the same here tried to go elsewhere\nTo care for your family and the answer is yes but\nYou know I'm every human being would do that so yeah I thought it was a kid on that because you should\nHave been about how horrible wage of ... especially is region so that's why I took a little bit worse than you are taking pictures you're there you're spot on I mean that argument just like\n... years now about the ocean waiters in color I heard that I Know where that goes you know do a um it just because that that rhetoric of either\nOutward racism or underlying races you know to to say you're a judge and it's just a big huge huge rabbits not care about what the world is shut up very very oh\nNo absolutely and and what I'm saying is you know is that the caller who said what if the roles were reversed the essential question there was\nUm if we maintain a system of a political and economic class system based on race where instead of white people being the over class essentially the wealthiest in the country the best paid in the country the ones that I was privileged\nInstead of that what if it was black people and white people were the victims of that kind of a class system\nUm and that like I said that's what white racists of unsettling to fearful white people forever as you know black people want to reorganize society\nUm and that like I said that's what white racists of unsettling to fearful white people forever as you know black people want to reorganize society so they're on top and you're on the bottom and that's not what I'm hearing from black people and that's what I'm hearing from from Hispanics and that's what I'm hearing from Native Americans what I'm hearing from them as let's\nDo away with aid\nEconomic and political and cultural system where one race is on the top and other races or on the bottom let's just do away with that and lift everybody up\nAnd and I think that that's you know at the end of the day I think that that's actually possible I think it's going to take us a while to get there but I think that the millennial generation right now of of white kids are starting to get this and certainly the the millennial generation people of color are very very aware of you know those are those structural stopped has\nBuilt in as people of color [noise] probably largely always been aware of it as you know because it's ten\nDrops on their hands on the LA so Dominic thanks for the call so what do you know I I think that they're like [noise]\nIt's almost a false argument and not you know and not entirely to Alamosa malls argument to say oh my God you know what if things were more reverse well you know it would still be corrupt system we need to change the system\nYoure listening to the Tom Hartmann program called too old to NATO away\nNinety nine twenty five\nAnd I realized at one of the ... you know the racist claims as well let's just all the you know race ignorant and\nThat's how I got to

thing I just uh you know and for those of you just tuned in I I I played this in the last hour um this is ... ... there's so much boiled into this thing this is like the Republicans using\nOr taking the Kavanaugh thing and saying oh yeah you know Christine foreign was lying about Kevin are trying to rape her and you know a damaged his life Bloody Bloody blah and therefore we've got to be outrage and then slipping racially and saying and therefore\nWell actually just listen this is this is this is not this is a Republican at\nWhy do you think about what's happening in Washington\nCongress may French and the Republicans know that it's dangerous to change the presumption of innocence to a presumption of guilt especially for black me if the Democrats can do that to a white justice at the Supreme Court with no ... no cooperation and witnesses including her best friend said didn't happen\nWhen white girl lives on them now why Democrats will be linked him black folk again turnout always told my son don't be messing around with that if you get caught she will crime rate\nI'm voting to keep ... care and the Republican because we have to protect me and envoys we\nCan't afford can they'd white Democrats take us back to the bad old days race Burdick life sentences Atlanta\nAnd one white girl screens right paid for by black Americans\nSo presidents by black Americans for President Trump that this is this is like bizarre I mean he had all this stuff's stitched into into one place and uh and and and then the Nate said the you know it reminds him of Emmett Till I mean then that whole situation where Caroline and what's her name\nInto one place and uh and and and then the next to the you know it reminds him of Emmett Till I mean that that whole situation where Caroline and what's her name\nDon and uh you know in her eighties confessed that Emmett Till never even whistle that are and and yet he was brutally murdered and and ah you know his mother's decision to have an open casket or you know just really woke up\nSome people you know a lot of people I think it was a pivotal point in American history it's amazing how you know one person's story I mentioned this yesterday says silence and one person dies it's a tragedy a million people died so statistic\nYou know though the war in Yemen where the Saudi Arabia is conducting should horrify us I mean tens of thousands of civilian children murdered\nBy by this war and ... but you know we don't talk about that but the one guy could show the oh yeah we're freaked out and that's you know it's just that I mean this is human rights and human nature of it um anyhow\nI'm I'm I'm starting to wander into a rant here in the Senate and goes friday Tony in Huntsville, Alabama Tony you're on the air what's up\nHi Tom can you hear me yeah what's on your mind uh I wanted\nTo answer the million dollar question about what black people would do if we were empowered\nAnd it's quite simple I'm a service provider near in Huntsville, Alabama and I take care of white people most of the things I Do work for white people wealthy ones\nAnd be on top of the former spied coast is just like on the bottom is a form of psychosis but black people take care of white people they love white people they have got our master's our teachers were there the people we looked up to four thousand years and now all of a sudden we treat them bad not gonna happen\nYou know white people will be well taken care about black people because we've been doing it\nThe whole time anyway and the people that white people should fear the most is the people that keep telling them that black people who served there every day and who I've always been part of their communities and have always looked up to them and respect\nThem are going to hurt them we stop doing that because that's the reason they don't they don't trust us as much as we actually do trust them\nI think I think it's a myth calm I think personally Tom are listening to your show and I think that you personally I Want to most intelligent man I've ever listened to on the radio and not just my opinion and that's why I enjoy talking to you you have my respect\nI'm with I Would think that all of a sudden somebody's going to just change their mind and just go crazy and wouldn't happen calm down\nTo just you know Tony I think that we're missing a word here um and thank you for for for everything you just said um but I like your thoughts on this we don't have a word for a system that has white male supremacy\nAnd uh you know baked into it right at\nThe the word that they had in South Africa was apartheid right there I mean they there was actually a definition of that system\nAnd you know you could say maybe Jim Crow is sort of an attempt to describe it although it so that that's really specific to a particular era and in in American history\nAnd you can say it's capitalism or it's a it's an element of capitalism you could say it's imperialism and an element of imperialism or he could ... you know obviously say it's racism or an element of racism but the structural thing that we've got in the United states where where white people control most of the wealth and most of the power\nAnd and then you know that\nReality is being used to scare poor white people in particular that well if the day comes that or when the day comes that America is majority minority you know the white people are no longer the ... majority of its gonna flip and you're going to end up on the bottom\nI'm you know again we're not naming the system we don't have a word for it but you know like apartheid it's a system that needs to be disassembled needs to be taken apart and my biggest county\nYeah there's a word for it what's the word the the word is called fear yeah well that's what it's called ... into writing good old fashioned here there are\nMore white brothers and sisters cheering them on the mission we're and\nArea yeah you're right you're right you know although I still am maybe maybe we need to invent one probably one has already been done I mean it's kind of I guess a variation credible race theory urban\nTony thank you for the call thank you very
