forty years ago camp tried to knock tried to keep forty thousand new voters off the rolls it took a few years but we beat him\nFew months ago we tried to close polling places but we beat him there to now he's added again I Will beat him again you know he's he's sitting on fifty two thousand registrations right now refusing to put them into the system keep in mind the last in Georgia gubernatorial election was won by about a hundred thousand votes\nSo of camp can take you know more than half of that and swaying away from the Democrat and toward him he's he is governor\nWhich is obviously why campus doing this but now we learn from Greg palace that you know it's not just Brian Kemp in Georgia is his though the one that's acceptable to talk about in the corporate media but you know a Greg palace just got the names of Ninety thousand residents of Las Vegas and Reno\nAnd you know we're on the air and both talent on ... this is Clark and wash show counties purged a were pressuring the voting rolls Ninety thousand people in Nevada is a battleground state\nYou know that the Republican Dean Heller is what running for reelection and he's got a really strong challenger and for a forgive

and this you know hey heads up to our listeners WC PT in in Chicago\nAnd and the and the other stations associated with the BBC beauty I'm Greg palace has the Illinois purge list yes you you know you

plug your name in and see if you have been purged from the voting rolls in the state of Illinois\nAnd Indiana Greg palace finally got I mean it's been suing the state's rights is twenty seven Republican controlled states that are all aggressively purging their voting rolls\nAnd I mean you know if you're living in California or New York or or Oregon and Washington state's this was not in this not an issue\nBut if you live in one of these red states one of these Republican controlled states and you want to vote democratic\nOr you live in one of the big cities are really you know you live or your you have an African American or last name or Hispanic last name or you know one of the ... one of the say ten twenty most common last names for both of those ethnic groups and\nAsians as well uh if you know the odds are pretty good I mean you know not\nFifty fifty or Ninety percent but odds are probably ten Fifteen Percent that era no longer on the voting rolls\nAnd ah in Indiana and they have found that they illegally purge Ninety thousand people\nAnd again you can see the list over Greg palace dot com\nSo the Georgia list the Indiana list the Illinois list and the Nevada list are all now up\nAt Greg palace dot com and it's really worth checking out and finally this or you know not finally I there's so much more news and I'll be getting to your phone calls right after the break about what you think we can do about this outside or beyond just voting Democrats it or or do we need to get Democrats in\nAnd in fact actually uh right after the break Tom president's going to be with us and I will ask him that question\nBut the the last piece here uh the White House has finally admitted after lying about this for for over a year now I'm Wilbur Ross saying oh yeah we're going to put the citizens ... ship question on the on the census which of course is going to cause\nAny Hispanic family in America we even as one member of their family who is living anywhere in the

feel or one plus one\nUh Brian Kemp who am I sued when I read the civil rights division because he was a practitioner of voter suppression and this was years ago this is like four or five years ago right\nOh I see them with like twenty eleven I think it was the oil I mean the ... I mean you you know because you're not talking about this you played the the forty one second tape from Paul why Eric okay a lot less people to vote and uh that's that's the key and and what they're trying to do in Georgia for the benefit of your listeners\nAre they acted a voter id law was upheld and so what does a progressive zoo we made sure that people had their id\nWhat else happened the New Georgia project which was a remarkable initiative led by Stacey Abrams who's going to make history by the way in twenty two days\nA she led an effort to register eligible voters in Georgia they registered over two hundred thousand and so what did the Republicans do they enacted a new bar\nAnd um and now they enacted a requirement that if it is it a perfect match between your form of id and what you have and the voter rolls and you can't vote and let me give you an example you know if your name is Thomas Perez junior\nYou or driver's license says Thomas threats comma junior and the butter roll says Thomas threads junior the absence of a comma keeps you disenfranchised well here in what's going\nOn and and the more common one is the same you know like my name is Thomas ... says Thomas e period Hartman\nOn one place and Thomas the harm and in another place that's not a perfect match according to to Bryan camp and I would be thrown off the voting rolls I Lived in Georgia for Thirteen Years never had a problem voting but that was back in the eighties about forget might've ruptured back to us right now\nBut here's here's the drill the reason they made this B. S. up is because the list of voters I'm In the fifty thousand potentially disenfranchised voters on this list\nAnd and uh Seventy percent of them are African American and by way of so you have a benchmark thirty percent of voters in Georgia or African American\nSeventy percent of voters potentially disenfranchised\nAre African American that the textbook voter suppression this is a textbook violation of the voting rights act this is a violation of the constitution this is a violation of the above the motor voter laws are and that's why a lawsuit has been filed and and this is just\nThe next chapter of voter suppression which is why it is so critical for listeners before the election to get online you can go to I Will vote\nCall that number I mentioned a streets read them vote and and make sure you are registered and make sure that all your stuff is in order or because\nThey're going to try to make it hard that they're only way to win because they're wrong on all the issues and he's a chance outrageous ad in the Republican primary uh you know he wants to make it harder for African Americans and Latinos to both and he should resign quite frankly uh it's unconscionable\nAs ... as a crutch area state is able to run for governor or they're just as you know just say this is the Fox guarding the hen house with a disservice to all the boxes\nAre critical about just in this and Kansas too I mean it was this uh this is not something something new and it and it's an essential is a violation\nOf all these various laws is also a violation of basically the principles of small D democracy all the way back to the days of Athens and uh you know just blatantly a violation of that now we're talking and time for us the chair of the DNC if\nThe five or the Republican appointees the five conservatives on the U.S Supreme Court had not voted to add not chosen to gut the voting rights act which was renewed by Congress a correct me if I'm wrong I think it was nothing\nYet yeah not Ninety eight and nothing there were two people to vote 'em in and and so obviously the will of Congress was there in fact they addressed that they said oh well people in Congress are afraid to vote against it because they didn't want to be called racist but we don't care if we're called racist 'cause we don't get reelected so we're just going to strike 'cause the soccer down or at least ...\nTalk of it had the Supreme Court not God of the voting rights act when Georgia have been able to do this\nNo and and that's\nA really good question as the probably one of the tour of the worst days of my tenure and the Obama administration wasn't twenty third change when the Supreme Court in a case out of Alabama I don't think he got at the heart of the\nVoting rights act do what would've happened if the voting rights act we're still in place is that the requirement that Georgia is putting in place now\nTo make it harder for African Americans and potentially Latinos to vote would've had to been pre cleared by the civil rights division of the Justice Department right and that pre clearance requirement was essential because we saw\nSo many actions somewhere not subtle somewhere a very subtle uh but no less I'm a unlawful and and that's why section five was such an important a bulwark in our voter protection structure and that's why without it\nEverybody has to step up and uh that's why I've been so actively involved in this that's why the DNC\nThrough our voter protection programs so actively involved and that's why there's so many uh Eric Holder's group\nI'm so many great lawyers and the fried at a bar in the civil rights far everybody's actively involved this isn't our hands on deck enterprise but I'll tell you the best thing that can happen right now is for people to plan ahead to make sure they have nothing to chance\nDon't simply show up on election day or because\nWithout having made sure that you are eligible to vote and and everything is in order for a ... ounce of prevention is critical because uh you know we have\nWe have such tremendous opportunity to take back our democracy or John and twenty two days I mean that we can win\nOr we could win a dozen governors races um and with the exception of one or two and I'm Talking about governors' races where we're slipping a seat currently held by a Republican and democratic can rent 'em in almost all of those cases the challenges the following\nTheir dead heat races we'd have the momentum we have the better candidate we're fighting for the issues people care about whether it's health care education women's reproductive health climate\nOr immigration but you know what when you have dead heat races and you have this voter suppression going on and I could talk about North Dakota and what they just did the up there I can talk about Georgia\nThey just disenfranchised I was a Native Americans um time we have we just have a man and a half to we're going to hit a heartbreak here I had a caller to my show last friday\nThis is sweet woman sounded just like you know a nice progressive bloody blah and she said you know I work I'm In Texas and I worked as a voting of officer for Twenty years and I can tell you if you get a provisional ballot all you have to do is write your name and address on the outside of the envelope\nAnd not only will ... will be automatically registered in all fifty states and I'm like that is complete BS it's a complete lie it's not true provisional ballots you know the Ninety five percent of the time or never counted\nAnd uh she continues to insist us and then I got a bunch of calls from and tweets from people saying she had called into Stephanie Miller show before me and said the exact same thing\nThere is a campaign by Republicans to convince Democrats that if you get a placebo ballot if you get one of these provisional ballots counted\nHere see it's just fine don't worry about it and this this is what accounts for red shift this is why and we've been seeing the since the giant voter purge in Florida and the two thousand election where Jeb Bush did this to hand the election to his brother\nYou know throwing Ninety thousand African Americans out the vote people get a provisional ballot they vote they think they voted they tell the exit pollsters yes I voted for the Democrats and suddenly there's a five point difference between you know what the exit poll showing what the actual polls show\nA is there an institutional or a specific program that the Democratic party is going to put in place to solve this or we have about twenty seconds\nYeah I'm a voter protection has to be in place in all fifty states you're absolutely right that uh if you cast a provisional ballot it is all too likely not to be accepted that is why it's important to\nGo to I Will vote dot com [noise] make sure you are your registration is in order and you can do the weekend\nThere you go and what was that for a number you gave us against\nOne me

what ... did he he passed the largest middle class tax cuts in the history of the United states any raised to the top income tax rate on rich people buy as I recall three percent\nAnd uh you know Bill

Democratic party and I think the the the number one candidate out there right now is is Elizabeth Warren and Ken who I Am going to talk about war and the third our the program\nBut keep an eye on all is before because there's some there's some good stuff coming here and uh she is a you know she's talking about raising taxes on rich people and she's talking about it without fear which is pretty powerful stuff for Democrats so you know I I think we can do it\nI Hope so\nYeah yeah me too and and and not only can we do it but by doing so we make our tax code fair because rich people do use a disproportionate a part of our comments wishes are taxes pay for and then we make our tax ... and ... and we make our our uh our economy fare\nBecause when you raise taxes on very very rich people in order to avoid the taxes they take less income\nAnd that's why you know when Reagan came into office naming richest CEOs America only made thirty times what their employees may and now they're making five hundred and\nChinese are boys made it very very similar to the top tax rate so we've got to do something about that yeah well thanks for the call today will be back twenty and\nYou're listening to the Tom Hartmann program called jewel to NATO away\nNinety nine twenty five\nDollar an era where they were defending democracy at America against the agents of discipline\n[noise]\n\nHi I'm Randy and this is Dave were the founders of bomb makers of the most comfortable socks and the history of feet so comfortable we've sold them donated over eight million pairs yes donated why we learned that sucks the number one most requested clothing\nYeah I had been homeless shelters so we started bomb us with the mission of donating a pair of socks for every pair\nWe sell to donate and saw a lot of thoughts we became obsessed with comfort we reinvented the sock from the ground up using the best materials available like the soft as in most comfortable\nCotton getting rid of what wasn't working like that annoying toasting you could probably feel if you wiggle your toes right now and inventing a few new comfort innovations along the way like our support that feels like a hug around your mid\nFoot at work people tried them love them told her friends about helping selling donate over eight million pairs\nChina now at ... dot com slash Tom and get twenty percent off your first order that's B. O. N. B. A. S. dot com slash th L. M. bombs dot com slash time\nDo you feel like the investment cards are stacked against you recently I discuss how corporations are buying back their shares to manipulate the market\nOr the actual executives are cashing out the FCC verified corporate buybacks are hiding insider trading\nUm if you if you were to go as I did live in Germany for a year where a somebody with your level of income you know well over a hundred thousand dollars would be paying as much as forty percent of your income in taxes you would have free healthcare\nYou would have free college in fact your kids would get a stipend when they go to college you'd have one of the best public education systems in the world you would have highway systems in road systems that are so well maintained that you can travel a hundred and thirty miles an hour on the freeway or you would have\nA ... you know I could go on and on right um and and you would have a much higher minimum wage the fact of the matter is the the other the other argument that I Would make Spencer and I've made this before but you know it's worth repeating fact I've wrote it written op eds about this you can easily find them\nIs that tax cuts affect there's two different categories of people in the United states in terms of income\nThere's people who have control over their income and there's people who don't have control over their income and if you got if you're a wage earner if you're getting a salary and you're working for somebody else you don't have control over your income broadly speaking I mean you can petition for a raise or whatever but you basically don't have control over your income\nIf you are an entrepreneur or if you own your own business or if you are a very very wealthy person or a CEO in a large corporation or he basically control your own income you can choose so much money you get\nSo for it when you look at the labor market if you take out of the labor market that top one or two percent maybe as much as three percent of Americans who actually have some control over their income\nFor that group of people when taxes are cut their income actually goes up\nBut your employer and let's say that you're working for acne company 'cause I don't want to ask the on the air who who is paying you a hundred and twenty grand a year but let's say that you're a lawyer\nA he asked me a knows that you just got a tax cut that you know a thousand dollars is pretty and consequential and it's also it's also temporary so it's probably not going to cause a huge dislocation\nBut let's say that you've got a tax cut that was worth twenty thousand dollars a year\nNow before with a hundred and twenty thousand dollars of income you're probably paying around thirty percent taxes so you're probably taking home at the end of the day run eighty five grand am I Am I right more or less Seventy to eighty grant okay so now here in ... and your employer knows we're willing to work\nFor a take home pay of Seventy five to eighty thousand dollars a year they know that because you're doing it right\nAnd now as a result of a tax cut your taking home Ninety five or a hundred thousand dollars a year now your employer knows your work for Seventy five\nSo over time what's your employer gonna do Spencer they're going to do one or two things they're either going to cut your wages directly and but that's sometimes very difficult to do or they're going to make your job unpleasant or uncomfortable or whatever and when you finally quit that job and you get replaced you're gonna get replaced by somebody who's making twenty thousand dollars a year less than you are\nBecause they're than taking the same take home pay and you you have established that the market for your particular job\nIs worth eighty five grand a year take home pay so ... and and you can see this by looking at the tax graphs and versus the wage grass and I'm Talking wages ... so we're talking a hundred percent people who don't have control over their income all going back to Nineteen twenty\nEvery time because of Nineteen twenty hurting him drop the top tax rate from Ninety One percent or twenty five percent in Nineteen thirty four ah FDR raised it back up to Ninety One percent in Nineteen sixty seven LBJ dropped down to sixty ... down to Seventy four percent\nAnd then in Nineteen eighty three Reagan dropped down to twenty five percent and then his little his little backup\nEvery single time if you look at a three hour window every single time working people's wages are caught over the next three to five years working people's wages decline for the reason I just described to you civil every time working people's wages go up\nYou know again let's go back to your employer is paying you a hundred and twenty grabbing taken home eighty five grand and let's say that the Democrats come in and they raise your taxes by twenty thousand dollars a year here now only taken I'm sixty five grand and you're going to go to your employer and say you know I'm not willing to do this job for sixty five grand to you know and and ... and nobody else the labor market is because this was an eighty five grand take home pay job\nSo you need to raise my wages modern twenty grand a year to a hundred and forty grand a year and they will do it because that's what happened during the wages when when taxes go up that's why in Denmark where the where they are the where the taxes paid by somebody making\nTwenty or thirty thousand dollars a year us equivalent is still almost forty percent like thirty six percent the minimum wage in Denmark has is a fourteen dollars thirty five cents an hour\nShould Eighteen dollars thirty five cents an hour or you know the the functional minimum wage and many European countries that are high tax countries around twenty dollars an hour\nSo the bottom line is it ... you know it always evens out the only people in other words the taxes go up your wages are going to go up as taxes go down your wages are going to go down you're always going to have basically the same I take home pay which is defined as a function of the marketplace\nThe only people who are actually affected in a consequential way will actually get richer as a result of tax cuts or less rich as a result of tax increases are the people who have control over their pay the very very wealthy does that make any sense at all Spencer\nAbsolutely and I appreciate your insight okay who I I appreciate it thank you very much I just\nYeah I I'm I'm Glad to hear at night and and I am glad my examples are working Spencer thanks a lot for the call I mean this is this is probably the most\nUnder unknown\nEconomic realities just it's just a simple economic reality we should be teaching us in seventh grade and high school as part of you know a civics class or even an economics class everybody in America should understand that because it's easy to just look at the tables over a hundred year period\nAnd not just in the United states you can look at any other developed countries in the world all over the country all over the world and they always see these countries in the world\nThe higher the taxes the higher the wages are lower the access to lower the wages and ... and ... that the lower the taxes the richer the rich\nAnd the higher the taxes and the less rich the rich and the richer is the middle class it's just that simple we need to roll back the Reagan tax cuts and go back to a Seventy four percent top will be back\nYou're listening to Tom Hartmann who's a drama Hardman ... audio and video

and Native Americans and I mentioned this last week but it's worth repeating again last Tuesday when I'm Brett Kavanaugh was very first actions\nWas to a blow away Native American rights in South Dakota south South Dakota\nHas a a a ... by Sunni North Dakota North Dakota has a brand new Republican backed voter id law\nAnd this requires not only that you have an id\nBut the your id have an address that's a physical location rather than a post office box\nAnd the reality is a large percentage of of Native Americans who live on the road as we live on reservations only use the post office box\nAnd ah you know there's there's reasons that have to do is travel sovereignty and where the post office can go and can go and and then and and also issues of poverty and a lot of people don't even own a home to have an address um so uh what we're looking at is a roughly\nExcuse me twenty percent of all the voters in the last presidential election where Native Americans living on reservations in North Dakota\nTwenty percent of them\nAnd probably about half of that twenty percent of all those voters Seventy thousand North Dakota and turned out I'm Guy about half of them will probably not now be able to vote and this went to the Supreme Court and Brett Kavanaugh said that's fine we don't need Native Americans voting\nDonated voting at all\nMeanwhile a Rick Scott as out here wearing a navy hat\nAnd it's really starting to piss off veterans I mean seriously upsetting veterans or this or he's been wearing this maybe half for a long long time\nAnd uh there's this new ad by voting vats\nWhere a Allen Madison he's a navy veteran is a thirty second hand you could find it on on line he says I see Rick Scott wearing that navy had everywhere he goes but let me tell you what he did a veterans\nAnd then he talks about how under Scots and this is a crystal as USA Today article under Scott's tenure as CEO of Columbia ... this was before he became\nGovernor the for profit company was fine one point seven billion dollars\nFor defaulting millions from Medicare Medicaid and try care a military health program and the company's settlement with the Justice Department says in other words were Scotts company which she ran admitted that they ripped off veterans and they paid at one point seven\nBillion dollar fine because they rip them off to the tune of hundreds of millions of dollars\nAnd then when Rick Scott was questioned about this under oath and the the ad is actually showing clips of this when Rick Scott\nTestified about this other oh he took the Fifth
