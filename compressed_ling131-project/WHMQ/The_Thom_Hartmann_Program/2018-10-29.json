blended in this rally [noise]\nMm well it's a it's an intriguing idea I mean first uh\nUh it's going to take a lot of courageous folks to go on those uh uh a tourist because Trump is incited violence at some of these rallies telling people in the rallies that it's okay to punch people are it's okay uh to uh\nUh to to strike back uh and of course they don't lead in a anyone but a Trump accolades into the rally it's about organizing something a nearby\nOr to try to get the attention of the media\nUm it it seems to me a work trying I mean ... the media or gave Trump hours and hours of free

from a a life experience and great wisdom and I think it's important what she said about the FDR I was down south to a gym Cliburn and we were talking about\nFDR and the new rights and I was a enthusiastic about to FDR in philosophy and Jim Clyburn said to me you realize row or African Americans didn't get to participate in most of the programs of the new deal and made\nA Jones point that it was really Lyndon Johnson who are opened up a those programs so uh I Would take away two things one is to realize when we're talking about uh the new deal or government programs we have to be mindful of\nUh the country's history of exclusion of African Americans and\nMinority population and and really\nA take that to heart going forward into a Joan reminded me of ... as he coaches article about a Trump or being a\nA a white president and he make is making the point that a a African Americans have been dealing with a lot of these issues for many years but it's the now that\nAre the issues are affecting a white America that there is a greater attention and then we should just continue to be mindful of the ah racism and stereotypes that\nAfflict this community and uh I think there was a ... a naive hope when Obama was elected that uh we had moved past or some of this at least in my generation and uh it's been a chilling reminder that many of these problems persist and we still have a lot of work to do\nOn the Jeff in Rogers, Arkansas you're on the air with Congress and broke out of\nThe morning there Tom but\nCan you hear me now and just find Jeff go for it ask your question okay you of selected to us a congressman Raul uh the uh\nDon't we have a a laws against people yelling fire in theaters inside the riots and causing sue the stress or I Believe our president has a\nMaybe be doing that and um that's my question is are the cars there'd be some thing bipartisan done about this we need to at least take a call the president on it to stop doing this because this is pretty bad when you got bombs in the mail and and people getting killed going to church\nOn there was also the the two African Americans were killed up in uh where where they can Kentucky and Tennessee after this guy tried to get into a black church to do a slaughter a you know the the three incidents in the last four days back to Congress last week\nCertainly I think the president says speeches uh have bordered in certain places and inciting violence that isn't protected speech um and political speeches are protected\nIn many ways for good reason but a non incitement to violence but more than just the president a part of my concern has been on these social media platforms where\nAre the pipe bomber or basically had tweets that were inciting violence and a Twitter did nothing to remove them a heroin gab or there was a platform that ah with the synagogue killing\nNothing to remove them a heroin gab ah there was a platform that ah with the synagogue killing where there was basically an incitement to violence and nothing was done uh so I think it yes the president has to have more responsibility but some of these\nSocial media sites need to be far more vigilant about speech that is clearly inciting violence and that is not protected under the constitution\nJohn in Minneapolis you're on the air with congressman kinda\nYeah um I just want to do to make the comment that um [noise] you know a lot of these uh social media platforms a repeat things from a propaganda Web sites that are coming from think tanks I don't know how you control that\nAnd then Fox News is essentially a propaganda machine a you know ... I mean people are still fed a steady diet and that is what they\nYou know if they only watch that and that's what they hear and they repeat all the talking points and most of them are false or lies or twisted in some way\nAnd so we have a big problem we have I think a truce\nOptional democracy and unfortunately it's not going to work it didn't it doesn't work anywhere propaganda\nLike in the Soviet Union it didn't work because it flies in the face of reality eventually when the society completely breaks down and I think that's what we're headed toward a you know we're headed toward Brazil and look at their political situation\nAnd what has gone on there or we can go next\nTo get in somebody who is a an ex\nMilitary right wing not a you know or even worse than Donald Trump or you know this is not beyond a you know reason to to say that that's a possibility so you know you can go ahead and comment on that I I find it very frustrating that\nI mean if I was in the press corps I Would have quit I think they all should get up when they catch Donald Trump ally just walk out and said no we have had enough of this when you want to tell the truth will go ahead and report it\nYeah on them and and and the other thing that caught a congressman is that it seems that ... almost ... I mean you know there are websites that have been tracking this immediate matters that aren't for example almost every time Trump tweets out a lie or something outrageous or something that's laboratory it follows by ten or Fifteen minutes a segment on Fox News that basically said just that\nAnd there's a report this morning that he literally is spending three times more time every day watching television than he does being president congressman\nNow I I saw that that is a apparently nine hours for personal time block down on certain days the eggs I Wonder\nHow that works I mean if if you have a day working day of twelve hours nine of those hours or for tweeting and\nUh watching television or in what he's doing is a you know there's an echo chamber between him and Fox News and it looks like he gets part of the propaganda from Fox News and then he tweets it out and uh if he wants to\nSpread propaganda he puts it down and Fox News or repeats it so it is a a a definite a concern and now the question is\nUh how do you address it and what gives you hope in that situation I mean the hope is he still lost the popular vote to I'm very confident\nThat he is going to lose the Congress or a this time that there is in my view or the majority of the nation and significant majority whether it's fifty five percent or sixty percent that does not\nUh subscribe to a his type of politics and that people are tiring of it a and a ... that we are going to be able to do to break through a so I uh I guess you have to if you're a in Congress share some optimism that uh the American people are going to get a\nSignal to live in the hills the looks and then we're going to be able to the right the ship a and we need to just keep being vigilant in getting our message out advocating education so that people can be engaging\nThe situation in Brazil and and the Philippines on Hungary in and out Italy on the verge things are very thing for me back with your calls for Congress from Colorado for\nThis you're listening to Tom Hartmann visit Tom Hartmann ...\nAudio and video or forty seven minutes past there will be back with your calls for Congress in ... his ... his Twitter handle his weapons as an represented breath grows on [laughter]\n[noise]\nWith all the recent news about online security breaches it's hard not to worry about where my data goes making an outline purchaser simply access senior email could put your private information at risk you are being tracked on line by social media sites\nMarketing companies and your mobile an Internet provider now that the Republicans have destroyed net neutrality that's why I decided to take back my privacy by using express vps expressed VPN has easy to use apps that runs seamlessly in the background on my computer phone and tablet turning on express\nVPN protection only takes one click expressed BP and secures and none of my eyes as your Internet browsing by encrypting data and hiding your public IP address protecting yourself with\nExpressed BP and costs less than seven dollars a month protect your online activity today and find out how you can get three months free I express VPN dot com slash Tom that's E.

Columbine I mean I I Lived in Austin in the eighties so I knew\nI was going on since the Reagan Administration\nYou are I mean I live in a new about the Charles Whitman tower of in Austin there's usually a nice way back in the sixties yeah yeah yeah but that that it seemed like an anonymous the anomaly you know there was so now so now now\nLooked at over two hundred mass shooting just this year alone right and and and I've I've gotten desensitized to these these attacks you know because they happen\nMass shootings just this year alone right and and and I I've gotten desensitized to the streets attacked you know 'cause they happened so often but this this one really hit home [noise] you know and you just feel\nSo bad for the people that have been affected back there but the the sad reality on this this isn't gonna do anything to advance the gun control debate I just don't think it will it why would it it just didn't happen at Sandy Hook or\nThe poll shooting vague I mean it's just money in politics rules everything and\nBut it's not just that you know if if if Democrats controlled the house the Senate in the White House we would have gun control there would be sensible gun control in the United states are they are they've done it before uh you know Bill Clinton did it in Nineteen Ninety five but the assault weapons ban George W. Bush chose not to renew it in two thousand five\nAnd that was the end of that uh you know so we you know so it's it and and in part the only reason that the Republicans are holding power is because of voter suppression all across the country but particularly in the red states\nAnd they're holding power in the states even where the majority of the voters are voting democratic or the or would like to vote democratic they're not allowed to at the polls and they don't have the right kind of id student ideas are not allowed but gun permits are\nI mean this is we're looking at at at criminal or election fraud being done by the Republican Party in state after state and it's been going on since the eighties\nAnd a ... in the Republican Party has turned into a criminal enterprise ah but it's\nThe money is the money from the n._r._a. that ultimately gets these politicians to vote in their favor correct\nI cannot or I can add to the disagree I agree yeah yeah and and\nThen and then and then the ... the whole thing is Tom I mean obviously these weapons of war these assault weapons have to be banned but but if it's an individual has this intention\nTo go out and harm people kill people for whatever reason it it's how can you stop them if the if nobody knows their intention\nUntil they act so so okay it banned all the assault wipe the weapons are still hand guns that can can not do as much damage in such amount of time but people will still be able to commit these acts just maybe not\nYou know the numbers that they can with the assault Web you know it's\nIt's as I said there's there's there are three issues here I'm this guy's core anti Semitism and all the anti semi too loose celebrate with him his hatred of immigrants and the ... you know this the synagogues or being one of the three hundred in the country that supports the Hebrew immigration or immigrant aid society ...\nAnd his specific saying that it was because of high us that he was going to the synagogue to shoot it up I mean he's ... an hour or two before he went and did this and\nI got on the fact that he had access to the to a weapon of war and can carry it around in the streets of an American city these these three things and and we need to be talking about all three in my opinion\nAnd you know one of them think Tom I'm as we sit here and speak\nI'm pretty convinced that there's people out there that saw his number say he he did the most Jews ever and you know in this country ... eleven you know there's people out there saying I could I could talk that I could beat him up\nThere's people that have that in their mind right now that that think he's a hero in it but they want to go out do what he did the ...\nYeah it really and truly is close ... close thank you for

P. you're disobeying God\nAnd that yeah yeah right but then when they said they were actually praying all over the world to put the shield around Trump that nothing was touching I went what Bible or any reading out of you\nAnd that and that has really disturbed me in one of the things that because I'm Seventy seven and I've question all my life [noise]\nThat one of the things I notice about people they never question [noise] they don't know their history when Trump first started running I recognize the Nazi propaganda right away 'cause I've been studying since I was ... years old [noise]\nAnd that and I recognized that the um [noise] how how it's done and I'm going oh my goodness and ... and I work at a food pantry and when he was running I told people if he gets into office this nation is going to we\nSaw was coming down and then somebody wants to deep debate with me I always telling me I'll debate with you I got twenty five years you know what you want to look at him\n[laughter] yeah yeah well you know one of the things that really shocked me when I that I just learned last week and I learned from Joe Scarborough of all people is that the number one component of\nOf Hitler's propaganda strategy or in the thirties in in Germany has documented by his propaganda minister or girls\nWas and I quote never let the people cools down ... in other words to every single day you have to do or say something a little more outrageous in the day before to to to get to cause to get the people cranked even the people who have to get them ...\nTo get the people on the streets to further polarize people's to further ... you know may strengthen the camps on both sides so that you know you can wipe out the other side of it ultimately end eventually and the Christian stations I mean Trump is outreach to the Christians was really simple\nYou guys you guys want to be able to uh to uh to do politics ...\nYou know from the Paul but right now if you knew that you lose your tax exempt status I'm going to repeal the the Johnson Amendment which was passed in the Nineteen fifties which was a deal\nNow basically between the government the churches that if the church is just stuck to religion and didn't get into politics will give you a nonprofit status but if you're going to do politics should register as a political party or something or you're going to pay taxes and and Trump's saying you know you can do politics and not pay taxes which is the exact thing that you know James Madison most\nFeared was the corruption of the churches by politics and and ... and of course was concerned about the policy corruption politics by the churches that you know both is happening and these Christian stations the business model for them Joanne and and most people don't are are familiar with those I've been to the radio business since I was sixteen\nI'm I'm very familiar with it and in fact I've been to the national religious broadcasters association's annual convention um and the the business model is there are radio stations that simply rent time\nThis broadcasters association's annual convention um and the the business model is there are radio stations that simply rent time and they and they they they don't have any particular\nSticker ideology they just want to make money right and so they say okay it's a thousand dollars an hour or two to rent time on this station and so the the tell evangelist\nThey go they ... they get these stations\nThey pay them a thousand dollars for that hour during that hour they'll do several sales pitch was asking for people to give them money and every day they they're keeping track of these calls are the cash coming in and if the cost of a thousand dollars and they make two thousand dollars and they say on the station the costs of my knowledge they only make eight hundred dollars\nThey drop that station and move along and some of these guys are on you know a thousand different stations and they're fine tuning their messages literally every day\nToo and and they're tracking the the results of these messages by how much revenue as come in and how much how many donations are coming in to to the Taliban Angeles you know to that that also helps pay for the stations\nAnd so I'm guessing that these people have figured out that if they throw in with Trump that the Trump backer White's the Trump heads a the the the the\nThe maggots [laughter] you know folks are going to say oh cool you know I should spend more money to this pattern disease you know he's one of us and he joined our try\nAnd get because I I can guarantee a Joanne they wouldn't be doing it if it didn't make a money which is really a tragic thing to say about it because I agree with you about calling but it's a tragic thing to\nSay about you know religious or with some of our religious elders that's what's going on joined thanks so much for the call for it to him and we'll be right back\nYou're listening to Tom Hartmann
