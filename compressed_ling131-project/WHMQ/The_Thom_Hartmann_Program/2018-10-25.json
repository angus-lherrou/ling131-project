we can know\nTo what extent Republican voter suppression was successful in this election is there some way that we can no one election night\nAnd the ... and my answer is yes there is\nAnd but it's going to depend on their being exit polling and this is one of the things that I have not been able to find any reliable news source on and if you know give me a call please you know two to eight Ninety nine twenty five if you know if there's going to be exit polling in this election\nAnd if so where and by whom\nBecause it's an exit polling that has traditionally pointed out to us how Republican boy and suppression efforts where and how and how successful they have been\nIn the ... the simple formula is very very straightforward the Republicans do everything they can to suppress the vote the main thing that they do however as they knocked people off the voting rolls it's it's been you know fourteen million people have been knocked off the voting rolls by Republican\nSecretaries of state and governors in the last ... last year fourteen million according to Greg palace too will be with us and in ten minutes we'll get the whole story on what what's up so the other Republicans and the Democrats fight back they tried to do that one for example lift\nYou know dodge city has now been dodged the Kansas right or it has been the iconic western town it has now become sixty percent Hispanic\nSo of course the Republicans who control Kansas and control a dodge city ironically you know which says something about how we need to get active or they decided that the even though there's twenty seven thousand people in town\nAnd many of the Hispanic people do not have automobiles are at the lower end of the economic spectrum they depend on public transportation they decided to move the single polling place the one place in town where you can vote way outside town ... miles outside town more than a mile away from the nearest bus stop\nSo lifts you know the the ride hailing company that can be with Hoover lift ... along with vote whole Latino is offering dodge city voters a free ride to the polling place\nSo you know using the hashtag dodge city hash tag Kansas\nThey tweeted a dodge city Kansas has a ... a Latin acts Latina ... majority city that has had its only polling location moved outside of city limits without access to public ... public transportation\nSo we're partnering with lift to provide rides to the polls this voter Latino and it's also being sponsored by Johnny Walker I'm assuming that that's the uh\nThe the the the liquor company remarkable but anyhow what I was saying is the\nThe way we'll know\nAnd the way that we can look back at elections going back to two thousand a prior to two thousand is by looking at the red shift prior to two thousand there was no real consequential red shift in prior to two thousand\nWe had\nWe had um [noise] [noise]\nReally a rapid way of knowing I mean the news media all knew who had won the election long before\nThe polls closed because of exit polling\nThe news media you know we were reporting they were calling elections within minutes of the elections in many cases because of exit polling the media by the way to do this in Europe routinely every country in Europe they do exit polling and because they all vote on paper and so it takes a day or two to count all the ballots\nThey released the exit polls the night of the election everybody celebrates everybody goes home and then they real vote comes in and it's always the same it's a rarely even more than a tenth of a point off\nBut in two thousand you had this massive voter suppression effort in Florida where Jeb Bush\nKnocks Ninety thousand African Americans off the polls are so that his brother could win the election in Florida and the Supreme Court could hand in the the US presidency and it wasn't just Florida where it was being done but that was the most conspicuous that's the most well known\nBut it was really a let's try this out let's see how this works if we can suppress the vote a black people will back get Republicans elected and sure enough it did\nAnd it didn't several states but the the exit polling companies they were reporting that Al Gore won Florida\nAnd they had an egg on their face I mean there's a horribly embarrassed and they had to quote correct their numbers remember that two thousand and two thousand two got even worse in two thousand four got so bad that the major companies in the exit polling business went bankrupt\nThey went out of business and so a consortium of news media got together and said well we'll do the exit polling and in two thousand six hundred thousand eight again they were so far off\nAnd nobody ever knew why they assume there was something wrong with the exit polls\nIf we can but what the what's what's wrong is that people are going into the voting booth or going in and going into the polling place there they're told your name is out on a on the list but here's a provisional ballot you can still vote\nSo they vote for the Democrat typically and turning the provisional ballot and not knowing it'll never be counted\nAnd then when they walk out the tech they say they tally exit pollsters that they voted\nFor Democrats [noise] and so the exit polls this is why we have three point five point seven\nPoints what's called the red shift and you were the exit polls are saying the Democrats won but there's been a success or you know five three five seven\nWind shift to the Republican in terms of the actual vote now so we need to be looking for this election night because this will tell us how effective the Republican voter suppression cameras have been\nYou're listening to the Tom Hartmann program called ... to ...\nNinety

Caucasian there used to me that I mean for Thirty years there was that this was a federal court or ... I think the Republican Party from doing this\nBut now they've got the courts so what they do is they mail you a letter looks like junk mail in Illinois Nineteen twenty people throw it in the garbage 'cause it looks like junk mail and um then if you missed an election\nThey say oh that means that you moved out of the state are you left and so you lose your vote and so to me are you ready for this five hundred thousand Georgians you know\nAnd have been given zero zero notice that they have been purged that is on the voter rolls that is their registration or cancel and I want to tell you what we did time I did something no other journals has done number one sue to get the actual names and addresses each each voters\nI did something else I hired a um about four major consulting firms whose total job\nWho's a what they do is that they find out where you live uh I hate to tell you this but every but American Express knows where you are on Thursday at UPS\nRight that these are companies that sell marketing and information to to rival I Want to sell things have basically\nAnd and these are ... these are the the number one consultants the nations\nYeah right that these are companies that sell marketing and information to to right below on a cell phone she basically\nRight and and these ... these are the the number one consultants the nation's biggest companies and they have special if they call a address hygiene a systems and they get with absolute certainty where people\nLive I just want to call it in the ... the marketing direct mail this this this is a very sophisticated I mean you know it's it's it's a these operation so yeah so\nSo these people and we know here whether somebody is still lives there or not and they know for sure because they've been engaging in commerce with these people typically in the previous weeks or months so they told you wandered\nYeah yeah they have two hundred databases and we have a special contract with the post office as well by the way and not using two hundred databases and the post office latest database eight with Ninety six percent certainty\nThey gave us the names and addresses of three hundred forty thousand one hundred thirty for Georgians who never\nNever left the state and never left their county never moved out of their registration\nHome where they originally uh um where they originally a registered to vote ... three hundred and forty thousand one hundred thirty four overwhelmingly these are voters of color is your poor voters he's the students um it is not\nYou know so they're they literally will not know if they show up to vote that they've been knocked off the voter rolls there'll be given one of those provisional ballots which will not be counted you cannot count the ballot if\nYou are not registered to Brian Kemp even if he wrong we remove you from the voter rolls around it's going to throw away your ballot and um and your visual ... however you tell the exit polls oh I've loaded and then there'll be a difference and when that difference is uncovered\nThe exit pollsters will quote conform the data to the official line\nNow as soon as soon as out since the election of two thousand when this was really rolled out in a big way on behalf of George W. Bush by his brother job in Florida but it was done numerous other states too\nWe have had election after election where the exit pollsters said the Democrats won but the ... but the actual count says the Republicans won\nAs a result of this voter suppression in seems to me that had this happen to the Republican Party and been done by the Democratic party that starting in two thousand they would have been screaming bloody murder or would have been an absolute holy hell from the rafters\nHow are the uh the the ... tower the how are the the wise elders of the Democratic party responding to to the research that you're doing it or you're uncovering\nWell others one elder name Stacey Abrams who I've been talking to you about this for five years\nOr my by the way my my lawsuit and invest issued can't began before even discuss running for governor either I think he was running for governor so I'm not trying to influence the election and trying to get people to get people back their votes and get information but she understands it\nAnd that so we have a major African American politicians understand exactly what's going on my problem is with the Democrats white congressional caught a for example when I issued a the purge list in Colorado which was given to me by the Republican secretary of state name is Wayne Williams\nIn response to the lawsuit in response to my lawyer he was ... he was he was forced to yeah okay who's forced\nTo give the names of the people he removed from the voter rolls hundreds of thousands of Colorado and when I called him on a heat scream bloody murder held press conferences attacked me and the Democratic party candidates\nReaction was oh I'm you know I he he didn't like her she didn't like what the Greg palace was saying because I'm the Democratic candidates didn't want to be negative\nOh God that we don't want to be ... we don't want to talk about voters losing their votes in Colorado which Hispanics and uh American natives events who's at risk in Colorado so\nYou ask why should the state like Colorado which should be glued to the core given its democratic demographics\nWhy Democrats losing Colorado because the you know the Democratic party\nIs not protecting its voters of color that's just it's the the sad and true story yeah\nAnd and that's one state is that emblematic of what's happening all over I mean I I'm surprised Tom for residents not screaming about this and the rooftops it can you\nCan you imagine if if Newt Gingrich was running the Republican Party I mean he's out there right now saying oh yeah it made it deserves [laughter] you know you could just imagine how the Republicans are in play those if if you know uh [noise] uh it said\nWell you know when I when I uncovered the purge of tens of thousands of black voters in Florida they recall felons you're only crime was voting while black right um the head of the Democratic party they were trying to get that he told me trying to get democratic politicians say some they wouldn't\nThey are afraid to say that they are the protectors of black criminals or that their protectors of illegal alien voters et cetera in other words they're they're cowering from the Republican its act remember to Republicans response to this is that they are preventing massive voter fraud right a as if I'm ... and again\nYou know that the that they're having people drive in from out of state no they never left Ga Ga answer\nIn a Mr Kemp so again\nIt's unfortunate is huge racial divide within the Democratic party on\nYeah well you know the the one thing that we can do about that is elevate this to the status of issue you know if if all the Democrats listening to this program\nFor example for the call their member of Congress into a two two to four thirty one Twenty one year one member of the house to senators all three of them and say I want you to him if they're talking to a Democrat I Want you to do everything you\nCan to get the
