Hawaii there was a study done you can Google this it's called the quiet longitudinal study it was done back in the I Believe it was it started in the Nineteen forties I could be wrong it might have been the the Nineteen fifties but Iran for about twenty five years or thereabouts\nIt was one of the longest a longitudinal studies you know long term uh studies of a an individual population having to do or is it where the resilience that pretty much ever has been done\nAnd in fact you couldn't even do it now because in order to do this they had to basically ignore what was going on so they went to the island of Hawaii which at that time back in the fifties or sixties or whenever they started this study was a basically all migrant labor\nOr native Hawaiian labor\nBut dirt poor I mean there's a little tiny islands that had nothing but sugarcane uh\nAnd uh the the adults worked on the sugar cane fields and the kids had one of the highest levels of poverty in the United states they had one of the highest levels of child abuse in the United states\nAnd they looked at these kids over a over a a multi decade period and what they found was that\nYou know there's a normal bell curve distribution for resilience there are some people who are very very fragile\nThere are some people who are very very resilient and then the vast majority of us are somewhere in the middle you know we're we're fragile in some ways resilience in other ways and you know and what they found was that the ... the width of that middle shrank\nSo as a consequence of growing up in the ... the conditions are severe poverty and and very often terrible child abuse that there were more fragile kids\nBut there were also more resilient kids\nNow this is certainly not a sales pitch for child abuse to to build resilience but the point is\nAt because it out it also produce fragility live there the results are ... you know in fact when they went back they they found that there there were variables that could predict which way a kid we'd go but that's a whole it's a much longer conversation that I Want to get into here but the but the point of it is\nThat confronting the world from time to time\nUh at interacting with other people in ways that may be uncomfortable\n... you know strengthen side swipe walking beyond our comfort zone and going out into just exploring the world as you know as young people\nThings that kids don't do when they're watching the screen all the time actually strengthens\nOur it for for most of us I mean these are the the the the the appropriate ways to strengthen resilience to crate resilience\nAnd then the question is you know what happens with screens while with screens you know the only interaction or having very very often I mean as with anonymous people online who maybe trolls that may be bought so may be all kinds of things you can do a lot of harm and a lot of destructive stuff there but ... and and and\nThat's not you know Mrs hits turning out what we're learning what high to pointed out in his book\nAnd and what these parents in Silicon valley I mean there's a whole nanny industry now in Silicon valley of management babysitters childcare centers daycare centers and schools that do not allow any screens\nEven though even the nanny cannot hold on a cell phone right ...\nYou're listening to the Tom Hartmann program called jewel to NATO away\nNinety nine twenty because the people who make these phones and whom program of software they don't want their kids exposed to it what do you think about [noise]\n[noise]\nAnd all the recent news about online security breaches it's hard not to worry about where my data goes making an outline purchasers simply access senior email could put your private information or risk you are being tracked on line by social media sites\nThere goes making it online purchase or simply access senior email could put your private information or risk you are being tracked\nA line by social media sites\nMarketing companies and your mobile an Internet provider knowledge Republicans are destroyed net neutrality\nThat's why I decided to take back my privacy by using express BBN expressed VPN as easy to use apps that runs seamlessly in the background on my computer phone and tablet turnout expressed VPN protection only takes one quick\nExpressed VPN secures in a non ... says your Internet browsing by encrypting data and hiding you're probably got the address protecting yourself with\nExpressed VPN costs less than seven dollars a month protect your online activity today and find out how you can get three months\nFree that express VPN dot com slash Tom that's e X.

which we feel bad about\nAt least I Need to move a lot of thank you for the call and sharing your story with us it's a if this was a this is a real challenge Mike in Milwaukee, Wisconsin named Mike what's up [noise]\nHave time I just wanted to know that the study too quick what type of recommendations for aid group and limited um brief time limit for the spring because\nA lot of schools that are um converting over to a you know tablets and electronic though it's a fine line that way a healthy development and also a\nAcclimated to the modern world though does it's great that the study of any of the\nJustice or grand signed limited arts and the second one it would be if you talk about it all the time and I know you've got to find out what exactly is that if they're like like like for my own because no I Want to\nWhat I'll explain his first of all with regards to the study is Mike I'm ... and nobody is making any recommendations yet because nobody really knows I mean this is the sort of thing the twenty Thirty years from now will be able to go back and look you know at the statistics and the epidemiology and say oh here's what happened then\nAnd in fact that's what Jonathan hated or hide did with his book was basically said these kids born after Nineteen Ninety five who basically grew up on screens\nThey're the ones who now have among girls just in the last five years a Seventy percent increase in suicide for girls and a forty percent increase in suicide for boys um so we don't know at what age it's you know there's enough self control and I'm self regulation to deal with this\nIf you think of of uh smartphones and tablets\nAs an addictive substance and think of them the way that you would think of alcohol or tobacco then arguably you don't want somebody exposed to them until they have you know the the for brain fully developed that's the part that inhibits behavior that can self regulate\nAnd the for brain ... you know we used to think this developed around sixteen or Seventeen and which is why we set the age of majority and and stuff like that around that age voting and drinking and whatnot turns out for many people for most people uh you know that kind of full development doesn't actually happen until you're ... between twenty and twenty three\nSo ha we don't know be a VPN VPN stands for virtual private network and at the end and were you know even when you mentioned expressed VPN which is one of our advertisers um ... there's a number of companies that they compete with it's becoming a very you know hot business right now and the way it works\nFor us the piano which is one of our advertisers um ... there's a number of companies that they compete with it's becoming a very you know hot business right now and the way it works is\nUm when you put a VPN app on your on your phone or on your iPad or on your computer\nOr actually now you can even put them on your on the on the ... system in your house you get it so that everything is you know as it goes through the VPN before it gets to you\nThat create and and this and that there is a VPN company somewhere around ... or ... for example the one that advertises on her show they've got um they've got sites all over the United States I've got one in Seattle which is the one that my phone typically connects to cause it's closest\nUh Austin, Texas Los Angeles New York DC all this kind of stuff\nAnd at their site they have basically a giant pipe into the Internet and ... and ...\n... so we can your on your computer or phone or whatever establishes a secure connection that is your data is all encrypted before flows in before flows out of your phone into the Internet is all encrypted and goes through this encrypted\nSingular channel all the way to Seattle in my case uh all the way to Seattle where\n... are the experts VPN company\n... D and Crips it and just drops it into the Internet\nSo if a if somebody's trying to figure out where I Am it looks like I'm In Seattle be if they're trying to figure out what my IP address is so that they could go back and hacked by phone or my computers they can't because the IP address as the IP address for express VPN so there is so it it covers your IP address\nAnd and most important for me because I have Comcast as my Internet service provider and they work so hard to destroy net neutrality over the years and now they have the legal ability to look at every keystroke on my computer every website I visit every password I enter\nUm you know all that data every single email I send Comcast can now read all of that and so by encrypting at before it leaves my phone or before it leaves my computer then when it hits Comcast Comcast looks at that all they see as a stream of Jim Risch 'cause it's encrypted\nSo they can't take my data anymore and it goes to the to the other end of the VPN thing we're a dumpster right into the main you know a kind of federally run a you know Internet type into the whole world and so there is no company that can monitor what I'm going what what I'm doing other than\nArguably express VPN could monitor it except that that's part of their contract with you is that they don't do that they're not set up to do that they will never do that and they promise and guarantee that they will never do that so does that make sense that I answer a question\nThat bike\nYeah okay great and had to my wife and I got to drive that I ever look at it\nOkay thanks bye thanks for the call and you know I recommend to me it can be any company wants is a number of very good to be the companies out there there's\nYou know there's ... there's there's just a

a little fingers to\nAmazing\nWe'll get some more news as we continue through the program here I Know that there's a whole bunch of it on hold and fact pretty much all the lines so let's so let's get back to our conversation Pam in Chicago a pan you want her to get back to our conversation about the screens and technology and all that\nYes Tom but if I may make a comment regarding Trump um Trump spirit courses out what maximize it maximum chaos in order to get maximum control and uh my concern is is that\nThe influence that Trump has because there will be a generation of Trump you\nWrite who will perpetuate they hate and think that the way to enter politics and when and our car is the same path that Trump has decided to take a and certainly\nIt to enter politics and win at all costs is the same path that Trump has decided to take a and certainly my condolences and my prayers\nTo the families in squirrel heal and many of them have said they don't want Donald there unless he denounced is\nYou know anti Semitism and hatred yeah and I'm not sure if he will do that\nYou know that was just an absolute profound observation Pam I was ten years old when John Kennedy was assassinated and yeah that calls a service I mean we all knew the call to service the John Kennedy put out a you know in in in my elementary school\nWe were doing the physical exercise programs that Kennedy had talked about and you know everybody knew it was the president's physical fitness program and we had you know advance to the classes you know are in the school\nUh we we're we're just moving just rip or a hat and when we all knew that was you know we're Kennedy's response to Sputnik and all that to me that happened during the Eisenhower administration but\nBut yeah we were moving forward you know the America and we were going to put them out on the phone you know\nAnd and that affected my entire generation at a very positive way and the way that we view government and and it hadn't occurred to me that there are ten year olds right now or or uh you know paying attention to Trump and what impact that is going to have\nWhen they're you know lawyers become yeah voting age all the way up to being at all for like me while\nAnd we'll end with President Obama that was the first time that many black youth\nThat was the realization that they actually could become president we had heard it we've been told you write letters to come in that era of Obama yeah so that's something for us to think about when Trump perpetuates hate and the sooner we get rid of him time the better yeah now let me go to the technology\nCher I'm kind of I I'm really concerned also about social\nMedia and screen time and technology and it not only impacts the brain but if you know this time it transformed the body the skeletal when I look at people who text or a lot if you look at the uh from the ...\nSeem to be as large as well as protrude quite a bit\n... when you look at the pasture we have we're looking at these phones and tablets and screen yeah that's what I was asking the skeletal\nYeah people are starting to get hunched over as a result of all the time they're spending staring at their screen\nAbsolutely and then my concern for the um [noise] for the uh the young children and you know elementary school it was high school not only be a technology but I'm just going to old school these backpacks time where they have to carry what books about twenty or thirty pounds worth of books\nAnd homework and that is impacting the pasture as well so ... ... and ... and the movie\nAnd social media to talk about the way young people communicate when I talked to some of the younger people time if you don't have a social media presence they don't they think something is wrong with you there\nI say our NATO they're going to be changing over time but it's certainly that's certainly the norm right now and uh you know do you have kids or what do you do about this\nIf it is a great but I think you have to start early and you talked about communication and then also if you pay for the Internet it seems to me being that your way of trying to regulate it if you're the parent in the household and you pay for these services I think you have a right to to stipulate some rules\nAnd then lastly Tom let me comment on how you know in an African American community and some of them and also some of the poor white community you we've been talking about a digital divide for never that has not been leveled right right so now\nAs we come into a A N and our community saying that you know

both but the the thing\nThe lens through which idea of this stuff Chris is that of of colds and a ... and and I do that because uh having lived in Germany for a year and my my mentor Godfrey Miller who passed away at the age of Ninety to about a half a decade ago by maybe I don't know six eight years ago\nUm uh was in Hitler's army\nYou know he was he parachuted into early in the war parachuted into a ... or ... what was then a part of a Iran it was the Kurdistan part of Iran\nTo help the courage he spoke their language or to help the Kurds are get the oil for Hitler and he was immediately arrested by the British and the Iranians and held in a prison cell until the end of the war for which he says thank God you know I never killed anybody\nUm but uh you know he told me stories about what it was like being a young man and Hitler's Germany I'm a number of the people who worked with the organization the Salem International organization at that time they've all passed away now correspond higher was one of them he was a he was part of the Hitler Youth\nAnd ah you know we had long conversations for stronger than to Uganda ah his assistant was eaten by a crocodile and South Africa or we were we worked together in Bogota, Colombia um and and what I got from these guys was that it was a cult\nThat that Hitler had created a call not just to call the personality but a a religious cult basically a this idea of the supremacy the area and race\nAnd and ah you know so it was a a ... a white nationalist cult and and the the confluence of Christianity with it there had been this arch bishop bishop archbishop more or who was appointed by the state you know in the in the mid thirties when basically all the other churches were shut down\nAnd ah the thing that woke people up from that call was having the curtain ripped back after World War two and seeing the death camps and seeing the horrors yeah seeing the devastation their country and the\nPrivate citizens coming and what come through and look\nRight and it and a shock to them out of their cult following in the same thing with Japan I yeah I have a a good friend who's Japanese and he's not as old as her Miller was um he he was born like I was in the ... I was born in fifty one I think he was born in fifty three\nAnd and uh uh but you know he's heard the stories you know and the the kamikaze pilots to die for the emperor who is the you know the the great grandson of a of the of the of the creator of the earth itself you know the sun God I'm a was the highest thing that you could do and and that called God's shattered when the Japanese were defeated in war\nSo if if Trump is defeated in a big way\nUm and Trump ism is defeated in a big way I think it could shatter that called on the other hand\nOr if they if they managed to kind of weasel true it\nIt's sort of like you know ... in a in the Nineteen twenties we had I not entirely analogous situation but Teddy Roosevelt prior to the Nineteen twenties have been a progressive Republican president and Taft followed him and continued you know breaking up standard oil and all those things in fact the final breakup handle happened during his presidency\nAnd then came the conservative Republicans and and uh the partying in Nineteen twenty campaigned on dropping the top tax rate from Seventy five percent down to about a twenty five percent which he did when he was elected in Nineteen twenty\nAnd and on a slogan of a ... more business and government less government and business in other words privatize and deregulate and they did that aggressively\nAnd in goose the economy like nobody's business which is why we had to call it the roaring twenties which by the way is the exact same thing that's happening right now and it's set up the inevitable crash in October of Nineteen twenty nine\nThat crash was so severe and so deep and so long that it woke people up to the Republican con game and it was three generations before the Republicans took control the house of representatives again\nI mean they they just wanted in the wilderness forever until in the Nineteen seventies Lewis Powell came up with this memo and they organize all the rich people and and figured out how to bring into the Christians and how to bring in the bed somehow to you know I mean they just basically the the gun guys the anti abortion people\nThey put together this coalition but ... it's not entirely analogous but but people did wake up from from that conservative called then it may happen again but Chris I I and I'm making no major productions here it's just\nOne of my major concern that we get sort of an an unsatisfying lukewarm resolution to this and that there aren't any serious consequences it just kind of lurched forward again and then we set ourselves\nOther thing that concerns me the most with the way the bowl of sorrow and the rights took over\nTook over Brazil as as mark ... was telling us what's this act the court's with a bunch of the right wing buddies and during the last few years of the Obama administration Mitch McConnell refused to uh to fill a federal judge ships to the point that John Roberts\nIssued a a a you know send a letter to Mitch McConnell and made it public\nSaying that there was a Judicial Crisis because there were not enough judges and the courts were all backed up\nAnd this was like a year before Obama left office and Mitch McConnell just completely ignored it and and also you know kept Merrick Garland off the off the bench and right now he is packing the courts and he's packing them with the kind of people who I think would support fascism in the United states that's something that really concerns me in a big way\nThat if if the horse in the United states to use the same way the laws\nAre on the right wing used them in Brazil to imprison lasting to literally putting the ex president in jail and have gotten chunk chanting lock her up about Hillary Clinton Tom you know\nGetting in that habit then then the game as turning really really really really and it was just going to have to wait and see if we can to\nChrist actually listening to Tom Hartmann visit Tom Hartmann ...\nAudio and video on your for your calls in just a moment it's a little after forty five minutes past [noise]\n\n\n[noise]\n[noise] let's talk about your business for a minute thinking on other things you can lead to attract the best time between networking events and referral bonuses you're probably spending plenty of time in Ninety to find the right people don't want to lose your often\nMany track you didn't believe the days when Bush is noble inactive game winning often designed randomly they weren't in Paris", "show_name": "The Thom Hartmann Program", "year": "2018", "city": "Greenfield", "day": "30"}
