on everything twice in the city council in two weeks or vote again\nAh I I feel confident saying that you know the major vote was was last night ... um and we'll see I mean we've sent request to Columbia gas before and messages before you know when they put the moratorium in I I asked can we have some data back in this up is there a reason why you need to put more it's because\nI'm not going to lie this is a hard it's hard vote is is not just something you want to do any logical reasons you have to realize that people suffer because of the moratorium\nFor example the lumber yard project before the housing project they wanted to use natural gas and that they couldn't\nA net switch to a different source which is more expensive so it was real it was a real issue here and we asked give us the data to justify this never heard back ... so we we shall see in\nRonald Donald's was the president of the north Hampton city council and they had to some committees are recently to discuss their reforming the housing authority oh yeah it was someone with some of the uh some of the input that came out of that\nYou know I mean I'm excited about this this is a proposal that I put forward to ask the legislature for um a permission to change the membership the housing forty north Hampton that's because the the ... housing authorities are stab us not by the city but by the state and what do we do is add tenants to the housing board\nA and I just think if you have tennis on the housing board ... uh you're going to better results are going to better oversight better policy making the conditions in housing authorities across Massachusetts are deplorable\nAnd ever since I was like in a war three and you know worked with people inside the house and kale apartments I really want to do something that's really hard to help people because they're really off on these legal islands ... where they just I mean they're just invisible almost a and M. powerless and uh\nSo I liked the idea of doing something to empower them and this proposed going forward\nThe people came up to the committee meetings are far more persuasive than I Know we have people from half your heights and ... house come out and tell their stories about what they face every day and they're very supportive of this idea um so what we're hoping to do is have two more forums these were committed means you won't have real\nA community forums or the next month and a half a in here from everybody and hopefully put up hopefully put a legislative proposal forward a and change things that the housing authority\nAnd of course the the new director or else you're probably but dropped two years now or ... now she's she's made some changes not all of them yeah it's you know with any kind of a it was a free for yeah she's a ...\nRocky road um I I think this is a you know same old thing you you need to have some checks and balances and you have in the management the housing authority of north Hampton and\nUh not impugn in um uh uh her motivations or decisions I'm saying this but you need to have oversight and I just think it's it'd be think about if you live in a condo and everyone you're condo association were appointed by somebody else and didn't even live there wouldn't make any\nOversight and accountability is um the way to improve things I think\nRonald Donald's here the president of the north Hampton so you can also take a break for sports and whether and talk about the red Sox game tonight with the yanks but do I want to get your perspective but you just finished a grueling or race or came up a little short for the state Senate the joke cover for the one that to uh to replace Jane Rosenberg\nAnd uh I Wonder did your your reflection on that and we don't always we always talk about
