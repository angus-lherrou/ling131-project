government for such a long time in their exercises in Yemen a campaign against one of the poorest nations in the world that they are thick as thieves with us and have been for a long time many of the in the Saudi royal family have\nMedicare for all is that a fair a synopsis of what question for asks are representatives to support\nYes that's the actual text of what it says\nAnd is Medicare for all the same or is it different than when we were we talk of as single are described as single payer\nYes it is different than it is different and Medicare for all is is really um a concept of health care universal healthcare\nA for everybody modeled after Medicare system but what we're talking about in Massachusetts says it's a little bit different simpler and buy more possible I think\nThe bill is um set up in a way to have one single payer which is I I trust where all the monies that come into the healthcare system from\nUm employers and a Medicare and uh you know all the different players would all go into one place so it'd be managed in one place and say and eliminate all the other administrative costs set the multitude of health care insurance companies waste right now\nSo a huge amount of money is on administrative costs in health and health care and insurance come in the system in the system yeah and those health care those health insurance system using health insurance companies are for profit they make money\nThey make money for executives and they make money for their employees but we can eliminate those kinds of class and just have one single place where all of that money um can be used and distributed and then actually save a massive amount of money for the actual cost of taking care of people\nNow who's question for dependent on the federal government in some way or if it were to pass in sort of you were to if we were to instruct our represented support this a Medicare for all program would this be simply a state program or would it also involves the federal government's participation\nThis would be a state program it will be asking them to pass a bill that actually has been in the legislature and very similar forest for the last Twenty years\nReally yes okay so so everyone knows the bill we're talking about are we saw the the elected officials no this is a real proposal that it's really on ... hill that really has been that they really couldn't vote on and fund\nYeah that's right yes it has a funding formula with and the bell which is one of the things that some of the other state bills have not had and have run into trouble but they're still has a funding formula within it\nDoes Charlie Baker have a position on the on the bill and or on the ballot question and I would like you to explain to us we either ... I'm Sorry ... explain to us why it's on the on the ballot in our district or a few districts in this election cycle\nWestern mass Medicare for all worked\nOn getting it on the ballot and fix district and the western part of the state that's not something that other district chose to do at this point in the ... six districts you talking about a representative districts or\nRepresented districts the ones currently represented by ... mark they guy Solomon roadside back and the district that was represented by coke ad so all of the western mass districts basically that's not in Springfield and if\nThis were to pass let's say that question for on our ballot receives an overwhelming yes vote in November which I Would hope for and expect does that\nActually advance the cause does that make it more likely that this bill will receive favorable consideration in the legislature anytime soon or is this simply statement of here we are we're western mass and we are standing up for the rights of the people but Charlie Baker is going to blow us all off anyway\nWell it doesn't it doesn't you know there's nothing in the question\nThat I and I know I Know I don't mean to just ... I'm Sorry but I did notice that the recent polls have you way behind Jay wonderful as you may be [laughter]\nUm [noise] so it doesn't it doesn't call for advancing the bail it simply calls for legislators to vote on the ... and there are many many steps that would come before voting for the bill\nFor instance I mentioned that this they'll spend in the legislature for Twenty years and what has happened in each of those Sessions is that it gets stock and they helped financing committee so\nAlthough this was a bill that has received specific and devoted attention from representative Peter ... who was I think really working on moving forward and the legislative process\nIn a way that it hadn't moved in previous years and then of course is yeah untimely and said this is willy interfered with that\nProcess he had become co chair of the health financing committee so that was going to be very helpful let me ask this\nMedicare for all would you as you describe it have this one governmental entity overseeing health care expenditures is that right let's start there yes yes okay and I'd like some more details on how Medicare for all would actually work\nYes yes okay and I'd like some more details on how Medicare for all would actually work or are we talking about something that looks like the Canadian system or something that looks like the a system in in England was his national health service are we talking about something different how\nWhat does it look like ... ... as a system\nRight well I think what's unique about Massachusetts approach is that everyone under this bill but we'll changes at any moneys collected to pay hospitals doctors services labs all of those things nursing services\nWould come from one place at the Massachusetts trust it so and it would\nBe run by people who are voting for appointed representing our every area of every kind of a dynamic in any um\nGroup of people in Massachusetts\nBut what happens is the ... all the the the funds will still pay for the same hospitals the same doctors you get to keep your doctor you get it to um have all of the services that you have in your community it doesn't change the services\nIt doesn't change your doctor is your doctors will still take care of you um what all the changes is that the health insurance companies will not be making decisions about your health care they will no longer exist in a way in which they are controlling the the the cash that's moving into to payments\nSo it's it's much more like the Canadian system than it is like the u._k. system because that's a that's a national health service that doctors and other providers work for the government here that's what the doctors would still work for themselves everybody would work you know privately but the funding would be public through this health care trust\nIt strikes me perhaps being just a bit naive here that the insurance companies would not take kindly to this a bill you know and so I'm Wondering\nHow it would actually be implemented in other words in for an employer let's let's say a decent employer has a healthcare plan with a\nAn ethno or one of the other insurance companies\nAnd the employees say wait a second I don't love my health plan because it is really hard to duck doubles and it's very expensive for me and my contributions or really painful to me but at least it's a health care plan if this bill were to pass and I vote for\nSince we vote for to for my weight behind it by voting yes on question for\nWhat would happen to my plan with my employer\nWould not be plans with employers are trying to say but the um plant would be financed as it's written now in the bill the plan would be financed by a payroll tax so employers would pay a piece of that and employees would pay a piece of that\nAnd when employers have still have an option to have a health plan or those health plans for employers would essentially at least over time uh disappear and be replaced by the coverage through Medicare for all I miss\nEverybody would be covered by Medicare for all so employers you know it employers would be paying less than they are paying now so they're paying their pain halo tax but they're not paying they wouldn't pay as much as the typical employer plays at this time\nLike an administrative costs every employer has to have that pays the cost of negotiating a plan having someone I'm at having people actually distribute the information\nDo the marketing um and many employers offer many plan so it's a huge costume players right now both small employers enlarging players so that cost would be eliminated\nI understand that and I understand that within the system you actually would go down from\nSome eight nine or ten percent which are the administrative costs throughout the healthcare system now for all these individual insurance at minimum minimum down to one maximum two percent which is the ministry of overhead for Medicare I understand that there's enormous savings and all of that\nThat said what I'd like to know is whether or not there would be a difference in ... insurance coverage in other words we all hear well this person has a basic plan that person has a Cadillac plan where does Medicare for all ... what's what's\nThe evidence that in the commonwealth would have the same plan so once you're born until you die you wouldn't be eligible for the same plan\nThe legislature as well I think that's really hopeful because and I didn't know that because I remember distinctly how when President Nixon introduced a bill that looked very much like what is Romneycare or Obamacare\nThat the Democrats including Ted Kennedy and what he said it was the worst mistake and legislative a long and distinguished legislative career\nOpposed it because it wasn't good enough ... because it wasn't Medicare for all essentially called something else at the time but nonetheless that bill Obamacare Romneycare or wasn't good enough and the unions were opposed to it because\n... medical coverage health insurance coverage was something that unions negotiated for and it was an important part of the what they offered to their membership so\nAlthough unions are not nearly as strong and powerful and they were then uh I still think that's a significant change them\nThe concept of um health insurance coverage came from the way ... years ago in Detroit and when and it became when when we had very large employers and the economy was healthy and that was something that we offered are are um workers but\nThe economy's changed and healthcare has changed and we don't have those big employers anymore so we have a system that doesn't work for us anymore so it's a it's really historically um health insurance provided by employers has been what we're stuck with but I'm\nThe employer based system yeah because that's where large numbers of people in a single place in an enormous factory for example ...\nI Would like to know this we hear a lot about how the Massachusetts budget is spending\nWas devoting forty plus percent either Medicaid or Medicare in other words health insurance in one form or another and I'm Wondering whether there is an economic impetus for this for Medicare for all now this year or in the coming a meeting the immediate future that wasn't present before\nYou know best and yes the ...\nYes I think that that's really true as as as the health insurance and health care industry just takes up more and more as a budget of the state but also more and more of a budget of cities and towns in school districts\nSchool districts are incredible and towns are incredibly bird and my health care costs not only for courage employees\nBut for retired employees all of that would go away under this plan because everybody would just have their own coverage they wouldn't need to be covered through there and for you know through their school or retirees wouldn't need to be covered that way so there is beginning to really be a push from the ...\nAnd from school districts to really think about getting them out from under that so that they can you know teach and six roads and see the other things we need\n... I I think that the the question I asked my raises another question in the minds of some listeners that you use the term Medicare we use the term Medicaid they're very different and I'm Wondering if you could explain the difference in what they are to our listeners\nMedicare is a federal program for uh people over sixty five as soon as it is now of course yes those are the guided by the government but\nInstead it's a plan for retired people and also for disabled people that is something that is you know paid into like five workers by the federally administered\nAnd a Medicaid or met at the Massachusetts version of mess house as an income based program that is funded in part by the federal government in part by this day\nAnd in Medicare for all Medicaid and Medicare would all be essentially covered by one program\nYeah that would be the ultimate goal there there's a provision in the bell for I'm getting our Medicare the fund says that the state has paid into Medicare at the federal level there's provision for getting that money back the current administration is probably not going to do that\nAnd there might need to be a a separate program for people who have the current Medicare\nI'm as this as the strikes but ultimately the plan is that everybody undifferentiated by age or employment status or non income or anything else would all be under the same thing\nIt does strike me that you're going to need federal government cooperation here because Medicare is Medicare or age based is funded either significantly are totally by the federal government whereas Medicaid is significant federal reimbursement but it also has substantial state funds as well\nSo won't you need in order to have Medicare for all to cover the people who are sixty five\nAnd older I'm not saying I have any special interest in as well but um yeah [laughter] but doesn't\nEliminate Medicare payments and civil exist okay well\nIt it it it's unclear how that will exactly be worked down there will need to be some relationship between the federal government and the state about fat but it's unclear how that that's one of the many things that you know that will be looked at should the bell come out of the\nHouse okay so let's come back to them and their how do we liberate the bill from the voices of the joint committee on health care financial how can you get a bill out of the arts that build joined [laughter]\nOnto the floor of the house and the Senate in the great general court of the commonwealth of Massachusetts so we can at least have a debate on what is the biggest item in the state budget which is by far which is medical coverage health insurance coverage\nWestern mass medical Medicare for all is building a grassroots movement that's extending to the east to has been going on for many many years\nAnd Beth ... speaking around to the western mass area up twice a week and they're very many forums about this along with I'm Deborah eleven sent in general I spent some others\nUm and we have been able to educate people were were are educating and moving the concept through these this ballot initiative\nUm which will ultimately build this grassroots movement and we're seeing people come out and talking about it we already have a organizers who are canvassing and the neighborhoods in western mass and talking to people about it and we're getting incredibly strong positive responses\nAnd this is happening in Massachusetts but it's happening in many states across the country and in in much the same fashion but we're seeing of a huge increase in interest\nAnd people more and more people are coming out and talking about it and but we need to push that energy toward legislators now we have some legislators who are very much interested in moving this concept so we see the movement building in coalescing and it's only going to move forward\nAnd you know isn't it it's very important that people vote yes on question for because that really lax our legislators knows that this is a ...\nIt it's very important that people vote yes on question for because that really lets our legislators now that this is a priority for us and that we really really want them\nTo be to be working on that and so there's the ones who are already in favor and then there are the ones who are less in favor who really also need to hear from us that's how it's going to happen by the voices people rising I that's the only way\nSeems to me that Massachusetts which led the nation on what was then Romneycare and became Obamacare that can lead the nation again\nAnd horrifying is is is when Trump take in his Republican accolades take away health insurance coverage for millions of people which they're intent on doing after the midterms as they can get away with it the dark Knight always being dark is before the during that will in fact I think\nReally motivate millions and millions of Americans say we need a system that's going to work that's going to provide health insurance coverage for everyone\nIn the United states it's a human rights it's not some kind of a privilege it's twenty first century and healthcare is human rights and Medicare for all the answer vote yes on question for petty healing death Eisenberg thanks for all your work their members of Worcester, Massachusetts Medicare for all western for\nWill prevail here by a large
