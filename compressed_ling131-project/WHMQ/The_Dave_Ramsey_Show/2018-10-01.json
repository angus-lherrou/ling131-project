didn't know that and I and and most people don't\nWant to them a little bit more about another part of the story which is the races which is not part of aviation history than I knew knew can you tell us how that became part of American culture folklore history\nSure so you know first we need to forget about what we know about our modern day or shows these\nRaces in the Nineteen twenties and thirties were ... ... with a real sport like baseball boxing and just as popular as each of those um it it can\nAs a really a marketing ploy ah in the late Nineteen twenties there's a lot of interest in aviation driven mostly by Charles Lindbergh in his flight across the ocean in Nineteen twenty seven\nAnd and because of its people are very excited about this new mode of travel but it's a very dangerous mode of travel at the time planes crashed with owning regularity or a river reasons that we would find horrified today\nAnd mediation industry knew they had a at a perception problem ... and the races were really borne out of that they they knew that people wanted the planes and they and they gave him essentially a show\nAt ... and drove people to to primitive airfields around this country to see planes race\nAnd and the crowds were massive you could have a hundred and twenty five thousand pain and in a single day just as many watching for free\nHalf a million fans of single weekend just huge crowds and the races were were were exciting but also very dangerous and and\nThere was a lure in danger\nAnd it was some ... some kind of a common interest because it was something about the potential for a woman pilot and up in the tragic accident that was even worse somehow than male pilot that was kind of\nAlmost chauvinist ... to protect to partnering American culture at the time\nNot exactly indeed initially the women were not allowed to re\nSo here's the sport it it's one of the most popular in America and the women are not permitted to rate\nAnd so early on starting in Nineteen twenty nine or ... like ... characters you know a millionaire heart and her friends we stayed in it that goal in particular really began to push to be included and in in Nineteen twenty nine\nThey finally are allowed to race but the men and post all kinds of ... on them\nA rule that the men did not face a they they wanted to win the race on their term\nUh and and this really began almost a decade of battles between the men and women you know they they are in the rights of race in Nineteen twenty nine but they ... they do so in the face of belittling rules and and even after that the little when rules and you\nBut by Nineteen thirty three the women have proven\nTheir ability and they finally earned the right to fly against the men race against the men are just like it a NASCAR today where where men and women race on the same track\nThey finally earned that right in Nineteen thirty three but\nWhen when things don't go well when when a woman died when one of my character died and one of these races\nThe men then use it as an excuse to banish the women and that really sets up ultimate climactic battle or whether whether women return take on the bed at night

if you can and if you would and then I Want to ask you a question share reaction is some of us who succeeded well shared with each other yesterday so auntie\nWell in classic Saturday Night live fashioned after forty four seasons of doing this they had what they called the cold open which the show just opens often times on the political note in this time no different than it looks like it was set up as the cabinet hearing\nWith a Chuck Grassley portrayed by Alex Moffett Dianne Feinstein portrayed by definitely strong special guest Rachel draft from previous kept coming back to being Kobus jar\nAnd Matt Damon as judge Kavanaugh oh hell yeah [noise]\nI tell you that I'm going to start an eleven\nI was just done when the opening ... when he opened with the sniffles in an effort to present himself\nAs being sensitive and compassionate but as the ah Saturday Night live a skit goes ... it was the true man was there I had been taken a bit aback\nI'm with the news reports about his wrists the response of his child I guess it was a daughter\nWho said we should pray for her it was totally political it was totally political and it was just reflective of what one could expect with him on the on the on on the\nCourt I'm Wondering if you as an African American woman at a specific kind of reaction to how she her testimony was received compared to how new Hill's testimony was ... twenty seven years earlier ...\nIt\nWas a Anita Hill's testimony is over Twenty years is it and I have to say it's not as fresh in my mind\nUm\nThat did there was that different that came and not and I I I\nPersonally felt it was not the gender based um it would be good to see that it was\nIt had to do with gender or both of them being women but I I felt that there was that racial factor that was inherent in their response was a new to hell yeah yeah\nYeah yeah yeah\nYeah I was taken back to the hills um to Anita Hill when I was listening\nAnd I remember because I watch very closely at that time the disrespect that they gave her and I'm Anita\nCompared to really trying I thought they were trying really hard to seem a impartial they they but I I I it didn't come across as authentic to me but they were trying so hard we want to be fair and they kept saying that\nBut in the end there's no fairness on particularly on one side [noise] [noise]\nYeah you know I I I I felt the legitimacy of the case for\nUm her\nUh that's what he what he Eighteen but I don't think the change occurred their willingness to delay the next phase of it I I and and that's part of living while black\nArtist living while black\nI was thinking on the way over I had I had picked up um I think it was a quote from Sojourner Truth and uh she said that I Am black and I am\nAnd so the race factor enters in however it cannot be the other factors matter but they don't first and foremost\nMatter and I'm speaking for me I I yeah I again that's that's my purse\nAnd having grown up as we used to say\nI I was I've been black three times I was a black a baby I was a black child and now I'm a black adult and the and the thing continues to permeate my life\nI Can't allow it to strangle me but it continues and I'm always conscious of it I've been actively involved in women's movements and women's effort\nLiberation effort and yet but it keeps coming up the other piece I felt was that uh the the\nThe

impacted October twelve hours a day of my a\nMarathon where I play ping pong for twelve straight hours uh to uh we're trying to raise ten thousand bucks this year for a record used it to come in the area and through Catholic charities um I Know that you're appalled at what happened recently is that the Trump Administration has proposed a limit\nOn a nothing more than thirty thousand refugees into the country and you know only about half of those are going to be accepted\nSo each year dwindled and windows in windows you're talking about twenty two point five million ... cheese is the biggest refugee crisis in in world history and we're going to keep everybody else\nYou know I'm I'm horrified look I think I I co chair of the human rights commission here in Congress and I believe that the United states stands for anything we need to stand out loud and four square for human rights and you know if we stand for human rights than we are our actions need to prove that and that means that when there are people fleeing violence in wars in natural\nDisasters that we are as well as other countries in the world\nBecome a place where they can find some safe haven and we're not talking about taking the entire world's displaced population and but we do our part and as you pointed out you know in your opening remarks I mean we're we're living in the world now where we have more refugees than any other time in in in history\nAnd uh there are wars and upheavals a natural disasters all over the world where you know people have been displaced and um and some people are playing for their

that\nYou know are unbelievably to our country a there'd been doctors and business people and teachers and I mean I could go on and on musicians\nAnd they come here to work and that's what they're going to the absolute lemonade or I'm hit\nIt come here to work to be able to raise their family I I don't understand why it's become so controversial and you know I think it plays into the administration's theme of you know let's beat up on immigrants are men\nAnd they don't distinguish between you know somebody who is an economic migrant versus somebody who was a legitimate refugees fleeing violence and civil unrest it you know they just they paint everybody with one brush\nAnd um I Would say to you that you know within the pioneer valley area I mean you know the whole area has
