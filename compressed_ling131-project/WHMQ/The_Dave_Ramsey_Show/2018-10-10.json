of course it's all if the sarcastic\nYeah and I feel like that's a good way of channeling rage but I feel like we have discovered a million new ways of of channeling her rage and what happened\nIt it it's really hard not to feel I'm enraged appalled sort of aghast at at uh what\nHappened um with the Republican Senate crazed determination to see\nBrett Kavanaugh on the Supreme Court when there were other qualified conservatives who who could have been seated instead of like you know Amy Coney Barrett um there are people who would have fit the bill but you know this particular person was a Bush protege\nUm and ah there was tremendous support for him\nUm and the Republican Party operative and they're going after the Clintons and yeah it was a person who is a true believer\nTrue believer and you know and it's kind of funny if you think back to his testimony and um he basically a ... you know he he was part of that team\nKen stars team that went after Bill Clinton and um try to uh tie a Clinton with perjury for having said you know I didn't have sex with this woman over the Monica Lewinsky scandal and yet\nHere you have Brett Kavanaugh also say it this never happens you know and despite all this corroborating evidence concerning his character drunkenness a you know behavior around a girls and women and\nUm it it I I have\nTo say that as a former journalist and as a woman I I Am just sort of appalled by this whole thing and um you know one thing we do know is that institutions and families they continually fail\nTo properly thoroughly investigate\nAllegations of sexual assault and to figure out what type of discipline or reprimand is appropriate and you know there's always this idea of handling such incidents on a case by case basis and of course\nWhat happens I'm In institutions when things are handled on a on a case by case basis is that a decisions get made based on who someone is in their ... you\nKnow in a manger of us because it's important to note that you also covered the court yeah when you were a report yeah yeah you just saw a lot of this I did a report and\nUm so what was really striking about Kavanaugh's testimony um was how very on judge like he seems I mean if you spent some time in the trial courts\nUm you know you become aware of the constant demands um for civility and I'm proper demeanor and it's it's really very\nCritical and I'm judges often will reprimand a lawyer for getting out of line I'm a witness 'em and they'll you know they'll say things like you know settle down and and there will be threats of contempt of court and you know you can't just come in and\nBegin speaking in this very loud belligerent kind of way so that whole Yahoo is that person now who will monitor coughing a behavior well you know if they're going to be the chief justice that's a good\nQuestion and and I but you know and I I don't know the answer but I Do\nKnow that women are incredibly fired up and um especially women who work in the law in various capacities you know and there are there are groups of women lawyers that are organized now on social media and um and will they be watching it certainly\nThey will um\n[noise] what's

went to college with and um\nAnd I I\nAnd it just it is it's underscore to me that the prevalence of just the problem the problem of how um men behave towards women particularly in that period of time when people are in their teens or early twenties and\nUm and I think that even men who are well meaning like you guys [laughter] of looking at\nMine too [laughter] that that\nMaybe we women have not
