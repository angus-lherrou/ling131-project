show and we welcome to the show to foreigners who is the director of community health and government relations at two ... and hospital and and liberal on who is the nursing director critical care services at who the hospital we are here to talk to that question about question number one on nursing staff ratios\nI'd want to actually get to the heart of this and there are a number of arguments going on around the periphery is that I think have no merit so let me dispensed with those and tell you what I really love to talk about okay\nI don't buy the argument that it's going to slow would take effect in January there'll be no time to implement it because it won't be implemented in January the legislature is going to change that date and or will be ignored just as the legislature change the marijuana dates 'em it's just not real in my opinion\nAnd it's going to take six months to a year to write the regulations which are going to be required in order to implement the law so high we can't do this in January what's freak out it's not an argument to make weight argument might to to the other argument that I think ... is this claim that there's twenty five thousand dollars per violation for hospital Everytime we don't have the right number of nurses on the word\nThat's nonsense in my opinion because the determination is not going to be made its first of all it's not twenty five thousand it's up to twenty five thousand it's an inch or cause it's supposed to get people to obey the law and the hospitals are doing their best no one's going to charge them twenty five thousand dollars is not going to happen I think that some equate argument\nI Do think that there are some serious arguments here about the question on itself and that's what I Would like to talk about it and that's about the ratios the problem and the money so if we could focus on that I Would appreciate it\nThe other arguments that I see on ... and the advertisements I just makes me want to screen just looks like Franklin corporate propaganda but effective corporate profit again in my opinion so here's where I'd like to start do you think is are you ... or you ...\nDo you believe that there is in fact a problem that is a valid question is trying to get to\nKnow the words are there adequate nurses across the commonwealth and the hospitals is not a problem we don't have to deal with this the whole thing's bogus or is there a problem can we at least have some clarity on that because I think a lot of people are confused not necessarily confuses I'd been in a hospital recently but\nAre confused about the hospital saying we don't need to do anything we've oppose this for Twenty years we've been successful in getting the legislature to do nothing congratulations us there's not a

continue our conversation about question one on which we will vote next Tuesday we were speaking with Jeff foreigners who\nIs the director of community health and government relations at who comes in hospital and and the ... who is the nursing director of critical care services at Dickinson hospital\nLet's talk about the ratios if we might please this question one this question question one set staffing ratios for nurses at hospitals one or the ratios that are set forth in question one\nSo the question one ballot sets ratios according to what level of care you're requiring so general med search patients would be what were the\nGeneral mid surge [laughter]\nYour your cannot pay China medical surgical for ... for you know and it's simple surgery or\nLet's let's go impulse or you don't want to hear I don't want to hear about really ... yeah I get lazy you know I get queasy it's come kind of squeamish let's not go there\nSo what the dollar question ... out of patience is one nurse for every four patients and that is\nWhether you are fresh posts not just coming out of surgery or whether you're on day three waiting to go home and just you know everything is ready to go and you're just being discharged and you're right you're waiting for the ride home and at no point does that consider the fact\nThat you might need a different level of care because of where you are on your check to me of care\nSo let me see if I understand is you have a one nurse for for patients on June ... surge scare guy\nGot I got it okay I sort of a\nAnd if they are all those patients are for example let's say with a patients on the floor and they're all a day three post stop and they're all about to go home they don't want you don't need a a one to four\nRatio for them on the other hand if someone's just coming out of a very serious surgery that person might need er nurse twenty four seven for a while\nRight need right a little better ratio than just one of four but if you are limited by your ratio is it's very hard to adjust and that's what nurses do they look at the whole situation they look at the condition of the patient and that's what about Clinton doesn't allow for the individual needs for these patients it's just across the board\nNumber it's not on the specific needs to be patient and Netflix is two and a daily basis and those things can change 'em um mom economic it's the nurse that decides exactly what that patient needs any given moment and\nAnd those things can change 'em um mom economic it's the nurse that decides exactly what that patient needs any given moment\nAnd that has been a large part of the you know on ONE Campaign this takes away discretion from nurses\nAnd what I'd like to know is why is that true because the ballot question itself sets up a minimum ratio so if you have for nurses on than sixteen patients on her for that would be a very large unit\nBut that said why even under the ballot initiative can't the nurses get together and with there's a supervisory of management people say OK here's who the patients are today here's how we're going to deploy resources why does the ballot question in your judgment take away that discretion 'cause it's not how I read it but\nIt's the points has made a lot by the new one quick to no one campaign so help me understand that from your perspective\nSo let's go back to that earlier situation that talking about where you have your eight patients that are already difficult to get in touch so we have eight patients they have to nurse\nAnd we should point out this in in the lives of nurses that's not how it works but okay\n[laughter] everywhere like\nThat and and say there are two of my patients in the emergency room\nWho are waiting to come up to the floor and really today we can say okay we can actually bring those patients and give them perfectly safe care but once this ballot initiative is the way the half we wouldn't be able to pull those patience either the emergency room ... actually physically is charged the patience\nAnd then that search that and that means he'll take or the or the\nLegislature writes in a an escape clause anything you know I have to do what you do with like ... and ... okay\nBut that's where we got to let me say it limits the ability of the the flexibility of the nurse has to make those decisions at this point\nBecause there has to be this minimum staffing level on the other hand it's a minimum Seventy level it's not a maximum Seventy level and so\nThe hospital would as soon in that situation put out a call for first of all we should note that someone shows up to the emergency room they're going to be treated valid question one yes or no they're going to be treated as federal law that person has to be treated\nAnd certainly they have to be treated as second address the question\nOf admissions to the hospital and whether or not that would or wouldn't be delayed and I think that as a practical matter it wouldn't be delayed because people are going to say we'll get the nurses and weekends for his needs to be admitted we're going to do was medically sound that's just how it's going to work in the real world events to make\nThat is you know I Can't imagine a nurse having can be put in that position and making that decision right um and like going to follow the law and not see the same time I going to break the law and do what I've been trying to do what putting these nurses in a position of hay of having to make that decision I don't know but if they put Methodist\nRight again assuming the legislature wouldn't teach us which is something I I think is really an impossible scenario going forward okay so one is the flexibility argument for nurses the other question or the other issue that seems to me is real\nHas to do with what this will cost and who pay for it and I know that's a large part of the no on ONE Campaign so why don't you explain that position for us a Jeff honestly want to try that or in the run you're on a roll [laughter]\nNo either won't have healthy though and so uh we'll talk about the concern for him and our our projections are concerned or that this will cost us a between six and a half million ... million per year\nAnd that's for salaries for additional nurses on duty\nResumes go into that but the majority of that would be salaries is also in a cutie tool that we're making some assumptions that wages would rise because we're all going to be competing for the same oh hospitals were competing for the same pool of nurses\nJeff you will have enough one second what's an acuity to ... [laughter]\nAnd that's like Judy Chu [laughter] basically how to fish and served as\nIt does I think it gives you a certain parameters of ... um\n... paying you know the needs that patient require so we have them right now in the I feel tired of the legislation for those and ratios and the nurse input you know all these different categories and parameters and then you know it's an objective truth that tells you it gives you a guideline number in the physics actually how many\nPatients should be paired with this patient in it a little like hair\nOkay let me go back because I did in Iraq just foreigners who is the director of community health and government relations echo a difference in hospital you're talking about the money and how much would cause Cooley Dick that's we've just heard from your mostly about salaries it for more nurses and more nursing care at the hospital in a year\nAnd I think you're going to tell me and we're not going to get reimbursed for the additional cost so\nPleased if well uh I think that's probably true I think we would try to negotiate insurance contracts to get some of them back but um you know it's a baby boomer era more people going on Medicare all the time and that's\nSo what are you in the morning with ... and that was the only live family\nIn my\nFrom second one on one by one by one you may be [noise]\n[noise] this is bill Newman WHM coming to the Academy of music\nThis weekend November second third and the ninth and tenth at seven thirty and then this weekend again Sunday at two o'clock that would be on a November fourth and then the eleventh again following Sunday at two o'clock\nTo ... years Gilbert and Sullivan the ... years again at the Academy of music this weekend and next\nBeing produced by valley like opera here to help us\nHave a preview I don't know if they're going to sing for us or not we have a minute power does a member of valley right offering the producer of gone to here's an Michael bud ... who is the state's director for this production of the kinds of weird so much fun I Will not sing for you what I son\nOne great and go [laughter] that's just in deference\nTo Monte and his musical sensibility however Gilbert and Sullivan so much fun so much like so much energy such a terrific idea tell us what's going to be happening at the academy and why you chose the gun to leaders and those are with ah Michael but\nThat's great I I heard you were in grade school of H. and that's kind of for a very popular production for a grade schools\nThe gun to ... years is um after pirates of ... and H and if it's in for and the McCotter which many people know the ... is actually a the the next great uh upper editor Gilbert and Sullivan did and it was it was late in their collaboration and it's incredibly colorful\nIt's beautiful it's funny it's timely has a lot of topical political references that that are good to this day you know about a power versus people who are out of power um social democracy and all kinds of things but so we have\nWe have a lot of this wonderful production which by the way is huge just like all below productions\nOf huge in terms of the number of people ... huge in terms of everything\nThere after ... valley heavy offer [laughter] sorry it's called late because it's a comedy it's funny\nIt's really really funny but there are four ... offers a forty people on stage including seven children um if there is a full orchestra in incredible period costumes are our costs and people always do an amazing job sets designed by an architect\nA lighting designer who's a genius so it's it's quite an extravagant production tell us a little bit\nAbout Gilbert and Sullivan when they wrote and why they wrote these operas and I've read is\nAbsolutely it was the nineteenth century and they were the satirists of their time they did satire on politics and Gilbert ... early fake\nNews that's what you're sort of like what are they haven't done they certainly they got\nOut there and they lampooned as the people in power okay and also the social structure and it's so interesting 'cause it was Britain of course so there are so many parallels to the way America is now and that British sense of humor so subtle\nSo you can all almost like they're ... they're acting like they're they're um upper class Brits but they're making little Monty Python jokes all around all through it or ...\nJokes and then you know that's where I got on micro cam right so we take\nThe humor and we expanded we give it a modern flair and some pop culture references and hum and here we are but the thing is not only were they satirist and wrote some funny things\nBut some of it was a serious composer and so around all this witty dialogue and lyrics and wordplay you rover was the threat is what's that Gilbert was deliberate has lived yes Gilbert was libretto and Sullivan wrote the music and he was a grand opera composer he composed ATMs\nClassically trained and he wrote these wonderful operas around is using he turned\nBack into rock and roll either which is it's\nAmazing and roll yeah and so this collaboration actually happened when they were having a ... or right after they had a big fight\n[laughter] they're big fight because some of them was a serious composer and Gilbert kept doing these witty comedies things and he said I Want to make a grand opera and in Gilbert was so insulted you know what's wrong with our stuff [laughter] so here at the end\nOf of the day here it is over a hundred years later and everybody's heard of Gilbert and Sullivan and their operators nobody's heard of ... grand opera [laughter] um but he did do one he did to one's called I've into\nBut it's the Gilbert ... which nobody's heard of easy it's ... it's rarely for foreign and so if you heard of I've enough\nI'd heard of I Know with an ... yeah I Know in ... west in Springfield FSI cars are that's about the extent I now\nBut the other cool thing about Gilbert and Sullivan is it's the granddaddy of all grand American musicals on Broadway all those you hello Dolly and all those the grand musicals that have music\nAnd the highlight of the word Hamilton to make my toes I sure a lot of musical Hamilton\n[laughter] I'd like to turn back if I might need a powered who was a member of a light offer as well as the producer why do you love this particular Gilbert and Sullivan production\nUm I've been doing these productions now for many years and it is a political relevance and the intensity of the music is just\nBeautiful and the the phrasing that certain characters bring to that music it just it's beautiful it's just really funny and in some of the twist that Michael has added because they do keep these ... these musicals relevant by updating the politics\nIt's astounding how much things stay the same in never change and how much change never changes and it it's these twists that happen and the more you pay attention the subtlety is it's it's really funny and and that's one thing I'm repeating myself\nBut I Would like to go back to one a point that ah Michael ... may not have to do with\nA ... it's very heavy opera 'cause there are so many people involved how many individuals altogether make up the the the production because you don't resolve is known for its course it's there where if you're in grade school and you can't sing very well you can be\nPlace than I Do too much now we're all saying well I I'm sure you're always or is it however the fourth\nGrade I ... that my voice has not improved a lot since then in March he will do for take no you won't thank you very much but how many people altogether\nAre thirty seven numbers I Believe onstage thing and then one of the wonderful things about Gilbert and Sullivan is that it's like a true because they are considered another cast member\nThey are no cars as a character they ... they are the character they bring the rest of the store and they have like a vigil identities there used to being in acting is not limited to just you know the people in the front you are\nThe village and what's as it takes a village to create a show it's not something that all the characters on stage they say how many people on stage at thirty seven\nAs it takes a village to create a show it's not something that all the characters on stage they say how many people on stage at thirty seven\nThere's a tremendous um volunteer orchestra there are this set designers and all the ... and they are they the entire village of people you never see on stage to choreographers one little dysfunctional family as I'd like to say\nLike every person brings or are they ended up like I Know you're close to a hundred there are tremendous number ...\nAnd you you learn the idiosyncratic in idiosyncrasies of each person behind the scenes on stage and it's really\nThe ... of a hundred a ... there will be at her own life to live\nThere for one show it and then there's some people who were there for every show there are members who have been part of these shows for forty years they were there for the very very first production\nValue I'd offer presents Gilbert and solving the gone to here's this weekend November second and third it's a dirty then Sunday for the matinee at\nTwo o'clock and then the following weekend as well on friday and Saturday evening at seven thirty and again
