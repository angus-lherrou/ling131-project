just so honored to be a part of that\nThan us and yeah I Would absolutely echo everything that's it and said I think that's what's amazing about these events for me is just getting to hear from people

Marie Curie is certainly you know one of the most famous women scientists ever she is the only person male or female to ever win the Nobel Prizes in both physics and chemistry ooh I'm and she did a lot of the early pioneering work on radioactivity\nI'm Alone with her husband Pierre Curie with whom she shared the Nobel Prize in physics\nUm and I have read that apparently the Nobel Committee was considering giving the prize to him um and that he among others objective that she had done just as much of the work as he did and\nUh and he ended up sharing the prize the two of them and then about ten or Fifteen Years later she also got the Nobel Prize in chemistry I'm the second woman who won the Nobel to win the Nobel yeah there's um ... um\nGot the prize in sixty three she uh came up with the basic model that uh we still use to describe atomic nuclei the nuclear shell a model\nUm so when we make the structure of the Adam in our classes in school that's the is that her I quite when you make the structure of the Adam you just usually make the nucleus of dot oh yeah and then you what you're making is the structure the electrons around it now it was discovered by Neal's bore\n... Meyer figured out that if you zoom in on the nucleus it has much the same structure of the protons and neutrons in the nucleus lying in the shells that look just like those models you were making a ha I'm but nobody understood how that worked because the forces are completely different she figured out how to make that model work so with in\nThe Cold War\nExplain that a little bit yeah proton we've got electrons neutrons Arnold's hanging out together in the core protons and neutrons\nAre in the court the electrons are way way outside so one of the standard images people described as if the nucleus were the size of a basketball okay the electrons would be out at the outer edges of a large cathedral um the nucleus is miniscule die in the middle of the Adam\nAnd so people just thought of it is this you know sort of solid lump um but they knew there were these things they couldn't explain about it you have certain numbers of protons and neutrons that would always be there and other numbers would never occur\nAnd no one knew Ryan ... Meyer figure it out it's because inside that tiny little dot they have these expanding shells just like the electrons in the outer part of the Adam\nWell let me turn now if I might to jury and Weinberger also a professor of physics at Smith College tell us what it is that Donald Strickland what's her discovery what's her contribution to physics that won her the Nobel Prize in physics this year the third woman ever it's been\nForty five years is really I have a fifty years over fifty years I had to do that on my head in my hand to try to figure out it's been a long time [noise] somehow no woman\nWas deserving of the Nobel Prize in physics but anyway\nUh Newman is not deserving of the Nobel Prize in math or even arithmetic for that matter I okay so\nHow was that well strictly at the time this was back in the Nineteen eighties was actually a graduate student at ... at the University of Rochester and together they worked on or develop the technique for I'm taking lasers which had been around for over about twenty five years at that point\nAnd figured out how to um make laser pulses extremely short and extremely powerful and so the upshot of that was it opened up an incredible area of all kinds of applications where they could investigate\nThings that happen as Gary was talking about inside Adams themselves on very very short timescales with these very short laser pulses\nAnd all kinds of applications where they could use these high power pulses to do things like eye surgery\nA machining of aircraft engine parts are literally putting holes and baby bottle nipples all kinds of stuff\nSo the reason that I have had a laser eye surgery and I have our new Nobel laureate thank for that I'm In part\nYes [laughter] yes\nTell us a little bit more about lasers you are expert on this as I understand it and I would like to know not only about these applications but whether the new Star Wars movies now going to be even more than the White House and because\nThe ... and all that a lot of a lot of what we uh see about lasers is or not the industrial applications which are\nAmazing and knocked the laser eye surgery what you've heard about but they're also a laser pointers and such it's\nOK let's say we are [laughter] I Know [laughter] I like to think they like it [laughter] so let's back up\nA little here and what is a laser exact okay well\nLet's start with what isn't a laser and that's all the all ... all the kinds of light sources that we're more used to like the lights in this room at this moment the sun et cetera\nAnd businesses have have developed this this term uh describes such light sources as incoherent which kind of describes that\nThey're all over the place so there for the most part composed of what we call white light so all different colors which are different wavelengths of light um they go in all different directions and they're not in any way acting in concert\nLast incoherent light the kinds of light that we're used to in everyday\nRight here in because they can't get themselves Oregon together right they're cats chaos they're tired of Zach representatives of the Trump Administration\nHas with a laser [laughter] oh let's try to stay away from the politics [laughter]\nBut in any case lasers are um as most people have seen for example laser pointers\nAre very different so they're highly directional so all those the light that comes out of a laser pretty much goes all the the the waves go in the same direction um and also it's very what we call highly Monica dramatic which means single color so most lasers\nUm have a very very narrow range of wavelengths it constitute that late and since it's so highly um like a pencil beam\nIt can be controlled very easily with lenses and mirrors and such and\nI'm unlike a the the ... kinds of white light that we used to\nSew the laser itself as I understand what you're saying it's funneling white it's putting him through a very very small opening\nIs the nature of laser light itself is to be that to to emerge from the inside of the laser which um it has energy stored in it and then when the energy emerges it naturally comes out in a very very tiny beam\nAnd his Monica traumatic so ... to ... the light spectrum is reduced to a very small slice of it I have let them so far recollection\nYes like white light goes from the the um you know blue into this the spectrum to the red end of the spectrum and his most lasers are single color essential\nAnd other usually read or are they going to be any of the oh they can be any anywhere ... lasers\nInfrared lasers all different colors of ... or any end of the ... yeah absolutely there's even X ray versions of laser\n... okay so this light is coming through the various pinpoint it's very concentrated is there some proportion mechanism to this is there like a hammer for gun that projects ...\nKnow whenever you create um and usually the other description of light is either as a wave or as you may know particles\nI I forget I think it was Einstein who coined the word ... photons describe these chunks of energy so that's the other way to think about light as as these chunks of energy costs so times and I'm photons travel electromagnetic waves another name for light travel at the speed of light\nStephanie Miller sons had to read I think that we want to throw

I think it was a little more than it was that when I I don't remember exactly when it was but it was before the twenty sixteen election where the Republican controlled house committee investigating Benghazi called a Hillary Clinton and\nAnd they questioned her for something like eleven hours and she was graceful intelligent informative uh nothing coming even close to anything that could be considered a lie or just very dignified a very well informed\nAnd just grace under pressure in every way and even a couple of years before that she had testified before another committed believe it was a Senate committee controlled by Republicans about Benghazi\nAnd she was fabulous through that entire ah one she only had one angry a moment where she said what difference does it make when the Republicans were harping on some very specific very trivial detail\nOr and then Republicans blew that all out of proportion and she had lost her mind and was screaming and yelling didn't care about Americans who had died so they took one tiny little phrase they use that in anger and turn that into she's not qualified she doesn't have the temperament and yet Kavanaugh's testimony\nThere were full hours and hours of testimony that were completely on hand there were so angry\nAnd so emotionally inappropriate for the situation that uh you know and yet they just say well he was wrongly accused of something of course is going to be angry well Hillary Clinton's been wrongly accused of things for\nDecades [laughter] yes she's angry about them but yes she knows when she was testifying she can't just stand there and yell and scream and flipper pages back and forth you know Matt Damon didn't do an imitation of Hillary Clinton on Saturday Night live after her hearings\nYou could almost see the Republican committee turning the pages to the script and he's now we're supposed to cry on cue okay I'm In this one little a passage you are from John charters calling her\nA irony can be magical but sometimes it's just plain nasty for example we have a president accused of sexual assault selecting a Supreme Court nominee who was also accused of sexual assault and into deeper already Kavanaugh might joined Clarence Thomas accused of sexual harassment decades ago as the deciding vote you criminalize women's reproductive choices in this case I already sucks irony\nSucks in this case I mean there there's so many things about this that really suck ... uh the fact that uh you know ... ... after a Ford's testimony Trump was saying she seemed really\nDignified incredible and he said something like what a nice lady or something not typically written I lay in yeah and then just a few days later he was mocking her at one of his yeah one of his rallies or\nThe irony that anybody would believe Trump on any matters related to sexual harassment or sexual assault is it it sucks it just there's no other way around it\nA ... another passenger from the ... the drunken abuses from my college dorm don't belong Supreme Court\nAnd neither does a cabin on you know I'm I was in the eighth grade the eighth grade and there were several of my classmates who were involved in in what they used to call a gang bang Mm behind at the school they had a campfire behind the school\nAnd everybody knew that this happened and they brag about it and laughed about it and all that and uh\nYeah yeah it's it's pervasive in American culture that that men get away with things that are just abhorrent uh and when women do report these things they get crucified for it and I hope that the me too movement is leading a toward changing that\nUh I I have I have a lot of optimism for the future not the immediate future uh but the long term future a that this is going to change that men are not allowed to systematically abused women like this and get away with it\nJohn charge latest column is on Mondays ... that you can find it on ... and I believe I'm going to see John ... at the end of the
