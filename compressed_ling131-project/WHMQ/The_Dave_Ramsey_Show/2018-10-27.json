is Leonard soon as he got some most of the ... most a plus size ten\nTen oh focus again fairly late to sixteen twenty to let his second was a season even\nA well yeah we were heading the third quarter was one of the stranger games I've ever been associated with it because we had a tremendous we can practice on both sides of the ball um defense didn't give up but I feel go on the first half and then we were up and down and\nJust made mistakes in the red zone we we played like a first game\nYou know made some mistakes uneasy plays were practicing given the St look so we dropped too many balls on offense but the red zone was really restricting and uh you know I heard is and um you know credit culture Carolina they never got a good team and I felt the magic McGurk reporters over top of we just couldn't make that one plane just\nOn defense made a couple comments made a radical metal errors in in in coverage games and they exploited so my hats off to those guys but our guys fought all the way and that was a really good thing to see on the tape and now we just got a point where a lot more energy when we go down the Yukon this week\nAsk you about the defense because I Know that during the ... you and your stuff works very hard on plugging some of the decisions that you had seen over the first half of the season and the results obviously were a lot better on Saturday what did change coached and where are you pleased with it for the most part on that side of the\n... the first time all year that we had all eleventh starters practice that has not happened in the first seven games so I certainly think that that leads to some consistency it certainly helped us you know and and we may\nPlays them when the ball is in the air we got it in the first half and a force to a couple of turnovers and played well and the red zone enforcement and fewer than ... big stand up for them to far more than a kickoff return so they they put a lot of energy and ah you know we got to get the office to um get it in the hands on this week\nGo triple with us I'm Josh our admitted men in Yukon coming up and he starts for their four games left in the season it's the time of the year where you get down to the nitty gritty Windsor at a premium and you want to still get every one you can for your team had how do you sense that the guys are holding together after last weekend\nYou know young guys a little more result you know I think than the coaches you know we're in there all day Sunday and the sauce on the players I talk to them and say hey it's all in front of a ... you know but but we can't worry about down the road you got to worry about one thing as\nHaving another great we can practice that really helped us on defense in the office gotta catch 'em on gotta make place yeah you gotta make plays at this level and we gotta make twice Saturday against you cook\nLet's talk about this you come team their record is probably not indicative of the way that they're playing currently look at what they did at South Florida last weekend thirty eight thirty USF which was ranked tied at halftime they end up losing by eight points so that looked like for a young Yukon team but go gentle they're starting to come together\nYeah that they took the ball away three times in the first half or two interceptions on the first to garage that really gave momentum and stored in a quarterback condos are really really good play a really good ... they had an off\nWeekend it's made a difference and certainly his a performance you had to hire a hundred and Ninety seven yards so they've got good receivers alliance big and strong and uh I mean I can move the ball they could have done that against everybody and they put a tough schedule so I'm you know their defense obviously became a little more opportunistic and had some takeaways and gained a lot of confidence\nAnd are they playing a lot of young guys are just getting better every week\nIt looks like a gentle and made a concerted made a decision recently I'm just going to go young and they know that they've got a lot of talent that maybe wouldn't have otherwise that they had a few more wins earlier seeing the field as much as they are but that's dangerous goes right when you get some of the young guns are the young kind of learning on the job and they start to figure it out so and I bet it also makes it tougher to prepare for them\nTheir merit well we're seeing the guys on film so I mean that's each coaches decision or you know renting or what is what he's doing so uh I just what I see on tape as they got talent and or maybe young role but they have talent on both sides of the ball and the and a really good ... so you know we we are more worried about mass and taking care of the ball and and\nMaybe young role but they have talent on both sides of the ball in a really good Potter so you know we we are more worried about mass and take care of the ball and gets scored a touchdown kicking feel real
