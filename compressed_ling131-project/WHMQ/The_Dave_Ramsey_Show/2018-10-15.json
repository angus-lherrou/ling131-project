found it yet but it's on them or think that the orbit suggest the existence of and other body and this is how\nPluto was found because something weird what's happening in the afternoon there was a prediction made that there must be some other pointed out beyond Neptune and lo and behold Pluto gets discovered\nRight and but I really crude example is actually the discovery of Neptune itself that was discovered in Eighteen forties at the time but as traumas had discovered you're nuts and they were like well but its orbit suggested they may be a large sized object out there\nThey could also predict and I'm Talking about early Nineteen century they could also predict where would it be found that ...\nWill be at a particular place at a particular time even though we have never seen it all you have to do is to point\nThe telescopes in that direction at this place at this time you're going to find this planet and ... that's exactly what happened and in fact it really spurred interest in science and also trust in science because we're like well if you can predict things that are unseen this must be powerful after this goblin\nDoor planet may be indicative of some other bigger planets out there in\nOur solar system if we know about all these other planets we found the Mr Spock Vulcan around another star\nHow can we haven't found another giant planet in our own solar system it'd be

and remember it so far away that you don't get that much light from it either the goblins Charlotte the lucky to find it right now in most of its orbit it is\nTo find for us to see an even with large telescopes and it has an orbit of our own forte\nYou're not going to see it so we just got lucky that it was on the closest approach so the same thing ... maybe with this planet nine that's the reason why people are trying to search with large telescopes larger sky it's a tricky thing but two other objects I should mention along with a\nGarden that have been fine said no neither do I find it I
