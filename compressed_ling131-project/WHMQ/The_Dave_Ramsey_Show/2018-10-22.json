published capitalism in America history by Alan Greenspan and Adrian will drudge of course Alan\nGreenspan is the chair former chair of the council of economic advisors and the long term chair of the Federal Reserve board he served as chair of the council of counts of economic advisers under President Ford\nAnd was appointed chair of the fed by President Reagan his co author Adrian ... who is with us this morning is the economists political editor his written some half a dozen previous books prior to capitalism in America\nA history well it's a long history and we only have Fifteen minutes so I don't expect you to actually tell us this story altogether Mr will drudge but I Would appreciate turning to the\nBack of the book if I might and it is I mean I should note for readers has really readable makes economics accessible and I really appreciate that I'd like to turn to the park\nIs titled answered Trump where you have a few comments about President Trump but not a lot about this tax cut for corporations and for the upper one percent of taxpayers in the United states\nAnd I'm Wondering how you feel about and you and Mr Greenspan feel about this recent tax cut whether it's good for the United states and whether it matters anymore now that the Republicans don't seem to care that we're going to have trillion dollar deficits yearly for as long as the eye can see what's what's your position on that\nWell I think the if you look at the American corporate tax rate\nUm which was a thirty five percent it was very high by global standards and not just high but dysfunctional because it weighs a lot of American global companies to keep very large amounts of money\nAll ... sitting that basically doing nothing um so you go to these sort of tradition dollar cash mansions fishing them money not being used for productive investments so I think there was everything to be that the tax cuts but not for the top one percent of\nThe corporations\nUm and corporations paying less corporate tax they have more money available for investments so that's not my massive water and I I I speak for myself not no not so don't agree on that\nThat's something I wanted my worry is um the um unfunded entitlements you know the fact that you're cutting taxes\nWhilst entitlements to gang up in up in up it's it's like a balance and therefore you know a a deficit and it's actually not massively difficult to to to to close that deficit it's quite possible to do it by a mixture of raising the retirement age raising taxes a combination of all of that you could\nYou could bring your own to get back into balance but just cutting taxes without with without addressing the that the size and they should have been tied in with policy making\nThe book talks about your your book with a Alan Greenspan talks a lot about the supposed or would you fear is the lack of dinosaurs and in the United states that we're no longer as the creative economy as we used to be\nKnown that nor the tool I mean one of the arguments you make in this book is because he\nGot to look at the loans to run the show to look at the long term in an entitlement long term talked on the bankruptcy also look at the long term and climate change but that talk about it because there was a big enough book with a lot of stuff in it but I Would bet they massively in favor\nOf um intervening in that area but to be using the price mechanism to price the extra knowledge of the costs of of of pollution and things like that but I think one of the reasons why businesses are becoming more and more reluctant to invest is getting more and more worried about it's a\nLoan to the lumped impulses of climate change so that will that money\nSo you think that you know in a word that in fact the government has a significant role to play in combating climate change\n... through through the price mechanism but yes absolutely\nOkay we have to leave it there we've been speaking with Adrian ... new book with Dr around ...

staffing ratios\n... said at the number of letters to the editor on this and anyone who has had the misfortune to watch some of the recent a playoff games on TV has seen any number of TV ads opposing question one the safe staffing ratio nurses to patients in hospitals\nWe have with us to discuss question one this morning in the studio Don stern\nWho is co chair of the Massachusetts niche nurses association bargaining unit at Bay State medical center in Franklin she's a mental health nurse and Suzanne love also co chairing the emergency department nurse and a union representative has well\nMedical center in Franklin she's a mental health nurse and Suzanne love also co chairing the emergency department nurse and the union representative has well they are volunteers in the effort to pass a patient with limits in Massachusetts I Would start with Don stern and we'll go to Suzanne love\nA lot of bad a publicity uh generated paid for publicity for the most part opposing question one\nYou support question one tell us why\nWell good morning everyone and thank you bills thank you Monti ah for having us here today [noise] I support question one because I just want to do my job the best I can as a nurse and right now and caring for too many patients at one time\nThis bill is about setting safe patient limits on how many patients we care for at one time\nRight now the only place where there are limits regulated limits by the law\nOr the intensive care units anywhere else there we have absolutely no say or control over how many patients we care for at one time\nAnd all the research clinical independent scientific research says we care for too many patience is dangerous it's just dangerous and it's unnecessary\n[noise] the one state which has a law similar to that which is proposing question one is California has been a lot of debate about whether this law has worked in California and or what the effect has been tell us about that\nThat's a great question so let's let's talk about California California said this law in place for over fourteen years\nI I think California's a great sample size um because it has over three hundred hospitals one out of seven people in the United states receives healthcare in California\nUh that's how big California's\nThe outcomes in California have been fantastic so for example Massachusetts has number forty eight out of fifty for wait times in the emergency room\nCalifornia is a times or forty seven percent faster since they put this law in place a their hospital based infections\nHave have gone down significantly high rates of re admission had gone down significantly rates of death medication areas these are all related to nurse staffing\nLet's go back from it question one says what about staffing what is the actual provisions return Suzanne of torture Britain's department nurse proponent of question one helpless\nQuestion what lessons have the right the right number of patients per nurse when these patients are in the hospital and what's the right number\nSo if you look at so people have asked this question many many times like well how did you come up with a number\nSo it's a combination of over Twenty years of research and looking at California's outcomes and also working with bedside nurses are across the state for years it's based on the unit that you're on so for example most people are familiar with medical surgical units so right now you can have\nA a let's say at Franklin on average those nurses are caring for I don't know six seven invasion down in Bay state Springfield they're caring for eight or more\nAll the research and the outcomes say that that nurse shouldn't have up to four patients at one time on a psych unit like mine it would be up to five ... in in the emergency room Suzanne it would be up to three patients three to four patients\nSo that's specifically related to the unit you are on it's very unit specific in addition the bill\nSo it's three in the ER for medical\nSurgical up to four because the the opposition would like to tell you that that's a rigid rigid number\nAnd what we're saying is it's up to four and the law also talks about using acuity tools\nSo right now I promise you as a nurse when I'm caring for too many patients at one time\nThere is no autonomy I don't have any freedom I'm just running around hoping I can do the very best that that I can\nThis law would allow me to use acuity tools my clinical judgment and say you know what right now my patients are so sick that I think I can safely take care of for versus five\nSo there is flexibility within those numbers but it's up to four on a medical surgical for\nThan thirty ... you know January one oh my God we're never going to meet it\nSo there's two points that I Want to make about that just because in a a law become goes into effect on a particular date or it doesn't\nActually mean it's in effect yeah like where's my Pasha exactly mine too [laughter] so and I I'm Sorry for your mind\nTo yes and I don't feel sorry for money but but ... he'll he'll get by somehow but I\nDo think it's important to note this because this has gotten lost an entire discussion\nWhich is the proposition ... has the same legal status as any other law passed by the legislature and the legislature can amend it and it can change it and so if there's a problem it's not written in stone this is not a constitutional amendments it's a law\nIt is and so let's talk about okay goes in January one\nI promise you this guy's not gonna fall um what has to happen next we'll have to go to the health policy commission all the regulations have to be figured out not only that but all the hospitals have to submit plans on implementation\nThe acuity tools have to be designed and worked out with the nurses and the administrators and all of that is going to take months and months and months and months just like you said okay\nSo this idea that I mean I Love your vision is ... to ... go bingo and you know\nThat there is going to be ... when this passes and as you can hear me say when this passes\nBecause it's the right thing to do when this passes there is going to be a period where we're going to have to fight to make sure that the revisions don't destroy the integrity of what the bedside nurses have written because this is really about your safety the other thing I Want to say to\nThe other argument that people are saying well there aren't enough nurses how are we ever going to need this so I I\n... I I I Love this interview or you have to answer my own questions\n[laughter] it's like I Am out\nOn Saturday at all it's not really a lot of fun though I like about I Would I Would love you I should\nSpeak about the both of those questions one is the claims or lack of nurses so this is impossible to build as well in any event and then let's get to the money because ... she uses a number of today have never hurts their stepping ratios would cost about a billion\nDollars in ... that once I was wrong on that\nLet's talk about the nurses first ... they don't talk about the money and then the most important thing though\nAbout this interview though is about patient safety and there is nobody better to talk about patient safety than Suzanne so but I'm going to I'm going to talk about the nurses I'm going to talk\nAbout my life because the first ... shortage of nurses in Massachusetts and if this law goes into effect medical centers hospitals are not going to be able to hire the nurses because they're not there what's the answer to that\nIn many parts of our country there is a nursing shortage there's two states that do not have a nursing shortage Massachusetts in North Dakota we graduate three thousand a hundred thousand three thousand five hundred nurses in this state a year just in the eye Ninety One court or\nFrom Springfield to Greenfield there's six schools with seven programs there's plenty of their schools with seven nursing broke nursing program at UMass has to nursing programs so there are\nPlenty of nurses in Massachusetts other parts of the country not the case\nSo there are enough nurses nurses have left the bedside at the hospital because it's just too stressful it's scary sometimes to have too many patients who are sick of trying to juggle who\nI have four things I should be doing right now they're all things I should be doing right now it's hard to decide which one I'm going to do sometimes what everybody needs something from me\nThis will allow that this will this bill will allow patients have the right level of care hospitals will be able to hire nurses there'll be able to bring nurses back to the bedside nurses went\nBack to the bad side when this law passed in California a hundred thousand return to the bad side in California's\nBedside nurses as opposed to some other ... yes federal vendors as\nYet side nurses and somebody that for one reason ... nurses have left the hospital is they moved to a lot of them to being part time positions people need full time work with benefits\nWas talking about yes I'm Sorry one\nOther thing I Want to cause cause Suzanne answer that question beautifully\nOr the other thing I Want to add to is Massachusetts has one of the largest group of nurses working part time or pre DM which is a you know in a casual basis who would love fulltime work\nBut the hospitals will not post those positions because they don't want to pay for the benefits they just do this is a a cost saving measure it's cheaper to have pre DM nurses in part time nurses so they don't have to pay for health benefits or anything else and this would actually make them [noise] have to post full time positions\nOkay which will go to sue the money now in Studio ... she claims quote nurse staffing ratios costs about one billion dollars annually this means higher taxes are health insurance premiums and operate horrible yeah what's your response to that\nSo I'm gonna I'm going to talk to you about the actual costs and then I'm In uh in Massachusetts and then I'm also going to talk to you about the outcomes in California so I'm not surprised that sue wrote that no ah that letter and not surprised\nThat it is it is also a codes on co authored by the uh a chair of the board of ...\nOkay so these are executives okay we are so they're aligned with hospitals executives and the corporate dollars so I think it's really important for the listeners to just make sure that we understand who wrote that letter\nOkay I'm In terms of money so we're not really sure where they keep coming up with this figure we've asked for their their numbers\nWe we can't get a straight answer for them so independent research was done out of Boston College and the independent research at Boston College says okay and again this is not something we paid for\nIndependent academically reviewed rigorous study said that this bill will not costs more than forty seven million dollars a year\nWhich means on average for every hospital that's three percent three percent of their budget\nWhich is a drop in the bucket so think about base tape for example they made Seventy million last year Seventy million dollars they pay their top executive over two million dollars a year so this is not about money or a lack of money there is plenty of money to pay for this\nSo this idea that somehow it's going to cost a billion dollars is ludicrous\nThe other the other I I'm guessing she got that number is we are definitely disappointed in the health policy commission we chose them to do the implementation help us do the implementation of this\nSome pointed in the health policy commission we chose them to do the implementation help us do the implementation of this law when it passes because we thought that they were independent watchdog it turns out that the health policy commission net behind closed doors with hospital executives\nThe hospital executives turned around gave him these ridiculous ridiculous numbers and then the health policy came out and said\nWe have the numbers on how much this is costing this is independent there was nothing independent about it when you don't bring both sides to the table to actually look at the numbers there is nothing independent about it\nSo that billion dollars is ludicrous it's ludicrous bill there is no fact there is no study it's all inflated numbers that were given by the hospital association it seems at each time we hear them talk about how much this little costs of the cost goes up I haven't\nI've noticed that I notice this out as a brilliant point and the other thing too\nBecause I've been debating uh can you imagine that bill\nThat Monti that ah I have been out there did you write in drawing opinions I have no feelings at all about it at my ah ah\nSo I've been out there debating and and and so the number keeps changing too because they are the other thing they're going to try to tell you\nOh my God if this passes all the hospitals are going to close and all of the community hospitals or\nWhere I mean that's the scariest it and probably the most emotionally wrenching argument if there's any chance that who is going to cause I'm opposed to it and they're making that point over and\nOver ... about that yeah let's just go right for it first of all there are very few freestanding hospitals left right and ... was part of a mess generally are all part of me that works now we're so let's talk about\n... Dickinson Cooley Dickinson as part of the partners okay do you know how much partners made last year they made over six hundred million dollars\nAnd their CEO earns for a million dollars for a million there there is no person no chance that clearly Dickinson is going to close or close any program no one hospital in California and not one hospital in California and the fourteen years\nHas close as a result of the staff in law\nNow in Massachusetts in the last ten years we have had hospitals hospitals closed but let me tell you why they have clothes or why programs have claws has nothing to do with staffing this is where this is the first time we're actually really talking about staffing in Massachusetts so north Adams let's talk about north Adams in\nA closed four years ago why do they close that's a that was a free standing community hospital\nBecause the hospital executives mis managed the funds\nThey have plenty of of Medicare Medicaid dollars coming in but those hospital
