don't know is he the MVP or is it ... it's hard to say but it was wonderful to see that but anyway as I was saying we saw him pitching in August and against the Houston Astros at Fenway Park\nAnd they

Christian Vasquez became the catcher of the team was as kinda funny but you know whatever\nWorkout nice and that that last scene of the last out\nWhere they brought in Christian sale a to a basically closed is a series out and then he runs into his arms crossed hills about six foot five and a\nA Christian Vasquez is a much shorter person and ran into his arms is like a Yogi Berra running into Don Larsen is arms when Don Larsen pitch the perfect game in the world series is kind of a cool thing so uh and and again you know the pitcher has to be six five and the catcher has to be five eight in
