browser it's completely safe and the reason I use it is you brought up\nAnd you bring up a lot reviews on Amazon yes of course you've got the fake will view is you've got the user name and by competitors vitamin ... wherever they\nHave people right they could use this is a great algorithmic software it's free you got a steak spot dot com is you'll look now and I have it in my browser so if I'm getting something anything I always check in the Ninety nine\nThe stakes spot dot com is you'll look now and I have it in my browser so if I'm getting something anything I always check in the Ninety nine percent of the time it can do an algorithm\n... things that come up for you that say hey that view is a ... what it looks\nNow I see it says offers in app purchases it's is it free or does it cost money the right sorry I\nI never have state for it and I have it up a on my browser and it's a little it's a little a little\nIcon and then you once you're in Amazon ... the thing you do is you go to Amazon you want to buy something you click on reviews and now you're looking at people's we're using Amazon you're like oh my God this Thursday raved about well you get you go to that thing you know you start the\nWorst movie it was first in line I'll do that or the latest news story up let if their art or even if they're just hundreds of years or just a few\nYou hit the safe spot icon and it just says hold on I'm going to do it out a little bit in the study of those reviews any second this by the way it works the on the uh Amazon it works for a I think a bunch of others you you're probably reading it right now\nI Am I Am trying it on Amazon as we speak I stole the chrome extension 'cause that's the easiest way for me to use it yeah and uh [noise] and so is it going to some I'm running it so says thank you for using faced by you can analyze this page so I'm running it on the reviews for these Wolverine\nPerfect uh a super a scanner because somebody was curious about this and it's still gives it a very good grade this is good you can trust reviews of this product that's good and then ...\nIt'll say what what tells it to give it that great yeah okay it it does a young thing where it tells you owe it uses the word killing was used over and over again and all that said do Ralph but the\nRace is our analysis to take it over Ninety percent high quality that's this is fascinating the way that they're uh they're doing it uh yeah yeah cool yeah I really I really like this yeah faked spot dot\nCom or it probably be most useful not so much of an Amazon which is I think cracks down quite a bit on bad reviews on Yelp which is kind of always\nThere yeah yeah yeah oh yeah hey thank you for the tip that's a great one thank you yeah yeah he's on Amazon all the time that you to take care show thanks Alex ... yep Bye bye now here's the only thing I Would say\nWhy is it free [laughter]\nWhy is it for maybe somebody maybe the person who wrote\nThis is a a humanitarian is an al ... is a it just\nSays you know the world needs is I'm going to do it they put a lot of effort into it and they've got a nice website they do a lot of analysis somebody's you know there's paying for a considerable amount of a cloud computing time\nNot just for the website but to do the analysis 'cause that's all done a server in the cloud and so then I rub my chin and I stroke my chin I say and this is by the way I Want you all to do this and you are most in Portland where you teach kids to do this because kids are naturally trusting\nRight they they you know they they don't realize that\nThere are bad people out there greedy people but but it's a good question to ask when something's free will how especially because and maybe this is one of the most important things to understand that this\nStuff costs money that nobody has a website like this in a service like this and they're not paying a lot of money hundreds of dollars a day maybe more [noise]\nSo is it just somebody with deep pockets of says yeah you know what this is such an important this could be it could be I don't want to sound cynical but it was just such an important thing to do that I'm going to give this away\nOr is there something they're getting out of it and my guess is that when you installed this extension\nAnd you run it on stuff it's probably looking at every page you go to and that has some ah that has some value so the first thing is before you saw one of these things you should do is read the read the privacy policy now\nIt is possible that the privacy policy is not accurate but thank goodness there's the in in Europe and I have mixed feelings about it but there's a general data protection regulation and or in Europe GDP are\nAnd uh and and there are a in the United states similar a legal protections like the Federal Trade commission that do\nPenalize lies in privacy statements however they gotta catch you but I think usually you can see so let's just see here\nWhat what they do when you use or service we automatically collect the following information about you your device information which includes but it's not limited to information about your Web

services they'll do that because then the information they collect can be aggregated against that personality and sometimes if if services work together they can maybe even figure out who you are so that there's that\nIndividual Web pages are products that you view they collect that website says search terms referred to you to the service and information about how you interact with the service well they have to do that right otherwise they can analyze refused but\nThey don't say limited to websites you're buying things at so they are collecting information now who are they ... how do they use this\nWell\nDo they for instance share your personal information oh we share your personal information with third parties to help us use your personal information as described above\nA I don't know\nFinally we've also make sure your personal information to comply with the laws that's all normal we are as described above we use your personal information to provide you with targeted

you go to every product you look at is recorded and then they can use that to targeted ads or marketing communications\nThat makes sense that makes sense you\nCan opt out of targeted advertising that's good I'm pleased that we do not know this is important alter our service data collection and practices when we see a do not track signal from your browser they're saying we do not honor do not
