... director the UMass Amherst labor center\nAnd perhaps in answering that you could tell us a bit about what the labor center does for those ... UMass Amherst labor center and don't know what that is exactly so it's really a two part question would tell us I'd like to really get to the substance of my question but also like to know why\nIn every listeners know why you two are the experts on this topic that are closer with you and then we're going to go to ...\nYou know I Would say on the on the your piece right that\nYes the minute I think the decline of Sears speaks to a moment and uh American and also global economic history in which basically corporate America has abandon\nThe idea of a stakeholder economy uh when\nUh CEOs and uh and workers a share 'em in the prosperity or that they are collectively produce right and as the of that article on the front page and the New York times or just you know the new retail giant Amazon\nIs you know much was given to um helping workers out\nSo I think that you're not overstating it build the only thing that I Would add is that you know Sears didn't do that you know because they were super generous they did that because they they were a company that emerged at a time when workers had a ton of collective power\nRight and so workers through the labor movement pressured employers likes ears right\nInto a into bargaining a living wage I'm\nA good benefits and pension um and that created I think an organizational culture at places like seers right where you know there was an understanding that we're not we're going to not take all of this for ourselves but we're going to give some of it I'm a to a to the workers at as well\nCreamy Caesar dressing that has smoked salmon few capers grilled ... it also has ... to ... which are toasty hot hot political taunts lightly Smokey salmon along with the coup she's addressing that it's just been fired\nPollen Elizabeth Caesar is one of seven sour on the menu all big and down to for teaching me on its own right\nBig bountiful salads kind of a tradition of tone the dressing for me to write a poem the lives of the kitchen and a salad from pollen Elizabeth travels well perfect meal to go just call ahead\nCaesar salad can be regal when\nI went to was quietly offers an intriguing twist some timeless classic Caesar salad which smoked salmon and toasty hot electric route taunts I\nWant to make a difference in a big way nearly two hundred children in Hampshire county or on a waiting list to be matched with adult mentors called big children who are matched with mentors their big brothers big sisters Hampshire county do better in school and report higher self confidence and have better relationships in years [noise] start something\nCalled for one three to five\nNine three three or five and volunteer or donate the big brothers big sisters and I'm sure county\nI happen to have been any you know and they end up not a handout habitats mission provide homeownership opportunities are low income families is unique requires partner families were alongside the money ... ... to help them\nReach habitat partner family five hundred and fifty hours what for physical labor towards the structure of our own home other habitats family structure [noise]\nDo you believe that older to shoulder joint results not only better\nOut but this year we're area make\nIf you believe every once you have a decent place to live homeownership ... nobody to family and then everyone deserves the opportunity for a better future we could use you\nTo leave your home and community and both Franklin in Hampshire county to learn more today these visitor that she'd be habits\nThis film in state tuition we continue our conversation was Cedric day we own and Julie closure they are\nRespectively the director of the new director of the human is labor center and Julie is the academics program manager for the U.S labor center\nI Would appreciate it if you could tell our listeners what are the biggest fights regarding employees labor and the community in your view that are now going on the UMass Amherst\nUm yeah I think that um with Cedric coming on board and and being the first um leader of color to be or is it the first person of color to be leading the labor center\nI'm and I'm coming from a background um I went to University of Michigan also um and met there on a someone who became a mentor of mine graciously bugs\nWho was fighting for labor rights I'm back in the forties and fifties and then kind of transitioned into fighting for um racial justice and in particular in Detroit the black power movement and so I Lived with her and two thousand eight and\nI'm definitely carry that into I'm looking at how economic justice is just one aspect of the fights that ... that labor center wants to be looking at we also are thinking a lot about gender equity and racial justice and for instance on campus and we've had a couple\nUm racist incidences occur recently that has been in the news um and\nWe're looking to um partner with folks on campus like the afro am department the w._b. the boys African American\nStudies department and uh the W. E. D. to boys center which is part of the library\nAs well as um the mass which does multi cultural education programming on campus and they've been since twenty twelve\nGetting together a coalition of students I'm faculty and staff that are responding to institutional racism that very much exist on that campus and saying how can we\nRaise awareness about um the fights that\nFolks of color experience every day or you know that um the flights and and the difficulties they they shut down a whole building for um\nFor thirty minutes because of the racial profiling incident on campus and though raising awareness about that but also saying what do we do to change that climate and to change that culture of white supremacy that really still does exist what\nIs the connection in a ... so ... so to do on the new director of the human is adversely resent are viewed\nConnect the dots for so that you are labor organizers you are focused on the rights of employees and workers and people who are\nUh exploited disenfranchised in various ways the relationship between that kind of collective effort is for workers and racism on campus I don't think that's necessarily a self evident a connection so could you help us understand that\nSure um you know one thing that we try to\nEvident a connection so could you help us understand\nThat yeah sure um you know one thing that we try to teach at the labor center is that the struggle for worker rights is inseparable from the struggle for the rights of women and if people of color and other marginalized\nUm folks um so let's just take for example the you know the incident at at Whitmore which is the administration building at UMass Amherst\nHere was a a union member a worker of color who walked into his own workplace okay and campus security shut the place down and interrogated this person\nOkay that\n... in my view and I think in most people's views is a hostile work environment how's that person supposed to be productive how's that person supposed to trust the folks that are that he or she works with a in order to get the job done that they were hired to do\nThat as a very clear example in my view right that ... that the rights of workers and the civil rights of that person as a person of color are connected right you can't separate those two if we think for example also about sexual harassment right\nThat ... just in the nature of disclosures since I Am the judge the western Massachusetts officer the American civil liberties union and it is a public records that we have made a public records requests of the universities ten times saying making it public records demand for all the information around that incident no please\nNo it's great and and so and if we think also about um you know the the um the issue the issues that that women face on a daily basis in the workplace of being the target of sexual harassment continually right\nI mean how are women supposed to work under those conditions that too right it's a hostile work environment that is not only a worker rights issue it's also a women's rights issue and so what we try to do at the labor center is advance a vision of union solidarity that includes not just\nYou know kind of bread and butter you know worker rights issues right but also folds in the fact\nThat you know there are workplace issues that have to deal with gender and race and the fact of the matter is you know we were talking earlier about the transition from industrial workforce to a surface workforce the workforce in the United\nStates today right in more feminine eyes and more diverse than it is ever been and if the labor movement is going to rise from the ashes it's going to have to understand\nThat we have to see racial class and gender inequality as linked that has to be the core of our struggle and so what we do with the labor centers we try to educate our students on the on how those struggles are linked\nThe one thing that I Hope Harris Freeman will do for us uh in the coming semesters is teach a class a we've been discussing on employment rights that links you know workplace issues to questions of civil rights and employment discrimination right that's the kind of stuff that we do at the labor sent if only Harris Freeman we're here to be able to\nDo that [laughter] okay Harris room ingested walking Harris the microphone is yours will even give you the last word on a segment higher aggressor Harris Harris ring they'll they'll thank thank you for having\nThis kind of show it it's really great to have a conversation with my colleagues and others about uh the intersection of of justice for working people and injustice for women and and diverse minorities are in the United states it it it is the future of the labor movement and um\nAnd when you say the future of the ... or ... ... ... including a into these other than unions or is this strictly a union a base struggle in your view\nWell I think that that that the labor movement a it is an organization that seeks to speak for not only those that are currently organized but those that need organization and need reform in laws to protect them even if they're not in a union we want to stand for all those people\nAre so for example one one local thing that the labor center is involved in as a a friend of the court who filed a brief with the Supreme judicial court about a current struggle here in the valley\nAnd if we can swath of America does the United states government is completely out of touch and unable to be of assistance to the people of Puerto Rico and I'm Wondering whether that is correct analysis in your judgment\nThat that's just the picture is that says I'm a lot about what was happening uh I mean we have been lost I'm\nInto discussions in the United states and the executive a branch of the United states have have not only on the Trump presidency but um before that have not had put the league was a ... the agenda I I think the\nThe whole issue of Trump selling paper thousands of people are people um was one more insult on top of many others\nUm you can also point out to all of the different tweets famous streets of I'm President Trump against ... and I'm diminishing the effects of Hurricane Maria but also talking about\nUm how ... was also a in his view the ... the main cos I mean it was a political ... does he go it was ...\nThe ... to be blamed for the effects of the human taking 'em and and that is it's not just ignorant but it's also a discriminatory statement um I mean put the recall has been a territory a colony of the United states for more than a century now\nUm we don't have a democratic elected government\nOr the seasons are imposed on us by the U.S Congress\nAnd the most recent one was in position of a fiscal control board that make decisions are on our behalf\nAnd this is go control where we should point out was initiated under President Obama right I Would like you to go back to President Trump for a minute at least and answer this question for me if you would is President Trump viewed in Puerto Rico and I understand ... ... and your journal question here or me a few\nThan specific more specifically do view or President Trump to as fundamentally racist [noise]\nThe short question if the short answer is yes of course but um there's a ... um answer to that and that is that what do the ... the um [noise] a has been the target of what we call\nStructure discrimination so they're going to ... discrimination I'm so there's\nSeveral aspects of a discriminatory levels and the treatment of the USDA ... I'm beginning with a colonial subjugation type of relationship that we have\nBut also on the um the older everyday aspects of making decisions on behalf of Puerto Ricans\nSo um this precedent I'll say it's more expressive a he has he's he he's not hiding\nHis discriminatory um attitude toward ... and that's not to say that I'm governments before Trump way not discriminatory against ... um the the fact that he is so open about it is just a\nVery insult is um and just to a\nWrong or we're speaking with attorney and the more ... or a bona she's the director of the Institute for human rights and a professor of clinical war and human rights within or American University in Puerto Rico she was here in the valley giving a talk to the western women University's School of war\nYou refer to Puerto Rico as a colony of the United states has been for the past century\nI Know this was a big question but I Would appreciate your perspective\nYou think that's the solution to the boats a political and economic problems and engines face in Puerto Rico is independence or statehood or a continuation of its presence status what would make life Puerto Ricans better on the island\nYeah I'm I'm not too uh another one to make a decision will be ... right I I Do have my own views and on that question but I Would say is is um ... have never had the ... the right\nThere right to self determination um respected\nAnd that is something that is that the basis of of of um\nOf resolving the situation I'm right now there hasn't been a lot of discussion I and after your ducking Medea as well on the status of ... second um class citizens are and and I have to say I\nI I don't agree with that because I Believe we are not necessarily a citizens of the United states so much as ... um subjects\nAre absolutely right before I'm a day is paying you know a power so what do we have here if you talk about second class citizens we second class citizens in the U.S in the u._s. country in the states\nSo I'm a person can have a citizenship that was imposed on us it's it's different and and the discussion it to me is um alarming that I'm\nDiscussing the right to ... to be treated fairly to receive that the the protection that we need\nUm it's not necessarily because we are us citizens is because it is a real human rights and because the United states have responsibility a fiscal responsibility\nOver trade tore that he has decided to um to have and um so that's at the core of this situation\nWe've just about a minute left but I Would like to ask you for your perspective on what should happen now with regard to a recovery efforts or continued recovery effort or new recovery efforts to help Puerto Rico recover from the natural and unnatural disaster that has followed Hurricane Maria\nThere many things that need to happen\nI'm the first thing I'll say is that um you know but I'm sending money over will not resolve the the question or the situation\nI'm Puerto Rico has many structural problems I think the relationship with the United states needs to ah get straight um and we need to resolve that relationship um as soon as possible and Puerto Rican needs to have\nRespect or their democratic ah um [noise] I'm rights I'm as well as the economic and social rights\nI'm even if we do say that um that say that a FEMA a starts to do a great job I don't think that it will make many different I'm In a situation right now\nStart to do a great job I don't think that will make many friends I'm In a situation right now I'm the first thing that the second thing that should happen is for the United states to assume I'm putting his public that we have Seventy two over Seventy to the Indian and public debt\nAnd that didn't happen overnight it happened because again of the mutations and I kind of me and posed by the U.S Congress and the United states so there is a fiscal and international responsibility that the United states has over ... and they need to ascending\n[noise] we've been speaking with attorney and that much you know for a bona she's the director of the Caribbean Institute for human rights clinical professor of law and human rights at the inter American University in Puerto
