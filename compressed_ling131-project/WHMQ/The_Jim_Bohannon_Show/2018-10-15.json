gym do have a show from Westwood One radio where one eight six six five oh jumbo one eight six six five oh five or six to six on line by this a jumbo had a show dot com you can follow me on Twitter\nAt Jim Botox\nI was a at a doctor's office today and was stomach through the latest edition of Sports Illustrated and are in their inbox section that is to say the letters to the editor if you will or these days emails or whatever I noticed this this very brief little letter\nWas titled perfect storm and I'll quote here shameful and appalling is the only way I can describe this what the reader find shameful and appalling\nHere's the entire letter Chamberlain appalling is the only way I can describe your coverage of the W NBA championship that's the women's National Basketball association [noise] Seattle sweep of Washington was amazing and all you could a lot was one page with a few photos you should\nBe ashamed or such outrage over a game\nOr the writer of that is so proud I mentioned her name Lisa Lorenz the of the low birth Pennsylvania\nWell Lisa I can answer that question for you I don't know if the sports illustrated people ever got around to reply to you I can tell you a very simply why their coverage was one page and a few photos and that's because nobody watches the WMBA [noise]\nBecause it has very low attendance at any time it's on TV which is sporadically of the ratings are terrible the WNBA exists only because the NBA the cast male league has chosen to subsidize it\nAny women's independent basketball league has gone under\nAnd when I find particularly interesting though is is the language that was used sham vote and appalling you should be ashamed that\nNow I'm not that concerned about coverage of women's basketball I Am concerned about people out there who seem incapable of anything that is reasonable perspective about things with which they disagree shameful and appalling\nIf you become outraged about everything\nWhen can you actually show outrage you've taken away your main weapon if you save outrage for genuinely outrageous ... people notice you but as your outraged all the time nobody knows is oh\nJohn or Jane are outraged again we don't even pay attention after a while John in Seattle calls and believe me John welcome\nHey Jim yes yeah my take on this or is it I think it's tragic that a young lady that's Eighteen year old today that goes to four years of college\nOr their it's higher institution of public or private\nThere's this constant drumbeat on campus that all men are evil that you always have to be looked at over your shoulder\nAnd how does that prepare young lady to go out in the world and have good social skills to make a living raise a family I mean it's it's almost like it's the Victorian area you know it's like there's this real narrowly defined\nIdea that this is how men and women are and that this is how\nYou have to relate to the opposite sex I mean it's just so narrowly defined it's just like a throwback to Victorian\nIn many ways it is which is which is ironic because of course many of these people are rather a rather liberal gene in in their views about are things that are upset the Victorians but in terms of of being easily ...\nOffended some of these people come forth like they are one giant Ron nerve ending it and I I can I I think I could walk and some of these people I could say a good morning and they would say why don't you mean by that [laughter] I think\nI Know it's a it's supposedly a a liberal approach but it it's more like a really\nReally a really tough conservative Victorian I mean it's so narrowly defined about how men and women are supposed to be eight to one another so anyway that was my thought on it you have a good night\nShow

what I wanted to say one don't get me some of the easier in watery but they can't put that on on man and see that a lot of men that allow and ... just because they were ... they're not gonna take it out on our men\nMen want to read to\nMe it does happen it it does happen that you're very correct it does happen\nYeah man you know going around take is often anybody they they are eight than they are accused of rape so they're not really in the ... and some of the ... some of these women\nWell in some cases I I Will I I don't know that I can get down to a comparison let's say of ah of rape versus an accusation of rape or an accusation of rape unfounded would be a terrible thing or being raped I I I have no idea what that would be like and I'm very glad that I I bring Noah\nNoah ... ah empathy if you will to the subject is not something we most of us want to be familiar with but I certainly see your point lives and and I mean like Anthony\nDown on that and not mind because some of these women were read and I sympathize with them and my I mean it's wrong I like it's being awkward for them but they have no right taken out on on ...\n[noise] well it certainly is not a ... a correct thing to do I would absolutely concur that uh again there's just no legitimate basis for doing that I mean it would be the same thing as if we were just say are based on the Duke lacrosse case all women are liars really based on one case\nWill of course everybody would put down that notion of what are you saying oh women are liars\nAgreed that's ludicrous\nBut how is that different from looking at one incident\nIn which a there are charges against men and assuming all men are pigs I'm Sorry that doesn't hold up either every case is different every case is different and has to be judged on its own circumstances that I think is the message that we should be getting across your along with the notion\nOf tried to put your outrage or indignation and some perspective a Stephen ...

I've tried ... travel and most of the major freeways in America Ninety five north south on the east coast my ... my experience has been you need to map out your your your route\nWith with on an on the major freeways but then if you run into a situation where like in a south to North Carolina where the Florence are gender flooding a closed that down then you need them\nYou ... you need to make sure that when you're when you're going now they'll go on the major freeways first and then wait for the Detroit then that's when you should you shouldn't start on the side roads because it because ... there's a major hurricane like Michael's coming through it's coming up to Alabama\nYou just need to get get on the major freeways and get as far as you can as fast as you can stay on the clear major uh interstate and then and then then if it happens when you have to take a detour then go that gun then go to the side routes that's all I'm saying\nAll right well let's see what I think over because to say about that certainly sounds reasonable to me and then he\nIs absolutely correct but importantly you must know what the side roads are so this way in case you have to work those roads you should at least be familiar with and so when you're traveling on leisure early um track\nTo some of these escape areas that you may find yourself having to evacuate sue\nSo this way so if your if your area is let's say area that everyone knows you're going to be there now and the other people are going to meet up with you\nAnd you should know at least several of the major roads to get to that location just in case you have to take one of those roads but when you're doing it on a leisurely timeline\nIt's not a problem you don't have to be concerned about it but if you let's say before let's say you're on a major artery and you're told that a veto it has to take place you can easily tax the email from your phone that hey\nI'm taking this deep and we're going to go to through this direction to that location so this way\nFamily members who you rely on those\nEven as the people on the other side cannot get that sick no meaning the tax bill the email message wants that to our turns on and the people on the other side get that connection your text or email all show up once their their cell phone reaches that tower\nNo as a as a ... and ... thank you Alan for your call them ... and your thoughts here or how does the GPS here ah affect all of this\nI'd makes everything so wonderful that we know where each of those are like you can set and activate your GPS for\nYour family members so this way you can see where you know your family members are by checking where they are on the GPS system so that in times of weather related problems such as Michael\nYou know the storm skipped throwing down you know can take our technology\nAnd if the towers are the people that you're sending a signal to went down on the\nDance single you won't get that you know the people on the other side won't get the message but if they had another tower that active they will instilling receive those messages so as long as you're sending a signal you can let people know which way you're going how you're going that way and on the other side\nIt's important to understand that they will receive their wants a power\nIs connected to that cell phone they will receive the message and now they know what happens here\nAnd I would just throw in a quick little plug for radio and the good old ubiquitous over the radio always there and distribute such moments we go to Patrick in Rochester, Minnesota joined us tonight on the bull headed show with our guest disaster preparedness expert Anthony ... good evening Patrick\nA good evening Jim all of this uh this coverage is very fascinating with the hurricanes and so forth [noise]\nUm [noise] and uh otherwise and being a good script for a movie\nUm why not just bomb or a hurricane several hundred miles out into the Pacific a can be a new killer it would rain radioactive [laughter]\nA waste of a\nMaybe a hydrogen number\nWell that's a nuclear bomb too because you didn't know because it involves a a a\nTrigger that consists of either uranium plutonium but beyond that if it is let's assume for the moment that we didn't care about the radiation we just wanted to really knock a hurricane out of kilter\nA I Am not sure about this but I Would say that if we were to drop our entire nuclear arsenal into hurricanes I\nIt might have an impact but these things are so much bigger than a single nuclear weapon that aside from all of the other uh him practicalities of such an idea they're just too big and very\nWell you know let's put it this way let's say the United states was to let's say or just you know in the state of Florida the state decides hey we're gonna take this action and do something with the storm\nAnd the storm goes towards Alabama what Texas\nNow ... is the state of Florida are liable for the I ... in this storm and damaging to states the other states or let's say another country let's say the United states there was a big storm coming towards us\nAnd then we diverted to Mexico and they go straight through Mexico City and cause a hundred billion dollars worth of damage Ali liable for that so that's another area of issues that arise if we went to try to control the weather because the weather's going to go some place\nAnd the people that it hit they've got to kind of be upset\nKnow and I would note one instance in which this\nA bowl or even there was proof that in fact the action lead to one followed but this was this is probably half a century ago or so somebody got the idea of cloud seeding or part of the eye of a hurricane this was I think the hurricane was off Jacksonville, Florida\nAnd so they did it and the hurricane promptly took a sharp left earning headed inland\nAnd the ... I don't think anybody was ever able to tell if in fact the the cloud seeding caused this but I don't believe that ever again that was tried so ah the the fact is that that we just don't know enough about these things in the end of the Anthony notes quite correctly [noise] uh\nUh one of the just simply change of course it damages somebody else in the ... who is liable and are you [laughter] it could be a painful lesson in the liability laws if in fact we ever did learn to do this we we'd better learn to do it with exact precision will take some more callers will be an athlete covert\nAnd this book is emergency prepping simple disaster preparedness for the Modern Family as website the urgency prepping dot Oregon where one eight six six five oh jumbo back in a moment\n[noise]\nSame if you're not as hot guy from all around the night on my chance of showers pass you find in the morning after my\nMostly cloudy and fifty eight\nAn old like water to that\nOr or uh um we're ... we're not even work because you wouldn't be able to drive anywhere anyway\nAnd that's not that's not necessarily true at all you may or may not you just simply have no way of knowing if you're talking about\nA a an earthquake that it's a you know twenty on the Richter scale of the every structure and road is flat and well I guess you're screwed but I mean I don't think that's a that's too likely and they go kid is always a handy thing to have even under the most dire circumstances\nOr your your advice for a gym that you would please Anthony\nAbsolutely I mean and don't kid is just that so let's say\nYou are you have to abandon your vehicle and you have your whole trunk full adult kids love you had your backpacking you carry ... central stuff a few days the food and medicine\nThat other things that you can now walk and hide it to the next town or wherever it is that you have safe lodging or maybe even just they just sent nearby and just\nYou know wait it out and so you know forty and start putting together what's happening now\nThink about it when the last ... in that case of farming laws of the states now are starting to take seriously you know emergency management of these type of situation like in the state of Florida because we've had so many hurricanes back the back\nThey taking it seriously the money and management of each county each district each region the state itself\nI mean we moved I think it was seven million people during the hurricane the ones that hit um\nI was it are my camera member from so many names now but think about how many people were relocated not only in the state of Florida but to Alabama Georgia\nIt was just and then ... you know we location of the masses and from what I remember no one was\nKilled during this whole process\nNor I one eight six six five oh jumbo one eight six six five oh five four six to six and as we go to the break an important lesson to keep in mind\nDo the best you can uh again the idea of throwing up your hands on the air and say well no more to go ... or any other preparation we're all going to die is a a counter productive way to think at least make the effort you never know it could save your life will be back in the moment\nTechnology truth to money like going through you have fourteen Logan passwords and do ... from member any of them are one or two does is such a game's awesome one two three\nTruth be so easy to switch and save on car insurance I Geico dot com is super cool ... percent underscore exclamation point exclamation points Nineteen eighty five ...

for taking my call sure I'm I'm I just wanted to say like my brother\nAnd I we you know people say oh it's not going to happen to me um my dad\nHad a stroke a couple of months ago and he was evacuated hours from the Morehead City area\nAnd the\nRehab center where he is two blocks from my house in downtown law has city his five hours away from me it was destroyed pretty much\nFlooded um we had a lot of wind here\nA lot of wind um but what I wanted to say real quick Mr Bo head and was a lot of people have that idea oh it's not going to happen to me but it almost did happen to us\nAnd we were very fortunate and we are we were prepared we prepared five days before this hit and we're very thankful for being spared were very much prayer full for the people that were um\nYou know a inundated with water\nWe got hit by a lot of wind here not necessarily flooding in Morehead City area of course in the inland areas where they have rivers\nWe were on the answer coastal people don't understand where on the entire coastal where the water has a place to go so we were very fortunate um the water rises and\nAnyway we we prepared we didn't have that idea like it's not going to happen I could have happened to us\nUm thank you so much Mr Bo hadn't\nI'm I'm just very thankful and I just wanted to let their prayers and like you said\nYou've got to make the effort like you said you got to make the effort like I'm I'm thinking back right to take a trainer ... the jury and I like those people had to leave we had so much warning Mr Bo hadn't\nRight well I mean that's the thing and I think it's a very important thing and I appreciate your thoughts\nAnd certainly a sympathy of empathy goes up to you would be an all of those who suffered to you and your family have a Anthony Kobe or the the call to evacuate the area we always hear about of course the people who decided where we're going to ride this went out your adult and a half of\nIt happens all the time people do ride it out but more importantly as long as the majority of the people are out of the dangers all yes\nThere's always gonna be the Straggler that want to stay they think that whatever they don't want to go to where they're going to ride it out and it is what it is you know at least\nThe authorities have a very ... a lot of people in that area but even now you know this was in the past where you can ride it out when the authorities did they\nFind that this is an area that needs to be evacuated they literally though everyone out you can't ride it out and these days especially if you're on the coastline and specially areas that are fall\nSo high water levels et cetera there is no writing it out you love to get out\nAnd we get to do all kinds of great stuff\nBut I wouldn't get to do otherwise to three

for an\nIdol I I was I was actually enlisted also but anyway what do you have for what do you have for our for I guess\nAbout goals but it's always been for me I'm a Seventy\nYear old and uh I uh\nIt's always been holders value for me uh it's it's really a state that same market terrier ate it in the last year and I was wanting to know if\nIt if he feels it's still a place to hold value\nI think of it as an insurance policy okay it's it's against disaster but that's been going down because when interest rates go up gold goes down as do many other commodities and interest rates have been going up and looks like they're going to go higher and that's been hurting go go gotten over Thirteen hundred dollars announced\nNow it's roughly twelve hundred dollars now it's even lower than that so I I don't think it's going anywhere anytime soon I mean we've had all kinds of disasters of the world and do this not throwing up it's just not what it used to be if anything bitcoins become a new\nKind of safety valve and even that hasn't been working that way as well so have a little bit of an insurance policy but I don't see go going up dramatically anytime soon\nWhat about other a precious metals platinum or silver\nUm all the same Silver's ... gone down dramatically a platinum as kind of a of a place I play on a kind of like converters I guess I'm so car sales have been getting weaker wait wait so none of the person smiles have really been doing much they all get hurt by rising interest rates Jim\nOkay very good thanks for your call Steve appreciate that very much and I might add thanks for your service as well now a\nThis is one of the little economic lessons I learned I guess a classic example of a little bit of knowledge is a dangerous thing but that is that in uncertain times that gold another ... precious metals will go up a but I gather there are exceptions to that\nYeah well I mean these are uncertain times although I'm some ways they're good times I mean the economy is doing these we got all kinds of potential problems with China and so on\nBut I mean this is not a time like two thousand eight when you know look like the whole world is going to be falling apart [laughter] so ah no goal just isn't doing well it it really is a direct correlation with\nA interest rates and I mean the federal service raised rates are loud and long term interest rates have gone up dramatically and the ten year treasury is now over three point two percent\nIt started about two point one percent so it's not a big move up pretty short sharply and I think it's going to go maybe the three and a half percent by the end of the year that was all bad for gold silver plot them and let him\nBut ... do you see an interest rates going much beyond that\nYes I Do I think we're in the beginning of a major long term bond bear market\nWe've ... basically had a thirty five year bond bull market where bond interest rates peaked at about fourteen percent of Nineteen eighty two\nAnd they went down the absolute though was about one and three quarters in the middle of two thousand Seventeen and since then it's gone up to three point to\nAnd I think it's going higher let me just to have a brief explaining why interest rates are going up beyond what the Federal Reserve's doing right on the demand side there's less demand for treasuries because the two big buyers China and the Federal Reserve\nOr out of the market right now China actually has been the seller of treasury bonds not an empire\nFor political reasons another way they can get back at us over the trade war\nAnd the Federal Reserve remember they were buying all these bonds sixty billion a month the so called quantitative easing program that's over that's been over for about a year and a half now and now they're doing qualitative tightening so when bombs come do they're not buying new ones not renewing them letting them mature\nSo true of the big buyers of bombs are out of the marketplace and meanwhile huge new supply Jim and we've talked about this before but the evidence that we have are being financed with that\nIn the third quarter that just recently completed third quarter we added four hundred billion dollars need that just that corner around today there are options of the thirty about the ten year bond they did not do well I because we're having a huge supply because we're having trillion dollar deficit so more supply less demand\nYields and we'll go up and prices go down\nAnd there you go the old supply and demand thing All right we're going to come back and talk some more we will certainly return to the issue of China\nAnd a terrorist and the like about that when we come back after this break going to take a a very close look at that gift that keeps on giving\nThe student loan indebtedness one eight six six five oh Jim ... is our number one eight six six five oh five or six to six Americas money answers mad as our guest Jordan Goodman again money

that's fine but but but you shouldn't be paying out this kind of enormous money to finance a hobby and as I've also noted before that's why we have so many bowling leagues in this country people like to bowl\nAnd there are just simply an awful lot more people who like to bowl the people who can make a living and the professional bowling to her back and so I mean it just always it amazes me at all these people who want to find myself or I Want to do this or that well why don't you do that in your spare time and in the meantime get a job\nYeah well I mean luckily we have a good employment situation right now and and there's a tremendous shortage of workers\nExcept the people coming out of college in many cases are not qualified or willing frankly to do the jobs that are available there's something called the jokes report which is the job openings long term survey and the latest number was six point nine million jobs are unfilled employers cannot find the people\nTo do tool and dye making or plumbing or electricity or climbing electric utility poles there may be the people coming out of college don't either have the skills or the interest in doing the jobs that are actually available in the real world\nWe ... which raises another point is too easy to sit on your body in this society there ought to be economic pressures on people\nLike if you have a law student loans you are under economic pressure to do something and a lot of people take jobs in the white but I've got a service those you know that's over fifty percent of the people graduating today go back and live at home because they can't services student loan debt and have an apartment in the car and kind of get on with their lives I mean it's it's pretty pathetic\nI mean if you wind up doing doing a job
