O. V. I. C. K. O. V. I. C. word one eight six six five oh Jim bow and the Allen calls in from Dallas this evening and listen to the cliff five Seventy good evening welcome Alan\n... going to be on the show thank you and what's on your mind July that one\nOh here he was ... spending that my experience has been I'm sixty one years old I've ... I've tried truck travel and most of the major freeways in America Ninety five north south on the east coast my ... my experience has been you need to map out your your your route\nWith with on and on the major freeways but then if you run into a situation where like in a south and North Carolina where the Florence are gender flooding a closed that down then you need them\nYou need to make sure that when you're when you're going now go go on the major freeways first and they wait for the Detroit then that's when you should you shouldn't start on the side roads because it'd be judgment there is a major hurricane like Michael's coming through it's coming up to Alabama\nYou just need to get get on the major freeways and get as far as you can as fast as you can stay on the clear major uh interstate and then and then then if it happens when you have to take a detour then go that gun then go to the side routes that's all I'm saying\nAll right well let's let's see one ethnic over because to say about that certainly sounds reasonable to me than he\nIs absolutely correct but importantly you must know what the side roads are so this way in case you have to work those roads you should at least be familiar with and so when you're traveling on leisure early um track\nTo some of these escape areas that you may find yourself having to evacuate sue\nSo this way so if your if your area is let's say area that everyone knows you're going to be there and I and other people are going to meet up with you\nAnd you should know at least several of the major roads to get to that location just in case you have to take one of those roads so when you're doing it on a leisurely timeline\nIt's not a problem you don't have to be concerned about it but if you let say before let's say you're on a major artery and you're told that the ... has to take place you can easily tax the email from your phone that hey I'm taking this beach are we going to go to through this direction\nTo that location so this way family members who you rely on\nThose even ask the people on the other side cannot get that sick no meaning that tax to the email that\nSays once that's our turns on and the people on the other side get that connection your text or email all show up once death death cell phone reaches that tower\nNo as a as a ... thank you Alan for your call the your thoughts here or how does the GPS here ah affect all of this\nOh it makes everything so wonderful that we know where each of those are like you can set in activate your GPS for your family members\nSo this way you can see where you know your family members are by checking where they are on the GPS system so but\nIn times of weather related problems such as Michael you know the storm skipped throwing down you know it can take out technology and if the towers are the people that you're sending a signal to went down on the\nDance single you won't get that you know the people on the other side won't get the message but if they hit another tower that active they will instilling receive those messages so as long as you're sending a signal you can let people know which way you're going how you're going that way and\nOn the other side it's important to understand that they will receive at once a power is connected to that cell phone they will receive that message and now they know what happened to you\nAnd I would just throw in a quick little plug for radio a good old ubiquitous over the radio always their distribution such moments we got to Patrick in Rochester, Minnesota joining us tonight on the bull headed show with our guest disaster preparedness expert Anthony ... good evening Patrick\nA good evening Jim ... is a this coverage is very fascinating with hurricanes and so forth [noise]\nUm [noise] and uh otherwise set a than being a good script per movie\nUm why not just bomb or a hurricane several hundred miles out into the Pacific a couldn't be a new killer it would rain radioactive [laughter]\nA wave but or\nMaybe a hydrogen bomb or\nWell that's a nuclear bomb to get you to know because it involves a a a\nTrigger that consists of either uranium plutonium but beyond that if the if it let's assume for the moment that we didn't care about the radiation we just wanted to really knock a hurricane out of kilter\nA I Am not sure about this but I Would dare say that if we were to drop our entire nuclear arsenal into hurricanes I\nIt might have an impact but these things are so much bigger than a single nuclear weapon that aside from all of the other end practicalities of such an idea there is too big\nAnd let me\n[noise] well you know let's put it this way let's say the United states was to let's say oh this you know in the state of Florida the state decides hey we're gonna take this action and\nDo something with the storm and the storm goes towards Alabama or Texas\nNow ... is the state of Florida are liable for died during this storm and damaging the states the other states or let's say another country let's say the United states there was a big storm coming towards us\nAnd then we diverted to Mexico and they go straight through the city and cause a hundred billion dollars worth of damage\nHow we live off of that so that's another area of issues that may arise if we went to try to control the weather because the weather's going to go some place and the people that it hit that got to kind of be upset\nYeah and I would note one instance in which this happened I'm not sure that anybody will never found liable or even there was proof that in fact the action lead to one followed but\nThis was this has been probably half a century ago or so somebody got the idea of cloud seeding or part of the eye of hurricane this was I think the hurricane was off Jacksonville, Florida and so they did it and the hurricane promptly took a sharp left earning headed inland\nAnd the the I don't think anybody was ever able to tell if in fact the the cloud seeding caused this but I don't believe the ever again that was tried so ah the the fact is that that we just don't know enough about these things in the end of the Anthony notes quite correctly or\nA one of the just simply change of course it damages somebody else in the ... who is liable and are you [laughter]\nIt could be a painful lesson in the liability laws if in fact we ever did learn to do this we we'd better learn to do it with the exact precision will take some more callers will be an athlete Kobe\nAnd his book is the emergency prepping simple disaster preparedness for the Modern Family is

curious what all you folks have been throughout their one eight six six five oh Jim bode when eight six six five oh five four six to six years Dave in North Carolina joined it's below Dave\nI Am kayaking Michael Jordan I uh you know the last\nStorm that came through here and and your call screener asked perhaps what was the right outside of cherry point Marie Claire station\nOn the Carolina coast or just in between ... and more head where the flooding was real bad and you know the thing about this last storm is that there's the flooding was\nWay outside the norm\nTwenty inches of rain in twenty four hours is just not something that normally yeah I've I've had this house here for for Thirty years and\nThen through every strong that they ... the idea that strong that rate down through the air station there so you know I've always had the spinoff tornadoes and all that stuff that happens it's never been anything like this and I've never had\nA huge damages and when I was sort of some of your callers say post chats ears failing out everything you know I've never gotten a penny from anybody for anything and never even made an insurance quiet and uh\nWell how does I mean you what you do you had to rebuild right well\nLet's get the repairs on my own and and here's the thing is when people do rebuild it's like I this is the first time I had\nDamage and uh I'm\nI'm gonna do it all out of pocket and I'm fortunate that I can do that because you always\nAre local well\nBut I mean it's if people do this stuff themselves rather than higher and the first guy that comes along or the pickup truck\nAnd says I'll do that for action that you know and then they normally have to get that read that but you know I I was at the local Wal Mart earlier picking up so I you know\nRun in and grab some stuff get out and I was talking to one of the workers and I said\nYou know you guys are still open six in the morning till ten at night and I if I get to go in and get oil so there are like going at three in the morning when there's nobody there ... get out right and ... and she said well you know we're still so under staffed ... because so many of the people that work at Walmart\nCompletely lost their homes and I um I didn't know it was that bad right here I knew it was you know I can get mean if you drive through this area\nTrees or ... or cut a pilot on roads and all that stuff right but you know introduce responsible to evacuate when you're told you is a threat is there this is the first time I've ever evacuated for storm\nAnd so bad doing it couldn't wait to get back almost almost turned around at Georgia State line and came back but my granddaughter wanted me to go stay with her you know in that area issued or read about ... right or left came back and\nDo the only good thing about it is when I came back I was able to blame things that people asked for because everything was shut down mhm right you know I've been through super typhoons in the Philippines spoken our places like that where you don't evacuate because the government who is who you're there for says we're not going anywhere in\nFact we're going to go out and take care of the people who need our help during the storm mhm so which you know it's not an irresponsible actually not always leave now and\nI don't know it it up all of this with other countries of course that's a
