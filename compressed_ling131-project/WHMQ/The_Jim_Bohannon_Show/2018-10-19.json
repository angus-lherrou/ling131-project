America and our imperiled world Mr Kagan thank you for joining us tonight\nThey rounded\nThat's a quite a title the jungle grows back what's the derivation of that\nWell if you think about the fact that you know the world have been living in all its flaws it's been pretty good uh but you know there are forces out there in the world or horses coming from China and Russia\nOr ... or is that you know want to sort of destroy the world and that's what I mean by the jungle growing back and we need to continually push back against the jungle or it'll it'll take us over an adult us\n... and of course there is a a view that has a at various times been the stronger or weaker but it's never disappeared in that view I guess can be summarized as a\nNone of our business none of our business let's just to stay out of the world to uh keep an arms like fear will just to sit back on our own shores and make our country better and we won't or we will go meddling is somewhat but it\nDisagreed strongly with his press is his promise\nThat we should intervene abroad in various places specifically in the middle east\nHaving spent some time in our past life in official down fish has the um I just disagree with his premise that the Iraq War we touched by the way that we should be an Afghanistan it all given the fact that we've been there now for over Twenty years we've had changed a darn thing you know the country\nYou're thoughts police are\nWell I agree we have not been effective in Afghanistan you know let's not forget why we went into Afghanistan you know we were attacked so there\nAre I think we would have been done better if we had taken out of out from Afghanistan or they had an opportunity to attack us which is something that we bought a at doing during the Clinton Administration you know as for Iraq I you know I'm not going to go back and say that everything that we did was right in Iraq but I Do think\nI I I still have a hard time believing better off if we had Saddam Hussein in power\nOr that would be yet another vicious dictator\nOr that we can now at people who are now carrying out assassinations or in other people's consulates like the head of Saudi Arabia or we would have Iran still and so you know we make mistakes of the country uh I certainly make the stakes\nAre in St Louis about what we should do but the real question it seems to me is a are we going to deal with the threats that are out there or our way and uh unfortunately in the middle east there are real threats that we already have seen on September eleventh that come out\nAnd attack us and we'd have to deal with them they're rather than having to fight them here\nAnd to keep in mind also are the areas that were brought up by dock\nOne as regards Iraq Saddam Hussein did not only have programs of weapons of mass destruction but he used chemical weapons against both the Kurds and the Iranians he had a nuclear weapons program and let's not forget that\nAh as for a Afghanistan that was again the headquarters of al ... which was a so inextricably mixed with the government of the Taliban that it was hard to tell the two apart with the U.S forces finally reached a\nUh cobble a in some cases or a Taliban government functions were funded by Osama bin Laden and al ... money let's not forget that we had every reason to go in the problem I think we have in many cases is\nThinking that we can do things like this are on the cheap and the quick a particularly the second ... Iraq War the notion being that that will go in will pull out the or\nThe underpinnings of the uh Saddam regime and the entire country will rushed to the notion of a free pluralistic western style democracy and as we have learned a lot of parts of this world a culturally have a hard time going down that road\n[noise] well that's exactly right and I think you know sometimes you know we we we learn the wrong lesson or whatever mistakes in Iraq\nThen led us to do nothing in Syria where now we have Russian forces we have a rainy and forces and we have terrorists or says ah you know threatening us our neighbors sending hundreds of millions of refugees are in Europe and I think you know we can't we can't do everything that we shouldn't be everywhere\nBut there are places where we're gonna have to address some of these threats or they will in fact affect us directly\nWell six six five oh jumbo when eight six six five oh five four six to six as we go to a Marty who calls them from east Texas Zillow Marty\n[noise] yeah Hi Jim uh it it's a I always enjoy your show you know it's like I'm I'm working on a thesis right now is a historian that the arc of history actually is\nInevitable there was going to be somebody who discovered the new world there was going to be a country that um\nThat are not a country necessarily but there was going to be powers that\nMap to the world and that brought in marketing pillows and and and commercialism around the world that we're going to map to where they were discovered the world that we're going to be part of the progress that brings us to the point that we are today and I feel that is inevitable and America seems to be the\nUh the chosen vehicle or the inevitable a position that we find ourselves in the world today where we are combating\nA individualistic notions against a you know I'm collective is notions and that's that's something that I think is important to consider\nAll right let's let our guest to comment on that are your thoughts about uh the the arc of history if you will\nWell I I don't know about the arc of history because I think a lot of things are contingent and and I really do think they depend on human actions but there's no question\nThat the caller's right to say that\nYou know the United states found itself in a particular position or that do other country was in and I some of that had to do with geography you know we've talked about ... surrounded by two oceans which gave us a certain degree of security but it also gave us the ability to send forces at maintain stability\nThe lotions which gave us a certain degree of security but it also gave us the ability to send forces at maintain stability in Europe and Asia and prevent or is there a that would eventually engulfed us and it gave us the opportunity to affect\nAn international economy in a way that benefited our road so I think that's you know there is something special about America we shouldn't forget about it whether you know whether there's an arc of history I guess remains to be seen by a certainly United States has shaped history with it with that said well yes\nAnd then of course it is if this might be if there is an arc of history we certainly aren't yet in a position to be able to\nAh accurately predicted one eight six six five oh Jim bow and of course we are a available uh uh to be heard not only in our affiliates stations but also a jumbo hadn't show dot com which means uh anywhere in the world and bus gill joins us from the Philippines where it is a broad daylight tunnel gill\n[noise] yes hello Jim I'm just one comment on a on our your guest's views on Philippines for like a career I'm like Japan has um create a arrangements are with the United states and and under certain conditions we can be a trip wire\nFor the U.S to enter into a into another major conflict\nWith is is there for Korea or or or Japan or attack and a lot of people don't realize that are not that many years ago this war's United States territory\nUntil Nineteen forty six that's true although in the case of a of the Philippines I'm not sure how many ah potential major conflicts exist and that is to say I'm not sure just exactly how many countries out there are covering the Philippines these days\nWhile they are they we we do have an ongoing problem with the Chinese building a well artificial island into\nAreas that are are are claimed as a either territorial waters of other countries such as the Philippines and Vietnam or a areas which should be considered international waters only taken\nAll right let's let our guests commented about that that notion of a of the some of the a bilateral arrangements we have around the world with the countries such as the Philippines or with the Japan with the with South Korea\nAnd the possibility that that these arrangements might drag us into a larger conflict to Robert Kagan\nWell I actually think you know are they actually have the opposite effect if we are reliable uh allies we will deter\nA China from attacking them whereas if we are pulled back and and and those kinds of Tibet but\nWe will encourage Chinese attacks and then I think we'll get drawn in that conflict anyway I mean the fact that we are reliable allies out their means that we can maintain stability and maintain eat and not have to get into war is if we think we could stay out of the conflict\nThat involves China and Japan and Korea and all those other countries out there I think we're kidding ourselves we've already discovered\nA twice over the last uh past century that we can stay out of those kinds of conflicts\nAnd uh if we try to do so uh uh if we tried other words to go for quote the peace and honor now in our time will usually wind up with either one\nThat's right and you know people talk about or offshore balanced SARS but that's what we were in the Nineteen thirties and the consequences of that was we wound up having to fight off shore so I think it's better to provide stability or the security arrangements\nStay with us a more to come by one eight six six five oh Jim ... is our number one eight six six five oh five four six to six Robert Kagan our guest is the Freedman senior fellow\nWith the project on international order and strategy and the foreign policy program at the Brookings Institution online at Brookings dot edu he's a columnist for the Washington Post author of the return of history at the end of dreams\nAre dangerous nation of paradise in power and they twilight struggle a served in the state department and the deputy for policy and the bureau of Internet American Affairs or graduate of Yale and Harvard University's Kennedy School\nWhite six six five oh Jim bow our number one eight six six five oh five four six to six more from our guests Robert Kagan and your calls on the boat had a job in a moment\n\nWhen it's happening here in the valley we're talking about the only live and more these kind of by any around a handful\nPart of the country that at that had an institution of slavery that the north opposed and didn't have and you had a neat dividing line and in fact Thomas Jefferson said\nYou know in a way it's precisely because there was such a neat dividing line that makes it impossible to avoid conflict eventually you know the decisions we have today they're like\nNeighbors disagreeing with neighbors you have people in the suburbs disagreement people in the city\nIt's really hard to see any kind of geographical line uh and we don't have the kind of fundamental institutional difference that we had\nBetween a slave holding south and a capitalist north so I think we're we're obviously in great disagreement and we see polarization uh but I don't see a civil war I think that was a very special circumstance\nWell I certainly am happy to hear you say that and uh I certainly hope but and I actually think that you are correct Carolyn ... Pennsylvania now good evening Carol\n... or you say that it and you need to keep that radio turned down Gerald this could be a very long call an arrow [noise]\nI don't want to say much all I wanted to say as I Am against the United states doing any first strikes\nWell okay I'm not sure that ah that we have any comment plated or as a matter of uh of your thought process Robert Kagan a I guess we would have to define a further first strike a I doubt that we're ... to go around let's say when they first\nStrike a nuclear option a full scale World War three type of auction of option although my guess would be that there may be places and circumstances in which\nAt proactively or engaging a problem before it gets worse and something less than the nuclear level might be on occasion beneficial\n[noise] yeah I mean we certainly I we I Can't imagine those using nuclear weapons in the first strike that's that's not been our policy in it and it it it is not going to be but but yes if if we saw a crisis developing a that might result for instance in another terrorist attack or\nA in a in a war that we could forestall a by taking some action I think we have to be willing to do that or as we have in the past and uh and you know try to do with his intelligence ... selectively as possible but you can't rule out the possibility of using force although not nuclear force if that's what the caller's talking about\nThe big ended the key is in the term of first strike\nA more to come what eight six six five oh Jim bowl what should be the American role in the world regardless of what we would like it to be what is the best role in a in a world that is far from perfect your thoughts with our guest Robert Kagan author of the jungle grows back in just a moment\nFrom a massive cactus falling out of home from a beer dancing on a ... we've covered I talked to farmers we know one thing or two because we've seen a thing or two we\nAre above ...\n... ...\nWe're heading into the final chapter of the\nGreat American read on PBS PBS to ask you to pick your number one book from\nMelissa in America and how do you love the novel on Tuesday I tell me twenty thirty eight seven in central hosts merideth vierra anthem very special Gasper account down the top novel based on your boat and then if the big reveal America's favorite thought don't meet the\nGrand finale of the great American read that he'll be twenty thirty eight ... only on your PBS station\nDiabetes high blood pressure anxiety meds everyone's on them if you want to fifty year old male maybe it would be for you or even with type two diabetes a million dollars of term insurance my only cost you about two hundred bucks a month of ...\nLife insurance is out there called term provider and speak with big Lu at eight hundred for a one fourteen\nFifty eight eight hundred for a one fourteen fifty eight or is it big blue dot com\nRemember big lose IQ he's on madness to\nIndeed knows it's hard to find qualified candidates when you're hiring like finding a unicorn boy you post your job on indeed it's easy to find people with skills you need a nurse practitioner for experience acute care certification indeed has a huge pool of amazing candidates and screen or tools that help you find your most qualified\nApplicants and entire shortlist of unicorns see by more than three million companies worldwide using deet to hire post your job and indeed dot com slash higher indeed the world's number one job site so Wisconsin ... visit from a bear much like a horror\nInterior to adhere damaging\nWe've covered it talked to farmers we know one thing or two because we've seen a thing or two we\nAre ...\nYou're right my name is ... ...\n...

six by boat jumbo and a two labs in Galloway New Jersey on the boat Hannah Joe hello Lance\n... through ... warrior I'm wary lying for going [noise]\nListen I'm well you're right there ... you know the human species are definitely in perfect better more highly competitive but I see a comparison in the original ashtray tragedy of the common\nAnd at times when you have people that are vying for specific resources or do they will come to conflict rather than a compassion\nAnd unfortunately a classic example of people that are still deep rooted in hatred among each other is the conflict in the middle east because it's so biblical\nSo I mean people just don't get along at certain points in times when they think something of of\nSo I mean people just don't get along at certain points in times when they think something of a value for them or their their uh ethnicity is going to be pregnant away and jeopardize\nLet me offer a thought here about two areas that were bound to be conflicts forever one would be the war in Northern Ireland which of course did not last forever\nAnother goes back to some years ago when I was working with a young woman who said that she wanted to go cover the next war and she was moving to South Africa\nAnd at the time I said well first of all I was just back from Vietnam myself I said I'm not so sure you want to cover the next war but knowing you maybe you really do I said if that's what you want\nThen that's probably as good a place to go is any of the only place I could have put on a par with that I suppose was ah was somewhere in India or Pakistan well of course India and Pakistan have not had an all out conflict in quite a while and there never was a full fledged war in South Africa\nIn which the south Africans ever had to use those nuclear weapons that they in fact a later admitted the existence of and dismantled so uh if you are one looking at those conflicts alone or South Africa which is still troubled today to be sure but there's been no all out war there\nOr Northern Ireland which still has its problems but again the vicious gorilla fighting has gone away and I'm not sure what Robert Kagan I Would buy the thesis that some conflicts can never be resolved\n[noise] yeah well I mean I think the conflicts can be contained and that's what you know we've done for instance in Europe you know when I when you talk about the middle east and help people of Haiti show there forever and fighting each other forever\nOr you know in the Nineteen thirties that's exactly what people said about Europe and it was true you know Europe and Europeans have been fighting each other for centuries and people said well how can how can we expect to bring\nEurope to peace and yet and yet we were able to now I'm not saying that that is you know whatever we did in Europe we can necessarily\nDo in the middle east it it may be more than an effort that we want to make but I agree with you Jim that you know you can't look at any of these conflicts in Northern Ireland is a perfect example a and say that there's no way of of putting a lid on it maybe people might still hate each other\nOr not like each other but it doesn't mean that they have to be at war with each other and I think sometimes outside forces can really play a helpful role in that regard\nYeah and then they get I get it boils down to the fact that perfection is not the litmus test year ... things are made better I think that's a much more a plausible a litmus test for any course of action thank you for your call last we go to Charlotte Durham North

know a A R I don't know is Carter been there a court room with a capital\n... and all the decisions he made a using one thing you see what I mean\nHe is using one thing and and again I I'm curious how Jimmy Carter would react if such charges have been thrown at him I've interviewed Carter so I don't even have to to ask that rhetorical question I Know how we would react he would react\nUh very intensely he would probably out Kevin Cavanaugh in that regard not to mention a although we we should in this context that Kavanaugh wrote an apology that appeared in the op ed pages of the wall

a has been to some extent never was and he was a better ex president than the president so yeah I see what you're saying and I I appreciate the your thoughts are Charlie thank you very much for that Pam in Sioux City Iowa good evening them\nHey I just wanted to tell you listen to your show all the time on my way home from work and make far I'm actually calling from my car\nOr a ... I I think\nThat the kind of a west and the ... scale and\nI'm an independent I'm not ... I'm not a Republican I Am an independent and I think I don't think it's that they want to they're trying to tell people what to do I think their point is they have millions of followers\nAnd they just want to let their followers now how they feel I don't think they're trying to tell them how ... how about I just think that um they just again it just ... million followers\nOh they do that and I and I'm sure that you're correct I mean the problem I have is merely the fact that there are a lot of people who may very well formed an opinion based on what some celebrities says and then that's the part with which I differ or that they both have the right to speak out oh without question without quest that\nGreat great great but I it again and like I said I like I I really respect your with your show a lot and again I think that\nI think they're just trying to reach all their followers and just trying to get the vote out you know\nThat that ... in which case band that very how true is together because as I say I firmly believe that each of them\nProbably injured their career to a certain extent so if in fact it was that al ... a boy when you take a hit the nail in your career for something you believe in the well that's that's worthy of applause Richard in Durham North Carolina now Hi\nHey Jim are you doing I'm well thank you\nI'm a on my way home also from work in a I'll listen to you on a regular basis in a pretty shaky show I uh I Believe I've always said this to my wife that\nI Believe that um celebrity have a certain responsibility when they get to a certain point of saying that they want is their thing\nTo get into politics that's one thing where they are actually active in politics when you have so many years the day that\nAbsolutely do not know what's going on and they idolize these people and if they believe that their idols want them to vote a certain way that's the way they should go not knowing\nWhat the consequences are still that that's a long way to use you're saying\nYeah I I again uh I I think what they have to say and how they say at both both does a couch a very much uh so I see what you're saying and and the that would be actually weighing the circumstance is good for them back in a moment\n\nWhen ... when there is that what do you maintain the bad weather when you need it was just wanting to storm the hand you a chance\n[laughter] I mean yeah\nAnd if she ran she would probably do fairly well over his popularity has been the events\nI I think you would automatically let her as a as a as a strong contender should choose to run I don't think she's going to because I think she she recognizes as a as dirty Harry ... a man or a woman's got annoys limitations and I I think she's much better as a\nAs a media communicated the necessarily as a candidate but I think she could be a formidable candidate I really do\nBut my point is is\nTheir job description whether whether they are not fully a this is kind of a man but uh athletes\nAre at their job description\nIs has the word play in it you know actually plays a sport right I get paid a lot of money and has a lot of bad actor plays the park um\n... ... thing to play music and theater people play and play a book that's not where I go to\nTheir opinions or set it because they are American says they have just like that as a body part like we all got to pay it but um their opinion it's not necessarily any better than lying or Joe blow down the street\nOr anybody else that they that that\nThat is the whole point Steven I like you vote you summed it up nicely exactly their opinion is not necessarily any worse than mine but it's not necessarily the better either end that was pretty much to the point that I was making All right when we come back and

while we can expect this year with a medical officer from the Centers for Disease Control doctor leads the gross cost a lot of uh what are we expecting this year\nI Wish I could say I'm we wish we could say oh we can never really predict for the coming season\nWhat it's going to be like how severe it is going to be right now it's it's just too early typically in the United states um flu activity begins to pick up in the fall around October um but right now we just can't predict what the coming seasons going to be like and that's one of the reasons it's important to get vaccinated every year because we can never know how serious it is going to be\nExact and for those who say well uh I was ... committed last year I was vaccinated in ... Thirteen or something they need to realize and that is a a flu virus was a very sneaky food which keeps changing our lives\nYeah they are really little wonders and in terms of how they change on flu viruses change constantly um and that's one of the reasons that in most seasons as we move from one season into the next the vaccine has changed to reflect what is thought to be\nThe thing that we're going to be seen most of in the coming season um so that's one of the reasons to point to get vaccinated every year\nLook look back to last year than the uh what kind of a season was that\nYes so last season the two thousand Seventeen Eighteen season was a very severe season I'm One of the most he's severe seasons we've had in the last decade with an estimated nine hundred thousand hospitalizations and eighty thousand deaths um we had\nOne hundred and eighty recorded so far pediatric that's from last season and one of the the things about it was that it was a season where um the activity was very sustained across the country for many weeks at a time and really affected\nAll age groups across the age spectrum very severely so last season we did have a very severe one um\nAll of that said we can't really draw any\nConclusions or make any predictions about what we're going to see going forward for twenty Eighteen Nineteen based on what happened last year\nIn terms of vulnerability I guess there is a constant about flu and values that the older and younger you are the more likely you are to be vulnerable\nTrue um there there are some groups that are more likely to develop severe disease if they get sick more likely to get hospitalized more likely to have that ... and those are the very youngest in the very oldest um\nThose under five years of age particularly those under two years of age and those sixty five years of age and older\nI'm old I said we we also know that there are individuals outside of that age group for example those with some chronic medical conditions are more likely to get severely ill and even with that said we also know that we really can't predict who\nCould have you know if you take any individual\nWhat individuals are going to have a serious outcome what individuals are going to get sick enough to go into the hospital or die I'm\nEven previously healthy people young adults can get severely ill children who have no prior medical problems can get severely ill from the flu\nIs there more than one vaccine available this year\nWe have a a good number of different vaccines that are available this year on the two basic types if you\nWant to divide them into two broad categories are we have flu shots and then we have um the nasal spray vaccine\nShots are given with a needle generally and they are made either with no virus at all or with virus that's been an activated and killed so it can cause disease and then the nasal spray vaccine is one that's made with live viruses but these are viruses that have been weak and so they can't\nMultiply enough to cause any disease\nOf course most of us are not at all confident to make that choice ah ah other than the cost factor and I wouldn't be one to scrimp on those which one was more effective at at least based on past years\nThat's a really good question and it's also one that's very difficult to answer because I'm ... one of the\nMany things that very about flu is vaccine effectiveness varies from season to season and that can depend on the person they're age their health status how good the matches between the vaccine and what's circulating and also can vary from one vaccine to another um so the most important thing people can do is\nTalk to their health care provider about what vaccines they have available and they can help select the right vaccine for you\nIn addition to taking the vaccine water other precautions we can play against flu every year every year we were told you sure to always wash your hands a lot\nAbel letting you know that this is food from

to let you guys\nWant to get some things off of our chest because we did not like the way they were doing in Donald Trump throwing\nHim under the bus and back in that buzz on him but no reason at all he had been in the public eye for all these years and not one time they called in those nasty nasty and they got it running against Hillary Clinton\nWell there's certainly there was a shall we say a major turnaround in it and when they want when he won\nThen obviously that has something to the major sector of this country has not come to terms with they cannot accept that he was making them out except that he signs bills into law economic subsidies dictates national policy in accordance with the\nThe constitution this was a major problem for a minute and it's been two years and I'm not sure exactly when this was going to sink in ... yeah he really did win\nWilly willy with all of his accomplishment look at what he's a team within two years have done more than Obama could do an eight

impact into I'm Wondering how you you got to be connected with his campaign I mean obviously there are a lot of people out there who\nWho are rally to his his support but not many people have gotten to actually speak at a at a rally is held on for a candidate Trump and President Trump how did you come to the attention of the Trump campaign\nAt all I can tell somebody from is kept it out for us um and it just it's sold out from there he came in North Carolina there was no way they was going to be here in North Carolina we not be there so it was arranged for us to be at one of his rallies he\nInvited on his stage name as my we didn't have to take his Mike He gave it to us to let us say whatever we want to say it but not all of those cameras back there that that was it was probably over a hundred of them\nAnd I'm Out there that that was that was just it just snowballs out there that I think that next January\nAnd Mississippi opening up for a rally and we've opened up for so many of

they\nReally think about it I'm President Trump Donald Trump at the time he is about the people he or the people real people um he's not you can have all these different degrees or what have you uh and just be so politically correct\nDonald Trump he's just a real person if you remember before he ran for president I mean he ... he looked at who we hung out with the real people like he was not even a a\nBillionaire even though he has a billionaire\nHe just said act out any I don't like yeah yeah with the people and how the people you know why he want because hey how us\nGo ahead say Oh yes he hurt us and if you look at it even right now in his presidency he's bypassing all of these organizations and taking it directly to the people nobody bought him he's not beholden to\nHollywood or the lobbyist nobody\nBought him a paid him off he's only beholden to the people that voted him in office\nTo analyze that off and look at the left wing media how they spend the late shift gossip
