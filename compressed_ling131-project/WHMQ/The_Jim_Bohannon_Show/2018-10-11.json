you're a given area like that and ah and frequently they can ah can cause a distraction\nBat with purple focused on who said you know all the criminals are ... they're not they're not going to have

much that's the ... in Panama City Florida where the brunt of this storm struck into we return now to our discussion with Dr Brian Day and it's just a professor of the department of atmospheric and environmental sciences at the university at Albany State University of New York\nAnd I was noticing a doctor ten or comments made by the Taj a regarding the relative a quick pace of Michael in Florence of course as we recall was guilty of loitering\nOut why is it the storms of vary in terms of the pace at which they move\nWhile you can you can think of hurricane sort of like a leaf and a stream and that is a you know the the leaf is is moving in a very slow meandering stream that that's sort of a sudden it or not moving very quickly with like for instance there was sort of linger over the place and that given period of time whereas a leaf in a fast moving stream like um\nLike Michael ... will move very very quickly through an area\nWould it be safe to assume that a a faster moving storm is more likely to bring with the wind damage as opposed to the water damage in comparison with the Lawrence where the wind might be less but the water damage more or or can you even make that generalization\nUh it's certainly if a storm is moving\nOr it will it will produce um a window over a a area for a longer period of time and that has capability in fact likelihood of producing flooding rainfall um but in terms of the when you can you can have a storms that are very intense much like Michael that are moving both slow in the past\nI'd say so in other words the the speed at which the storm moves across the surface of the ground that is to say it's it's land speed Iran not necessarily related to the uh the speed of its wins no no it isn't\nA very good one eight six six five oh jumbo our number one eight six six five oh five or six to six as we watch\nMichael the remnants there or continue to move across a Georgia having of course if the Florida Panhandle portions of Alabama as well\nAnd is still heading across the state of Georgia is our guest Dr Bryan tang of this\nDepartment which you teach atmospheric and environmental sciences\nOr that the people today I think uh they look at all these terms like a\n... satellite pictures and we hear things like Doppler radar most of which of course most of his early know what that is but it sounds like you folks are are totally on touch a\nWith the with what happens in the storm in other words I think we we may at one time we use to make jokes about the weatherman and how little they do and compared with today I guess it had no hardly watch today we act like you guys know everything and if you're even off by a little bit I think we get on your case for that and that it strikes me that there's a happy balance there that\nThat you know more ... than you used to but it's not like you have a complete handle on every single storm but every single moment\nRight and it's it's the nature of the beast that weather prediction will always be uncertain to ... to some degree but in in the last decade or two we we've really come up very very long way and ability to predict whether to protect a extreme storms like Michael\nYou I understand you have a research that you undergo at Albany a that focuses on tropical cyclone formation intensification and interactions with the the climate system let's start with formation\n... what is it that is the existing out in the open ocean that causes a tropical depression to form\nWell and and the Atlantic um we oftentimes see these clusters of thunderstorms that form a in the middle of Africa\nAnd they will move off the coast of Africa and about um ten percent of them so really tiny fraction of them will form into tropical depressions usually in August September and October\nWhy that time of year I Know there is a season but I'd never be a wide\nYeah and that's when the water temperatures are to warm is in the tropical Atlantic\nUm that's also when the uh the atmosphere is is uh uh the the more most moist um and that is also when kind of the the jet stream which can interrupt the storms that um that that sort of brings storm winter storms that through our next it was over the winter that's when it's the furthest north\nSo um it's just kind of the best environment that time of year for storms to form for hurricanes to far\nI guess it was maybe ten twelve years ago I was talking with somebody who ah worked with a of well at the time was considered I guess the greatest number crunching computer in the world and we were trying to lay people to get some understanding of what this thing could do and I asked him and says or anything\nThat this computer can't do any numbers it can't crunchy said yeah we can get a handle on the on all the factors in the environment if you count all of the wind velocity and temperature and high pressure low pressure areas\nIs that you could put there are so many numbers there that that that computer at least the like I said about a decade ago that it couldn't handle that can handle other stuff that would boggle your mind but that it couldn't handle do we have computers today which can quote handle the the the amount of data that's out there\nUh yes it's it's it's always a challenge because there's just so much data a on any given day or our satellites and in space or take many many measurements are over the entire globe and that all needs to be um put into these uh weather prediction models\nIn order to forecast a model and that is a is a pretty a daunting task to do but as our computers get a a more powerful and um we we sort of learned about the Amish are more and more um we've definitely made great strides in weather production as a result\nSo we looked a bit at the tropical psych load formation of this by the way folks will be three credit hours at the end of the uh [laughter] but now that the other part of your research intensification okay so the little tropical depression\nWhy do these things and I guess not in every case do they but but why do they in some cases become these intense storms\nRight in intensity changes is one of the grand challenges of tropical sites on production that something that we we still struggle with um as we clearly San like all we we did not anticipate you know a few days ago that it would be making landfall as such a strong a tropical site found or hurricane\nUm so what sort of we we generally understand kind of what feel with ... that is as you as you said before kind of the warmer ocean waters that are live below the ... are both below to hurricane\nAnd that provides a kind of the fuel gasoline for the power to Windsor to store\nAll right and then that takes us to interactions with the the the climate system itself has a A R there uh are there are portions of the planet\nWhich are let us say predisposed to uh to the formation of a depression due to a storm to to hurricanes ah portions of the planet where are all else being equal a it's a friendly environment for this kind of storm information\nIf they're the the Atlantic actually is is not the most active in terms of the number of hurricanes that formed the Pacific particularly the western part of the Pacific I'm off the coast of 'em in China and Japan and the Philippines\nUm get many many more hurricanes are out there they're called typhoons by the same system there there's just different names for for them um and they regularly get storms as intense as Michael I'm a you know a a great number of them every year\nAnd that there's another thing that I think confuses the lot of us okay hurricanes on the Atlantic and I guess what the Eastern Pacific typhoons in the in the western Pacific is that right\nYes tighten ... in the western Pacific and five phones yeah just sort of generic sites on the Indian Ocean and in the southern hemisphere\nInteresting and those are just terms of convenience we are centrally talking about the same phenomena right\nYes the way which is why in the science community we'd just referred to everything has a ... phone instead of a hurricane because that's just kind of a generic name\nEnough All right we will continue our discussion tonight and your calls welcome of course uh either as a a question for our guest or since\nAnd uh also in the experiences you may have in particular if you are facing the wrath of Michael we'd be interested in hearing from you as well\nAt one eight six six five oh jumbo one eight six six five oh five\nFour six to six our guest is Dr Bryan tagging assistant professor in the department of atmospheric and environmental sciences at the University of Albany State University of New York back with more in just a moment\n\nWhen it's happening here in the valley we're talking about and the only live and more news and the pioneer valley and for the pioneer valley major [noise]\nCalling from Donna in Huntsville, Alabama on the jumbo how to do with our guest Dr Brian ... of the University of Albany State University of New York good evening Donna\nHi Dr ... I'm a native New Jersey and I was like a restaurant care I feel kind of like a hurricane knob and there's not much like giving to hurricane Camille August ... right that was five and nothing after\nI had never been worse uh I think a lot of these other storm hit them getting a wrong intensity as comparison get Camille\nAnd then that even had a hundred and twenty five foot wall of water\nCome out from the Gulf or there were tankers here were African freighters barges on highway Ninety and I think that in that area and they didn't have the type of coverage that we have now I mean we couldn't get on a computer or\nYou know Facebook or health journey thanks how I just wondering if you can comment on the tactic and that's getting no ref rank as far as the ... of it and I really don't think any of these others come anywhere near it\nOr you're exactly right can mail is kind of in a class in its own and then a lot a lot of people these days I don't remember a restaurant because I did occur such a long time ago and you're you're right the pictures of of the the devastation along the coast uh were was absolutely tremendous um\nWhat's what's different today perhaps is that uh the one thing that has changed is that there's just so many more people\nAnd I'm buildings along the coast so uh when we do have any sort of major hurricane hitting inland it's just affecting generally a lot more people a lot more buildings a lot bigger portion of our economy\nI'm just I'm because I've been on a ... a very desirable thing people love to you know let's look at the ocean every day um and so that's their choice to do that yeah\nYeah and there was a ... that can station I went through the entire thing uh-huh I went to all of it so I mean I'm\nA got a crash course and I'm surprised that people are surprised to oh I'm going to lose my electricity and I'm going to get some water in my house that seems a little not to ...\nOr ... you're exactly right I think people who especially are new to the area\nI'm a tendency to underestimate their risk sometimes because they they just don't have the experience and um you know they they assumed they can for instance they can take their windows and um by some buy a bag of chips and just sit through the event and that will be yet but\nI'm the the there's always we always stress you know before the hurricane season begins you have a plan you prepare and emergency kit and and it's it's a ... like this where where um you know it comes to fruition\nYeah I Lived through the the tail end of your meal and uh it almost eight my car uh seriously it hit the war way at the side of the of the some land by a stream bed that became a raging torrent and uh uh literally had I if I had not gone to lead the lot where this car was\nAnd moved it I buy my car I could not get into the car and the driver's side but I I moved to\nA away from the uh the edge of the water but that that waterway was and this was littered with cars or the next day and this ... this was the weekend tale of Camille the thank goodness we were lucky portion of meals so I you know what I'm Talking about will come back we'll talk some more\nWith our guest Dr Bryan

you're right that that we have this desire hey I bought the ocean front well I'm Sorry that that's not good enough to me that that that that's just foolish this\nYeah you do you touch on to the you know an important point and and something that I think needs to be discussed more and that\nUm you know where the terms of um how people manage their their risk and there there is risk everywhere right there is there's risk to to whether you can live in California there's risk of earthquakes if you're near a fault line [noise]\nUm but in in terms of um who's responsible for um absorbing that risk um we all buy insurance um the federal government or has the national flood insurance program which if you're on the coast\nUm and susceptible to storm surge I'm your regular you know if you have home owners insurance oftentimes I won't cover any sort of water damage so you need to buy policies through a federal program or a private company that offers ... flood insurance and\nI'm a sort of who who pays for that that catastrophe poll uh when when that that risk is realized um is kind of a ... is a subject of rape debate um and controversy\nMhm absolutely uh it should do you think there should be a prohibition or uh do you think there should be a changes in in how insurance premiums are structured or or what changes would you make in that regard if you could\nIt's yeah it's a it's a very very um complex question um I I certainly think I'm a you know it's it's really kind of up to how how the state and wants to start a craft legislation on terms of um there there are caps on

six all kinds of money things out there it's a major part of the of our lives even if I may be investing or or playing a various a market games or or not or shall we say your hobby\nBut the fact is that we are all our economic beings to what extent or another and this is the kind of thing that can seriously affect your life\nLet's talk to or not only our guest Jordan Goodman America's ... mad but to see the new calls in from medicine lodge Kansas good evening Stephen\nGood evening Jim or or remember one night a night\nOf very for those who don't know that Steven was in the same year that I was in in Vietnam but go ahead\nYeah but you are in Austin for and\nI Know I I was I was actually enlisted also but anyway what do you have for what do you have for our for I guess\nAbout goals but it's it's been for me I'm a Seventy year old\nAnd uh I uh\nIt's always been holders value for me uh it's it's really a\nState the same or get Terry rated in the last year and I was wanting to know if it if he feels that still place to hold value\nI think of it as an insurance policy okay it's it's against disaster but that's been going down because when interest rates go up gold goes down after many other commodities and interest rates have been going up and looks like they're going to go higher and that's been hurting gold gold gotten over Thirteen hundred dollars announce\nNow it's roughly twelve hundred dollars now it's even lower than that so I I don't think it's going anywhere anytime soon I mean we've had all kinds of disasters in the world and gold has not gone up it's just not what it used to be if anything bitcoins become a new\nKind of safety valve and even that haven't been working my way as well so have a little bit of an insurance policy but I don't see go going up dramatically anytime soon\nWhat about other a precious metals platinum ... silver\nUm all the same ... gone down dramatically a platinum is kind of a of a place a play on a kind of like converters I guess I'm so car sales have been getting weaker wait wait so none of the pressure smells have really been doing much they all get hurt by rising interest rates Jim\nOkay very good thanks for your call Steve appreciate that very much and I might add thanks for your service as well now a\nThis is one of the little economic lessons I learned I guess a classic example of a little bit of knowledge is a dangerous thing but that is that in uncertain times that gold another ... precious metals will go up ah but I gather there are exceptions to that\nYeah well I mean these are on certain times although I'm some ways they're good times I mean the economy is doing the survey we got all kinds of potential problems with China and so on\nBut I mean this is not a time like two thousand eight when you know it looks like the whole world is going to be falling apart [laughter] so ah no goal just isn't doing well it's it really is a direct correlation with\nA interest rates and I mean the feathers arms raised rates are loud and long term interest rates have gone up dramatically and the ten year treasury is now over three point two percent\nIt started about two point one percent so it's not a big move up pretty short sharply and I think it's going to go maybe the three and a half percent by the end of the year that was all bad for gold silver platinum unwed him\nBut ... do you see an endless race going much beyond that\nI Do I think we're in the beginning of a major long term bond fair market\nWe've ... basically had a thirty five year bond bull market where bond interest rates peaked at about fourteen percent of the Nineteen eighty two\nAnd they went down the absolute though was about one in three quarters in the middle of two thousand Seventeen and since then it's got up to three point to\nAnd I think it's going higher let me just there were a brief explaining why interest rates are going up beyond what the Federal Reserve's doing right on the demand side there's less demand for treasuries because the two big buyers China and the Federal Reserve\nOr out of the market right now China actually has been the seller of treasury bonds not in a buyer for political reasons another way to get back at us over the trade war\nAnd the Federal Reserve remember they were buying all these bonds sixty billion a month through the so called quantitative easing program\nThat's over that's been over for about a year and a half now and now they're doing qualitative tightening so when bombs come do they're not buying new ones not renewing them letting them mature so two of the big buyers of bombs are out of the marketplace and meanwhile you\nNew supply Jim we've talked about this before but the deficit is that we have are being finance with that\nIn the third quarter that just recently completed third quarter we added four hundred billion dollars and that just that quarter alone today there are options of the thirty about on the ten year by they did not do well because we're having a huge supply because we're having trillion dollar deficit so more supply that's the man\nYields and yields grow up in prices go down\nThere you go the old a supply and demand thing All right we're going to come back and talk to some more we will certainly returned to the issue of China and a terrorist and the like about that when we come back after this break go take a a very close look at a that gift that keeps on giving the student loan indebtedness\nOne eight six six five oh jumbo is our number one eight six six five oh five or six to six Americas money answer as mad as our

shouldn't be paying off this kind of enormous money to finance a hobby and as I've also noted before that's why we have so many bowling leagues in this country people like to bowl\nAnd there are just simply an awful lot more people who like to bowl the people who can make a living and the professional bowling to her and so I mean is it just always it amazes me at all these people who want to find myself or I Want to do this or that well why don't you do that in your spare time and in the meantime get a job\nYeah well I mean luckily we have a good employment situation right now and and there's a tremendous shortage of workers except the people coming out of college in many cases are not qualified or willing frankly to do the jobs that\nAre available there's something called the jokes report which is the job openings long term survey and the latest number was six point nine million jobs unfilled employers cannot find the people\nTo do tool and dye making or plumbing or electricity or climbing electric utility poles there may be the people come out of college don't either have the skills or the interest in doing the jobs that are actually available in the real world\nWhich raises another point is too easy to sit on your body in this society there ought to be economic pressures on people like\nIf you're ever while student loans you are under economic pressure to do something in a lot of people take jobs that are like ... they've got a service those you know that's over fifty percent of the people graduating today go back and live at home because they can't services student loan debt and have an apartment in the car and kind of get on with their lives I mean it's pretty pathetic\nI mean if you wind up doing doing a job you're not particularly fond of a because it pays
