the great falls Montana and the case to be a good evening\nYeah I uh I was just thinking that they're salmon to in my memory and there was a strong linkage to nine eleven with the Saudi regime or at least a portion of the population in\nThat well a lot of the people involved in the plots were from Saudi Arabia to my knowledge there has never been any evidence they'll be getting the the Saudi Government was in any way involved\nLet me uh let me expand upon that point\nI'm not saying that there was any linkage directly but I think that there is a ideology that is exhibited by the Saudis have disdain and disrespect and I don't think the president should go to war or get carried away but he has to\nWalk a tightrope he should send a strong message that they can't just staying here is a\nA presence in his in our nation's hill and they're a dilemma that we're helping them with so that's my opinion\nWell All right very good any ah any thoughts on the beach to a caller\nAnd trying to think about different things that might can be done also and one might be to significantly limit the number\nOf a diplomatic passes that any of the family has to come into this country at all\nMaybe reduce the number of people at their embassies here I'm not let them by as much land and property as they would like to buy I mean you know we've got to consider all the potential options we have to

someone and put your demo for seven minutes by all accounts\nFor I'm not giving them a mass either I'm just not sure there's a lot we can do about it\nAnd that that is what makes this complicated isn't it the brutality of their act\nOr the apparent brutality again what we have so far or stories don't pass it off no no no no just supposed to be clear about this loop we at this juncture does not

Barnes why are we sending them money\nOr there's no question about the fact that they are not shall we say a poor and uh certainly uh although as I noted that suddenly Powell\nThey may be useful on occasion is hardly a usefulness that would demand or that they get our money that part I must confess or is that is a little hard to understand it\nI don't understand it all I Know I have absolutely no appreciation for any reason why we shouldn't give them a damn\nYeah again as I say uh if uh they were someone useful to us who needed money that might be different\nBut they are someone who can be useful to us who doesn't need a penny and in that regard I think Charlotte sport is extremely are well taken a one eight six six five oh jumbo what eight six six five oh five or six to six Rick in

just revoke his path for a which is certainly within their authority do show\nA claim that he's violated multiple Saudi laws extradite him back to Saudi Arabia it goes into a jail in Saudi Arabia and he's a story on age six in the New York times\nAgain he would be just as out of the way at the end I think that uh again we have a a very rational thought process from Rick uh get it and less and less we really think Sydney power that the Saudis deliberately felt that only\nThrough a show of extreme brutality or could they send their message out I mean I Would think that what Rick just described would end up itself be ah shall we say an a plus the fate to send a message to dissidents\n[noise] well it certainly should have been but this is as you mentioned earlier gentleman medieval sort of regime\nAnd they are barbaric against women and all kinds of citizens of their country so I that's what makes me think this was a deliberate message\nThat they are are barbaric again a is a given a that they were stupid and dealing with the United states this would be a level of stupidity beyond anything that I've ever seen that's the part I think that amazes me\nThat they have generally been pretty adept at quote dealing with the United states and this uh this kind of arrogance or\nMaybe that's why they're calling it an accidental death during interrogation they were supposed to do everything but killing\nYou know you know the ... that ended up ... this is a regime so brutal that they might very well I think that that was somehow pass oh okay you were only tried to made me a little bit ah maybe that maybe I'm maybe I'm wrong maybe they are that stupid Linda in champagne Illinois hello\nHi Jim I'm not saying that the Saudi Government are nice people or anything like that only art and\nCertainly not at that and this this fellow um I Believe I'm came from a family of arms dealers the within the Saudi Government at one time I think a very close to some of these\nHe's a Muslim Brotherhood support or he is the I think talking about this or that hardly makes them a savory character that's very true in\nLike a journalist in in Saudi Arabia having the freedom to chat right in favor of Israel he thought that shouldn't have been allowed\nAnd everything ... says that um and I don't honestly think that the Saudi Government would have been so stupid it's ... like that\nBecause they know it would come back on them and I wonder if there was a rogue elements of course we don't even really know what happened you\nKnow we do but the thing about this rogue elements in a consulate ... these are not just to places like boutique some of the shopping center where you just wander in now but people\nCan decide to do something that's not smart and I think that the fellow called in about John ran and maybe on something and it may have been done and partly make Trump look bad and try and make a ... ... you know because\nI ... that that is the level of

All right uh ... believes ah amplify further on that are obviously we're not talking about a\nA two different religious sects per se and unless you want to uh uh consider a I suppose the more traditional a Judeo Christian ethic on the one hand as a religious sect in this a\nLooking back to the jumbo had showed one eight six six five oh jumbo what does that work in this seemingly intractable\nNational discussion about policy and politics things do seem to be as this book is titled out of control Dr Richard ... position than psycho analyst and the subtitle apocalyptic psychology and the age of Trump\nOr to a rod who calls him from a wire Houser was kind of a sudden they both had to show good evening rod and welcome\nRon are you There God can you hear me yes you're on the radio go right ahead okay\nYeah my phone it's like a ... well okay for the\nCall sure up I don't consider myself a really delicate first but you know what I heard on Wisconsin Public radio I listen to public radio a lot of it they were talking about George Washington when he became president\nHe did not want to ... them and I just think to myself what a shame they didn't take it out because\nYou know if it got people that I don't care who's name it they're whatever letter or named up on that and that way I see it we don't need any ... with other white\nUp but that cap it off or whatever something happened at a port woman and I can't imagine a traumatic experience like that but up to me is not the issue right here in the fact that Obama he killed somebody for the part they all we got to wait until after the election\nBut our shores on the other what they get it before the election\nWell you've covered a number of the issues of the day but I'm not sure this directly relates to uh the topic at hand I Would just make one vote or before a deferring to Dr Creighton\nOr it was very naive of George Washington or anybody else to suggest that there would not be factions factions are almost proof that we have a free government if you have a genuinely free society you will have differences of opinion\nAnd like minded people will get together and organize to try and convince others of their point of view it as an essential part of society now can faction lives will be carried too far well yes it certainly can and perhaps we're seeing a manifestation of that\nBut the notion that you can have a free society without different factions isn't a possibility and I refer to Dr Creighton\nI Would have to agree with you entirely about that I I think there's a psychological motivation ultimately for or\nYou can unify groups to ultimately break down into smaller divisions so I I think there's no way of avoiding connections or what you do want to avoid as you mentioned this uh the extremes of polarity between two factions so that there's no workable solution to the system\nAnd we'll come back and explore some of that here in a moment but the writing a call from Steve in Chatham county North Carolina good evening Steve\nMartin has always enjoy your show in the screws thank you thank you ... ... when it gets to a point when you go to a\nRestaurant or or you've been allowed and uh I I don't know ... if the person or the establishment is left like whatever the mail or I don't understand this road once those oh\nBut when it gets to a point where you can't go out and have reason to that age without someone screaming at you spit on you know and then when you can't\nI really don't care of your\nDisposition just let's let's have a reason to bake I mean if we can talk with a screaming at each other ... which ... which I don't do\nAnd yet I'm the I call the Clinton machine the machine has his just you can use to give up the fact that two years ago two years ago ...\nYou know you lost the election okay I guess what if you love this country if you if you're being honest and then you're going to try to build it up not tear down\nAgain I'm not sure the extent although certainly I've had my differences over the years with the both Clintons especially in regard to uh honesty and and corruption I don't know that we can say that they are personally responsible for the uh the outbreak that we've seen a across the country\nUh I Do a Dr Creighton find one thing that I find tragically ironic\nAnd that is that much of of what we're talking about here is conducted by groups that roughly called themselves and ... that is to say anti fascist\nAnd the tragic irony is of course if those tactics of silence thing your opponents by intimidation and violence would have been understood by any of Hitler's brown shirts a reference that I'm sure would go right over the limited intellect of most of these people but that is that is is the sad a problem and back\nWe're brown shirts a reference that I'm sure would go right over the limited intellect of most of these people but that is that is is the sad a problem and that cannot be tolerated when you try to do that from whatever political perspective that you are so fewer\nAnd you are so virtuous that you don't have to listen to anybody else than the only answer in my book and you could certainly agree or disagree as you choose the only as read my book is do arrest\nProsecute and if convicted incarcerate such people that is out of bounds you could not let society be reduced to to the level of ... who can put together more of violence in the street\nYou know I I think you're ready to several important point\nA ... one of the points that I Try to make in the book has to do again with the underlying psychology of what's taking place at least a large portion of society and it's been said for some time now that there's an increasing degree of\nOf of the offices within the society and is it is increasing decree of moral perfection is an obsession all thinking is society\nAs a result when ... when when they counted as those types of psychological structuring their goals are those individuals are very prone to what we call projection and that is that they tend to uh take aspects of the the denied a self\nMake up and to place them on people around them\nAre so when you have a group like a ...\nA claiming that the anti fascist you look at the after it's very very obvious that the behaviors that you have your one would expect from the fascist group and so you see this constant accusation coming from the left projecting on the ride for everything that they're doing\nA at a ... but are claiming that it's the right to doing it so that's I think the motivation for some of this behavior or in terms of how to deal with it I agree with you entirely I think one of the greatest problems that we're encountering in society today\nIs that you lack of force that of the laws that are ... that are currently on the books are for a place like a\nPortland for for the mayor of port to sit by and have people rioting\nOn the streets and refusing to have to police intervene this is a breakdown of the necessary a legal sanctions and\nBoundaries that are a free society must have and if that's gone that it's going to be just a free for all\nYeah a again it it it is not something that uh that that could that could possibly be tolerated and and I see things like that and there have been other examples of some time ago when there was a police shooting that brought a rioting to Baltimore and the mayor of Baltimore told the authorities to let it burn\nA as if to say if people feel aggrieved enough that they get a free pass on behaving like civilized be eggs and that is\nAs as you say it I I think I'm not putting words in your about that is is pointing us in the direction of anarchy and that is not an acceptable outcome nobody is so aggrieved that they have a right to break the law with impunity nobody\nWho's yeah go ahead\nWell I I again absolutely but it it it's the role of the government are both at the local level and the federal law enforce the laws of the country and if they fail to do that then you can expect a increasing outbursts or for these groups because they're essentially unable to behave badly\nExactly oh we are you telling them yes you're tactic and intimidation is working and are people respond positively with or are they are told that or their tactic is uh is going to be tolerated\nStay with us more to come as a doctor Richard Creighton takes a look at just what is at work here what is the psychology\nInvolved in the the way we are currently conducting a business in this country at the public policy level and it's a\nIt's disturbing but again it's a knowledge of the knowledge is power maybe we can learn something from all of this one eight six six five oh jumbo we'll be back in just a moment\n\nGiving voice to the valley one on one in five seven five and fourteen hundred and\nThat reflect the the circumstances in the world but for whatever reason yes I like everybody else that would tend to agree with my viewpoint so it's almost a a a ... a a it it it naturally follows however\nI have never been so enamored of my viewpoint that I Would suggest that hey I must be right and therefore everybody else who disagrees with we must be wrong\nOr nor be that no matter how right I may be that it's somehow gives me a pass on the rules of society that that is the level of arrogance that escapes me even on issues where I'm\nVery confident that my viewpoint is correct I I just uh it's it's the attitude that goes with the viewpoint that escapes me\nWell we we've done a very poor job over the last generation or two at raising children or children have been raised with this concept of preserving self esteem or with the concept of self esteem is based on number criticizing never corrected\nAn individual and this carries on into the educational system so you've ... you've got chicken relations now or at least one ... one generation that's really able to look at it so critically a as a result they they have to preserve this concept of perfection\nAnd anything less than that it is not even within this fear of consideration\nAs as we go to a break and then we'll come back with some calls but I have to ask you\nIs this a terminal condition that has to say are these people beyond redemption is it impossible to ever a inject them if you will with a note of rationality or have they been so ... into this notion that my self esteem is the violet\nThat they will for the balance of their lives which in some cases maybe fifty sixty Seventy years\nCease to be affected members of our society\nA well if you if you want an honest answer\nI certainly do yes\nOr no sisters of the political level this is very difficult to treat and I think that's what we're talking about around here and so I I see the prognosis for this generation is not good well in fact most of the society is not good as a\nResult though it certainly is well honest answers are exactly what we need right now will come back and talk some more with

know that uh\nBut on that I don't even hear it proposed\nA All right the uh I I don't know that a a law of that sort of might be a very worthwhile or Dr Creighton I'm not sure how you would even words that such a law and he thought you might as\nWell I don't know that there's an existing law uh that that deals with we create a certainly nothing that I'm aware of the post ... set up\nUm I I think
