online find this a jumbo had a show dot com you can follow me on Twitter at Jim Botox\nWell Tuesday will be two weeks until the election we're getting very close to one of the more important midterm elections in recent memory and that we have a sort of take a look at it from a variety of angles and we thought we might take a look at it this evening\nFrom the standpoint of the largest uh rather fastest growing a voting bloc in the country one of the largest of such a voting blocks the Latino vote and do so and the company or ... or he is the founder and CEO of ... wealth management a good evening good to have you with us\nThanks for having me a gym honor to be here\nThank you very much a first of all it is a a large group or or just in terms of of sheer numbers are there are about I think twenty nine million Latinos eligible to vote a nationwide they make up a twelve point eight percent of all eligible voters and those are I Believe the new highs right\nYeah absolutely but the funny thing is that a lot of them are not\nVoting well that was another interesting er and always a disappointing when you look at a segment of the population a and that is a but a midterm vote ... ... a rate for Latinos Asians and wise reached like record lows in twenty four teen\nThe Latino voter turnout rate in the mid term elections has declined steadily since twenty oh six\nAnd a that dropped into the fourteen to a record low twenty seven percent\nOf white and Asian eligible voters also a record low turnout rates are although there was a record number of Latinos voting six point eight million and a twenty four teams will be because their numbers were growing but still as a percentage\nThat is a decidedly disappointing given some serious and contentious issues at stake why do you suppose that is\nBut back to the jumbo had showed late six six five oh jumbo as we've been examining the Latino vote a big part of the American voter and one that cannot be simply a tossed aside as a a democratic votes something for Democrats to a\nA simply a take advantage of an a or something for Republicans to completely ignore a not a true at all now than let's just go to oppose here this actual campaign as the president is trying to stand in the way of any pending blue wave\nWith just Eighteen days left until the mid term elections the president is the book solid for the final push holding for rallies and the next five days\nAnd as Pamela Brown reports will likely see more of a newly minted rallying cry at those rallies\nDemocrats bridges mobs Republicans bridges jobs\nI knew rhyming line of a cat from President Trump as he tries to have ... Republican voters by laying out a closing argument around two weeks from the mid term election\nI Know a lot [noise] of Kavanaugh law and order and common sense that's what it's going to be and remember it's going to be an election of the caravan you know what I'm Talking about\nFrom feeding on a new my bring caravan thousands have Central Americans nearing Mexico's southern border presumably headed to the U.S I Will say\nHave caused the problem\nBecause I have such an incredible autonomy I have so many [noise]\nTell everybody what [noise]\nWhat's the worst flaws in the world we're doing a hell of a job\nUsing those laws sibling Democrats without evidence supporting the immigration and fly\nAs you know I'm willing to send a military to defend our southern border [noise]\nAll costs because the illegal immigration onslaught brought by the Democrats because they refuse to acknowledge what changed the laws they like it\nTrump also taking it Twitter with his Democratic conspiracy theory I Am watching the Democrat Party lettuce south on our country by Guatemala Honduras and El Salvador\nThe leaders are doing little to stop this large flow of people including many criminals from entering Mexico to the U.S again same without evidence this group of migrants are criminals\nDemocrats for their part and it gives you the president I fear mongering\nThey almost want there to be an immigration a challenge that most cheering it on a because they're looking for some way to create or something to frighten the American people during an election\nWith control of the house and Senate and the balance trumpet in full campaign mode as the election season enters its final week\nPamela Brown and with all due respect to uh Pamela of course he did not say they were all criminals you said that they include criminals just a little parsing of the language that might help to further understand the discussion so we are talking today with the key lay low ratio of the real wealth management\nAnd looking at the at something I I Will simply state this as as I see it and I believe that this is accurate whether you dig ditches right or wrong and that is we live in a world of nation states nation states have the absolute right to determine\nOf their own prerogative who gets into their country how many for how long and for whatever reason now there are those of course who who uh get a warm and fuzzy feeling about the whole world holding hands and sing in ... I'm not one of those people\nAh I'm all in favor of immigrants who come to this country\nBy the laws of the land but no one anywhere in this world has the right to enter another country without the country's permission or do you uh take exception do any of that\n[noise] you know I I think that the immigration issue is a very complex and complicated issue I think that we sure to have\nA better policy on immigration I'm not that it's not strong enough that it should be definitely more clearer and um that we should be trying also\nThis is our back yard we should be trying to help these countries out a lot of the problems I hate to say this but a lot of the problems these countries that\nWere created by us I mean I miss Thirteen there from LA they're not from those countries so you know ... it's kind of a double edged\nThing although it was widely US government policy that created in most Thirteen\n[laughter] of course not of course not only from LA uh\nThey they they certainly are and of course ah many of them have gone back and forth and there are those who would wind up in other countries who who wind up but uh entering this country but I guess the point is simply and I saw this sign by demonstrator out in California some months back at it and it's just stuck in my mind\nThe science really read immigration is right\nAnd and at the time I remember saying no it is not a right you may argue that you think it ought to be which would at least be a debatable point I Would argue that it is not\nAnd should not be quote a writer but a privilege to be conferred by a nation state uh depending on what is the best interest of the nation state but to call it a right or simply indicates that you really don't know what's going on it isn't a ride a and in my view that it should not be a ride per se\nBut this whole discussion of course is not about immigration and never has been it is about the laws of the land that is to say who enters the country legally and who does not your thoughts\n[noise] you know uh [noise] I think things are true to [noise] you know just a by twenty fifty\nHispanics or you know actually I don't like the term Hispanics I like to turn back to you know it's more selective apartments\nOr a by twenty fifty ... are we are a warning for one in four ...\nPersons here in the United states aren't going to be Hispanic whether we like to acknowledge that are not if we don't terror policies not address this coming way because\nWe see families grow here average average Latino families have a lot more uh sons and daughters are than an average angle\nA family um but more importantly we use\nTo tailor policies that makes sense that are not cruel and that makes sense going forward for the future that's just an opinion\nOr an advocacy we are are dealing in pigeons will get a few from our audience as well here and they just a few minutes ah for example let's take of the case of the uh the children separated from their parents at the border or in my understanding that if we were to come across a parents who are let's say a robbing a bank\nThey did from their parents at the border or in my understanding that if we were to come across a parents who were let's say a robbing a bank or that we would ah probably wind up separating those parents from their children\nAnd my response or frankly to those people is a rap somewhat say harsh but uh this is my view if you don't want to be separated from your children stop breaking into our country there are procedures for entering this country and yes sometimes they are a very lengthy and sometimes they are\nLaden with red tape but a Soviet that does not give you the right to turn this into the international flight ... your thoughts\n[noise] you know uh for many years uh back in the early Nineteen hundreds there was no illegal immigration John\nAnd I agree with you I think that I I I agree with you to a point but you know for looking at it\nFrom the other side of the of the glass you have to also say to yourself Seventeen to Twenty years for someone to become a citizen of this country because I've seen that\nYes and I had a I did a show on that and and uh that's a lot of ... is not exaggerating that that that is the length of time it takes some people and it's way too long but he proceeded\nYou know so you know in that sense if we could you know if we can get\nBoth sides of the aisles to start having the dialogue started having this conversation\nNo one's ever going to be a hundred percent happy but we sure are going to work and show progress to putting together an immigration that makes sense for every\nNow and again the prospect of this country being a one quarter or one third or more a Latino or bothers me not one wet and I suspect most Americans as well provided they came here legally which of course in the case of many would not be the case\nBut this is not about ethnicity or anything other than the laws of the land and ah so anyway the ah the point of course obviously that we'll discuss this in the the next half hour of the program with our guest is is we're talking about the Latino vote\nIn the mid term elections to what extent is this an issue of for the Latino population are obviously hideous ad issues that issue for all of us but there are other issues as well a job's a cry about all the other issues that affect everyone\nHow does this fit into the panoply of opinion here will be back in just a moment\n\nWhen ... when his age and the steps to bad weather when you read it with a twenty two storm team and what are you a chance on one five\nThirteen fourteen years old every day when they're walking to school the kings are coming\nOne gang or now they're saying either you're going to join our game or we're going to kill you and we're going to kill your family now this is an extreme case but it is absolutely\nOccurring across Central America and the rule of law has broken down in many of these countries and unfortunately has created a situation that's not tenable for a lot of hard work ... individuals on it\nNow than our and we want to blame how are we to blame how did we another is how we create that\nWell a lot of the criminals that were deported during the Reagan\nAdministration a wink down to you to their home countries right and the creators syndicate in each one of these countries are to being one of them but that's just one of many that are there and right or wrong\nIt was one of the factors that are that still creating this\nFeeling of hopelessness of helplessness in their eyes you know ... you know I Can't speak for their opinion or what have you but it's just something that has come up\nOne eight six six five oh Jim bowl as the we take a call from bin he is on Long Island New York and joins the bull headed Joe good evening bed\nYeah good evening I um [noise] I I wanted to know what you would consider the difference between four thousand Italian immigrants showing up what's Ireland and lights on April ... years ago\nOr four thousand migrants coming to the southern border now twenty eight so what will be the uh the different states especially legally\nOkay well I can certainly give you my answer to that uh my answer would be that\nBut the difference is especially legally\nOkay well I can certainly give you my answer to that my answer would be that are the ones who showed up at Ellis Island\nWent through a process and they weren't just a landing by boat somewhere along the east coast and running a sure they were going through the process which is all the difference in the world as far as I'm concerned a of a ...\nA year and I both know that that process was short or months at best also\nIt was not illegal to enter the country at that time right or they did not have\nThe laws that we have now set up your right or wrong and it was a different process entire gym\nThat is true but nonetheless it is the right of the country to do so I Would even go further and say once your population reaches a certain critical mass it as the obligation of the nation state to determine who gets it when you reached the point where there are a a certain number beyond a certain number of people that are easily absorbed\nThat it is the obligation of the country to decide who should enter the country and how many based on what's in the best interests of that country now granted you go back a century and a quarter maybe say a century and a half into and\nWe had a burgeoning industrial machine that needed a it was very labor intensive did a lot of bodies and we were trying to settle the lands of the of the Old West we needed a lot of warm bodies we don't need as many today\nWould you agree\n[noise] you know um I I think that we still need a lot of bodies in other industries and\nTo generalize or stereotype about population coming in as not being educated not when you said but you know not only that energy patient I did not\nHaving the wherewithal you know when many of these people are very educated\nAnd here's their advantage they will out work us they work\nVery hard my father came to this country work seven days a week All right he worked his hair loss my mother the same thing sometimes he held two jobs but the idea is that\nThere has to be some sort of going back to what I said before there has to be some sort of policy that makes sense that works for both sides of the aisle and nobody's talking to each other gym but when I was talking to each other and we're not progressing as a country\nThat I Would agree more calls to come back in the moment\nFrom a

Missouri we're looking at the Latino vote you're leaving Kelly\nHi thank you very much I had to pull over because I I I didn't want to call and good of vitamins you think I have\nI have about a few things I I just want to get out and number one is I Believe that the person you're interviewing doesn't really say what he would do because he realized the influx of calls that would overwhelm your studio right\nNow I have no reason to believe anything other than candidates a complicated issue and I I assume that what you here's what he thinks so go ahead\nOr the other thing is this is the the things I hear as arguments all the time is that\nWe need to cater to assert nationality in order to make the nationality fit into the America it used to be that people would come to America and put into America because they try really hard to fit the America\nAnd I just don't believe that there were helping ourselves by trying to uh a debate the need of the Latino community in order to get them into this country I think that's why the influx is coming in and the other thing that really gets to me there's no one is putting pressure on these government the way we should\nWe should cut off all tied to these government and allow their people to overthrow those things those governments and change what's happening in their country they have a right to do that and the Catholic Church fill a tremendous amount of pressure right now about what's happening down there\nIf those governments and James what's happening in their country they have a right to do that and the Catholic Church still a

horse or a they don't talk to me anymore but I Would uh uh secretly set something up for each of them about two million apiece and uh also I'm a big animal lover so\nAh here in South Dakota I Would probably try to set up a\nKill a shelter and instead of having volunteers run it to have it the something to where they are paid employees a man that's about all I can\nThink well very good okay

talking about a duel knock it down to even five hundred and fifty million dollars but but you can see what I was talking about earlier it's not easy to spend this kind of money [laughter]\nI Know I don't know uh I Know the movie you're talking about I really enjoyed it and uh it's true you you just don't know how to go about spending that kind of money and if you actually had a plan I think you would probably be a kind of person I wouldn't want to know anyway\nWell you know I as I say I would be very boring but I went about would be buying all kinds of a of a a very a a safe and sound or

week\nPamela Brown and with all due respect to uh Pamela of course he did not say they were all criminals you said that they include criminals just a little parsing of the language that might help to further understand the discussion so we are talking today with a key lay low ratio of the rail wealth management\nAnd are looking at the end something I I Will simply state this as as I see it and I believe that this is accurate whether you dig ditches right or wrong and that is we live in a world of nation states nation states have the absolute right to determine\nOf their own prerogative who gets into their country how many for how long and for whatever reason now there are those of course who who are getting warm and fuzzy feeling about the whole world holding hands and sing income by a I Am not one of those people [noise]\nUh I'm all in favor of immigrants who come to this country by the laws of the land but no one anywhere in this world has the right to enter another country without the country's permission\nOr do you uh take exception do any of that\n[noise] you know [laughter] I I think that the immigration issue is a very complex and complicated issue I think that we should\nHave a better policy on immigration I'm not that it's not strong enough that it shouldn't be definitely more clearer and um that we should be trying also\nThis is our back yard we should be trying to help these countries out there was a lot of the problems I hate to say this but a lot of the problems these countries have\nWere created by us I mean unless Thirteen there from LA they're not from those countries so you know ... it's kind of a double edged\nThing although he was lying to US government policy that created in most Thirteen\n[laughter] of course not of course not only from LA or\nThey they they certainly are and of course ah many of them have gone back and forth and there are those who wind up in other countries who who wind up a a entering this country but I guess the point is simply and I saw this sign by a demonstrator out in California some months back into it it's stuck in my mind\nThe size of the red immigration is a right\nAnd and at the time I remember saying no it is not a right you may argue that you think it ought to be which would at least be a debatable point I Would argue that it is not\nAnd should not be quote a right but a privilege to be conferred by a nation state or depending on what is in the best interest of the nation state but they're calling it right or simply indicates that you really don't know what's going on it isn't a ride a and in my view that it should not be a ride per se\nBut this whole discussion of course is not about immigration and never has been it is about the laws of the land that is to say who enters the country legally and who does not your thoughts\n[noise] you know uh [noise] I think things are changing [noise] you know just a by twenty fifty Hispanics or or you know I actually I don't like the\nTerm Hispanics I like to turn to you know it's more selective apartments or a\nBy twenty fifty ... are we are are warning for one in four ...\nPersons here in the United states aren't going to be Hispanic whether we like to acknowledge that or not if we don't terror policies that address this coming wave because\nWe're seeing families grow here average average Latino families have a lot more\nUh sons and daughters are than an average Anglo a family um but more importantly we use to tailor policies that makes sense that are not cruel and that makes sense going forward for the future that's just an opinion\nOr ended and obviously we are are dealing and opinions will get a few from our audience as well here and they just a few minutes\nAh for example let's take of the case of the uh the children separated from their parents at the border or in my understanding that if we were to come across a parents who are let's say a robbing a bank or that we would probably wind up separating\nThose parents from their children and my response frankly to those people is a\nRap somewhat say harsh but uh this is my view if you don't want to be separated from your children stop breaking into our country there are procedures for entering this country and yet sometimes they are a very lengthy and sometimes they are\nLaden with red tape but a Soviet or that does not give you the right to turn this into the international flight ...\nYour thoughts\n[noise] you know uh for many years uh back in the early Nineteen hundreds there was no illegal immigration\nJohn and I agree with you I think that I I I agree with you to a point but you know for looking at it from\nThe other side of the of the class you have to also say to yourself Seventeen to Twenty years for someone to become a citizen of this country because I've seen that\nYes and I had it I did a show on that and and a lot of ... is not exaggerating that that that is the length of time it takes some people and it's way too long to proceed\nYou know so you know ... in that sense if we could you know if we can get\nBoth sides of the aisles to start having the dialogue started having this conversation no one's ever going to be a hundred percent happy\nBut we sure are going to work and show progress to putting together an immigration that makes sense for every\nNow and again the prospect of this country being a one quarter or one third or more a Latino bothers me not one wit and I suspect most Americans as well provided they came here legally which of course in the case of many would not be the case but this is not\nThe Americans as well provided they came here legally which of course in the case of many would not be the case\nBut this is not about ethnicity or anything other than the laws of the land and ah so anyway the ah the point of course obviously that we'll discuss this in the the next half hour of the program with our guest is is we're talking about the Latino vote\nAnd the midterm elections to what extent is this an issue of for the Latino population are obviously hideous ad issue is an issue for all of us but there are other issues as well a job's a crime of all the other issues that affect everyone\nHow does this fit into the pan of Billy of opinion here will be back in just a moment\n\nWhen it happening here in the valley we're talking about the only live and more than a pioneer valley hand for the pioneer valley the major [noise]\nOne gang or now they're saying either you're going to join our gang or we're going to kill you and we're going to kill your family now this is an extreme case but it is absolutely occurring across Central America and the rule of law\nHas broken down in many of these countries and unfortunately has created a situation that's not tenable for a lot of hardworking individuals on it\nNow than our and not to blame our wheat to blame added we another is how did we create that\nWell a lot of the criminals that were deported during the Reagan Administration\nAre way down to the to their home countries right and the creators syndicate in\nEach one of these countries are to being one of them but that's just one of many that are there and right or wrong it was one of the factors that are that still creating this feeling of hopelessness of helplessness\nIn their eyes you know ... you know I Can't speak for their opinion or what have you but it's just something that has come up\nOne eight six six five oh Jim bowl as though we take a call from bin he is on Long Island New York and joins the bull headed Joe good evening bed\nYeah good evening I um [noise] I I wanted to know what you would consider the difference between four thousand Italian immigrants showing up at Alice island in Nineteen eight ... years ago\nOr four thousand migrants\nTo the southern border now in twenty eight so what will be the er at different ... especially legally\nOkay well I can certainly give you my answer to that uh my answer would be that the the ones who showed up at Ellis Island\nWent through a process and they weren't just a landing by boat somewhere along the east coast and and running a show or they were going through the process which is all the difference in the world as far as I'm concerned a of a ...\nA year and I both know that that process was short\nA months at best also it was not illegal to enter the country at that time right or they did not have the laws that we have now set up your right or wrong and it was a different process entire gym\nThat is true but nonetheless it is the right of the country to do so I Would even go further and say once your population reaches a certain critical mass it as the obligation of a nation state to determine who gets in when you reached the point where there are a a certain number beyond a certain number of people that are easily absorbed\nThat uh it has the obligation of the country to decide who should enter the country and how many based on what's in the best interests of that country now granted you go back a century and a quarter\nMaybe say a century and a half into and we had a burgeoning industrial machine that needed a it was very labor intensive needed a lot of bodies when we were trying to settle the lands of the of the Old West we needed a lot of warm bodies we don't need as many today\nWould you agree\n[noise] you know [noise] um I I think that we still need a lot of bodies in other industries and\nOr stereotype a population coming in as not being educated not what you said but you know not only that education I I did not having the wherewithal you know when many of these people are very educated and here's their advantage they will\nWhere with all you know when many of these people are very educated and here's their advantage they will out work us they work very hard my father came to this country work seven days a week\nRight he worked his hair loss my mother to see things sometimes he held two jobs but the idea is that
