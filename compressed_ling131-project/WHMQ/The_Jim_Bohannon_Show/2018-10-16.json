Gorka you take note of the idea that there are two spectrums of any allergy objective truth and subjective truth I Would contend that while that indeed maybe put forward out there in this world of ours that subjective truth is an oxymoron your thoughts\nYes absolutely totally I I think it was incredibly telling\nI don't know if you're caught this in the cabin or hearing the Democrat Senate the starting with Cory Booker a used the phrase the truth when talking about the testimony from Dr Ford buddies so telling her truth\nThere's no such thing as her truth either the truth or there isn't true so yes this is\nThis is what you get this post modern is on this is the the the construction of the left and the twentieth century whereby there is a denial of objective truth so yes the politics to be divided into two groups\nThose who believe there is one truth and those that believe everything is relative the those that believe that everything is relative um they they create the atrocities of the twenty of them twenty first century\nBut what if I put forward a subjective truth\nThat says that ah every single member\nOf the Democratic party is actually a communist and they were out to destroy the United states\nI mean I don't have to subscribe to that view although I Would concede that in many cases they are certainly pushing policies in that direction but what I just said I wouldn't subscribe do but how would a believer in subjective truth telling me that my subject the truth\nWas wrong but there is this right\nWell you know the best they they'd have to fall into their own trap there'd be no way if they if you believe in the concept of subjective truthful multiple truth there'd be no way for them categorically to deny your accusations so this is\nThis is the ... the two of the whole situation so yes it's it's a very powerful weapon that you can use against the the liberals that spouting it every day\nYou identify Islam as an extremely radical religion certainly as it is practiced in much of the world today that's obviously the case now uh what about those who identify Islam as a a radical political ideology or in Islam is there really a distinction\nWell it depends I mean there's there's the theories as the theology and then there's the practice so the question is what what is the practice if\nIf it's a Muslim who's living in America or or or the behaving in accordance with the U.S constitution then there's the problem if it's a country as such as Bangladesh show or elsewhere\nWhere if the law becomes the legal system where shall real law actually becomes the ... of the land of ... such as Afghanistan than we have a problem because then the the truth that we hold to be self evident the quality of the quality of the sexes\nThese things fall by the wayside so you know blanket statements or a dangerous in this case because we have Muslim allies Jordan is one of our closest as allies but he's a Muslim state but we have to be specific about the context in which country and who we are actually talking about\nOne thing that has bothered me a great deal about where this country finds itself today with the people on the left are pushing harder and harder or to outright a call for socialism I suppose in a way it's an improvement\nThat uh you have people on the left who uh or at least are saying openly what I always suspected they were thinking over the years and that is the socialism is the path to go I Do think that they've overstretched overreached I should say in that regard or is that the term socialism no longer a four letter word in this country\n[noise] [noise] yeah it's a very good question I'm disturbed that in the upcoming midterms\nFor the of the Democratic party candidates have\nOpenly labeled themselves a socialist\nA in a recent poll by the victims of communism foundation more than forty two percent of America millennials said that they would like to live in a socialist or communist America\nThis is incredibly disturbing if you look at the fact that in the last hundred years more than a hundred million people were killed in the name of socialism communism so yeah I think the Democratic party overall the radicals who have taken over the Democrat Party\nHave managed to socialize this word and make it more acceptable than it ever was before\nAnd as we go to a call here I just have to have this ... it seems to me that what we are getting is nothing more than we should have expected we have for about two generations advocated control of the education of our young people to people especially if the College of faculty level in\nMany cases will have an absolute axe to grind and very anti American ideology who are are less and less likely to drive even hide that fact now\nAt a private school it's probably difficult to do a lot about that but in many cases we're talking about faculty who are paid out of state tax dollars and why the chancellor isn't presidents of these universities have not been called before the education committees of every state legislature in America\nAnd demanded to know why such and such and such and such isn't fired if they want to see another penny of state tax dollars is beyond me\n... I I couldn't agree more are we abdicated the schools the high schools and colleges starting in the Nineteen seventies and that's where we are today so if you want to understand how somebody as absurd as dangerous as Bernie Saunders\nBecomes popular in America it's because we allow the education system to be taken over by the radicals\nTo David in Cedar Rapids Iowa the boy had an show with Dr Sebastian Gorka hello David\nL A chance that hey you guys mentioned earlier that there is a subject of ... or\nPeople are given a chance to work up to their abilities\nPeople will share their paycheck swimming not money by the amount that they earn in a way and there's some great pride surrounding all of that make sense inside a little money and go to the baseball game any stigma than I might of attacks them has melted well\nPeople regardless [noise] pretty much my eyes were all very similar\nTo W.

looking at solutions\nTo health care problem that has not gone away Obamacare was still on the ropes of the Republican Congress was such an could do nothing seems about health care and yet the problem persists and it's a very real problem for many many people Lawrence calls in from champagne Illinois hello Lawrence\nThat ending gentleman I can you time more orientation here is genie see is that sort of like a political candidates except you're selling ideas about health care\nWell first of all his GDP or and this was as good a time as any to have been some explaining exactly what GDP advisors is\nLawrence thanks for the question always like doubting our company or we are a consulting firm we traditionally help advocate on behalf of employers\nAs well as patients and members of the healthcare system to try to navigate so what is often times very confusing system to do so so our clients normally are corporations that are trying to help their employees find more cost effective ways to help navigate the system\nOr I was there anything else that you are you wanted to ask you about Lawrence\nThat's good I think I can make my contribution now um [noise] I basically I'm a physician by the way I basically agree health care prices are crazy high\nUh I also just ... allies in psychiatry now back in the days when I charge thirty and thirty five and forty dollars for the committed our I actually made more money that way than over the years as it went higher and higher\nA I Want to\nExpress my consternation and and and lack of understanding of what on earth happen there are those are days when I was very busy and I didn't pay any attention accept doing my therapy keeping up\nMentally a medically competent and and my ordinary life but everything went off the screen and maybe have some insights but um I Want to make a point here that\nOnce upon a time I think the medical world was more\nUh\nLike I was able to do it in the early days my practice or the people were coming in the hiring me it was their our it was their time they could talk about whatever they wanted it was my job to try to keep the ball rolling in a constructive way that was going to help\nThem resolve the problems that they originally came to me for but still\nThey were in charge in that respect I think\nThat's different than what your gentleman that we're talking about a yet I'm quite knowledgeable about the BPA ca and I understand the need to help corporations figure out how to uh buy health care for their employees and I'll be quiet now and listen I have another idea or two but\n... okay well let's let's get the better the second or ... so stay on the line but to your response or substance and\nWell there's a couple of things and when we're when a wry we've started to see that go I go back to the first part of your question or comment Lawrence which was you know back in the day it seems different than it does today and that she has back in the day it was different\nUm as as we continue to monetize the healthcare system from a business perspective I've now\nYou you know we can actually draw very clear and close parallels to what we saw in the banking system by two thousand eight we had the banking system a consolidated into a level of what we consider to be too big to fail\nWe're seeing that same thing uh her in the healthcare system now health care systems are run by doctors any longer run by Wall Street run by businessmen\nAnd and and the challenges that we have here is that we continue to see consolidation used to use it you would have an insurance company in conflict with a hospital system or a doctor system trying to negotiate contracts and reduce the cost of health care they're no longer doing that\nAre actually working together and working together because the health as a as a result of the Affordable CARE Act insurance companies are are limited on the margin of profit her the AC a at Fifteen Percent now if I'm a CFO and a CEO\nOf a Wall Street based organization and I'm limited to a Fifteen Percent margin I Want Fifteen Percent of a million dollars or Fifteen Percent of a billion dollars\nBecause my fiduciary responsibility is to my shareholder not to the patient the by my product and this is part of the challenge we have in the healthcare system where the finance companies ... responsibility\nIs to the shareholder not to the consumer and so we started to see this move when I got into this business over Twenty years ago there were over twenty health insurance companies in Texas where I live today there's four\nSo as the consolidation of the market has occurred and fewer insurance companies are in the market\nAnd they've gobbled up the market share and now they're going to a hospital systems and working in a line that used to you have a doctor and network with one maybe to insurance companies now every doctors and network with almost every insurance company so this idea that insurance companies have the ability to utilize leveraged\nBring down the cost of health care is it true at all discounts don't matter anymore prices do [noise]\nAll right uh the say the least that covers quite a bit of a thing that you would like to add to that Lawrence\nWell or I can add and bring up the the second point a San jose is a thing or\nThere's something strange about a a doctor's\nTurning over the running of hospitals to people called hospital administrators are most hospital administrators have a bachelor's degree or they couldn't ever get into medical school yet or doctors who are no more and are smarter actually let these people run the entire\nBall of wax now related to that I think is the need to get these costs down hospitals are even worse than a doctor prices are they and and the\nOil and they were coming up on a break here that doesn't move I Do want to hear what you have to say but we're going to have to pause to do it after these messages\n\nWhen bad winter here is that

therefore they Rob Peter to pay ...\nAre you are you still be talking about the practice of taking money out of the Social Security trust fund which of course has been done for a wide variety of things and in fact a lot of people think that there is a in fact an account someplace with all of that uh\nThat cycle withholding when in fact there's nothing there but in Iowa you so I'll I'll address that question with our guest the ...\n[noise] well listen I mean yeah this is [laughter] it definitely has been the practice of the federal government for the last goodness multiple decades um to to look to move the money around and and effectively just rack up the debt let's look at the national debt right now\nA Social Security and and\nAnd even Medicare for that matter is is\nReally insolvent if you actually look at the way it's structured now and the money that's going out while it may have cash in the coffers from a standpoint of we we the government reports that there's money to cover these things it is very true that they move money around in different ways they're barring\nAgainst the defense fund and a number of other things to make sure that there's enough money to pay for one thing that they've committed to and this is again going back to the well we talked about in the first segment why Medicare for all\nA would be effectively just a massive uh the only way to do it would be to massively collect taxes and continue to borrow\nA with a baby boomer generation where they are with life expectancy doing what it is doing and that's the thing Medicare and Social Security we're not originally set up to be this ongoing thing Social Security was originally created to ensure that the American citizen didn't outlive their retirement savings\nRight and so but we distorted that in a way that now because of the advancements of modern medicine which are good we're outliving the system or at least the system the way it was set up and unfortunately this is just

the national Intelligence Council\nHis previous book is defeating jihad the winnable war and the\nOne eight six six five oh jumbo is our number\nDr Gorka you take note of the idea that there are two spectrums of ideology objective truth and subjective truth I Would contend that while that indeed maybe put forward out there in this world of ours that subjective truth is an oxymoron your thoughts\nYes absolutely totally I I think it was incredibly telling a though if you're caught this in the cabin or hearing the Democrat said at the starting with Cory Booker\nA used the phrase the truth when talking about the tests the Monday from Dr fooled buddies so telling her truth\nThere's no such thing as her truth either the truth or there isn't true so yes this is this is what do you get this is post modernism this is the the the construction of the left and the twentieth century whereby there is a denial of uh\nWhat's going to be divided into two groups those who believe there is one truth and those that believe everything is relative the those that believe that everything is relative um they they create the atrocities of the twenty ... twenty first century\nBut what if I put forward a subjective truth\nThat says that ah every single member of the Democratic party is actually a communist and they were out to destroy the United states I mean I don't have to subscribe to that view although I Would to concede that in many cases they are certainly pushing policies in that direction but when I just said I wouldn't subscribe to\nBut how was it was a believer in subjective truth telling me that my subjective truth\nWas wrong but there's this right\nWell you know the best they they'd have to fall into their own trap there'd be no way if they if you believe in the concept of subjective truth for multiple truth there'd be no way for them categorically to deny your accusations so this is\nThis is the ... the two of the whole situation so yes it's it's a very powerful weapon that you can use against the the liberals the spouting it every day\nYou identify Islam as an extremely radical religion certainly as it is practiced in much of the world today that's obviously the case now uh what about those who identify Islam as a a radical political ideology or in Islam is there really a distinction\nWell it depends I mean this does the theories as the theology and then there's the practice so the question is what what is the practice if\nIf it's a Muslim who's living in America or or or the behaving in accordance with the U.S constitution then there's no problem if it's a country as such as Bangladesh show or elsewhere\nWhere it's ... becomes the legal system where shall real law actually becomes the ... of the land of ... such as Afghanistan than we have a problem because then the the truth that we hold to be self evident the quality of the quality of the sexes\nThese things fall by the wayside so you know blanket statements ah a dangerous in this case because we have Muslim allies Jordan is one of our closest allies but as a Muslim state but we have to be specific about the context in which country and who we are actually talking about ...\nBut one thing that has bothered me a great deal about where this country finds itself today with the people on the left are pushing harder and harder or do outright a call for socialism I suppose in a way it's an improvement\nThat uh you have people on the left who uh or at least are saying openly what I always suspected they were thinking over the years and that is the socialism is the path to go I Do think that they overstretched overreached I should say in that regard or is that the term socialism no longer a four letter word in this country\n[noise] [noise] yeah it's a very good question I I Am disturbed that in the upcoming midterms\nFor the of the Democrat Party candidates have\nOpenly labeled themselves a socialist\nOr in a recent poll by the victims of communism foundation more than forty two percent of America millennials said that they would like to live in a socialist or communist America\nThis is incredibly disturbing if you look at the fact that in the last hundred years more than a hundred million people were killed in the name of socialism communism so yeah I think the Democratic party or rather the radicals who have taken over the Democrat body\nI've managed to socialize this word and make it more acceptable than it ever was before\nAnd as we go to a call here I just have to have this it seems to me that what we are getting is nothing more than we should have expected we have for about two generations\nAdvocated control of the education of our young people to people especially if the College of faculty level in many cases have an absolute axe to grind and an very anti American ideology who are are less and less likely to try to even hide that fact now\nAt a private school it's probably difficult to do a lot about that but in many cases we're talking about faculty who are paid out of state tax dollars and why the chancellor of the presidents of these universities have not been called before the education committees of every state legislature in America\nAnd demanded to know why such and such and such and such is inspired if they want to see another penny of state tax dollars is beyond me\n... I I couldn't agree more are we abdicated the schools the high schools and colleges\nStarting in the Nineteen seventies and that's where we are today so if you want to understand how somebody is absurd and as dangerous as Bernie Saunders becomes popular in America it's because we allowed the education system to be taken over by the radicals\nTo David in Cedar Rapids Iowa the bull headed show with Dr Sebastian Gorka hello David\nHell of a chance to ask hey you guys had mentioned earlier that there is a subject of truth in that check check check and", "show_name": "The Jim Bohannon Show", "year": "2018", "city": "Greenfield", "day": "16"}
