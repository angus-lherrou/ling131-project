uh\nIt's always been holders value for me uh it's it's really a stayed the same market terrier aided in the last year and I was wanting to know if\nIt if he feels it's still a place to hold value\nI think of it as an insurance policy okay if it's against disaster but that's been going down because when interest rates go up gold goes down after many other commodities and interest rates have been going up and looks like they're going to go up higher and that's been hurting go go gotten over Thirteen hundred dollars announced\nNow it's roughly twelve hundred dollars announce even lower than that so I I don't think it's going anywhere anytime soon I mean we've had all kinds of disasters of the world and gold is not growing up it's just not what it used to be if anything bitcoins become a new\nKind of safety valve and even that haven't been working lately as well so have a little bit as an insurance policy but I don't see go going up dramatically anytime soon\nWhat about other a precious metals platinum or silver\nUm all the same silver has gone down dramatically a platinum is kind of a a a place a play on a kind of like converters I guess I'm so car sales have been getting weaker right wing so none of depression smells really been doing much they all get hurt by rising interest rates Jim\nOkay very good thanks for your call Steve appreciate that very much and I might add thanks for your services well now a\nThis is one of the little economic lessons I learned I guess a classic example of a little bit of knowledge is a dangerous thing but that is that in uncertain times that gold another ... precious metals will go up a but I gather there are exceptions to that\nYeah well I mean these are uncertain times although I'm some ways they're good times I mean the economy is doing these like we got all kinds of potential problems with China and so on\nBut I mean this is not a time like two thousand eight when you know it looks like the whole world is going to be falling apart [laughter] so ah no goal just isn't doing well it's it really is a direct correlation with\nA interest rates and I mean the federal service raised rates are loud and long term interest rates have gone up dramatically and the ten year treasury has now over three point two percent\nIt started about two point one percent so it's not a big move up pretty short sharply and I think it's going to go maybe the three and a half percent by the end of the year that was all bad for gold silver platinum unwed him\nBut ... do you see a hit list race going much beyond that\nYes I Do I think we're in the beginning of a major long term bond fair market\nWe've ... basically had a thirty five year bond bull market where bond interest rates peak at about fourteen percent of the Nineteen eighty two\nAnd they went down the absolute though was about one and three quarters in the middle of two thousand Seventeen and since then it's gone up to three point to\nAnd I think it's
