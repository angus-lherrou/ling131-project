heavy general counsel\nAnd director of the center for the American future at the Texas Public policy foundation what lessons do you think we should have learned will get down to whether or not we have limited but but out of this debacle but we've gone through what lessons do you think we should have learned\nI think the lesson that we are learning now is the importance of standing or ground I mean with with this president ah you know you have in back in the navy that may be and pass administrations would have been cold\nAnd I think the the gold the strategy of the left had never thought that the Republicans would hold their ground and actually stay and from behind the nominee\nOr the pressure would be so great that ah he would have to withdraw the or she would have with Charles himself and so in the face of these vicious attacks on them and as\nA stellar reputation had an amazing career as a a jurors to judge the lesson here is that uh we conservative stood there grilled pendant right outcome was achieved and that needs to be a less than ... Ford\nShoe have courage and the convictions that uh our leadership and DC are dared represented\nIn reality can you foresee a time and let's say the next five or ten years when a a a major nominee like the Supreme Court nominee will be able to receive more than four or five votes from the other party\nI Hope we'll get there I I Do I think we'll get there quicker than that\nAnd then my my prediction is that actually the next Supreme Court justice will will get that kind of back to the bipartisan consideration that used to be traditional with the Supreme Court and I'll tell you why\nIs I think with judge Kavanaugh's confirmation to justice this takes in the last forty years of the Supreme Court being a toss up when it came to super judicial activism\nAnd that with this justice being confirmed not that\nYou know the other side is always going to win but what's going to prevail this law the law and the constitution and I think with that recognition you will see\nA less and hopefully end or the last attempt to hit the homerun cases to create brand new rights that brand do\nA protections that were never intended by by our constitution and so\nWith the next justice than with is already established as the new status quo the return to the respect for the bullet law or that there won't be so much at stake that you won't have hundreds of people getting arrested the capital over the nominee\nBecause we won't be in such a high stakes game anymore\nFor the judiciary for the highest court in the land and so maybe we can get back to considering the merits of candidates based on there and here it's to the law to respect for the constitution the qualifications of their record and we won't have these cases that make you know\nEvery single nominee a life or death fight partisan fight for the the ...\nRight I Would hope that you're correct I I don't know if I'm terribly optimistic but one thing the whole notion of the judiciary has essentially governments umpire calling balls and strikes that's constitutional ... constitutional\nThere are an awful lot of people out there and unfortunately who don't really care how you get where you're going to the end justifies the means I don't care what the constitution it was only written by a bunch of dead old white guys and they all own slaves and the vet center and so on a\nThey don't care about that sort of thing they care only about getting their way and that means as I said earlier a lifetime tenured unelected legislators that's fine with them were not in many cases talking about very principled individuals' here\nWell that's right and that say a symptom or a sickness that it's come from the federal government that's way out of control but this guy we're way beyond a government of limited enumerated powers that was a dish and by the founding fathers and\nYou know one thing and the overall theme of this administration has been in the ministry ration that it's been looking at cutting regulation and decrease in size empower the government being fought\nInch by inch every step along the way a but here I think in the way the judiciary is being transformed it's putting men and women in place that have that commitment and are rejecting this idea that you\nKnow every court case needs to be a policy victory how about we just have a court case that is correct all the law and that's what we expect to ...\nWell I'm certainly with you are of course if that were to happen we would probably need to do a certain extent to be teaching young people\nTo feel that way and that's another area that I I Want to get into with the Rob had Mickey and that is the extent to which we have taught\nYoung people to not only be have him in the the vicious and the self centered a bill mattered way that we have seen but there's also to to recognize that free speech is important to them at the your feelings if they get hurt by somebody else says\nWell grow up to develop a thicker skin a though

lessons do you think we should have learned will get down to whether or not we have a minute but but out of this debacle that we've gone through what lessons do you think we should have learned\nI think the lesson that we are learning now is the importance of standing or ground I mean with with this president ah you know you asked him back and all the way that maybe in past administrations would have been cold\nAnd I think the the gold the strategy has left had never thought that the Republicans would hold their ground and actually stay and from behind the nominee\nOr that the pressure would be so great that uh he would've withdraw the or she would have with Charles himself and so in the face of these vicious attacks on and as\nA a stellar reputation had an amazing career as a a jurors to judge the lesson here is that uh we conservatives stood their ground\nAnd that right outcome was achieved and that needs to be a lesson moving forward to have courage and the convictions that uh our leadership and DC are dared represent\nIn reality can you foresee a time in let's say the next five or ten years when a a a major nominee like the Supreme Court nominee will be able to receive more than four or five votes from the other party\nI Hope we'll get there I I Do I think we'll get there\nQuicker than that and then my my prediction is that actually the next Supreme Court justice will will get that kind of back to bipartisan consideration that used to be traditional with the Supreme Court and I'll tell you why\nIs I think with judge Kavanaugh's confirmation to justice this takes in the last forty years of the Supreme Court being a toss up when it came to super judicial activism\nAnd that with this justice being confirmed not that\nYou know the other side is always going to win but what's going to prevail this all the law and the constitution and I think with that recognition\nYou will see a less and hopefully end or the last attempt to hit these home run cases to create brand new rights to the brand do\nAh protections that were never intended by by our constitution and so\nWith the next justice than with is already established as the new status quo the return to the respect for the rule of law or that there won't be so much at stake it you won't have hundreds of people getting arrested the capital over the nominee\nBecause we won't be in such a high stakes game anymore\nFor the judiciary for the highest court in the land and so maybe we can get back to considering the merits of candidates based on there and here it's to the law that respect for the constitution the qualifications of their record and we won't have these cases that make you know\nEvery single nominee a life or death fight hardest and fight for the the ... versus the right\nI Would hope that you're correct I I don't know if I'm terribly optimistic but one thing the whole notion of the judiciary as essentially governments umpire calling balls and strikes that's constitutional that's not constitutional\nThere are an awful lot of people out there unfortunately who don't really care how you get where you're going to the end justifies the means I don't care what the constitution it was only written by a bunch of dead old white guys and they all own slaves and the vet center and so on\nA they don't care about that sort of thing they care only about getting their way and if that means as I said earlier a lifetime tenured unelected legislators that's fine with them were not in many cases talking about very principled individuals here\nWell that's right and that say a Sin Nombre a sickness that it's come from the federal government that's way out of control but this guy we're way beyond a government of limited enumerated powers that was ... by the founding fathers and\nYou know one thing and the overall theme of this administration has been in the ministry ration that it's been looking at\nRegulation and decreasing the size and power the government being\nThought inch by inch every step along the way a but here I think in the way the judiciary is being transformed it's putting\nMen and women in place that have that commitment at are rejecting this idea that you know every court case needs to be a policy victory how about we just have a court case that is correct all the law and that's what we expect to ...\nWell I'm certainly with you uh of course if that were to happen we would probably need to do a certain extent to be teaching young people\nOr to feel that way and that's another area that I I wanted to get into with Rob heh Mickey and that is the extent to which we have taught\nYoung people to not only be have him in the the vicious and the self centered and Neal mattered way but we have seen but it also to to
