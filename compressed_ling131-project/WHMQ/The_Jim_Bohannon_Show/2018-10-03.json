nationalist sub is my basic books and build a we have a call from Helene she's in Inglewood Florida to joined us this evening hello relaying and welcome to have you with us\nAnything uh you know I think on this subject or read I think you know the two wars that stuck out to me was tranquility and as\nYou mentioned as we had our nation America\nThat supposed to be one nation by did as hot as well and and intensifying with the low ... issues whether it's the cabinet off or immigration or Republican or Democrat\nI Want to bring on a ship is an independent state it's like when you have to make a law of their own now we should look at her own United States\nAnd say OK currently I'm living in Florida because Republicans have a certain philosophy of the way they would like to see things yeah\nMaybe we should make Florida simply a Republican state\nDemocrats have a certain way with which they like to see things yeah I don't know whether they care about the environment or support abortion or what have you maybe we should make 'em Texas Democratic state\nAnd maybe if we had each individual said have this democratic philosophy for Republican philosophy people that have those philosophies belonging to Democrats or Republicans could live in that state and there wouldn't be all this animosity and great Yvonne\nWell then as soon as the course of the people who are extremely mobile and and also assumes that we can simply dictate what state is now granted election returns may so indicate\nEr which direction the state goes but uh the notion of of officially establishing some things are and how would you feel if Florida was determined to be the opposite of you what are you going to just pack up and leave\nI Would say that there would be more peace in tranquility in a state that whoever supported\nThe the ... the weather the ball abortion or offer abortion people living in that state certainly wouldn't be much happier and it wouldn't be in my opinion it much more productive state\nWhere most people have much closer ties to localities and bad I mean he grabs your quite willing to do move wherever whenever but other people have\nFamilies they have the jobs they have the traditions and and the like and and they would not certainly it would not be all peaceful if suddenly all the Republicans are in\nUh Florida in let's say removed to Georgia or something where you where are you going to do to the point of a gun I mean I mean it it just ... honestly lean strikes me is just a tad unrealistic really\nAs long as you have a free society now of course if you are if you didn't have a free society and that would be very simple but\nPeople are much lower than they used\nTo be non non some are some many or not\nI mean don't you think that's a matter of choice and one's individual white it's kinda like if they don't like it up north 'cause it's cold don't they moved down south\nOh they can but you're talking about the forcibly moving them\nOh no no I'm not saying for moving them it would be\nGoing to move [laughter]\nWell that they're going to be happy where they live well\nBut they're they're going to be more unhappy if they they feel like they've got to leave their their view I think would be fine somebody wants to leave lift the others leave\nAgain that would be an optional thing either they can choose to me well let's just say that what support their value systems are just the ... or choose to be unhappy because hey\nBut of course you know election returns will change what a given state happens to do and then that's kind of an American viewpoint or so you know again uh I'm not sure that I see that as as a solution do you draw the lessons from it to your um\nWell I I I think he'll win raises an important historical point the United states was\nOr as you know originally Thirteen independent independent countries briefly and the is it the deal that brought the United states together under the constitution was a was a deal that was supposed to allow\nExactly the kind of very very significant differences in a state character that Helene is talking about\nSo all all of us are look back and are appalled at the at the question of of slavery but we we tend to forget that for example Massachusetts and Connecticut at the time of the founding\nA had established churches and we're we're very proud of their of their puritan tradition as being part of the public character and culture of the states and that didn't mean that anybody was forced to leave those states have just messed up if\nIf you wanted to live and that that kind of a place then then you would live in Massachusetts in Connecticut and if you wanted to live someplace else than you'd you'd probably moved to New York\nAnd um it it is\nInteresting that over over the last two hundred years United States you can say has moved more and more towards a enforced\n... trying to force all the states to be the same and as I say I think it's very understandable on the issue of of slavery [noise] um but but when you get to a\nWell I wasn't sure if you're going to finish that thought but the clocks gonna make you feel they should go after this break\n\nWhen bad weather can be tough to back when when you leave you with the twenty storm deep and what are you a chance one on one [noise] drying\nAnd the theory of a world like that is is that different nations will have different forms of government some of them were not going to like so you you you read a lot in in the American press these days about uh about a Hungary Poland Israel Italy criticizing these countries and saying well that that\nThey're not they're not being government the way we want them to be governed\nBut that's exactly the point the point is that\nIf if Americans going to be a nation state and national state and it doesn't want others to to interfere in its elections in to tell us what to do than hard partly it has to allow other countries the freedom to determine their own course and so there's a certain ah humility\nIn that saying we don't necessarily have the the answers that we can dictate to every other country in the world invading Iraq and uh helping determinant new constitution there didn't work out so well some may may be may be American doesn't have\nPat answers for how every other country should be governed\nAre obviously quite quite frankly there are some countries out there that just really aren't aren't fit for self governance and it'd be kind of a free status or culturally they are simply unprepared for that the I Wonder if some languages even have the the word compromise in them I I seriously doubt an Arabic includes the word ... receipt\nOr because of the of the uh the the way that the many aspects of their culture a proceed so\nUh I think that there was a much greater recall probably for this kind of think back when the United nations consisted of a a lot of Western European democracies and we were willing to look the other way for the the Soviet Union and then suddenly all they had the the big\nBreak out of a of a colonial is a a areas of became nations after the Nineteen sixties and we suddenly saw the the likes of Libya leading me the United Nations Human rights council\nAnd we realized that the total of ... of of the notion quite frankly I think the the the widespread growth of independent nations is probably what do the United nations because you you have within the United nations today what may be out of a hundred and Ninety some countries you've got maybe what\nFifty or sixty that could be considered the genuinely a fit for free self governance\nYou know most of those countries but the ones that you're saying are are fit our our country is in which there is an overwhelming majority of assert a single national group within the country and ah the\nThe ones that are not said are you you you're talking to a large large portions of a of a Africa and Asia\nAnd look at look at the orders higher swath of the predominantly Arabic countries from Morocco or eastward and then once you leave by the Arabic countries just going to predominantly Islamic countries many of those are are very monolithic ally of one the culture and uh the the the armpit of the planet\nI mean uh whereas the United states and relatively pluralistic place I mean\nI'm pretty sure that that's a that that is Sunni Arab propaganda\nIf you actually take most of those countries and take a look at what's in them or you'll see that they're in not at all monolithic I mean in in North Africa you have thirty million Berbers who have their own language and their own culture and our suppressed\nIn in ... countries like a ... ...

that a judge Kavanaugh is confirmed as suggested to the Supreme Court because I Believe\nVery strongly that we need more justices who believe in the constitution and I just this is the lead and creating a legislature legislation to match their political views\nAgree absolutely and now it's really like you said you you touched on the very reason why Brett Kavanaugh is facing all of this opposition it's because he believes just as you do and as I Do and that scares the daylights out of people who abused judges\nAnd Supreme Court justices as life time tenured unelected legislators\nI agree the other thing I wanted to say my my strong feelings I Believe that for many years I was very open minded listened to both sides Democrat and Republican of arguments voted for the person I felt was best ... probably the job\nThen I started to watch things like Bill Clinton and his shenanigans Hillary Clinton and her I'm truthfulness Mr Obama and his son truthfulness and now\nI have a very hard time if not totally cannot believe or respect any things\nThat a democratic legislature has to say\nWell unfortunately that seems to be the case for me as well I'm Sorry to say Norma a it's a it's the direction that party has gone and I I regret that see even Andrew North Carolina and the good to have you on Steve\nHey ... ... ... um\nFor the people that are wondering you know highly it's

though she hadn't heard anything from her and quite a good while\nShe hasn't been quite a prominent as she was there for a while but it's certainly true\nYou know why they ... they called it the shit up\nWell I'll go this way if I had been a person that I thought at any influence over her head and I'd been a Democrat I would've said you know you're you are every time you open your mouth you're you're adding a few thousand more Republican votes now I wasn't going to get a person who would tend to ah\nAnother kind of person who would tend to ah shall we say a buckle under she loves to see on

[laughter]\n[noise]\nWe're speaking with Mark Felt a British base historian the author of ... some books as late as being ghost writers published by the capo subtitled when us a German soldiers fought together to save the world's most beautiful horses in the last days of World War two and we haven't really gotten into this into great detail but uh\nWe should point out I suppose of the importance of these horses just from the standpoint of if you will breeding stock because I gather that is why the Germans had them in the first place right\nYes absolutely they'll if it's on a breed or very very special breed of a white holes are found in the end of the Spanish riding school they have been carefully bred for hunting but severe hunger is\nAn empire or they performed a very special kind of a display which has known as high schooling of horses um is a very very stylized and of course if you go to the end as today you can see this they ... the palace and uh that bloodline was absolutely pure and the Germans grabbed the whole says\nWith the intention of feeding them into a program to create if you live in an area in a kind of super whole for the gentleman army\n[laughter] absolutely unbelievable but but nonetheless that was the circumstances that occurred so these words is at ... at the at great important from the standpoint of just go to those who love horses but also from the German point of view of the master race even to and including forces themselves so\nAs as we were telling the story or the Americans have reached the location of the horses and they're going to have to convert German trucks\nIn order to transport them back to American lines and the in the meantime I gather that the fanatic German SS forces have not been inactive and they are suddenly aware of the presence of Americans behind German lines\nThat is correct says you have this little outpost of the U.S army twenty miles behind the German lines or the the other German troops in the area where of what's going on the most of them have stood down\nUnder leaving them alone however there is an ss unit moving up which has been defeated elsewhere in that coming up in groups of several hundred or and they said this has some kind of a red flag to a bowl or some kind of opportunity and they launch a couple of consented attacks\nOn the uh the little town which has defended by only you know a couple of hundred Americans is very light weapons in a small vehicles\nAnd uh they have to fight them off and they have a couple of\nFatty a serious battles is yes has had managed to break it and of course it would have led to a ... I'm On the other thing is it leads to the creation of something called steel its foreign legion which is the interesting part of the story\nOf believes the limits learned more about stewards foreign legion\nWell they also say it was left in Columbus guy called a captain told us to it and uh you know he's in the office so he's right combat experience but he's left with a really difficult situation\nIs simply doesn't have enough men to defend the town in the ... so he looks around and of course when they came in they all say liberated some allied POWs there was some Americans\nBrits poll subs French\nExcept for and they've been working with the whole says for some years\nAnd he is able to um some of those were captured Jon their weapons but it's still not enough men so he intends eventually into the German prisoners that they have taken and um he re arms field expedient\nA quite a number of German soldiers and then a man checkpoints alongside\nEx POWs and us soldiers and of course this is known to steal its foreign legion where you throw the costs accent as well into this tiny on contacts and of course when they uh S. S. actually attack it is Americans fighting shoulder to shoulder with German and British POWs and contacts and everybody else\nTo defending the stand or the townspeople and of course the ah ah the women and children of the stuff so it's an after him ... story\nThis foreign legion that this was a collection of people who if you put them all together in a bar or some place you would take very many drinks before some of these people were going at each other's throats\nIn the in in this period of intense pressure or were they able to get them to do work together without killing each other\nI think the ... was that ten they rule in in this together the whole says where that ticket out if they would ask behind they would fall into Soviet captivity the Germans could expect to a nice trip to Siberia and I do like\nA it's not being shot on the spot or for the others of course ah they just want to get out and get back to the American line so the horse has become the ... of the men and women and children that are also there as well so it's very complex\nOn top of that we have one more play we haven't mentioned which has the each episode back a Communist Party his hands will also operating in the forest they would like to snatch these whole says as well because they see them as being checked prophecy because they are on ... land so we had another added die mentioned to this as well\nDid they manage to to get in the way of the operation these the check Mart as\nThey try to as the Americans were taking them out they manage some road blocks on the very edge of check territory on the very end border and a couple of American officers had a real showdown with a gun in this World Cup and loaded and pointed\nAnd it was you know in case of who I think fast fortunately they for everybody the checks playing fast tend to allow the Americans but that German or allies and everybody else to pass through the whole says into safety in the area\nWe have concentrated on the horses are a unique part of the story but of course as you noted the American forces discovered a lot of humans there as well refugees and the like did the everybody a person's horses do they all managed to get out safely\nKennel read them initially didn't want to take out refugees because he thought it was a military operation but then when he ... he came up himself a couple of days later and he saw the plight of these people and he decided that he would turn a blind eye to what was going on and if they could join this great long straggling call on the people\nWhich was code name operation cowboy to move these papal horses and everybody else into Bavaria\nThat will be old well and good because\nYou know a lot of these people are well sedate and Germans and they had a either been born in the area or move there on the Nazi occupation the checks hated them and the checks for the time and to get rid of these people out of Czechoslovakia and a wife enough for the wall was quite a few unpleasant massacres and a lot of victimization so\nThese people want it out as fast as possible into the west\nNow at this point of course the U.S and Soviet Union were still technically allies the Cold War had not be gone but I gather that this incident with the ghost writers began what we uh my calling I suppose the the period of post war irritation between the two\n... no fire or go to match dot Gov slash

contentious issues and asked if they're voting intentions had changed\nIn the national poll initial nine point edge for Democrats was reduced to two points by the end of the survey the poll among voters and competitive districts expanded a negligible GOP edge of less than a single percentage Boyd up to a five point advantage\nThe change came after hard edged questions which sought to portray Donald Trump as a disruptor of a state's assailed status quo\nAnd the Democrats as the party of open borders impeachment and pillows say for example one question asked respondents whether they believe

Florida where there are hot races galore is a Michael's calling in this evening hello Michael\nHello I I like to say that the battle of ideas isn't just between Republicans and Democrats\nIt's between Republican voters and the Republican Party\nI'm a Republican I Love Donald Trump\nAnd I feel betrayed by the Republican Party and that is why Donald Trump was able to steal the Republican Party from the Republican nomination from the Republican establishment\nWe have a trillion dollar deficit to share with it in a booming economy the Republicans campaigns on on fiscal responsibility they promise to defund Planned Parenthood and they did it why should people vote for Republicans I Love Donald Trump and all the good things in our country\nIs because of what Donald Trump is done through executive action\nYeah but he could only do so many things by executive action and he did get his tax cut through a and there have been other things not as many we would hope that I have to ask you one other thing Michael before I turn this over two miles damage\nIf you are a deficit hawk as am I\nGood heavens Donald Trump has never said anything about the federal deficit reduction he's big on on reducing the or the trade deficit\nBut on on the the whole notion you go back to the primaries of two years ago when when there were Seventeen Republicans running and Trump would be in the middle of the stage with his standing in the polls need look to his left and he looked who's right and you would say all these people are going to cut your entitlements but not me\nI mean as a as a deficit hawk I'm I'm rather surprised at that you are somewhat disappointed in the president\nI think he should have vetoed that omnibus spending bill I really do but the Republicans have a a responsibility to not drive our country into bankruptcy and they're not doing that and again they promise to defund Planned Parenthood\nAnd are there it's really disappointing and I think this is going to be like two thousand and six in some ways because they haven't delivered they really have it\nWell that'll certainly help the president out a lot of a lot of people and I'm assuming you mark considering including yourself\nA sit on your hands and allow the the demographic to take off as he's done about all he can do with executive orders you've Democrats said either house the Republican and then just to say the Trump agenda is effectively dead\nOr at least there's always hope there's always hope with the Republican control of Congress that you can get more things past like the tax cuts\nThe one thing that would make me feel better and my congressman we come out and say I would I Will support a member of the Freedom Caucus like Mark meadows to be speaker of the house I don't want another John ... or I don't want to Paul Ryan and uh you know that\nI feel about an athlete below sea so I think we have everything either the obvious how you feel about Nancy Pelosi will lead to that to his Democratic opponent is going to support\nI mean you always a rational voter always votes for the better option available something to keep in mind bears I during this do a ... I suspect that the discussion that Michael and I just had as a microcosm of millions of such discussions all around the country right now and I oh\nYeah absolutely and I don't know ... is Michael can I speak to make all or do we feel free to go right ahead speak to my home here hey Michael I'm just curious because what you've said go too closely to what we've been talking to bite in the show so far\nAre there do would you be willing to say are you willing or you inclined to vote for the Republican candidate in your local district or do the last person is sufficiently pro Trump or the Republicans ... he is not", "show_name": "The Jim Bohannon Show", "year": "2018", "city": "Greenfield", "day": "03"}
