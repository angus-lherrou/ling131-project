is Carter been there a court room that a capital\nThan in all the decisions he made you know using one thing you see what I mean\nHe is using one thing and and again I'm I'm curious how Jimmy Carter would react if such charges have been thrown at him I've interviewed Carter so I don't even have to to ask that rhetorical question I Know how we would react\nHe would react uh very intensely would probably out Kevin Cavanaugh in that regard not to mention a although we we should in this context the cabinet wrote an apology that appeared in the op ed pages of the wall Street Journal saying that

year with a medical officer from the Centers for Disease Control doctor leads the gross cause a lot of uh what are we expecting this year\nI Wish I could say I'm we wish we could say uh we can never really predict for the coming season\nWhat it's going to be like how severe it is going to be right now it's it's just too early typically in the United states um flu activity begins to pick up in the fall around October um but right now we just can't predict what the coming seasons going to be like and that's one of the reasons it's important to get vaccinated every year because we can never know how serious it's going to be\nExact and for those who say well uh I was ... last year I was vaccinated in twenty Thirteen but it's something they need to realize and that is a a flu virus was a very sneaky food miffed jeeps changing honest\nYeah they are really little wonders and in terms of how they change and flu viruses change constantly um and\nThat's one of the reasons that in most seasons as we move from one season into the next the vaccine has changed to reflect what is thought to be the thing that we're going to be seen most of in the coming season um so that's one of the reasons to point to get vaccinated every year\nLet's look back to last year than the uh what kind of a season was that\nYes so last season that she doesn't Seventeen Eighteen season was a very severe season I'm One of the most he's your seasons we've had in the last decade with an estimated nine hundred thousand hospitalizations and eighty thousand deaths um we had\nOne hundred and eighty recorded so far pediatric that's from last season\nAnd one of the the things about it was that it was a season where um the activity was very sustained across the country for many weeks at a time and really affected all age groups across the age spectrum very severely so last season we did have a very severe one um\nAll of that said we can't really draw any conclusions or make any predictions about what we're going to see going forward for twenty Eighteen Nineteen based on what happened last year\nIn terms of vulnerability I guess there is a constant about flu and that is that the older and the younger you are the more likely you are to be vulnerable\nTrue um there there are some groups that are more likely to develop severe disease if they get sick more likely to get hospitalized more likely to have deaths and those are the very youngest in the very oldest um\nThose under five years of age particularly under two years of age and those sixty five years of age and older\nI'm all they said we we also know that there\nAre individuals outside of that age group for example those with chronic medical conditions are more likely to get severely ill and even with that said we also know that we really can't predict who could have you know if you take any individual\nWhat individuals are going to have a serious outcome what individuals are going to get sick enough to go into the hospital or die I'm even previously healthy people young adults can get severely ill\nChildren who have no prior medical problems can get severely ill from the flu\nIs there more than one vaccine available this year\nWe have a a good number of different vaccines that are available this year on the two basic types if you\nWant to divide them into two broad categories are we have flu shots and then we have um the nasal spray vaccine shots are given with a needle generally and they are made either with no virus at all or with virus that's been an activated and killed so it can cause disease\nAnd then the nasal spray vaccine is one that's made with live viruses but these are viruses that have been weak and so they can't multiply enough to cause any disease\nOf course most of us are not at all confident\nMultiply enough to cause any disease\nOf course most of us are not at all competed to make that choice ah ah other than the cost factor and I wouldn't be one to scrimp on this which one of those more effective at at least based on past years\nThat's a really good question and it's also one that's very difficult to answer it because I'm ... one of the many things that very about flu is vaccine effectiveness varies from season to season and that can depend on the person they're age their health status\nHow good the matches between the vaccine and what's circulating and also can vary from one vaccine to another onto the most important thing people can do is talk to their health care provider about what that means they have available and they can help select the right vaccine for you\nIn addition to taking the vaccine water other precautions we can take against flu or it seems like every year we were told you sure do always wash your hands a lot\nCan be kinda nice movie right

what we do not know July [noise]\nWelcome back to the gym but we haven't showed one eight six six five oh Jim bode one eight six six survival five or six to six as we look tonight as an arrest has been made and as we learned\nThe arrest of a person with a very long history of the difficulties with the law is that again makes you wonder\nUh just one point or do we stop saying you get another chance\nA clearly we're talking about someone who was incompetent to handle their own affairs and uh again the laws are what they are both in could change about the Caesar say Iraq but for others it could change\nOne eight six six five oh jumbo one eight six six five oh five four six to six and the to lead them Inglewood Florida hello really\nGood evening I get emails on media is being blamed for this\nBut I agree with you your uh your take on this trial the net these rallies take a lot of here take a lot of ... director\nUh I don't know it didn't like throughout the rest of the street to hear a ... or to is angle and when we had a early elections\nThere's been no civility here and there was no facilities for we've heard that this is going on\nIn even after the news broke that if it was going on ... ... email us ... if I thought that maybe the news media as well as the ticket\nAnd then they come down here fall off a little bit iffy interesting if anybody else who else throughout the collection ... early ... what was happening at the early voting places but I tell you it it it's pretty nasty here\nBut when you say when you say pretty nasty there are sort of you are you're talking about an actual polling place is that right\nYeah I hear you know you've got one side on one side and the other side on the other side and you know one side trading at the office\nAnd talking about people who are effective lever although at a rather childish way campaigning at a polling sites most states have laws against actively campaigning with so many feet of a bowling side\nYeah it's like a hundred feet thought what was happening if it wasn't it was it's not only screaming at the other people\nThat they were like yeah but it was it with a different party at the parties were actually at one that's out there and in some cases party for at one another so even when they heard that this is falling on\nThings here is hey there and it'd be interesting is for the Catholic and other places besides Florida I'd like to know because that's the way it was here\nYeah well again or I or are\nYou in other words you have it in the in Florida formal polling place was established annoyed and many other states you may vote absentee or you may go to let's say the or\nThe office of a voter registration let's say and cast a ballot but I I don't see a lot of places that you actually have\nHave a normal polling places like fire houses in in schools that are are are are opened up in this regard I Know that really because of course it's it's very hard to to protest outside of a of a mail box if you send in an absentee ballot or or or no protest in the offices of let's say\nA a county uh\nUh the county office building so these these are actual polling places huh I well\nYeah well like what they call it is early to watch it are they going to focus his early ...\nAnd then after a certain state they have to go to their kids ages ... to vote and yeah of course you can see the ads valid but you wouldn't I Would say that one\nThis story broke get of course I was there not knowing that that happened that I Believe that aired at thirtieth warning that wasn't that I feel like a fall out later that after that I even heard of\nThat in the next day it said on the Philly as a gift for some if not war\nWell it is it is very unfortunate I was wondering you know do you have anything to to say in regard to the specific topic of the arrest of the suspect in the uh the uh the phony bombs tonight\nI think the thing that has always been I don't know if this is true is in other states it seems clear Wyoming today as black people in this state like say I'd have had this ongoing arrest a record\nI Can't help the people that have been arrested for Twenty years or even out on the street I guess that's the thing that for like maybe\n[noise] uh\nIf it reflects as me as well of course obviously you can be arrested the many many many times ah and ah convictions or or what would matter in terms of uh of any ah what amounts to prior restraint but uh see what you're saying elated yes obviously something needs to be done in\nWhat about you prior restraint but uh see what you're saying then yes obviously something that needs to be done in the in this regard I Would uh thoroughly gr only I get calls in from Philadelphia tonight for the good evening on land\nAnyway yeah this is what's on your mind do not here so I'm fine I'm I\nWas I was I got all your saying where I have a lot and you know or something like that so many chances I was also looking at it from my my act and go where we have a problem with the healthcare system in this country\nEspecially compared to other developed countries and I think the CEOs of mental health\nIs even more I served in the medical field in general and so maybe after somebody goes and stuff about your times yeah they bought the information they put people on for oh maybe they could have a thing\nWhere they ah what people are mental preparation where they they go to specialize will help us now and they get out and maybe if\nI got I think what's more acceptable at first place that person would not right yeah\nSo you're wasting our minds whether they justify doing these things\nAnd you know and I guess that it costs money mental health professionals are like so that's why part of it but then we have things like that and how much he was right or the FBI on this investigation that the financial part of it and then the other side\nAs a mental health professional is able to help somebody ... that that guy that thing from happening on a first like that's just slice less especially if the you know especially somebody got the better building bombs and they got lucky they\nAlso said something actually happens like people get the answer for that something like that with a little bit of an aspect is that something ICS priceless\nWell widely anybody that I Would agree\nThat certainly to the extent that in fact we are able to be so proactive obviously the uh the area middle health is under served in this country we do not have mental health science down to ... to such that we can offer treatment to give but let's say a\nA Seventy percent chance that uh we've a fixture you're a defect your brain but a yes or the short answer is no we do need more resources the terms of mental health and maybe some kind of a\nIf you will mental health probation might be at least something worth pursuing Greg in Sioux City Iowa on the jumbo had a show of the arrest of a suspect in the uh\nSort of bombing case again since he

could add up to forty eight years in prison\nRe made it clear that the devices in the packages were real and dangerous\nThirteen I these were sent to various individuals across the country each device consisted of roughly six inches of PVC pipe\nA small clock a battery some wiring and what is known as energetic material which is essentially potential explosives and material they give off sheet and energy so a reaction to heat shock or friction\nNow we're still analyzing the devices in our laboratory these are not hoax devices\nRe also awards that there could still be other such packages out there and there was anyone with information to contact the FBI again as we know the seas are say are has told the investigators that\nThe uh a device was would not have heard anyone and that he did not wish to hurt anyone whether or not he had anything else to say about why he went to all this trouble to do this is not clear a live day in champagne Illinois joins us on the jumbo had a ... a good evening and\nUh and I could say a lot of things and I I cringe when I first heard this today I just decided to let it sit there and not look at it for a while I Would think about you know wait until\nSome things started falling into place but I I'm just gonna ask pose a question and I can't answer this question actually 'cause I Can't see that other people could look and see at pictures of him at Trump rallies\nNumber one ... whether they look photoshopped number and number two a lot of people have said he had this van in Broward County and they they said even if you're in if you're in Broward County in the face of people\nEven if you when they occur on a vehicle you're going to get ... you're going to have your your vehicle you know attack scratch whatever it's going to be\nI mean people are going to go after it and that ban let you know like it was you know not attack or nothing was done to it and so I'm kind of interesting observation and so I\nSaid yeah there are pictures out there that the the show um apparently at the at the Trump rallies although I Would agree that\nThat certainly this was the the day and age when with bumper stickers are virtually any guide a kid can get your uh your uh your car uh vandalize the interview that you said you're a member of the Rotary Club it would seem to this day and age of the big bucks to set off some people out there and then a lot of liberal Broward\nCounty ... van with her is covered with in a trunk stuff and all kinds of stuff in it it's just it's it's just curious and um there are a lot of curious things about this way you look at it so I just thought that I Am you know they just think about those things\nWell I think those reports that certainly to do worse the worth considering ... thank you for sharing that with us tonight one eight six six by boat jumbo Stanley in Raleigh North Carolina Good evening Stanley\n... thank you for taking my call waiting or question mhm uh I have no doubt that uh I'm probably not as up to date on this story as you are do I read as much from the secret service reports and the FBI reports as been available\nA several times in the last Fifteen minutes you've made the comment that apparently this gentleman is not capable or was not capable of taking care of his own affairs a nowhere have I read that he was not capable of taking care of his own affairs uh where where did you blame that from\nI get that from the all the various arrests were made to boost man and\nOr have I read that he was not capable of taking care of his own affairs where where did you blame that from\nI get that from the all the various arrests were made this man and the various activist reading to bomb a power plant at one point or\nOther brushes with the law I mean it is abundantly clear to me whether or not you have a basis they're under the law for some kind of a of a preventive activities or something else again but I'd say his his record speaks for itself\nOr certainly but there are many people that have been arrested who has a criminal histories that pay their bills are that are able\nTo take care of them so they're not the fares are speaking of I I'm happy if he was able to pay his bills I'm Talking about all able to manage zone affairs without interfering with others let's put it that way here\nOkay All right well that that makes it clear I Do

I Know you got troops that are\nAll over the globe a cold beer for border to North Korea border you're at different places right when I was just one or do you think maybe the\nPresident or one of the pressure point is for him to pass the\nGovernment to put it in the fish will request for military assistance on their southern border that while you could say in troops to their southern border with\nMexico southern border yeah\nWell first of all I\nMexico should be doing their job on their border that's number one and number two I don't know that that we need the opposite way they're quite capable of gardening that border is a proven over the years they suddenly decided\nThat needs to their advantage to let people through but it's not as though they're capable of defending that border they have done so very effectively over the years and they have suddenly stopped which for whatever reason there's a new a new president in the in Mexico city ah\nIf I thought that that would make a difference and there was no other way to do it I could go along with that idea David but honestly I don't I don't think that it's necessary to do that and I do believe that that's the the appropriate

former deputy undersecretary of defense and currently columnist with the American spectator online and spectator dot org we're talking about the end of this intermediate range nuclear forces treaty which President Reagan had concluded that thirty one years ago with Mikhail Gorbachev\nAnd let's see what we have denied all of the mind of a blend who\nCalls in from Cedar Rapids Iowa the boy had a job Glenda good evening\nThey chew first I like to a\nDegree was president of the draw for the treaty and then also the general comments about job bull by the age of national security stood my comment is is I was in the military all to the seventies and eighties and I was a purging to list so cruel and Germany where they ... and he was saying\nThat the European Union is going to allow these intermediate range weapons that we may or may not produce to be put on their soil they scream bloody murder up all this with the eighties\nWell I don't know I mean I assume the NATO countries that have a certain obligations Jed but you would know better than I\nWell I mean they certainly do but I you know there were he's ready to get very very good point\nI don't think that the NATO countries are going to allow\nUh enter a radio range ground launch cruise missiles or any other kind of nuclear capable missiles on their territory oh so that's one of the reasons that I'm saying in my article that we probably don't need necessarily to develop a tit for tat weapon\nA there are a lot of things that are driving us to do so I mean certainly the defense against the Chinese intermediate\nRange weapons could include a an intermediate range weapon of our own but I'm not advocating necessarily that we have to develop and field and I ended up violating type cruise missile ourselves are a lot of other ways to do this my preference frankly is for us to bolster our missile defense systems\nWe have some very good missile defense system but they're not perfect by any means uh they're probably not going to stop more than twenty five or thirty percent of any missile attack\nAnd that certainly is not good enough for we want to do I think is all set with the Russians are doing here but a lot more money and a lot more time into perfecting are missile defenses\nThat deserves a follow up of course the whole notion of missile defense so derided as a star wars by Senator Ted Kennedy and others in point of fact there is nothing\nAbout the notion of a missile defense that is in the least impossible you were talking about the speed of missiles at the speed of computers\nAnd the the the course of the speed of computers is increasing every second it seems like and it was only a matter of time before we will be able to as the old expression went shoot down a bullet was another bullet that this is not something that has any inherent impossibility difficulty yes\nWell and you're right but we've already done it I mean the question is how to get it better I mean we have systems right now our our strategic missile defense system station and California and Alaska are capable of intercepting a ballistic missile in flight\nA we have the bad a terminal high altitude air defense system or we have batteries are and I think South Korea I Know we have ... other nations to I don't know if they're in Britain or not but yeah we have a lot of other places\nOr you know these systems work they're not a hundred percent sure what I'm saying is let's put the money and and and invest in the science and engineering and get a systems to the point where they're going to be a lot closer to a hundred percent effective\nDo a call from Zach in the western Nebraska good evening Zach\nGentleman I'm calling in about the uh the boat meeting today with ... um and are\nSeeing a little clip a quote of ...
