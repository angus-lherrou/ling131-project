I Know the the reason for you because politicians are cowards and they want to keep the job and anytime you tackle a serious problem\nIt probably is still a problem because there's some controversy attached to it and politicians hate that well that's what we've got elected for was to tackle these issues\nNow I see that that thought has been flushed out in a considerable study by Peter Wallison senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute who has written judicial fortitude and published by encountered books subtitled but last chance to rein in the administrative state that Peter thank you for joining us tonight\nMy pleasure good to be with you Jim absolutely are your thoughts if you would on on the witness\nTrend really began and and how it has managed to avoid being challenged in court because to me it as it is a uh imminently challenge a bowl of there would be such a word\nOr it's it's a very much challenge of all and I hope that this book will encourage the court to start looking at this issue but it really began I think in ... what was called the progressive era between the Eighteen eighties and about Nineteen twenty when there are many\nSocial and economic changes going on in the country\nAnd the people who are then progressive is led by Woodrow Wilson and Theodore Roosevelt thought that the constitution was just too rigid to deal with all of these problems and so we had to make some major constitutional changes appoint a lot of smart\nFirst we lock your interest rate for up to Ninety Days then if rates go up your rates days locked but you've rates go down your rate drops either way you win call us today at eight hundred quicken or going to rocket mortgage dot com\nRacial upheaval only about on certain three year fixed rate moms cup of coffee permission and conditions people having winter license and all the things and I'm like number thirty thirty visual conditions are exclusion ...\nFrom a massive cactus falling on a home here dancing on a ...\nWe've covered I talked to farmers we know one thing or two because we've seen a thing or two we\nAre ...\nAnd you're right and I find me ... it's not an Airbus and everything\n[noise]\n\nWe're glad you're with us on the jumbo haven't showed one eight six six five oh jumbo relates six six five oh five or six to six\nWell I got to say it's about time and thank goodness for Peter Wallison senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute\nWho is the website ... H. E. I. dot org somebody needs to be done about this tendency of Congress to pass the buck to the other like the bureaucrats and those three letter agencies and elsewhere but the three letters or a good place to start\nA potentially writing general outlines of laws and letting him be the agency's fill in the details right the laws\nAnd a ... I'm going to be done about that ah we have a call from dark who calls in from Wilmington, Delaware to speak with our guests Peter Wallison the good evening doc welcome\nThank you for taking my call is August ... just a one or two quick questions for his team atrocity I'll just genocide lifted up\nWhere do you see this court heading under President Trump on her opportunity under justices Gorsuch had Kavanaugh and if there is no justice appointed as a second trumped or what you just want to do you see this court filing turning back tributes out of the cameras are not are you hopeful for the future and outs are what are your thoughts on that so\n\nThat you did you have two questions that that was just that was\nYour what you see the court going aren't these justices and are you all over the future that we could turn back the tide of I Would say almost fifty years\nAll right very good I Wonder I could use to be going in other words do ya I Will ... Kavanaugh tipped the balance and they actually show some traditional voted dude\nYeah I actually think that uh this is very very hopeful\nI'd add in the book I talk about the position of each of the justices but I say that with the appointment of Kevin ... there are five justices on the court who I think are ready to modify some of the major decisions that have led us to this position\nI'm the one that is most important here is one called ... the Chevron case or Chevron deference where the court many years ago in Nineteen eighty four\nA declared that the lower courts had to defer to the to the interpretations of various agencies of what powers they had been given by Congress that's very strange because it\nLeaves the courts out entirely and so that that\nDecision in particular has been a warrant for the agencies to increase their powers tremendously and interpret the authorities that they had gotten from Congress or to grow their powers now with cabin or they're\nHe's a constitutional list he's a texture list just just like Gorsuch is and the other three people\nIncluding especially Justice Thomas who I I dedicated the book too because he has always been concerned about this question and now he has four other justices I think on the court who are ready to take the steps that Alexander Hamilton\nExpected them to take when he wrote that ... that the federal is Seventy eight paper that I've that I've named the book after\nA while it it's just remarkable you know I understand Congress being leery of hot potatoes it's cowardly it's chicken but that is understandable they have to face the voters the courts don't what what are they so reluctant about\n[laughter] I think they really are concerned about not having any a direct support from the public\nThey don't need support from the public you know what I mean if we don't even associate with the public they and they have their own circles for cocktail parties in the like\n[laughter] I agree that that there is of that but Alexander Hamilton was right and when he talked about fortitude because he was saying yes okay the courts are independent and the reason he was writing about it is because he had he had been asked why are you giving the courts\nThe judges lifetime appointments in this democracy\nUm why shouldn't they stand for election and the argument he made in this federal is Seventy eight is they need lifetime appointments so they can stand up to the elected branches in a democracy the elected branches the president\nOr Congress are bound to have more power because they're speaking for the people\nThe courts are only speaking for the constitution\nI'm so they had been since that\nThose decisions in Nineteen thirty five\nAnd the effort by the president after that to a point seven new members and that's changed the entire nature of the court um they had been reluctant to take on the elected branches so that I think is the reason and we have to get the courts to start doing\nThat well we certainly do Alan on the road in South Dakota tonight gleaming\nEither thanks for taking my call sure [noise] yeah I was going to mention I just turned it on here and I didn't have an [noise] but uh your guests mentioned was I think\nYou know he said that uh where Republican now to mark sooner agree with that and I agree with you know kind of the\nTime frame on each side of the problem started you know it's also around that time learn from what I've read where you started became you know people started calling us a democracy is not a Republican I Do since then I've heard your guest said several times referring to our democracy\nWell I mean like one of the ... we have a representative democracy that's a while though and maybe that's because until recently that have not been technologically feasible for us all to have one great town hall meeting or we will now of course read the point where those technologically feasible although I think it would be a terrible idea\nUm we can even talking about that a bit later on but but the point is we have a representative democracy that is the republic we elect people who make the decision that's how it works or anything you want to add to that uh Peter\n[noise] no I think that's exactly right I think ... many conservatives I'm afraid and I'm certainly one of them many that many conservatives are afraid of the term democracy but we have to understand that the that the founding fathers actually thought of the people governing through\nA legislature and the legislature being elected by the people would make the major decisions that is still a democratic structure and so\nConservative should not worry about calling something a democracy\nThe democracy that fit the founders didn't like was a democracy where ... which is called the direct democracy where the people make the decisions themselves immediately in in in some kind of um ... uh a conference or director but that's not what we\nHad the old town hall meetings in the newly homeless a good idea and that is right now will will will come back to them time allows but right now I'm calling from Sharon in ... Missouri hello Sharon the go ahead\nYeah kinda Dan ... Mr wants and maybe I Am way off base back um\nThere is a movement could have a constitutional convention and one a couple of the things that I Hope comes out of it if we do have one that we have guessing that term limits for the legislative branch and the reigning power of\nExecutive orders as the president now if that in Dan\nAnd the legislature cannot I guess you have to worry about running for office and is there like it\nWould that change that balance so that the courts possibly would ... that that could that plate a little bit more because a lot of it's like to have to take more responsibility All right\nWell the way the way I see it in the way I discuss it in the book is that if the courts actually step up and say that certain\nLaws that Congress passes have passed too much legislative power to the executive branch if the court to ... or ... would actually say that\nThen that would force Congress to make these decisions itself the ... for Congress as Jim had said before is that it's too easy for just a pass on to these agencies\nAll of the major decisions exactly to be made\nFor the north going I'm going to break that doesn't move here so we will amplify on that thought when we come back in the moment\n\nAnd giving voice to them one on one by one on seven five fourteen hundred and\nForty ... Jim ...\nWell out of the comments that I made were in regard to those with that viewpoint that the constitution a is a a document that we can make up as we go along if we don't have to like what's in it it's not a view I happen to share but there's a lot of people who follow that was All right\nI just thought it would be the fact is is yes it does it change will document but only the voters of the country are allowed to change\nWell no actually the voters of the country don't have any direct say so in changing it there are methods that involve both ah ah usually we have used the constitutionality of the Congress although the the the conventions could also be the method proposing\nA constitutional amendments and then ratification could take place through three quarters of the state legislatures or through a a convention held in three quarters of the states the voters per se do not have a direct say so except insofar as they elect the people who do have a say so a breeder\n[noise] yeah well that that ... exactly right that have the have the system with ... um but it it's a important just to understand we have the ... that the procedures in place the mechanism in place to govern ourselves\nAnd we are not allowing it to happen we're allowing the government to slip away\nOut of their hands into the hands of bureaucrats in Washington yeah that's the problem\nThat is the problem but of course it's a problem that will not be going away until the people who are quite happy with the system are forced to to change their ways will be back with more in

state of the case for something that really needs to be said has to do with the administrative\nStage in his new book judicial fortitude from encounter books and we have a call from a sigh in Akron,

twenty Republican Congress person to to\nDo to allow trophy hunters to Ariel Hi Ken our national park in Alaska any is done this in regards to sea lion murder and\nGain well before we go too far off the deep end to Peter there ah I'm not sure that anything that has been done on this particular case a illustrates the point that we're making tonight to Peter and in fact a if in fact Congress went along with the however a wise or unwise decision may have been\nUh it wouldn't be the subject that we're talking about tonight I don't believe\nThat no not unless it was an action that was not the rise by Congress this is exactly the kind of thing that could happen if Congress hasn't authorized it um and one of the problems is that this very general legislation that Congress\nA passes sometimes allows administrators even conservative administrators to take things into their own hands and do things that Congress had never intended\nExactly it even in that in fact that's what we're talking about them that would be unfortunate but if there were specific authorization by a majority of both houses of Congress if\nIt a a ... in other words if the authorization will specific enough that you would have had in effect a law uh presumably that was passed Gary into Butte, Montana good evening Gary\nGetting ... thanks for having me on the shores pick up things and then get off on your your I agree with almost everything your guest has said I'm\nA minor point I I Believe we should call it a constitutional Republican and instead of the Democratic republic but that's my\nMy ... years and I think it really is we're giving him some ...\nYeah yeah yeah it it does mean something to me but I don't have the time they get to explain it on your show but anyway um and then the the\nThe the main thing is that I wanted to call about is the constitutional convention and that that is something that we definitely do not want to do there's there's conservatives out there that wants to do this and think I think\nIt would be a very good thing to do but I agree with your guest it could be a runaway costs just cook veteran ... read the history of our convention they weren't supposed to um go off and right\nHere but you're not going to get anything that would be authorized but it's such a convention that could take effect without\nActually having thirty eight states ratify in one form or another let's not forget the articles of confederation\nWere falling apart at the time that that happened and I would I Would just add one more thing if in fact we don't go that route\nThan most of the major changes that need to be made right now be a term limits of Congress be at the no budget no pay for Congress be at a a an amendment that would say that Congress may not pass a law that affects the general public that doesn't affect them equally all those who you can forget about\nWe are at an impasse and the mechanism as it is has currently been used it's already it's in the constitution but as it has been used today we're all amendment to start with Congress then we can forget about any of those things ever happening a\nBeauty let me add one thing there Jim I and I think much of what you said is something I agree with but let's focus instead of having an argument about whether we should have a constitutional convention let's focus on something we can do now because\nI think we are headed for some serious trouble unless we start raining in these these\nBureaucracies but how do you ... how do you were swayed short of of of some method of of of force\nUh uh how how do you persuade the uh current judiciary and Congress from changing a path that they have gone down for decades and which they are quite happy with I mean so they're not going to just suddenly say gee Peter you're right you're going to have to arm twist these people are going to have to drag them\nAnd I don't know how you do that just by saying please read this book is a great read but I don't

right the first job is a helicopter bombs or or helicopter parents and I guess most of us understand it is the term or referencing parents who hover over their children and in essence won't let them make the mistakes necessary to grow up and become adults but that'd be a reasonable definition or would you admit that\nCan that's but that's a pretty good definition and ah I think one of the things that that they learn is that somehow they are at the very least they deserve things in life\nAt because their parents did those types of things [noise]\nAll right ah that's something else that it it seems to me that\nThat the generation that has provided us with helicopter parents\nOr their parents as as a group probably would not really a about doing this sort of thing where they I mean a ... it's hard for me to the things that are\nBefore this generation of a helicopter parents that we had a a generation before that have parents that are essentially provide of the role models for these people are it it seems to be that these people sort of sprung up uh uh on their own and the the whatever their influence may have been\nThat it was not entirely their parents because I I don't think that it goes back a that many generations says it\nDoesn't really I mean there's some there's some small groups of people who have always been like that but if we go back and look at our generation is

people granted I I I don't ... the the young people I Know my my that my my definition I'm Talking about a a parent's today's parents who are generally of course in their uh their their twenties and thirties and some of their forties\nOr the ones I Know which are not a a wide swath of humanity they're they're very definitely not in this category uh I mean they they do discipline their children their children are expected to do certain things and just that includes bumps grapes\nA failures of picking yourself up dusting yourself often end the whole learning experience is there any kind of a of originality about this or a geographic concentration because I don't know that I have never actually met a helicopter parents much less a lawnmower parent\n[laughter] well I don't think it's necessarily originality I mean I I taught university from Nineteen Ninety six until two thousand was Seventeen\nAnd one of the reasons why I was glad to who step away from that was probably the last four years\nI we get calls from parents going what do you mean my travel got us thirty on their tests and I go well I Can't even confirmed mature kids in my class and they would blow up and like what do you mean I go well you know there are actually federal laws against that they're they're adults I Can't disclose anything you know\nAnd you used to be when I got a thirty on a on a test I was in trouble today the teachers in trouble\nYes at at the university level not even at the high school level\n[noise] wow uh I had\nOne flew flew in from New Jersey to Texas to to talk with me [laughter] about their child's grade [laughter]\nWhat a good heavens and well that that that does almost eight lay literal helicopter or this case an airline and I guess a remarkable I'll ride a Greg in Springfield, Missouri joined us on the jumbo headed show with the clinical forensic psychologist Dr John Huber a good evening Greg\n... a doctor I miss question uh okay I've got I've got a one year old grandson and ... on kind of worried about situations the daughter of all I mean I don't even know if she'd be considered a lot more ... and something else going on me\nShe obsessed with taking pictures I Love your desk is if he stands up you know it's like he's yelling baby it's ever done it and they don't even she won't even let them so like what myself\nGrab them laughing I physically go there and grab them because always on top of them they you know that he can't be around neither grand kids you know they're playing and they get in says there are there some germs you know it's like real estate and I'm almost worried about I mean\nWell you know maybe you should be more than almost worried I'd [laughter] Hubert Dr Huber sounds to me like Greg may have found an example here\nAnd he might have but I'm I'm assuming this is her first child\nHow 'bout that gray is is is a very ...\nOkay and you know at first child you know like the kids are at the store and they are in the living room and they spent their pacifier out and you got to go stick it in boiling water for ten minutes before he can put it in\nBack in ... by the time she has her third ... dusted off it doesn't matter she didn't know where to get up out of the gutter and throw them out you know [laughter] so\nSo in charge more dads that'll change how well she\nJobs to pass by she goes by and they were doing last oh\nWell All right now the ... and why is it yeah going going way longer\nYeah remind her that you know you you raise the child and spoil the grandchild or if you spoil the child you'll be raising the grandchild\nYeah exactly as we go to the next call here as a Dr Huber I guess you do know the reason why ah grandparents and the grand kids get along so well\n[laughter] yeah they have a common enemy [laughter] okay\nA little cynicism there for the program I Love it to Tom in Port Angeles Washington good evening a\nGentleman by the uh one of the things to generate show adopt or a mob just the amount of legislation that's out there that you have to see that the CDC that child to fill up the people\nIn a in in the communities\nCan get word of something in your your child got injured or you know did you leave go play in the yard and this happened or the chart if the car seat issue of who you know you have the right one for your head at at that age right that if there there's a whole lot of stuff that that that\nYou would never even dreamed of as kids would be\nA and I'm like you're in my church is right [noise]\nAnd and my parents never would have dreamed you know that somebody would have a hand yeah I mean at the state or local level [noise] uh so that's got to create some paranoia out there for the people that are remembering that they used to ride on the trucks predators if a fifty three Chevrolet pickup truck and hang out with the\nTruck yeah we can't even right in the bed and the truck now yeah exactly no I Know\nAnd and and and and it does you know the things that I could think of you guys go out and get that next ...\nWell thanks for your your thoughts are Tom uh to what extent it has a government if not imposed this on us at least encouraged this\nWell I'm from the government and I'm here to help and right now and and\nWhat happens is you get you get a vocal minority of people and they go out\nThere and they raise this think and they stand up in front of school boards and governor meeting on our legislators and all of a sudden we have these things impose now there are some legitimate things that need to be regulated I I don't disagree with that\nBut\nYou know uh I've been involved in so many different types of court cases a forensic psychologist of\nPeople following a pediatricians word to the ladder ... on a first child or something\nAnd the pediatrician assumed that oh you know they're an adult they'll they'll know they can't Hungary you don't wait three hours to feed on even though I said you know do you every three hours and ah all of a sudden you get child protective services involved\nIn it because you know the kids take being taken up the hospital because they have crying all the time and the other they think oh they're not\nFeeding the kids and the mother's like no I'm the I'm just like the doctor told me every three hours [laughter]\nAnd it's crazy to get out [laughter] it it it's scary for new parents especially young\nOnes and uh they they follow those rules and then what happens with\nYes they hit the public school system and they were hey your parents do this this child abuse of your parents do that at Charlotte and they start coming home and dictating the rules of the household and it's scary because there's no handbook that says ... ... really you can do parents you know what you care\nWell a suffice it to say a ... something about it Dr Huber managed to be here and I managed to get here and other people in the audience managed to get here a courtesy of parents who did not have that handbook either so I guess the the the old methods at least a do not to cause a tremendous\nTremendous a fatality rate among young people that might be some lessons there to be to be learned from bats\nWill talk some more about this to buy this tendency\nIn the direction of not just helicopter parents but\n... parents I mean at some point or this has to be arrested this has to be stopped what six six five oh jumbo back in the moment\n\nWe have from North Hampton to bring the one on one by Hampshire touting I Want to seven five and frankly\nI think Kate ways they might have been younger students in school but the thing about it is I think I told him I ... a lot of the [laughter] I says where the problem with these kids they don't have a problem solve number two they don't know anything about elections\nKnow some of the ... had the process\nAnd they used to teach civics them in such a moron [laughter] yeah I I had that they do that's also part of the problem\nYeah but but what you just said is very telling Linda they don't know how to problem solve commonwealth ... hill is the point of raising a kid if you do at the end of the day produced someone who can problem solve\nI mean right eye as true why have them I mean\nNo seriously why have a kid I I you can't just be doing it out of cruelty let's producer a human being who will ... failed miserably who will flop in life and and do all we can to to had to get them and nobody says that math is what they're doing the\nGuy the guy said it made it sound like the kids have no future now that well Republicans are running the country or\n... again I mean it's it's if you want to have that view that you're perfect right as an American so do you think about it do suck your bomb and organize I mean I I may I Will be out there are those of you and I hope that I don't step on your precious little self esteem\nBut that's one of the political debates all about if you feel that way there's something about an all out\nI went into this whole still ISIS problem is that the schools to control your kids you know they became the parents in many cases you're getting up and saying anything people are not going to any PTA meetings the old way they used to in place there you know\nWell and if they do go to complain about the city and a lot about their kids don't want our guest to comment on windows at the say which I think is a lot the doctor uber\nHas set a lot and there's a lot of validity to that the schools you know they they used to be locally controlled and now they're they're nationally controlled and just like what what\nThey need in in their state in in\nCalifornia or Washington state is different than what they need in Florida and Texas and Georgia and New York straight you know we need to I think my at history as a school psychologist tells me we need to go back and let the states\nStarts setting a the the standards of what their kids need to learn their at because our federal government has dropped out of the picture as far as you know they don't even requires that recommends spelling or national education agency says we don't have to worry about spelling anymore because everything has spell checks on them\nAnd you know no more curse of language that you don't have to learn to write in cursive while she can't ride in cursive you can't reading curses so\nHow are we supposed to go

that said jumbo hadn't show dot com you can follow me on Twitter ...\nJumbo talks well Michael is a history and yet or in many cases you can consider Michael is an ongoing presence the hurricane itself has a broken up and moved on across the Carolinas but uh the aftermath of well that still much here in now and that we have proof of that in\nA corresponding Clinton never lose standing by in Destin, Florida tonight and I gather that uh things are still pretty much a mess they're Clayton\n[noise] gym you're right you know will hit the forty eight hour marks and Michael made landfall in Mexico Beach Florida not far from where I Am now a early tomorrow afternoon and yet there are still when you have a known here\nThe search and rescue efforts are ongoing in fact they just started today because many roads are still\nImpassable there's people from the Panama City beach area who ... who are still not able to get back in ... there are so many roads blocked off their archery down in roadways from Tallahassee\nAll the way down close to the best in the area or the amount of damage that this storm is done I've heard described as a credible\nA as unlike anything that people from around here ... and people in these parts are familiar with hurricanes\nI talked to a couple of people who were surveyed some of the damage today they described it\nShingles or through the eyes of of in two sides of cars for Bruce they've described the different things ... free down on top of cars and things like that hundred and fifty mile per hour winds and they get caught a lot of people off

produce models for catastrophes and they are estimated that hurricane Michael caused about eight billion dollars in insured law says that does not include loss was covered by the national flood insurance program is a thousand million and that's an awful lot of money in terms of people\nAs you can be with us on the ... one eight six six five oh Jim both what age six six five oh five or six to six thanks for being\nA part of the program I I just still going over the various conclusions reached by our previous guest Dr John Huber the Austin, Texas based clinical forensic psychologist\nDot org this new generation that that's worse than the helicopter parents worse they call them lawnmower parents and uh\nThey like a law and more just remove every opposite go from their child's path eliminating the entire\nMethod by which kids grow up [noise]\nI mean it sounds seductive Lee compassionate or we don't want our kids to suffer [noise]\nWell I don't want them to ah to suffer from dread diseases or or a crippling auto accidents or anything like that or a sexual assault or a lot of things I don't want our kids to suffer from but the ordinarily bumps and bruises of life\nThe the day to day method of of learning by doing and by making mistakes\nThat's a necessary part of growing up if in fact that's the goal if you really want your your child to grow up and that's how you do it that's how you grew up is how I grew up making mistakes\n\nI a good look back on on my mistakes in in various categories there are a few I suppose that I made that I look back and I still cringe about many of them I laugh about was I dumb\nA and a lot of them I can look back in a positive way and say that the wasn't fun [noise] but I'm a better person because of it\nAnd\nIt sounds made that there is a whole generation not everybody in the generation but but I ate a major subset of this generation the parents engaged in such behavior as if they never thought about it\nAs I say it is difficult for me to even conceive of any parent who who thought about this for more than twenty seconds to not be able to figure out that this was a terrible thing you're doing you're setting up your children to fail\nWhy would a parent what to do that I mean\nI guess if if you're not very bright\nAnd you could convince yourself not me but maybe you could convince yourself that you're being compassionate my child will not ever stop their toe they will learn nothing I Will see to it that they go through Eighteen years of of formative life and learn nothing yet\nBecause every chance they had to learn how to get away and make sure that they don't learn except maybe they learned that a mommy and daddy will always be there to make it all better\nNot the way it's supposed to be and again I Am sure that not every parent does this I Know a few parents in that age group not a lot but the ones I Know\nActually raise their kids with discipline and with standards of performance and with punishment when they they've followed by the side with correct the behavior all the things that are yes hassles and ah and sometimes\nEven pay for the parents but that's what you signed up for when you when you reproduce studying yeah your head and the kid\nThis is what you're supposed to do\nIts it interesting that that we have a generation of young parents who apparently can figure that out\n[noise] everybody\nI'm Talking to right now talking with that one eight six six five oh Jim boat we were all raised by parents who started out in life making mistakes you grew up who had children and they let us make mistakes\nSome more mistakes than others some lessons more painful than others but the general rule of thumb was I Want my child to grow up to be an adult\nSo that they can cope I won't always be here people who are parents get older they die the kids were supposed to carry on that's the whole point I Want to produce kids who can make a go of it after I'm gone\nIt it just strikes me as I said I'm just wondering uh how you feel about that or am I to old fashioned them I stuck in the past ... lacking compassion for young people who should always be protected from every conceivable moment of pain embarrassment are heaven forbid\nChallenge to their self esteem\nWhen I have six six five oh jumbo is our number one\nEight six six five oh five or six to six I I'm just I'm just curious about it to me it is just astounding that this could have an old that there would be a few people like this year I mean in a nation of three hundred thirty million people you're going to have a few\nBrain dead do five okay I accept that I'm not happy about it but I accept it but it sounds like much more than that it sounds like a trend not a universal trend to be sure but enough of a trend\nThat you have to wonder are these people thinking\nAt all I\nDon't think we're talking about parents who sit down and and and deliberately calculate this that's how I sabotage my child's life they're not they're not saying that to themselves they're not they they ... they may be doing it but that's not what they're trying to do\nJust to just sad and bizarre as I say life comes with challenges\nAs they say no pain no gain\nSome pay and of course we don't want our kids to undergo other other types of pain I mean it's it's essential it's essential one eight six six five oh Jim bode to wander in Hopkins ville Kentucky a good evening welcoming\nYeah forget anything damn thing today that problem today that parents have become that killed that she didn't have to come to

horrible\nIt is horrible and ... ... what's worse Wanda is that it's entirely foreseeable\nI mean kids must be taught to be rational reasonable people are kids left to their own devices or are they will they will produce some pretty frightening circumstances\nList is inside a yeah I mean they ... their children to go on I mean I'm just looking at some things are it's just sometimes I guess what\nSo unbelievable you're like well these people put planet that those people come from ... well\n... it's a great question what planet did they do they come from I I tell you wonder are they all want to read the lord of the flies\nA very interesting book or the work of fiction\nBut uh it's an allegory there is a lesson to be learned in the book the lord of the flies it is what can happen when kids are sexually grow up on their own and don't learn these valuable lessons All right to a bill in Walla Walla Washington hello bill and the welcome\nYeah hey how're you doing fine thank you will

playing on their child because now the child is taught in school and everywhere else that's all they have to do is go to a teacher and say that they were abused even though they might not ban and there is just to be paying any\nWell I'll tell you it's a situation I gotta I gotta agree with you build it as a a situation that has gone way\nOverboard uh we're talking here about basic discipline

I Know the the reason for you because politicians are cowards and they want to keep the job and the time you tackle a serious problem\nIt probably is still a problem because there's some controversy attached to it and politicians hate that well that's what they got elected for was to tackle these issues\nNow I see that that thought has been flushed out in a considerable study by Peter Wallison senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute who has written judicial fortitude and published by encounter books subtitled but last chance to rein in the administrative state that Peter thank you for joining us tonight\nMy pleasure good to be with you Jim\nAbsolutely are your thoughts if you would on on the witness trend really began and and how it has managed to avoid being challenged in court because to me it as it is a uh imminently challenge a bullet there'll be such a word\nBut it's it's a very much challenge a bowl and I hope that this book will encourage the court to start looking at this issue but it really began I think in ... what was called the progressive era between the Eighteen eighties and about Nineteen twenty when there are many social\nAnd economic changes going on in the country and the people who are then progressive is led by Woodrow Wilson and Theodore Roosevelt\nThought that the constitution was just too rigid to deal with all of these problems and so we had to make some major constitutional changes appoint a lot of smart\nRate drops either way you win call us today at eight hundred quicken or going to rocket mortgage dot com\nRacial upheaval only about on certain thirty year victory moms cover crossing permission conditions people having one or licensing office he thinks analyst number thirty thirty initial conditions are solutions may apply\nFrom a massive cactus falling on a home here dancing on a ...\nWe've covered it talked to farmers we know one thing or two because we've seen a thing or two we\nAre ...\n... it seems to have you seen\n[noise]\n\n\n\nWe're glad you're with us on the jumbo haven't showed one eight six six five oh jumbo one eight six six five oh five four six to ...\nWell I got to say it's about time and the thank goodness for Peter Wallison senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute\nWho's the website is released their initials H.

I just turned it on here and I didn't have an [noise] but uh your guests mentioned I think\nYou know he said that uh\nWhere Republican nodded mark sooner agree with that and I agree with you know kind of\nTimeframe when he says the problem started you know it's all fool around that time learn from what I've read where you start became you know people started calling us a democracy is not a Republican I Do since then I've heard your guest said several times referring to our democracy\nWell I mean look there's none of that we have a representative democracy that's a while though and maybe that's because until recently it has not been technologically feasible for us all to have one great town hall meeting or we will now of course read the point where that is technologically feasible or that you would be a terrible idea\nUm we can even talk about that a bit later on but but the point is we have a representative democracy bath is the republic we elect people who make these decisions that's how it works or anything you want to add to that a leader\nNow I think that's exactly right I think ... many conservatism afraid and I'm certainly one of them many that many conservatives are afraid of the term democracy but we have to understand that the that the founding fathers actually thought of the people go running through\nThe legislature and the legislature of being elected by the people would make the major decisions that is still a democratic structure and so\nConservative should not worry about calling something a democracy\nThat democracy that the founders didn't like was a democracy where ... which is called a direct democracy where the people make the decisions themselves immediately in in some kind of um ... uh a conference or literature but that's not what we\nHave the old town hall meetings in the ... is a good idea that's right but we'll we'll get we'll come back to them time allows but right now I'm calling from Sharon in grain Missouri hello Sharon the go ahead\nYeah kinda again Mr wants and maybe I Am ripe space back I'm\nBuried in movement can have a constitutional convention and one a couple of the things that I Hope comes out of it if we do have one is that we have guessing that term limits for\nThe legislative branch and me reigning power of executive orders as the president now if that in Dan\nAnd the legislature cannot I guess you have to worry about running for office and is there like it\nWould that change that balance so that the courts possibly would maybe step that to the plate a little bit more because it's like we have to take more responsibility All right\nWell the way the way I see it in the way I discuss it in the book is that if the court actually step up and say that certain laws that Congress passes have passed too much legislative power to the executive branch if the court to ... or ... would actually say that\nThen that would force Congress to make these decisions itself the ... for Congress as Jim had said before is that it's too easy for just a pass on to these agencies all of the major decisions\nExactly did they made for the north going I'm going to break the doesn't move here so we will amplify on that thought when we come back in the moment\n\n\nBad weather here is that what are you may just be steps back when when you do with the twenty to storm the somebody may be one on one by one\nWell out of the comments that I made were in regard to those with that viewpoint that to the constitution a is a a document that we can make up as we go along if we don't have the like what's in it it's not a view I happened to share but the law people who follow that was ...\nI just thought it would be the fact is is yes it does it change will document the only the voters of the country are allowed to change\nWell no actually the voters of the country don't have any direct say so in changing it there are methods that involve both ah ah usually we abuse the constitutionality of the Congress although the the the conventions could also be the method are proposing\nA constitutional amendments and then ratification could take place through three quarters of the state legislatures or through a a convention held in three quarters of the states the voters per se do not have a direct say so except insofar as they elect the people who do have a say so up Peter\nYeah or that that ... exactly right about how the how the system with ... um but it it's a important just to understand we have the ... the procedures in place the mechanism in place to govern ourselves\nAnd we are not allowing it to happen we're allowing the government to slip\nAway out of their hands into the hands of bureaucrats in Washington yeah that's the problem\nThat is the problem but of course it's a problem that will

in Alaska any is down there in regards to sea lion murder and\nGain well before we go too far off the deep end to Peter there ah I'm not sure that anything that has been done on this particular case a illustrates the point that we're making tonight to Peter and in that or if in fact Congress went along with the however a wise or unwise decision may have been\nUh it wouldn't be a subject that we're talking about tonight I don't believe\nThat no not unless it was an action that was not the rise by Congress this is exactly the kind of thing that could happen if Congress hasn't authorized it um and one of the problems is that this very general legislation that Congress\nPasses sometimes allows administrators even in conservative administrators to take things into their own hands and do things that Congress had never intended\nExactly it is in that in fact that's what we're talking about them that would be unfortunate but if there were specific authorization by a majority of both houses of Congress it\nIt it uh uh in other words if the authorization will specific enough than you would have had in effect a law are presumably that was passed Gary into Butte, Montana good evening Gary\nGetting ... thanks for having me on the shores pick up things and then get on on\nYour your I agree with almost everything your guest has said I'm a minor point I I Believe we should call it a constitutional Republican and instead of a Democratic Republic but that's my\nMy ... years and I think it really is we're getting into ...\nYeah yeah yeah it it does mean something to me but I don't have the time that it takes planning on your show but anyway um and then the\nThe the main thing is that I wanted to call about is the constitutional convention and that that is something that we definitely do not want to do there's there's conservatives out there that wants to do this and think it think\nIt would be a very good thing to do but I I agree with your guest it could be a runaway costs just ... read the history of our convention they weren't supposed to um go often right\nHere but you're not going to get anything that would be authorized but it's such a convention that could take effect without\nActually having thirty eight states ratify in one form or another let's not forget the articles of confederation\nWere falling apart at the time that that happened and I would I Would just add one more thing if in fact we don't go that route\nThan most of the major changes that need to be made right now be a term limits of Congress to be at the no budget no pay for Congress be at a a an amendment that would say the Congress may not pass a law that affects the general public that doesn't affect them equally all those things you can forget about\nWe are at an impasse and the mechanism as exist has currently been used it's already it's in the constitution but as it has been used today we're all amendments start with Congress than we can forget about any of those things ever happening a\nBeauty let me add one thing there Jim I and I think much of what you said is something I agree with but let's focus instead of having an argument about whether we should have a constitutional convention let's focus on something we can do now because\nI think we are headed for some serious trouble unless we start raining in these these\nBureaucracies but how do you ... how do you were swayed short of of of some method of of of force\nUh uh how how do you persuade the uh current judiciary and Congress from changing a path that they've gone down for decades and which they are quite happy with I mean so they're not going to just suddenly say gee Peter you're right you're going to have to armed with these people are gonna have to drag them\nAnd I don't know how you do that just by saying please read his book is a great read but I don't think we want to do is\nLet me suggest this and I I I agree that it's tough\nBut we have five members of the Supreme Court now who
