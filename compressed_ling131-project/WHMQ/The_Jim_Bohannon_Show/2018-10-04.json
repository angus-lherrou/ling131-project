he's the president and CEO of lab MD and there's the concern about this this issue as should we all be one eight six six five oh jumbo our number as we talked to Marty calls in from east Texas tonight to good evening Marty\nHi Jim another good one man I'm thinking the way with the signal processing speeds that we see now and the um\nAnd and the ubiquity of connections around the globe I feel like the nation states are doing their best to keep up but I feel like there's a lot of NGOs if you will there's a lot of uh anonymous and uh um\nOrganizations of people you know order at a at a at hawk level that are doing a lot to exploit all of the weaknesses and the Web and that\nThat that's as big a factor as any nation [noise]\nAll right uh non government organizations for those who are not into the alphabet soup or a nomenclature a a ... ... what about that the Michael ... do you think that uh that such groups themselves pose a a a a threat as such\nFor well I Do but you know we have two hundred countries in the world that we have to sort of a coordinate with trying to get that side of the committee to agree on what to do about cybersecurity is is an incredibly tall tales specially when a lot of them are criminal enterprises themselves so these NGOs that we call them\nGet a lot of them are just a they have a mask on evidence you and really they are there at the government they get ... by the government I mean look at how the Russian train these kids to hack at such a\nSuch a young age which is a great idea for that call hacking but it's not a great idea for unethical hacking and we we need to train our children a lot more an ethical hacking so they can do great defense is that we have to have\nEthics and this is the problem we we almost to the point where we would have to have a world cyber court and you start getting into politics and and in bad actors\nThat are acting like good actors and he's right on the money I mean I agree with him completely I'm just trying to add that they they might\nLook like outsiders when really their insiders and talk about Russia all day long I asked her\nWell let me ask you a bit about that than since you since you brought it up or is there any such international body there is of course the world courts and there are various or\nA bodies of the United nations most notably the Security Council and the like I'm not sure that I wouldn't necessarily in many cases be particularly prone to to depend on such international bodies which I find in many cases ... at best and the\nAnd the hospital to U.S interests that red worst but I I Am curious if it's such a pug bodies even exist usually law and regulation a trail far behind technology especially in this day and age\n[noise] no you're exactly right and it it always sounds wonderful and it's really dangerous because there's a really really really powerful weapon and I'm as pious plan to suit the side of how we all get along by yeah I I don't want this weapon given\nOr anyone that's not mature enough in the world is certainly not mature enough for this weapon and they will take it over they will regulate speech they will suppress their people they will\nThey will use it for propaganda and group think I mean it's just way too dangerous which is why\nYou know I always thought the United states should a control most of this still\nAnd and we're seeing this because again it's a fundamental lack of accountability we have nine of wittingly put all our ship says one big cloud and so you can punch sure that you can get a huge windfall you can find the fact that we have that\nAll sort of in one space it's almost like we should go back one eighty and do everything back paper [laughter] 'cause it was harder to scoop up altogether and then you take the fact that people aren't really that ... the bad actors are in locations they are making a fortune outfits that\nLying is acceptable normal something that's so it goes against the grain of sand people in this country you just can't be foolish and that would be really foolish and the United nations will forget it or maybe they have but it's just so far away at the ... yeah I I think the real solution is going to be technological yeah I Would\nHave to think so as regards what you just said by the way this notion of a paper is oh so twentieth century well you know what is there are certain certain things about twentieth century that that uh we're better uh the mere fact that we have a technical capability does not mean that we should automatically embrace it and in point if for example\nAh it's been noted that there is no central computer in this country for election results are in which someone could hacking and also the outcome well thank goodness for that I personally am not encouraged by this move away from\nSuper ballads there is a perfect trail right there of how people voted\nIf somebody hacked something or something gets deleted you can have the validity of an election destroyed in an instant and uh I personally am of the opinion that the paper ballots are the way to go and if anybody thinks that that makes me a retro or luddite well boo hoo\nWell we we do have short attention span of we sure don't like the way for people that counts I don't want it to the baby out with the bathwater ON Technology there shouldn't be\nBut but there
