the house minority leader and uh she hopes and some poll suggests you might be once again the speaker of the house\nNow it's hard to know exactly what Nancy mean sometimes sometimes you just a little goofy a are referring to of course the famous quote about Obamacare we're just going to have to pass it to find out what's in it or to what extent do you believe this could have been a rhetorical rambling on the part of ... below sea\nWell no I think I think what she did is give a window to her so I think you know you brought up Obamacare the fact that she and her party\nBasically we're willing to pass this massive bill without having read it and we're basically engaged\nIn a a a propaganda campaign to fool the American people at least a portion of them into supporting the American people were told by the president and by the Democrats that if they like their doctor they could keep their doctor they want to remember that\nHe did lay yes they were told that their premiums would go down\nI don't know if they expressly discussed the doctor bowls but I Know the American people were not told that their deductibles would go\nA phenomenally um higher to the point where the insurance was almost worthless which was the situation with Obamacare and and of course\n... I don't think the American people were honestly told that what they were engaged in was nationalized saying I'm a significant industry went ahead as if they you know health care system in the United states is similar to the legal system and the United states\nIt has lots of problems our legal system has lots of problems ... and the healthcare system has lots of problems but when we compare it to other parts of the world we thank God we have it because it's the best in the world right well that that the\nBasically the system was demonized\nUm and it was up there were just a lot of ... going on in order to change it again the injured advise the means the whole thing was like that so Nancy Pelosi is engaged in that\nAnd I think this has been the strategy if the Democrat Party if we look at ... you know the terms looming we have a series of candidates who are posing as something other than what they\nAre yes we've been hearing a number of things about people uh uh most notably a Christians similar from Arizona Claire McCaskill from Missouri\nAre quoted in recordings they didn't realize were were being made to order at least made public in which they indicate there are a lot more to the left than the than the shall we say they portray themselves to be we have a number of people who would like to speak with James Hirsch them and they lead off with David and crushed in Iowa hello David\nLogan thanks for your during a brief period uh-huh\nI got to ... or a ... and the mayor group\nA first one is a\nAnd Lincoln said one time is it didn't catch more people who were the party in the fall\nAnd barreled a goal and uh that with a birth date and then the other one is that I think the the ... entire Congress go ahead of us older than\nThat I'm Sorry you're kind of skipping in and out what was that last comment David and then I Want our guest to comment\nI think we get a hold of statements where they have a Congress up there to put this on their forehead so that each of them can read it and says are a little respect would ah tore each other if you want respect you have to give ...\nYeah well there's certainly that's a that's a would be nice to add I think if this particular time your thoughts James ... about the the tone of the political rhetoric of the day\nYeah and I think that sums up what David is trying to say and that's something I think all Americans would like to see 'em a little more decorum and dignity among each other\nBut basically you know with that the kind of commentary this collateral damage commentary Hillary Clinton saying you don't have to be civil\nUm and the the basic um atmosphere I brought up the Kavanaugh hearings to see these mobs of people and they are ... percent that caused you know the president come up with the slogan jobs now mobs\nWhich I thought it was brilliant by the way but it was ... you know he is a really slow to air\nBut we take 'em if the Democratic leaders have not called out they haven't called out and he thought yeah always willing to go after the president\nIs lightest rhetorical access by the president\nThey haven't called out in the ... yeah always willing to go after a president\nAs wide as rhetorical access by the president is is a ... to the stabbing somebody in the heart but when people literally go out and vandalized and bugs and the reform our summit and the like oh they lately there and I would say the thing of course they don't because they're scared to death of the Democratic right there is good at what happened to\nThe Joe Crowley in New York the problem with the

well\nIf your if your morals and ethics of a lead you to break the law I Would ah would thoroughly concur lesson admitted to go here ah your response James [noise]\nWell you know it brings up this idea or when he talked about his movie analogies and that is we were talking about a political party that has made it their position not to accept the results of an election\nUm they've they've tried every way they can with their allies in the media to essentially not only undermine the president or to remove him from office\nUsing governmental agency so and it's all failed and yes there there in

I didn't I think there would beat up before they cross over wise yeah and\nSo there was one like I had a black guy and like a a fat lip and so yeah there's been some scary things for sure but I think that first one was more scary for me 'cause I didn't know what the heck it happened\nIs Hollywood doing more of this now you had this return to the Halloween the movies with a a a Curtis ... guarded as yet are we going to see a return to those good old days of the of the scary this and Freddie Krueger that sort of thing\nYou know kind of it looks that way doesn't it I think that guy's like said some blonde and have figured out how to make\nAnd really commercial um horror films\nAnd and you know and it was so interesting I think about the horror genre and Hollywood is it really is that movie that you want to see in a theater because you want to be next to someone even if they're a stranger you know it's a it's a really great reason to go and have a meal experience\nIn terms of of of how we view these things anymore ... are the days of the the movie theater limited are we going to be downloading in the future\nThat's why I was asked that question a on a panel for my day job and and my answer was I Hope not because the way that we respond to storytelling at home is so muted compared to the way that we respond to them in theaters\nSo for instance um if you're watching a comedy at home you might smirk you know might have a smile cross your face but if you're in a theater and other people are laughing you laugh out loud and when you laugh out loud\nYour body chemistry changes it actually it releases endorphins and say you enjoy yourself more so I I Hope it I Hope everything's not just download and we sat and watched things by herself\nThe the whole future of of Hollywood I suppose is is predicated to a certain extent on the on the various a revenue streams uh theaters for example uh get an awful lot of their money off of the concessions\nThat thinks that they do\nYeah I Do probably would get a kind of data but if you're showing a blockbuster movie and the theater bulls in the X number of dollars off of popcorn and a and the candy at twelve dollars a candy bar or just the the the the film producer get a cut of that that's where the money is\nI'm not that I'm aware of where you'd be where I Would I Do yeah I Would be so I'm pretty sure we don't\nAll right yeah uh in terms of of the uh the the creativity that that goes into a Hollywood productions this needs to be the some of the the highest concentrations of creativity\nOf the uh the the creativity the that goes into a Hollywood productions it seems to me that some of the highest concentrations of creativity these days go not into the TV shows or even necessarily feature movies you seem so to me that some of the highest levels of creativity at least\nPer per second of air time if you will go into music videos in commercials\nHuh you know what that's a really great question I you know I I can tell you and I think it depends upon the film you know when it comes to cost\nThat it it really depends upon the special effects you know the cost per second on an animated film is actually quite extensive\nCosts for second on something like a star wars and I'd be very expensive Avengers very expensive so it's really more I think about the effects ... than it is anything else\nDoes do those Hollywood depend too much on affects or we don't have much in the way of star power in the script sucks but boy we've got a great computer graphic or a a special effects year long as you got to just pure white magic on your side can you sell the public anything\nYet now you can you you can't sell it felt like I think I got to tell you consumers are so smart they are so smart which is why you know I started digging into that the data side of things is to is to understand the customers want and there was a day when you could just make I'm living in ... said\nI'm In the this is probably more like twenty twenty ... Twenty years ago\nUm but now people are smart if they can they can kind of smell a bad movie and it's not that listen I from what I've experienced and I and I had to put it you know the kind of start with that because I think it's fair I got experience everything in it for every movie in Hollywood but no movie\nNo script ever starts out to be a bad movie\nYou know and they're all gone with the wind or Citizen Kane storage [laughter]\nRight I mean and sometimes you might have a script they might have made it not totally confident but it turns out to be a phenomenal film [noise]\nUm so you know but I I think people are are really smart and and you know I don't know do we rely too much on special effects and some of our most successful movies and the ones that I Am personally the most proud of our movies like hidden figures\nUm fault in our stars there wasn't a single ... a special effect in any of those films um yeah Slumdog Millionaire it was a an Academy Award winner for the studio and not a single effect I you know I I think there are a lot of effect certainly more than we've ever had um but I still think there's room\nYou know for those films that doubt at least I Hope so 'cause there's there's some of our our best stories\nIs an article of faith among the good people in this country that anything that comes out of Hollywood is automatic you'll you'll be left wing of politics preaching to the rest of his real disagree\n[noise] oh God is it preaching it doesn't feel like preaching to me um you know I I don't think\nThat that is fully accurate I think that maybe some of the stories that come to us\nMight might appear that way um you know it's funny I you know I sit in these rooms every day and yeah I'm a girl from Oklahoma I grew up at his ... and a Republican household\nUm but I can still enjoy a story\nWhether you know no matter what my political beliefs are or or not and I think that you know what I Would I just what breaks my heart is helpful at a sized stories had become because movies like hidden figures should never be considered politicized 'cause there was nothing political about that movie\nOr the anyway a fascinating tale and but we thought that on Halloween or virtually Halloween but that we should hear from Julie ...\nWho is a president jeep latest rather just ahead of media twentieth Century Fox do talk about\nThe ghost photographer Hollywood executives true story of discovering the real world of make believe it was published by Adrian live him and uh it's a it's a fascinating tale we'll be back with more adjustable\n\nWith bad weather so what are you ready to be steps to weather when you need it with a twenty two storm deep and what are you a chance\nWe work with you to really understand your knees in the ... with the right solution no more no less just smart people getting to know your business with simple personalized solutions for fair price real humans human how's that sound\nWell probably like the opposite of a smoker [laughter]\n... eighty eight months to to talk to someone with a new is today\nI'm Jay foreigner CEO of Quicken Loans America's premier home purchase lender we've created a new way to protect you from unpredictable interest rates are exclusive rate shield approval first we lock your interest rate for up to Ninety Days then if rates go up your rates days locked but you've rates go down your rate drops either way you win\nCall us today at eight hundred clicking are going to rocket mortgage dot com\nRacial upheaval only about a hundred and three year fixed rate moms precaution permission and conditions people having Leonard licensing office ... number three thirty initial conditions which was his main point and I can't believe\nThat we're playing for for basketball with a barber shop Clinton\nBall um [noise]\nUm\nNo I Can't believe how easy it will save hundreds of dollars in my car insurance was Geico [noise]\nLeaving I sent her more car insurance\nStephanie Miller and you share my feelings on Twitter you send out rough Nader's on my TV riffing Democrats and saying that Michael Bloomberg is going to shake up the Democratic party please do away Eighteen years ago [noise]\n... yeah I only go here so I couldn't leave that last night I mean I Know he's got a book that fell below ... reason why would there be to put that guy on TV\nStephanie Miller weekdays a one on one five seven five you may be [noise]\nImagine working hard for so many years and reaching your retirement only to\nFind out there's an issue with your pension or four one K.

well they're certainly that's a that's a would be nice to add I think at this particular time your thoughts James ... about the the tone of the political rhetoric of the day\nYeah and I think that

want\nAltercation and injury this is a so it's a delicate situation but here's the big picture we simply have to stop the if they were to get into this country\nThere would be an endless number of caravans and uh it appears as though the people that want to abolish ice the Democratic socialist so they called themselves the people that want to open borders seem to never be able to answer the question\nOf how many immigrants is enough\nAnd so they they seem to be on a trajectory to turn the United states into a third world nation because there are certainly enough people in the world that
