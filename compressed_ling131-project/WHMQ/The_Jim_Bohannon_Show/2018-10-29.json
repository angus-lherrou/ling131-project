although it's hard to imagine that it that it'll help the rappers career\nThat was kind of what I'm going into yeah but I ... I Can't help but wonder you know I you know all the your comments that Donald made after he said that's not how great he was a very smart man and then they all he could eat welcome there anytime\nA what would you know that being said Donald really thinks that what would he have said Okonjo got up there and told him or or about holy was all this other stuff what are you still be a great man you know well\nWe we I think we know our president well enough to know now that no the president will lay on the heavy\nHeavy uh compliments if he liked what you say and heavy complaints if you don't so no I I think it is you use really of Andrew Joan question there David no obviously a of what was said had everything to do with what the the president had to say in response\nAh Charlie in Manhattan, Kansas the good evening Charlie welcome\nSurge jumbo how're you doing I'm well sir thank you\nWell you know a lot of people in this country uh ran into him all the time about your age maybe a little over but\nPeople don't know how to critically thing I mean let somebody else to sink in for him in a ... one day I heard the U.S or on the Internet today Eric sold it for ex President Carter was are griping because he said that Kavanaugh was not\nA fit because of the out first and they wait conducted himself his performance ... in ah the heritage or you know he or I don't know it was Carter been there a court room that the capital than in all\nThe decisions he made a really using one thing you see what I mean\nHe is using one thing and and again I'm I'm curious how Jimmy Carter would react if such charges have been thrown at him I've interviewed Carter so I don't even have to to ask that rhetorical question I Know how we would react\nHe would react uh very intensely he would probably out Kevin Cavanaugh in that regard not to mention a although we we should in this context that Kavanaugh wrote\nAn apology that appeared in the op ed pages of the wall Street Journal saying that if he went overboard that he apologized for that so yeah I I can I must say I would you be Carter the category of ah\nWho cares quite frankly I don't I consider him a has been to some extent never was\nAnd he was a better ex president than the president so yeah I see what you're saying and I I appreciate the your thoughts are Charlie thank you very much for that Pam in Sioux City Iowa good evening them\nHey I just thought I'd tell you listen to your show all the time on my way home from work and make far I'm actually calling you from my car that\nI I think what the kind of a west and the cello slashed Gail and I'm an independent I'm not ...

just want to let their followers no how\nTheir point is they have millions of followers and they just want to let their followers now how they feel I don't think they're trying to tell them how the how about I just think that um they just again they just have millions of followers\nOh they do that and I and I'm sure that you're correct I mean the problem I have is really the fact that there are a lot of people who may very well formed an opinion based on what some celebrity says ... that's the part with which I differ or that they both have the right to speak out oh without question without question are great\nGreat great but I it again and like I said I like I I really respect your with your show a lot and again I think that I think they're just trying to reach all their followers and just trying to get the vote out you know\nThat that ... in which case ... together because as I say I firmly believe that each of them probably injured their career to a certain extent so if in fact

expect this year with a medical officer from the Centers for Disease Control doctor leaves the gross cause a lot of uh what are we expecting this year\nI Wish I could say I'm we wish we could say uh we can never really predict for the coming season\nWhat it's going to be like how severe it is going to be right now it's it's just too early typically in the United states um flu activity begins to pick up in the fall around October um but right now we just can't predict what the coming seasons going to be like and that's one of the reasons it's important to get vaccinated every year because we can never know how serious it is going to be\nExact we ever those who say well uh I was vaccinated last year I was vaccinated in twenty third gene there's somebody may need to realize and that is that a flu viruses are very sneaky food which keeps changing on his\nYeah they are really little wonders and in terms of how they change and flu viruses change constantly um and\nThat's one of the reasons that in most seasons as we move from one season to the next the vaccine has changed to reflect what is thought to be the thing that we are going to be seen most of in the coming season um so that's one of the reasons too poor to get vaccinated every year\nLet's look back to last year than the uh what kind of a season was that\nYes so last season the two thousand Seventeen Eighteen season was a very severe season I'm One of the most he's through your seasons we've had in the last decade with an estimated nine hundred thousand hospitalizations and eighty thousand that's um we had\nOne hundred and eighty recorded so far pediatric that's from last season\nAnd one of the the things about it was that it was a season where um the activity was very sustained across the country for many weeks at a time and really affected all age groups across the age spectrum very severely so last season we did have a very severe one um\nAll of that said we can't really draw any conclusions or make any predictions about what we're gonna see going forward for twenty Eighteen Nineteen based on what happened last year\nIn terms of vulnerability I guess there is a constant about flu and that is that the older and the younger you are the more likely you are to be vulnerable\nTrue um there there are some groups that are more likely to develop severe disease if they get sick more likely to get hospitalized more likely to have debts and those are the very youngest in the very oldest um\nThose under five years of age particularly is under two years of age and those sixty five years of age and older\nUm all that said we we also know that there are individuals outside of that age group for example those with chronic medical conditions are more likely to get severely ill and even with that said we also know that we really can't predict who could have you know if you take any individual\nWhat individuals are going to have a serious outcome what individuals are going to get sick enough to go into the hospital or die I'm even previously healthy people young adults can get severely ill\nChildren who have no prior medical problems can get severely ill from the flu\nIs there more than one vaccine available this year\nWe have a a good number of different vaccines that are available this year on the two basic types if you\nWant to divide them into two broad categories are we have flu shots and then we have um the nasal spray vaccine\nShots are given with a needle generally and they um are made either with no virus at all or with virus that's been an activated and killed so it can cause disease and then the nasal spray vaccine is one that's made with live viruses but these are viruses that have been weak and so they can't\nMultiply enough to cause any disease\nIn is one that's made with live viruses but these are viruses that have been weak and so they can't multiply enough to cause any disease\nOf course most of us are not at all confident to make that choice ah ah other than the cost factor and I wouldn't be one to scrimp on this which one was more effective at at least based on past years\nThat's a really good question and it's also one that's very difficult to answer because I'm ... one of the\nMany things that very about flu is\nVaccine effectiveness varies from season to season and that can depend on the person they're age their health status how good the matches between the vaccine and what's circulating and also can vary from one vaccine to another onto the most important thing people can do is\nTalk to their health care provider about what that means they have available and they can help select the right vaccine for you\nIn addition to taking the vaccine water other precautions that we can take against the flu or it seemed like every year we

six and ... to ... lead in Inglewood Florida hello really\nGood evening again you know it is being blamed for this\nBut I agree with you your uh your take on this trial you know you get these rallies take a lot of here take a lot of a threat here\nI don't know it's been like throughout the rest of the street to hear a sport it is angle and when we had a early elections\nThere's been no civility here and there was no facilities for ... for that this is going on\nIn even after the news broke that if it was only a ... ... email us ... if not all that navy the news media as well as\nThey come down here fall off a little bit iffy interesting if anybody else who else throughout the early ... ... ... ... the early voting places but I tell ya it's it's pretty nasty here\nBut when you say when you say pretty nasty there are some that you are you're talking about an actual polling place is that right\nYeah I hear you know you've got one side on one side and the other side on another side and you know one side trading at the office\nAnd talking about people who are effective lever although at a rather childish way campaigning at a polling sites most states have laws against actively campaigning within ... feet of a polling side\nYeah it's like a hundred feet but what was happening if it wasn't it was it's\nNot only screaming at the other people that\nThey were I guess that it was it with a different party at the different parties were actually at one that's out there and in some cases the party for at one another so even when they heard assistant falling on\nThings here is hey there and it'd be interesting is for the caffeine and other places besides Florida I'd like to know because that's the way it was here\nYeah well again or I or\nAre you in other words you have it in a in Florida formal polling place was established annoyed and many other states you may vote absentee or you may go to let's say the uh\nThe office of a voter registration let's say and cast a ballot but I I don't think a lot of places that you actually have\nHave a normal polling places like fire houses in in schools that are are are are opened up in this regard I Know that really because of course it's it's very hard to the protest outside of a of a mailbox you sit in an absentee ballot or or or do protest in the offices of let's say\nA a cow the or\nThe county office building so these are actual polling places huh well\nYes all of that law like what they call it is early ... are they going to go to the early ... yes\nBut then after a certain state they have to go to their kids ages ... to vote and yeah of course you can see the apple valley but\nYou just I Would say that one this story broke gets ... they're not doing that that they see the cats I said I Believe that aired at thirtieth warning that wasn't that I feel like a fall out later that after that I even heard\nOf that in the next day it said on the Philly for some if not war\nWell it is it is very very unfortunate I was wondering you know do you have anything to ah to say in regard to the specific topic of the rest of the suspect in the uh the uh the only bombs tonight\nI think the thing that has always been I don't know if this is true is in other states it seems clear Wyoming today as black people in this state like say I've had have this ongoing arrest record\nI don't understand how these people that had been arrested for twenty five or even out on the street I guess that's the thing that for like ...\n[noise] uh\nIt reflects as me as well of course obviously you can be arrested the many many many times are and ah convictions or or what would matter in terms of uh of any ah what about you\nObviously you can be arrested many many many times er and er convictions or or what would matter in terms of uh of any ah what about you prior restraint but I see what you're saying elated yes obviously something that needs to be done in the in this regard I Would uh thoroughly could occur\nOleg ... calls in from Philadelphia tonight for the good evening on land [laughter]\nAnyway yeah I'd want to hear my diet so I'm fine I'm On my\nSide so I was I going to fall by what you're saying where it's on cable laws and you know a person can only got so many chances but I was also looking at it from my mother proactive angle where we have a problem with the healthcare system in this country\nEspecially compared to other developed countries and I think the CEOs of mental health is even more under served in the medical field in general and so maybe after somebody goes then somebody times yeah they bought the information they put people on parole\nMaybe they could have a thing where they uh but people are mental preparation where they they go to a specialist about the health professional\nAnd they get help and maybe if I got I think it was more acceptable in the first place that person would never get\nTo the way from their minds whether they justify doing these things\nAnd you know and I guess that it costs money mental health professionals are like so that's why part of it but then we have things like that and how much he was right or the FBI on this investigation\nThat the financial part of it and then the other side as a mental health professional is able to help somebody and prevent that kind of thing from happening on the first place that's just life less especially as the\nYeah especially somebody could be better building bombs and they\nI Would I say I get lucky they got\nThere was also go undetected I something actually happens like people get hurt that prevent something like that with a little bit of an that's bad or something I see is priceless\nWell wildly on buddy that I Would agree that's really to the extent that in fact\nWe are able to be so proactive obviously the uh the area of mental health is under served in this country we do not have mental health and science down to ... to such that we can offer treatment to give ... let's say a\nA Seventy

lot of people have said he had this van in Broward County and they they said even if you're in if you're in Broward County in the case of people even if you when they occur on a vehicle you're going

his own affairs where where did you blame that from\nI get that from the all the various arrests were made of this man and the various activities threatening to bomb a power plant at one point or other brushes with the law I mean it is abundantly clear to me whether or not you have a basis they're under the law for some kind of a\nOf a preventive activities or something else again but I'd say his his record speaks for itself\nOr certainly but there are many people that have been arrested who has a criminal histories that pay their bills are that are able\nTo take care of them so they're

documentation that is when he came through and ah\nYou had you add money to get in the United states and if he didn't they set you back on the boat and if you are sick they set you back now what what do they deal with these people come out to the other way they they check but I gotta check there\nAre physical thing here or are they going to be sick or wet\nWell they certainly need to be petted and a variety of ways\nYeah I mean they don't have any any right to come up here I mean we got this issue about him and to sign that says ah you know\nIt's if it's in the right thing to do by letting command if you don't command you you can get excommunicated from the Catholic Church when I last absolutely ridiculous with the Catholic Church has all these other problems they've got you got a

his take his views of what is there is not right and the stick them so thanks Charlie DJ and southern Minnesota hello\nGood evening sir good weather and I talk to you yesterday\nAnd what's on your mind to my [noise]\nMy my idea what that says okay first of all the people don't discuss may but\nThe other jobs when they had their attitudes disgust me yet but go ahead\nYes the other gentleman had a good a good point where people came into the country the right way through Ellis Island you know through the the right process I don't understand and I am a Marine Corps war veteran and I've been to some of these countries\nI don't understand why Mexico is not doing anything they're letting them come through\nThat shrine we deal with it and they don't have to\nThat's right ah they're they're doing it because it's to their advantage and that's why they have always until now suddenly had a very tough southern border with Guatemala northern border they've always looked upon as essentially\nA toilet to flush their uh unemployment and other problems on to the United states Yes sir that it'll are absolutely\nAnd I I I'm forty nine years old I'm a I'm a war veteran and I voted for the first time for a president that slashed election and I am a Trump supporter and I believe what he has planned on putting our military on the line to stop them is absolutely correct\nI I don't see how there's an argument for that\nOh there there's no no rational argument you'll get all kinds of people who get hot and bothered about the fact that we're not being generous enough so it was interesting for me to hear all the people out there who were so generous with the your dollars in my dollars\nOr to the editor he'll morally superior so thank you for your service DJ and for your good thoughts David in Gainesville, Georgia lizard a WD un radio good evening David\nUh yes Hi Jim Hi there it's been a while since I've taught well I'm Glad you joined as a yeah I had\nA one or two questions that are ... are kind of get a handle on ... and I know get troops that are\nAll over the glow or who they are for border to North Korea order your\nDifferent places right when I was just one or do you think maybe the president did a one pressure point is for him a has a\nGood way to put it in the fish will request for military assistance\nOn their southern border that while you could send troops to their cells or order like\nMexico southern border yeah\nWell first of all I\nMexico should be doing their job on their border that's number one and number two I don't know that that we need the opposite way they're quite capable of gardening that border is a proven over the years they suddenly decided that it's to their advantage to let people through but it's not as though they're capable\nOf defending that border they have done so very effectively over the years and they suddenly stopped which for whatever reason there's a new a new president did in Mexico city ah\nIf I thought that that would make a difference and there was no other way to do it I could go along with that idea David but honestly I don't I don't think that it's necessary to do that and I do believe that that's the the appropriate way to go\nAnyway ah by the way I almost was in the visiting your good friends Billy Joel on the w._b. you in this past mourning but at the time was having a dental problems so was unable to make the trip ... had a job in a moment\n[noise]\nFor the Democrats and you know that is the the main thing that the liberals\nHave to gain a out of it the other thing they jam in a ... in in second Timothy it clearly states that a man that will not look after his own household is worse than an infidel we're not looking after our own and I think it is beyond disgraceful

about how this is going to come into brand new arms race and it's all Trump's fall oh gosh what are you guys need new material gym it's just the same old nonsense and it's still not true\nAnd the

columnist with the American spectator online and spectator dot org we're talking about the end of this intermediate range nuclear forces treaty which President Reagan had concluded that thirty one years ago with Mikhail Gorbachev\nAnd let's see what we have denied on the mind of a blend who calls in from Cedar Rapids Iowa the boy had a job Glenn the good evening\nTo you first saw late to a\nDegree was president of Charleston draw for the tree and then also the general comments about John Bull by the national security stood my comment is is I was in the military all to the seventies and eighties purging to list so cruel\nAnd Germany where they would say that the European Union is going to allow these intermediate wanes weapons that we may or may not produce there'll be put on their soil they scream bloody murder about this with ...\nWell I don't know I mean I assume the NATO countries that have a certain obligations Jed but you would know better than I\nWell I mean they certainly do but I you know where he's ready to get very very good point I don't think that the NATO countries are going to allow\nUh enter and medium range aground launch cruise missiles or any other kind of nuclear capable missiles on their territory oh so that's one of the reasons that I'm saying in my article uh that we probably don't need necessarily to develop a tit for tat ...\nAre there are a lot of things that are driving us to do so I mean certainly the defense against the Chinese intermediate range weapons could include a an intermediate range weapon of our own but I'm not advocating necessarily that we have to develop and field and I ended up violating type\nCruise missile ourselves are a lot of other ways to do this my preference frankly is for us to bolster our missile defense systems\nWe have some very good missile defense system but they're not perfect by any means uh they're probably not going to stop more than twenty five or thirty percent of any missile attack\nAnd that certainly is not good enough for we want to do I think is all set with the Russians are doing here but a lot more money and a lot more time into perfecting are missile defenses\nThat deserves a follow up of course the whole notion of missile defense so derided as Star Wars by Senator Ted Kennedy and others in point of fact there is nothing about the notion of a missile defense that is in the least impossible you were talking about the speed of missiles at the speed of computers\nAnd the the the course of the speed of computers is increasing every second it seems like and it was only a matter of time before we will be able to as the old expression went shoot down a bullet with another bullet that this is not something that has any inherent impossibility difficulty yes\nWell and you're right but we've already done it I mean the question is how to get it better I mean we have systems right now our our strategic missile defense system station in California in Alaska are capable of intercepting a ballistic missile in flight\nA we have the bad a terminal high altitude air defense system or we have batteries are and I think South Korea I Know we have other nations to I don't know if they're in Britain or not but yeah we have a lot of other places\nAh you know these systems work they're not a hundred percent sure what I'm saying is let's put money in and and best in the science and engineering and yet he systems to the point where they're going to be a lot closer to a hundred percent effective\nDo a call from ... in the western Nebraska good evening Zach\nGentleman

as the arrows and or I Want to back up and and just tell everybody I did vote for Donald Trump\nUm and the reason I did that was because of the\nNon intervention all uh aspect that he was portraying during the campaign or and I heard that term Neal con being thrown around [noise] and ah and I see that's exactly what's happening here and you know I I don't understand why we the American or continue to let these banker wars dictate our politics\nWhy don't we are allowing any quote banker wars to dictate any politics nor do I see anything in tonight's discussion a jet that wouldn't be in reality a pulling back from war anytime you allow someone to aggregated treaty in this way you're almost inviting trouble aren't you\n... ... I mean even the Romans had his face for its use from rebel of if you want each for war and that's really what we're doing here we're not allowing someone to violate the treaty and get away with it and whether or not we\nUpped the ante as you know a very different question and how we do it is a much better question so I don't know Jack means by bankers sponsored wars up to ... that sounds a little frankly paranoid may\nIt is not I think what we're talking about here tonight and in fact what we are talking about tonight is not any kind of a of intervention in third party affairs this is a treaty between the EU\nYou have what we're talking about here tonight and then in fact what we are talking about tonight is not any kind of a\nOf intervention in third party affairs this is a treaty between the U.S and Russia or the successor state to the Soviet Union and uh it's every bit our business and to this particular\nUh item of business is probably long overdue one eight six six five oh Jim ... is our number one eight six six five oh five or six to six as we talked a jet Batman contributing\nEditor to the American spectator deputy undersecretary of defense in the Bush ... administration he writes the loose canons column board TAAS on line and that is often the guest on this send to instill in their programs and he'll be back on will be like in a moment\n[noise]\nOf course but it didn't Mr Clinton making enforceable promised him on Jim either you know it's like it's like Mr ...
