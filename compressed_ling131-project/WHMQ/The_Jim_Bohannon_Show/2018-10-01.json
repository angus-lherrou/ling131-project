sensory logic and our number one eight six six five oh jumbo\nWhat eight six six five oh five or six to six as we continue our discussion here on this evening with a look at just how you go about reading others\nUh okay I could think of let's say a over the eyes and the mouth I'm not sure what else I Would even know to look for although admittedly even if I knew where to look guy I wouldn't necessarily read it correctly but other other parts of the base besides the eyes of about\nA yes there are the eyebrows if they shoot up an outward are expressing surprise and fear or the nose that crunches up is a sign of disgust something smells bad either literally or metal\nStrong additional places to look\nA one eight six six five oh Jim bar number a we have a car we are heard on the Internet by the way and we have a caller from Brazil Michael calls and hello Brazil hello Michael how are you\nPretty good pretty good gym I've been here about three years now and\nI'm a volunteer and I uh uh teach kids are kids and English professors at those big anguish for the school system uh English you know because I'm an English teacher but I decided to make a move but I came over here and you're listening to W. I. R.\nEvery day and if I'm awake at night 'cause I wake up at four thirty my time within an hour ahead in the east coast time actually won the rooster cruise around the corner from my house sure\nWell we're we're glad that ah that we have you as a listener that does a radio station by the way in the\nIn Akron, Ohio which are which Michael listens to I guess you might have heard our guest data hill note that the Brazilian seemed to have faces which are fairly easy to read them I Would imagine you must have an observation or two of your own to add to that\nOh I have plenty of observations over here they're not that easy to read the number one\nIn my opinion [noise] um\nBrazilians are very friendly okay\nAnd I'm a very accommodating at that point and what's your story agitated like anybody in any country when you're educated they're easy to read but it people here in ... in fact I I'm\nJust start working at a hotel here I met an Irishman is the one that I speak English and stuff like that but I remember coming about I guess ... well past President Nixon right who is a right way\nTo get a facial or whatever at that point but uh it was in his parents well he was paranoid but he was paranoid not what the press told everybody that he was afraid is going to get treated the election\nWell there there was a certain amount of that I Would regret you were going to pretty much just stick to the topic at hand there I think a Michael and we appreciate your thoughts into your listenership is well my guess would be damned hill\nThat a a a lot of the ease of reading faces has to do with knowing what to look for so for example I might go to Brazil and or I might see a lot of expressive face was and I would say they're very expressive faces but I wouldn't know what I was seeing right\nYeah let's go back to happiness so at any expression essentially just like a wave that gathers has a peak and let's go so well as I look for when someone smiling and maybe initially maybe even perhaps superficially outgoing is do they really feel it\nSo that they don't feel at several things can happen one is that the smile comes onto quickly it's what I call a flash mob smile\nAnother one's the smile could drop away too quickly that's why I call I guillotine smile\nWhen someone's done with it had just gone and finally to smile lingers too long even for the best joke if someone last for more than about three seconds\nThey're probably browsing you because in visual cutting terms\nThirty frames per second is Ninety frames and three seconds and that's a really long duration for people to hold on to something so when I see an expression and maybe as the caller said you know they're superficial happiness\nAnd then they get agitated well anger is the second most common emotion after happiness\nSo they have it in combination fairly often and I'm looking for the type of anger how intense as it is as the caller said they're agitated if the eyebrows pulled together to getting together that's mostly confusion\nConcentration maybe a little bit of worry if the mouth ... lips pressed together a little bit\nWell now there's probably a little bit of resistance to what you're saying\nBut if they get a ball dj below the middle of the lower lip now there are steaming mad and so I look for those gradations in different places in the face and so you know I if I can do this I'm I'm half Norwegian there's a joke about the Norwegian American man who loves his wife so much he nearly told her so [laughter]\nSo I Am very funny than if I Can't do this in the region Scandinavian culture in from Minnesota then yes I can do it in a lot of places and in Minnesota if you left an eyebrow that's the equivalent of nuclear war believing in Brazil they show a lot more than a raise eyebrows and ...\nAll right to jog in Grand forks North Dakota although I had a show with our guest a certified facial ... down the hill and uh oh John welcome\nYou know thank you so much as this fascinates me and I spent Thirty years of my life in sales and direct commission and now you talked to a region I grew up in northwest Minnesota so I can relate to Norway stands as funny\nI'm now myself also hold his\nBody language fit into what you're talking about because I can ... you know as I got more into the profession I'm someone sitting back in the chair somebody lean\nForward aren't some table some people arms folded were\nReal indications of a folded are sitting back they're not all that interested or a lean forward oh okay I think they're listening you know how does this body length\nGerman but I'm sure a body language as hard as it let's ask our guest about that job Dana ... do you branch out into reading things besides faces\nA I certainly have studied body language you and I do things on national TV I've been an analyst on presidential debates for instance for CNN and Fox and MSNBC I've been on today's show\nSo in those instances on TV they're trying to help the viewer yes I'll branch out into body language but the reason I don't do it for my corporate clients is that they're simply more accuracy with the facial cutting and here's the reasons why\nOne is hand gestures they are very idiosyncratic and tied to cultures a hand gesture that's just fine in Belgium\nMight get you killed in Sicily for instance\nOr the next thing is that the caller is correct or there are gross body signals that can indicate there receptive are closed off to you and they're probably fairly reliable\nBut scientists in this field would account that body language signals are about sixty percent accurate and that financial cutting signals are eighty percent plus so you know I like the higher percentage\nAnd the last thing is that body language gestures can be coached and because there are large gross movements you can kind of fake at anyone who's ever watched their presidential debate a scene that probably the speech coach told him to do this gesture or moving this way or lean in at this moment\nWhereas again with the face of the only place in the body where the muscles attach right to the skin so it is the truest most immediate most in the moment barometer really ...\nAll right or to cover with our guest Dr data hill is founder and president of sensory logic dot com is the author of famous faces decoded published by sensory logic and subtitled a

people on the other talking and all of a sudden you become aware of\nOh no he did not just for that and you want to say something that just guidelines you don't believe it because you know it but the person you're talking to doesn't see it all\nYeah ... well lying is really interesting there are some astonishing statistics from a recent issue of National Geographic on line turns out I'm not quite sure how they got to the statistics but it is National Geographic southern inclined to believe apparently forty two percent of Americans typically tell up to five lies a day\nAnd another eleven percent of us actually exceed that intel over five lives a day so it does\nHappen with a great deal of frequency human beings essentially want to feel good about themselves and attract allies as resolve the truth can be a casualty quite often now do you I pick up instances where I can tell something strange is going on\nSo I'll give you one quickly I Am a meeting with ... they are showing me their latest TV commercial they get done when they say what do you think about it and I said well pretty good except for the third woman into the thirty second spot they said what's wrong I said well

of being open to others of seeking Tom activity so it sounds like your orientation is very much that direction\nWell and another thing too is a smile is a blessing and other people yeah you want to bless people you know smile at them\nYeah I Would say most people equate a happiness and smiling with sunshine a that's a pretty common formulation and and certainly makes plenty of sense\nWell thank you very much for speaking with me tonight\nCertainly created to really keep smiling thanks so much for your goal there are those are a different uh ... emotions are the ones which uh give away their

different ways it shows one is that lifting with tension in the corner of the mouth\nThe other one is when the upper lip players but on one side of the mouse only so that's about as simple as you can

the Republican National committee so you certainly couldn't accused the the RMC\nOf ah putting out a a survey that is biased against Republicans although perhaps you could argue that they were trying to scare people with this survey David Strauss indicated that fifty seven percent of the Republicans they surveyed\nOr don't believe the polls in and say that they expect that in fact Republicans will increase their strength in this midterm election or to my way of thinking that's a recipe for disaster for Republicans\nMade over confidence can hurt your very badly in elections are so I I Would hate to think that ever or believe that because I could see people at home or are under their beliefs that your neighbor as going to get your ... or\nBy like the confidence is one thing but I just hope it's not over confidence\nBecause I I think it's a very interesting thing about Donald Trump of course to ah to overshadow things when he was involved and obviously he's involved in anything governmental right now I think that the Democrats look at the ballot\nAnd they see Donald Trump I mean his name is not on there to be sure but they are desperate to vote against Donald Trump and Trump's absence on the ballot\nJust means of do vote against any Republican they see on the ballot I think that that's a factor of the Democrats see Trump on the ballot Republicans by contrast\nI think do see Donald Trump on the ballot or they see a lot of Republicans many of them congressional Republicans with whom they may not be necessarily a are in agreement or they may have serious problems with the uh the Republican Party on Capitol Hill\nAnd therefore they may be less motivated to vote I I've said from the beginning that there is one word that ought to to get Republicans motivated enough and that is an impeachment\nBecause of Nancy Pelosi winds up a speaker with just a one vote margin to Eighteen to to Seventeen\nI don't think there's any doubt that the Democrats will vote articles of impeachment before April\nAs they can definitely try but what did they really have a lot of sports\nYou know you don't have to have you on anything that they don't like him he's a he's a racist or sexist pig I mean you don't you don't have to have him on anything I mean what what's a high crime and the misdemeanor I mean those are words that I think Gerry Ford or set at a very accurately a lot of people took exception with one Ford said he said\nWhat is a high crime or misdemeanor that anything that a majority of the house says it is\n... ... is a chance to recoup screener if they don't get it won't be counterproductive Democrats than twenty twenty I mean aren't\nI don't know I'm not sure I mean there's such as the divisions in this country that I think that this will shore up the base for the Democrats I I really do now we ought to keep in mind of course\nThat that doesn't mean the president's going to re ... removed from office there's no way in the world that there will be sixty seven votes in this new Senate to remove the president from office that isn't going to happen and Bill Clinton of course survived two full terms in office having been impeached but not convicted\nYou on the other president ever impeached Andrew Johnson he serve out his full term\nIn the the White House so no president has ever been removed from office the only one who would have been was Richard Nixon and of course he crudely resigned before that fact could be proven\nBut I guess it's an embarrassment that the Democrats should hang around his neck and I don't think that they would pay any penalty at all I think they would that would pay dividends among the increasingly rabbit democratic electorate David\n... her new order from space clap our government waiters a broker finance and type in our time span or ...\nOr if they can tear we try to each him and are continually knocks accessible they give him his greatest talking or you're heading into a corner It's MORNING and I said before you ask your your your will open a secretary\nI was I was going to ask you about this so you're pretty sure they will okay All right\nYeah and I'm very confident that he runs again I'd go a step after this job for or you're here\nHe is of course the oldest president ever to be elected but I must say doesn't show any signs of a of a of age so I Would I Would tend to agree with you are in that regard you know a ... it'll really give him talking points but it'll give him talking points I think that will resonate much more with the Republican base and with the the Democrats\nWhich raises another interesting issue here that we might as well talk about and that is just how many people out there are persuadable\nI have to wonder in this country you've course if you've got your your hard core Republicans and your hardcore Democrats and a supposedly there are those in the middle and I'm sure there are some but who in the world\nIs undecided at this stage of the game I mean seriously ... there are so many uh tubs of partisanship one way or the other than it is hard for me to believe that a a large percentage of the population is persuadable\nI mean Donald Trump cure cancer that most of the Democrats out there would not vote for him and if a Donald Trump were caught raping and none in the middle of Pennsylvania Avenue at high noon I think a lot of Republicans would say well let's just Trump being Trump I just don't see a lot of people being persuadable David\nI mean I like to think that most Republicans are against illegal sexual assault but you had a lot of people have heard was on our side it's a it's really an amazing time in American politics collapse it will do for years and get that into the end of Obama's term the\nRhetoric that troll ah the\nThe seemingly hatred between one group or Americans or other uh its votes fascinating and sat at the same time\nAh so I Do not think many people are persuadable it's probably a very low percentage\nThis point you sort of exercise\nYeah and and not only have you have you picked aside but in in many cases\nYou have done so at a at does some considerable attack you've dug in your heels as some may have lost friends uh I can name at least one person but I won't bother to that I Believe would probably\nFall under the category of of a former friend of mine even though I have a number of friends of different viewpoints and we just tend to pretty much coal exist by my talking about the weather or sports teams and stuff like that\nBut uh I I yeah ... there's been so much in the way of pressure on people\nThat are due to the digging your heels even if you have second thoughts as a Democrat or a second thoughts as a Republican\nIt's it's hard to do admit them without losing face

G.\nAll right ah I'm just curious what are the odds at the moment and granted these things can change between now and the election some major develop may occur could be a major conflict somewhere in the world the economy could take a sharp up during the downturn all kinds of factors in Iran but as of right now\nWhat are the odds that the Democrats will let let's let's do the three for openers take the house [noise]\nTake the Senate or take both\nSo the Democrats are hurt your house and Senate\nAre that are are just pulled up the arts or Iraq because they do move around all day long I had a lot to do with a book makers that we're getting a little bit worried about the risk that we're taking\nA because I've been saving the Republicans the whole group or so we've been getting plus learning all the Democrats what that means there's about a hundred you'll get back a hundred and ten or you'll you know received two hundred and ... whereas a\nFavorite or negative Barney would mean you would have to bet a hundred and ten dollars to win that hundred\nSo it would have to risk more\nTo win the hundred on the Democrats right now but as soon as this caller but I call my guidance outlook but the odds back to the way I Want them now I Want people betting all the Democrats [laughter]\nOkay and and again if you're a stand for your talking now about a a business decision you're not talking about any any personal ah a political or ideological views you're talking about what is best for your company right\nAlthough I mean a little bit of my personal views might play into that in the end of the odds are my opinion in my opinion is that\nThe Republicans will take both the house and the Senate ah without in mind I Want to make it attractive for people to bet on the Democrats are on these that were taking up to a thousand dollars per person or some of the money is coming and extremely out you know the Democrats were advertising that uh will pay it out that if they do it\nUh so that's it's let's say a company decision because it is up to me to make us the ... and in my mind is to get people betting on the Democrats\nBut your view that is to say your view as one who makes a living setting odds of what will happen not to you or your hoped for outcome or anything of that nature but as objectively as you could look at it as you believe that the Republicans will retain control of both houses of Congress is that correct\nThat's correct I mean I'm a little bit cynical and the person uh the news is very one sided shall we say\nUh you know Republicans bad Democrats good as that annoys the Republican voter base more than anything else uh that fact alone I Believe will get them out ... ... votes\nOr even though they're confident that it's going to happen or I Believe that just people saying that the Democrats are shoe and ah which is definitely the\nThe chatter around right now will get Republicans are voting and we'll see uh the exact same situation where you had in two thousand sixty in a lot of hope for a democratic victory no result\nOf course there are also the traditional fact\nThat as a group or Republicans that have to say the people to form the Republican electorate simply tend\nTo devote more and it's also a fact that since ah Eighteen to Twenty one year olds got the vote they have been in every single election the age demographic least likely to cast a ballot I I can remember the first time I voted\nAnd I did so I felt that greatly empowered I mean I thought it was really big deal I suppose that that uh the only thing that I've hit in my life of an age related bases that that exceeded\nMy right to vote was when I got my driver's license and and ah it looking at another thing you look at a bronco bomb a man who was capable of winning the presidency twice\nAnd yet when Obama ask people to vote but he wasn't on the ballot they abandon the big time twenty or twenty overweight he uh he wins the election twenty tan says please vote democratic and the uh the Tea Party revolution occurred twenty twelve and Obama wins reelection\nName is on the ballot twenty four Jane his name is not on the ballot this time Republicans keep the house and they take the Senate so it remains to be seen I guess David whether or not a a Donald Trump has any more coat tails and block Obama had because he Obama didn't have very good coat tails\nWords were say Obama here at the demographics or how to work is uh would they be going out to vote for an old white woman\nThey'd have a tendency to they have their they tended to vote for Barack Obama they they they ... they could be an old white woman who was as a as liberal as could possibly be and in tune with a with their viewpoints than in tune with those abroad Obama as a group I Would say that uh\nProbably they would be less likely to vote for someone older or white or\nThat that's been their track record up till now we'll see we'll see if other factors change that but that's been their track record\nI mean Obama's kind of a tough yardstick here as he was hugely popular\nA not so much politically I as a person so he had that sort of charisma where even if you're a Republican you probably liked them out of it as a man maybe not as a politician but as a man you had to almost perspective I\nI don't see that Iran's wedding over to class and\nUpper this way I think that the bronco Obama probably would have been an entertaining gas donate\nA a a Saturday afternoon a a patio barbecue provided you kept me off of politics so that he didn't start preaching to you which I'm told he was a\nHad a tendency to do but if you just talk the small talk things in the in sports in the like I gather he would have been the ... a very personable companion now that that to

I Hope in an ... number of\nCounterterrorism measures here in in Iraq for the U.S government but I also lived and worked in the kingdom of Saudi Arabia for years and I work for the king of Jordan for five so the enemy that we faced on the middle of it or you understand the idea of their history um why they\nWhat they want and do what they do and uh primarily uh you know in their eyes if we don't worship their God or the way they uh they believe they ever right to kill us and they would have liked to annihilate a you know that\nElement of our population so uh that and that's what the grave above the grape is\nInteresting of course not every Muslim obviously feels that way or there will be a terror attack every five or ...\nYou know a listen listen I you know I I have a lot of Muslim friends including the king of Jordan who's at the Muslim a good man I'm but he is also\nAdamantly opposed to the radical extremists which he called the outlaws of Islam and uh you know basically says they hijacked the Koran for their own purpose you know\nThe hero of your book the grave above the grave is a Rick Raymond New York city police commissioner or to what extent is a wreck Raymond really berny Carrick\n[noise] um well the listen there's a lot in there especially a lot of the things that are ... you would read in the book about the NYPD\nYou know I had fifty five thousand people that work for me forty one thousand that those were uniformed officers besides you know the terrorism and besides the major crises\nA thousand things going on in the PCs office on a daily basis you know I tried to demonstrate that in the book so a lot of that came out of mail a reflection of my time in that office\nIn terms of uh of the basic outline of the plot or what are we talking about again with without giving away anything but just set us up if you would really grave above the grave\nWhere you have a you have the present day New York city police commissioner ... it's called to a shooting in or ... one of his cups or dead on severely injured and they'd say ... ... it's a it's a terrorism investigation comes out of that but\nThis is a guy that has had to live after September eleventh he was a captain in charge of the precincts where the towers were\nAnd his wife was killed them eleven so he has this the people that die and now he's wound up in this investigation where it started all over again and it takes them all over the country and the end of the globe and it makes for a quite a compelling story\nWhile he's six six five oh jumbo our number one eight six six five oh five or six to six Steve calls from Columbus ohio for our guests Bernard Carrick author of the grave above the grave good evening Steve\nThat evening I'm Lester ah Bernard a I got a question you know that Saudi airplanes were allowed to fly\nDuring nine eleven and a lot of acts in the U.S why we're not the nationals allowed but only the Saudis were loud\nI wasn't aware that there were exceptions made for the uh the banning of a of a air flights in this country is that true\nUm there were not flights that were banned from leaving a when the airports were open a wants the airports were up in the you know that anybody could leave but I think what he's talking about\nIs a specific flight that was allowed to leave I Believe that uh Boston I'm In it had a number of members of the royal family from Saudi Arabia on it uh and I don't recall now Seventeen years later I don't remember exactly what day that was but it was pretty close uh\nIt was three or four days right after the attack of the towers um in that the authorization for that's like leave 'em was given by Washington\nNow right now to uh the notion of what we need to be doing now if you were in a position or maybe I don't know I'm a secretary of homeland security or what have you in a position to to have some considerable safe so uh what would you be changing about our approach you said\nYour son foremost the is the border border controls border security um we have to have it secondly\nLet ice enforce the laws that are on the books you know you have all these people complaining about ice they're all they're doing is enforcing federal law and the one thing I Would do\nUm and and it has not been done but these mayors in these governors in these political leaders that interfere with the federal government's a enforcing the federal law the immigration customs law\nI Would I Would lock them up uh I Would not tolerate them interfering in stopping members of the federal agents basically from doing their job or I I it's wrong it's a crime it's against the law and if it was anybody else that was interfering\nHampering obstructing we'd lock them up\nOr they interfering with federal agents or simply failing to cooperate and I I certainly don't agree with the notion that I wanted actuary city\nIt's there is both a crime if you fail if the federal government it's ice wants to know where somebody is and they get released in and I'm not a serious pedigree questions that you would\nGive to a local law enforcement agency you are required by law by federal law to provide that information and these people aren't doing it in fact they turn around and they just see a NATO ally and and the and all this other stuff it's a crime and they should be held\nAccountable it ought to be in the very least if they're not held accountable that way than they should be denied a a federal money highway money education money or what have you absolutely\nAgree yeah I Do uh uh the routinely go through in airports if you could change that what'd you\nUm ... well the one thing I Would do is you know you probably have Seventy Seventy percent sixty Seventy percent of your airline travelers in the United states\nThey are business travelers they're travelers that are in and out of airports maybe two or three times a week that that's their job it's it's a part of their job I don't think we have to screen these people the way they do every single time\nOr the you know visitors from other countries perhaps but I I just thought I think we we overdo it\nYou know sometimes we we over punish 'em when we shouldn't be and that's one of the times I think we're throwing it fair enough\nAgain do we think Bernard carry for being with us denied the former New York city police commissioner\nIn New York Times best selling

over at the clearly some of this behavior but it wasn't just the uh the the bend the civil war that helped but there was this the general national attitude of a hit first and to think about it later\nJoined Freeman our guest the professor of history and American studies at Yale University was written the book the field of blood we talked about the famous painting of Charles Sumner and about the the fatal do all the only one of its type but you filed\nWhere there are other incidents of note that the UAW uncovered at putting together the fields of blood\nThere were I mean for one thing that the most obvious thing I Know it was just the amount of violence because um I don't\nKnow one who's really written about this before no one's discovered it before until I was just stunned as anyone else when I started uncovering all these incidents but yeah there are a number of incidents in the book that are kind of shopping um there's one that takes place in the Eighteen forties\nFor example that I think is probably the greatest display of firepower on before the house\nUh and in that particular case a there is a congressman from Ohio named Joshua getting she's giving an anti slavery speech and he's an aggressive anti slavery advocate and as he's seeking a fellow from Louisiana named John Dawson stands up some kind of position themselves in front of getting\nAnd pulled his gun and Cox it [noise] and unseemly to that a couple of other southerners come over and stand by his side and they're all armed as well and it seems that there are number of weak\nOr anti slavery advocates who come and stand by the side of getting because they don't want him to be standing there alone and so at least for a few minutes in the middle of this speech you have\nSix seven guy standing there many of them armed and it's sort of showdown now in the end in this case nothing happens and the first fellow Dawson thought better of it and he sits down and everybody else it down but just the idea that that\nHappened and that it has been invisible for so long is is pretty shocking\nUm but then later and Eighteen fifty eight there's um a big fights that even people at the time saw as being really noteworthy and kind of shocking and in this case it when you had night sessions overnight session so or late night sessions or in Congress\nInevitably something bad would happen because Congress and they were tired and they were grouchy they probably were drinking over dinner and so the atmosphere was bad and in this case\nA yes Eighteen fifty eight so we're getting a really close to the civil war and there's a lot of really powerful\nNorth versus south sentiment and there's a fellow named with the wonderful nineteenth century named ... should grow from Pennsylvania who objects to something while standing amidst a bunch of southern Democrats and a fellow from South Carolina\nI'm named Lawrence kids uh\nConfront him Britain's in tells them you want to object to something go stand among your friends don't stand on my friends at and ultimately a grow just love the kid and knocks him slash\nAnd as soon as that happens this hoard of southerners rushes to that spot some of them extensively to break it up but most of them to join in and on the best\nFriends of grow northern Republicans comes streaming across the whole the whole pack of them jumping over desks and chairs to get\nTo their friend and ally as quickly as they can and you end up with this vast rumble in the space before the speaker's chair in the house of representatives with these guys punching each other throwing the tunes and you know I mean a real mass rumble which\nDefinitely there's a comic element to it but at the same\nWho are watching it said wow you know that wasn't like one congressman getting\nIran another congressman and touching him that was north against self ... that was a group of armed northerners fighting a group of armed southerners in a packed that looked like a battle and innocence was\nWow gunfight at the vigil ... nuclear oh [laughter] really pretty remarkable stuff was there a\nMoment but could have been considered sort of a a a crossing the ruble God if you will of the of the bishops priests age if you will love old when he became the firing on Fort Sumter Missouri\nA bullet in Congress where uh people in retrospect did move back and say well that's what we really should have realized\nI actually don't\nThink so and I think that that's something valuable to think about\nI don't think there was the one crossing the line moment and I think nowadays dearly we talk about that sort of idea all the time do there wasn't I think it was a slow progression over time with things gradually getting worse and told by the second half of the Eighteen fifty things were really violent and it was clear\nThat there was a lot of enormous\nHostility between north and south but there was no solution and this was part of the challenge of writing the book the people who are in the country at that time and in Congress at that time they are not assuming there was a civil war time they're assuming that whatever they're doing they're not\nGoing to be causing trouble that in one way or another there'll be able to stave off trouble for no I don't think there was a sort of clear why the only the only love it when there's a very clear moment that people say oh wow something just happened is when the ... southern states the interest the seed from the union\nAnd southern congressmen stand up and to see their states from the union by leaving Congress and the literally people in the galleries and people on the floor of the house and Senate are watching the unions\nAs the southern congressmen stand up and leave and there is a moment than when one congressman stands up and says to the room the union is dissolved that's a clear line in the sand", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Jim Bohannon Show", "city": "Greenfield", "day": "01"}
