executive officer of the independent Institute and the eighties you Twenty one year old the youngest of the of the young voters\nThat is the group which has consistently or legs in an election ouch\nNotch voted or they vote but the the least of any any age group in the country and for reasons that I've never understood I remember casting my first ballot\nAnd I felt a a sense of empowerment or I can do when I got my driver's license which of course is another area which many young people can identify with with me in that regard but uh it's unfortunate because this is the method by which people that have an option of this country and if you don't use that\nThat uh that franchise or if you don't exercise you're franchise we have trouble nobody likes to flabby franchise\n[noise] yeah I think I think that's true um I Do think that this reflects the the cynicism and powerless nature of their outlook\nYeah but they make themselves powerless I Know you don't you don't get involved you know what are the issues you don't register to vote you don't vote well whose fault is it that you're powerless\nI Know and part of it also is the fact that they don't they don't have civic education they don't have any ... education American history they don't understand the world they live and\nWhere does that go I mean why did I Know and that is\nBecause of the failure of the of the ... the school system um and that's why you know that's another whole issue of you know the case for educational choice and so forth um\nWhich I think it is definitely in the ascendant but it it it is a reality and so that's why we were focusing\nOn the hook for them being the questions they were asking and the fact that they were not willing to trust the usual suspects those guys so to speak\nAnd the uh show the commanding heights of the culture and\nThey no longer trusted the political elites which is sort of catching up with the rest of the country but uh in their case especially now I'm millennials have left for college\nAnd are starting careers and their families and so they have to buckle down and figure out you know how are they going to get through all this\nSo they're look they're now they're even more interested in in the answers and practical way to get through this so uh that that was the motivation for\nA credit in the series in trading catalyst and so on so our our interest is to push this as far as we can uh we were talking before about uh the view that many millennials are supporting socialism\nUm and that people like Bernie Sanders talked about the Nordic countries and you were you were pointing out correctly that these countries are actually quite robust market based economy is and to give you an idea of the percentage of of ownership I'm In these countries is about Seventy five percent private of the wealth\nAnd if you compare that to\nSay a country like China China is just slightly lower than an art in order to countries in and of course is a very robust economy despite the problems with the government so um the uh I think the opportunities are enormous and just give you a further idea\nIf your rank the um\nThe levels of private wealth I'm a bike country ah it turns out that Denmark his twelfth Switzerland is for Norway is twenty third sweetness fifteenth I'm North Korea is if a bar\nHundred and eighty us but the U.S is Eighteenth so the so the U.S is lower than Denmark and Sweden\nWhich is a remarkable when you think about it we're going to come back and talk some more with David throat use founder president and chief executive officer\nOf the independent Institute the website independent dot org you learn more about these series the love of the catalyst one eight six six five oh Jim ... is our number and we'll be back with more of the bull headed Joe in just a moment\nWe\nHampton to bring the one on one by Hampshire touting and when I was seven by\nUm and uh the other words on the one hand they been miss educated understand history and the and the nature of an economy and so forth and the other hand they're intrigued by the idea of\nOf enterprise and innovation\nUm and uh so we think that all those kinds of factors should be part of the communication strategy for this generation and\nThose questions are not that different from other people around the world um who come from different cultures how do you make the ideas of liberty relevant\nAnd compelling for people so the the fact that millennials um are receptive in the way we're discussing um and we understand how they'd been missing educated they're misguided in interpreting certain things for example\nUm millennials have been taught\nThat the great recession and\nA two thousand eight was caused by greed and the free market\nAnd even though the reality of it is that the federal government created the recession because of the Community Reinvestment act that was started decades earlier that created a gigantic housing bubble and that was not sustainable it burst and of course the usual response was taken which was\nTo have government bail out the different firms that had gone off um and took these high risk um investments which were essentially either mandated by the government more in centered by the government now so\nWe will have will realize\nThat these kinds of um iconic examples of allegedly the failure of free markets are fallacies and that their cynicism about political authority is even more justified\nIt makes a huge difference in their receptive to the to the idea of liberty\nWill come back with more with my guest David the row again the website independent dot org ... he is the founder president and chief executive officer of the independent Institute and we're looking at in a way\nThat new ideas and

into the catalyst are out there and reaching out I uh\nI consider myself to be reasonably well informed uh on uh what's happening in this uh this country\nA I had never heard of these programs I guess it's a sign that maybe it's a sign of my own a lack of diligence and in finding out what's going on although we know now a or is it just a sign of how stratified we are that there are very few\nExperiences in common that the transcend the generations in this country that something like this could be happening I've long splits taken for granted for example David by standing in the supermarket checkout line that the uh\nThe names that are splashed across the tabloids first names only that I don't know who any of the bar anymore but I Would have hoped I ever would have heard something about this before now\nWell it's it's part of it is that we're we're going through channels that are not part of the traditional media and so it's really uh I I wouldn't call it a subversive but it's it's certainly\nA outflank in the traditional media are it is it is true however the for the first season we had something around a hundred and one million\nViews in the media and John just awful for example devoted one of his programs to love God and there are many columnist wrote about it many other places\nAre and of course yourself taking the time um it's something that is in the ... it's in the sentence and I think that's the good news is if if it was something that wasn't getting traction and I think we'd have to reconsider\nFame into that we have a call from Ben in New York City who joins us now good evening Ben\nHow're you doing guys I'm actually not in New York City I'm On Long Island\nClose enough okay go ahead\nAnd ah well I don't really have a question I just wanted to say that I think you're you're going a little bit under any age category here with uh the home with the millennial thing because I'm thirty five but I guess that puts me at like the higher end of what a millennial is even though I I Would identify more as generation X\n'cause I grew up around people that you know where I was the older generation that are now about forty\nAnd I identify more as generation X then and generation y which became a so called millennial by anybody that's an undergrad in college right now is younger than a millennial according to the map\nThat said they'd be like Generation Z that's right he's a new one they have a younger than that that are you All right so the lady I was\nAbout twenty three like my youngest brother would be at that that the youngest of the millennials and he's already graduated college and had the job so you're\nYou're you're absolutely right and you are a millennial you're actually in the the upper half tier of millennials which I think goes to the age of ... of a thirty eight now\nUm and of course these categories are imprecise you know there there are many different kinds of millennials but overall there is a certain pattern to them and that pattern is not unique to millennials it is true with younger\nPeople as well so that when we developed this this program the original season one was targeting primarily college age and through young adults um your declares the second season is primarily focusing on early career is as the millennial\nUm group sort of passes through the demography\nAh so I think that it's a it's a very much as a way you're describing it one thing I should also point out this goes back to something that Jim was mentioning\nAbout the cynicism about millennials in it it's also true with younger people as well\nBoth children is an organization that offering extracurricular enrichment activities for children all\nAbility I mean we have autism can Down syndrome and kids with no diagnosis we've

Carter\nDime novels and so on uh I I think we might mention too that they're they're interesting parallels between these two men because um they both they both are the sons of immigrants they both\nHave a fathers who are are legitimate businessmen\nA barber in components case and in a nest this case of really quite successful Baker who had bakeries and in the Chicago area and I think it was the end the ... or influence of a brother or my brother in law Alexander Jamie who became a federal agent\nAnd the kind of um I think the melodrama and romance of fat\nActual real life detective being in his life really uh really drew a next to it and there's also the element of of him being\nA very very smart young man who ... who for a while it looked like he was going to be a lawyer and I'm\nAlso you know you have lawyers and doctors\nBut he looks at law enforcement and see that things are changing that forensics is coming in and that level of sophistication coming into law enforcement the adding existed before\nAnd he sees as an opportunity to make law enforcement a real legitimate professions and so so that's his ambition that's his path fairly early\nBecause he's very on both of these men are quite young when when they're famous struggle happened uh you know the late twenties and the case of of a\nMess and uh ... depending on where your data from you know you have you have ... in his mid twenties basically up into a a too is just as early thirties when he's at is at its height\nAnd his downfall so so you have a you have these kind of parallel track between these two men because component is viewing is one of the first to really view\nCrime as a business as a as an industry as a best friend so I have these two professional law enforcement and crime on a on a collision course in history\nYou know I ended up they both died rather young actually a couple of them was a forty eight ... before\nI get components forty yes for forty eight um he had just turned forty eight um and and that's in particular they both sort of had\nUm a longstanding ... a health condition that they picked up early in their their lives in in ... case it was the syphilis that ends up uh seriously manifesting itself when when he's in prison with NASA it's a it's a childhood heart condition um\nThat he got one from rheumatic fever when he was a kid so they're both in some ways destined or from very early on to live\nLong lives and it's just a remarkable for me particularly sitting here\nI'm only I'm only twenty eight years old which is the same age that that was when he was leading the ... and you you can't help comparing yourself to\nTo rally a nest and thinking I've lived a pretty easy life by comparison of gangsters aren't out are trying to get me\nWe have

released a he had he was he stayed most of his his prison term in Alcatraz or and then after he had to sort of psychotic break brought about by syphilis he was transferred to another institution in

one eight six six or five oh five a\nSix to six on the boat had a job I was noticing I a a website that uh well it has to do with a Christian persecution and quite frankly and I was just looking at some of the ah\nOf Vladimir ... and the Russians are they still remains a very important alliance the Turks for a while we're tried to obtain membership and that other Western European gathering the European Union but they at the time they were applying base simply\nWe're moving in the direction away from a political freedom and uh they didn't pass muster\nSo the turkey which was once a a pretty reasonable ally with the the Israelis has gone the other direction\nThey haven't got all the way there's really not Iran or Sudan\nBut this latest the circumstance is just the latest example of what can happen when a country that falls into the throes\nOf a religious fanatics and that's the direction that turkey seems to be heading so we're certainly glad to hear that a river and Andrew Brunson\nHas in fact\nBeen freed and I think we can safely say he will never return to turkey which would feel like a pretty smart move on his part\n[noise] uh\nThe court in the turkey had sentenced him to three years in the months in prison for his conviction\nA but since he had already spent two years in detention he will not serve any more time runs that had rejected the espionage and terror related charges in strongly uh maintained or to the country that he had to gauge the no such activity\nAnd it it seems again that it's highly unlikely that he did or that he would uh what it sounds like\nHe has another attempt at taking a shot if you will\nAt a at Christians in this world and I'm just curious you are your thoughts about all this is this a a case of hyper sensitivity on the part of Christians as is a case of a a exaggerating it would seem not by the statistics I gave a just a moment ago\nThey were granted there are an awful lot of Christians in the world are but there does seem to be a fair amount of persecution and what is particularly telling in many cases is the extent to which much of the world will look the other way [noise]\nAh like they're they're only Christians\nAnd that's a a an odd attitude\nUnless of course I suppose you you fall in with the\nIdentity politics kind of nonsense that well Christians tend to be a a rich wealthy white western countries or some such nonsense which of course by the way it is not even particularly true but if it were it still would be ah beside the point\nWhere or at least it ought to be a beside the point\nIs that it is ironic indeed that uh\nSome people in the west who\nMost express themselves with the the various freedoms that we have who make the greatest use of those freedoms are the least willing to defend them\nIt it's ironic certainly if the forces of fundamentalist Islam or where to take over this country the people they would go after first would be what they would consider to be the liberate teen residents of safe places like Hollywood for example\nAnd yet those people in their mad quest to appear to be a freebie tolerant uh we'll try to show tolerance for the most intolerant people on the planet is kind of bizarre just kind of bizarre most of the central tenets of western civilization\nOr actually nourished\nBy the Christian Church and I certainly would not be one to say that the Christianity has an on blemish record in this world certainly the or the Spanish Inquisition just to be one particular example\nBut in terms of a of a civilized influence and in terms of of the push toward personal freedom\nOr despite any number of of instances you can point out which ah\nChristianity was not always on the side of freedom the overall thrust of it throughout history has been in that direction and the countries which have become the most free had been nations in which Christianity has been the dominant religious force and conversely the countries in which\nAre the greatest persecution has taken place with the exception to view a totalitarian communist nightmares like North Korea or the area of the world that is most consistently um free\nUnstable on wealthy would be the swath of territory from roughly a Morocco across North Africa eastward through Egypt in the middle east and the further east do you get as far as Pakistan that swath of predominantly Islamic countries is ah\nThe armpit of this planet in terms of most ah\nStandards of uh of human conduct of behavior and the living conditions\nAnd since Islam in that swath of territory is so dominant or if in fact it were a pasture or a pastoral paradise you'd have to give them credit and since\nIt's not then so the blame must go in that direction I'm not sure exactly what it is but uh it's just unfortunate\nAnd uh again yes of course there are many fine Muslims in the world but in many cases it would have to be said that they are fine in spite of their faith and not necessarily because of it [noise]\nSo I find it odd that there are so many apologist\nFor some of the excesses of Islam particularly in that portion of the world where it is the predominant faith and so many people are willing to persecute or at the very least look the other way at persecution of Christianity which certainly in recent centuries has become a force\nAnd one of the principal forces in support of the notion of free expression of individual rights to host of other things that could be put under the general [noise] a title of the western civilization\nJust a sad circumstance\nOne would like to think that the the release of the river and Andrew Brunson\nIs a sign that this is changing and turkey are my guess would be it's more of a sign of the pressure placed on the Turks by a President Trump and not necessarily a sign of any kind of significant change in\nTheir policies the Turkish government is moving\nPretty stride and Lee in the direction of an Islamic point of view not good for turkey not good for the region not good for NATO not good for Europe of course the tiny chunk of turkey remains of the European continent with the bulk of it of course in the in Asia Minor\nIt's an unfortunate circumstance\nAnd we're happy for Andrew Brunson happy for his release happy that in fact uh this story has had a happy ending but for so many others that has not been the case and I'm just curious\nHow you folks feel about that one eight six six five oh jumbo one eight six six five oh five four six to six\nThere are many things in this world which are get curious er and curious or as they used to say in the Alice in wonderland\nAnd it is it is odd indeed\nThat one of the central forces for personal freedom in the world that I think it's safe to say that that is generally true of Christianity or can be so persecuted at times and the ... and for the civilized world to look the other way as a persecuted\nWhereas a of a force which with the exception of the ... versions of a of a communism that still exist in places like North Korea there is no more despotic or I'm Free portion of the planet\nThat that portion of the world which is predominantly Islamic that's not a condemnation of every Muslim\nBut it is I think a fair condemnation\nOf the portion of the world which is predominantly Islamic where are the home grown democracies of that area where are the home grown supporters of a personal rights of the like uh the home grown supporters in that part of the world for freedom of religion for example\nOr the answer is\nThey are anywhere but don't exist\nIt's a it's that will come back we'll take some calls but it just struck me that while I'm happy for a rubber Brunson that uh this is a\nA happy episode and what is the remaining a very unfortunate dismal and the depressive world condition and that is the the persecution of Christians who are considered I suppose handy by regimes such as the\nBugs who currently run turkey one eight six six five oh jumbo our number one eight six six five oh five four six to six we'll be back with more in just a moment\n\nWhen fat whether his age and the steps to bad weather when you read it which is one of these storms have had a chance to be one on one five [noise] for\nOut and real pretty Gloucester the Russian border in in the New York and when suddenly ...\nYeah that's what we're observing but you know what I Want to talk about is the Turkish government of today is not the ... when I was there\nNo no absolutely not uh\nThey they were completely different um in fact the way I understand their constitution is written in\nSuch a way that a sort of most ... law cannot be instituted now that's the way it was written yes yeah everyone is trying to change it now\nAnd the and he tried to change it officially unofficially I guess it's largely changed\nThat yeah it's and that's a shame because when I was there I mean I got along with a Turkish papal fantastic and say to this day I have several Turkish friends and what I get a kick out of most of among restaurants when I walked in the first time a greater them in their neighborhood native language they looked at like I had two heads\nBecause they never had an American do that to them but you know it's a shame that a country with the histories that it has and the inroads it has made into modern technology and how they have developed or cities\nIn the last uh forty years uh is going to is they're trying to pull back into the dark ages and I think that's a darn shame and I didn't know why the people of the country are standing around a little allowing that to happen\nBecause there are various factions just as it has happened in Iran you have any number of people who who can\nFollow the notion of a of individual

you can follow me on Twitter at Jim Botox as though be taking a look tonight at the forthcoming mid term elections and some of the issues that exist out there\nIn that particular among that group among the electorate which since they first got the vote has been the least likely to vote\nAnd that is to say the millennials are into those younger than that to particularly the Gen x rays and people of of that nature\nWill find out a bit of why uh this uh this is a one eight six six five oh Jim bar number one eight six six five oh five or six to six with our guests are\nDavid throw he is the founder president and chief executive officer of the independent Institute and publisher of the independent review David good evening\nGood evening to a gym\nAnd ah let's just start out by taking a look at a couple of projects that you have a a instituted here are the love God love and the catalyst for or these\nWell I'm a few years ago we created a video series on YouTube to target millennials\nCalled love of it's a satire of its on liberty but it's a satire of big government and what triggered this um is the fact that millennials are voted overwhelmingly both times for Obama or as you said didn't vote\nAnd the basic view that they had was the government's going to take care of them and uh the Democrats' progressive and so forth believe they had this generation and their hip pocket\nBut they want a guarantee sort of lock it in that they keep on voting them an office and the way they're going to do that was Obamacare get the kids to enroll\nCan look to become dependent on will keep on voting a sin and um that was the plan but something happened on the way which they didn't expect which was you may remember that when the Obamacare website came on line it didn't work\nEven though Sanders has never said anything critical Venezuela or Cuba or the former Soviet Bloc or North Korea what what he says well we need to look at the Nordic countries the Scandinavian countries like Denmark Sweden and\nNorway and the claim is that these are socialist countries and they work well and people are prospering and there's a high standard of living and so on the the problem though is that\nThe all three of these countries um basically the the property that exists the assets are owned a overwhelmingly privately about Seventy five percent of the wealth in all three of these countries is owned privately and the economy generally speaking our market based economy\nVery much so in fact is we're we're overdue for a break which we will take you are but we need to emphasize something the only way\nThat the Scandinavian countries could ever afford the extremely expensive cradle to grave kind of coverage that they have is by having road bust\nPrivate sectors that I mean private sectors that are are far more open and free of regulation than ours are I mean it's not ... that's something that people don't realize that they think that this is just some giants duck\nA socialist a would be paradise well some of the programs were socialistic but the economy is very private sector or they couldn't afford it we're going to come back and talk some more what a fascinating idea of finally reaching people\nWho have do a great extent withdrawn from the system I mean they they still have complaints but they don't seem to know how to articulate them or to or to

[noise]\n\nThanks for being with us on the jumbo Hannah Joe and one eight six six five oh Jim bowl one eight six six five oh five or six to six with our guest David Thoreau founder president and chief executive officer of the independent Institute and the Eighteen to Twenty one year old the youngest of the of the young voters\nThat is the group which has consistently legs in an election out notch voted or they may vote but at the at the least of any any age group in the country and for reasons that I've never understood I remember casting my first ballot\nAnd I felt a a sense of empowerment or I can do when I got my driver's license which of course is another area which many young people can identify with with me in that regard\nBut uh it's unfortunate because this is the method by which people have an option in this country if you don't use that that uh that franchise uh you'd be able to exercise your franchise we have trouble but nobody likes to flabby franchise\nYeah I think I think that's true um I Do think that this reflects the the cynicism and powerless nature of their outlook\nYeah but they make themselves powerless I Know you don't you don't get involved in it were the issues you don't register to vote you don't vote well whose fault is it that you're powerless\nI Know and part of it also is the fact that they don't they don't have civic education they don't have access to education American history they don't understand the world they live and\nWhere to go I mean why did I Know and that and it is\nBecause of the failure of the of the ... the school system um and that's when you know that's another whole issue of you know the case for educational choice and so forth um\nWhich I think is is definitely in the ascendant but it it it is a reality and so\nThat's why we were focusing on the hook for them being the questions they were asking and the fact that they were not willing to trust the usual suspects does Ike guy so to speak\nAnd the uh so the commanding heights of the culture and\nThey no longer trusted the political elites which is sort of catching up with the rest of the country but uh in their case especially now I'm millennials have left for college\nAnd are starting careers and families and so they have to buckle down and figure out you know how are they going to get through all this\nSo they're look there's you know they're even more interested in in answers and practical way to get through this so uh that that was the motivation for\nUh creating the series and creating catalyst and so on so our our interest is to push this as far as we can uh we were talking before about uh the view that many millennials are supporting socialism\nUm and that people like Bernie Sanders talked about the Nordic countries and you were you were pointing out correctly that these countries are actually quite robust market based economy is and to give you an idea that percentage of of ownership I'm In these countries is about Seventy five percent private of the wealth\nAnd if you compare that to\nSay a country like China China is just slightly lower than an art in order to countries in and of course is a very robust economy despite\nThe problems with the government so um the uh I think the opportunities are enormous and just give you a further idea if your rank the um\nThe levels of private wealth I'm a country ah it turns out that Denmark has twelve\nSwitzerland is for Norway is twenty third sweetness fifteenth I'm North Korea is at the bottom of hundred ATF but the U.S is Eighteen so the so the U.S is lower than Denmark and Sweden\nWhich is a remarkable when you think about it we're going to come back and talk some more with David throw us founder president and chief executive officer\nOf the independent Institute the website independent dot org you learn more about these series the love Gov and the catalyst one eight six six five oh Jim ... is our number and we'll be back with more on the ... in just a moment\n\n\nGiving point valid one on one by one seven five and a fourteen hundred and\nForty ... Jim ...\nUh and uh the other words on the one hand they miss educated understand history and the and the nature of an economy and so forth and the other hand they're intrigued by the idea of of enterprise and innovation\nUm and uh so we think that all those kinds of factors should be part of the communication strategy for this generation and\nThose questions are not that different from other people around the world um who come from different cultures how do you make the ideas of liberty relevant and compelling for people\nSo the the fact that millennials um are receptive in the way we're discussing um and we understand how they've been miss educated they're misguided in interpreting certain things for example um millennials have been taught\nThat the great recession in\nA two thousand eight was caused by greed and the free market and even though the reality of it is that the federal government created the recession because of the Community Reinvestment act that was started decades earlier\nThat created a gigantic housing bubble and that was not sustainable it burst and of course the usual response was taken which was\nTo have government bail out the different firms that had gone off um and took these high risk um investments which were essentially either mandated\nBy the government more in centered by the government now so we don't have to realize that\nThese kinds of um iconic examples of allegedly the failure of free markets are fallacies and that their cynicism about political authority is even more justified\nIt makes a huge difference in their receptive city to the idea of liberty\nWill come back with the more with our guests David the row again the website independent dot org ... he is the founder president and chief executive officer\nOf the independent Institute and we're looking at in a way that new ideas and thoughts can actually be transmitted to a generation that has rejected a lot of the Tricia traditional ways that we do that more than ... money six six five oh jumbo back in the moment\nI'm Jay foreigners CEO of Quicken Loans America's premier home purchase lender today's fluctuating interest rates can leave you with unexpected higher mortgage payments\nQuicken Loans we created a new way to protect you from unpredictable interest rates so you can buy a home with certainty it's called ratio and here's how it works with ratio you can lock your interest rate while you shop for a new home so afraid to go up you don't have to worry and here's the best part if rates go down you get to lower rate with ratio we really have you covered\nHere are more reasons why you want to work with America's largest mortgage lender for eight years in a row now JD power has rank Quicken Loans highest in the nation and customer satisfaction for primary mortgage rich nation and for the fifth year in a row they've also rank just highest in the nation for mortgage servicing rate shield\nAnother way we can save your money on your mortgage college today at eight hundred quicken or go to rocket mortgage dot com\nBasin right where he said in comparison to public records racial approval only thirty three year project transactions Holocaust information and get an equal housing lender licensing office he said I don't want them or thirty thirty additional conditions are actually just may apply\nTo night ten nine central on ABC finish the sentence for millennia Trump is the first lady the age of ten women in the me too movement call you a supporter Milo question is off limits you're not the first first lady to have to deal with her husband's alleged infidelity niece has just put a strain on your marriage\nTonight won the lottery or Trump say let's talk about the jacket why did you wear V.
