we're taking a look\nAt the things that are my possibly come before new Supreme Court justice Brett Kavanaugh including mainly gun issues in this particular instance in that scenario of course where there have been many many resounding battle that has occurred at the Supreme Court Charles calls in Springfield, Missouri this evening hello Charles\n[noise] Hi there how you doing this to ban and I'm fine thank you [noise]\nUm I was listening and I you know you hit on a topic that's always been a kind of a hot button for me and that is how the liberals always do get these ideologues that you know completely side with them but the um you know people get\nBored you know anytime that a conservative tries to get someone that really is on their side and not some halfway you know a ... a you know the Democrats are an absolute said that we the the conservatives do nothing they they have constantly there the\nThe party of appeasement and they need some on this got some fighting in just says no or we're going to fight for this\nCan we just haven't seen it I mean I look at the Democrats and how they treated cabinet and that'd be despicable\nAnd either party however why don't we ever fight [laughter] you know where you can fight they put up\nYeah the ... that's a good point I Would argue has to do address and I certainly agree with the Charles uh\nAbsolutely uh Dave in regard to the notion of ah the next time there's a a a Democratic president if we put up a liberal justice will be start coming up with the stories about how they uh they uh the litter or have overdue parking tickets or what have you I think that that is is droves noted that disgusting practice\nBut uh I was wondering I have Republicans thought hard enough regarding some of the more liberal a recent pick say for example a bronco Obama's pick some of which I I think sailed a ride through I mean it seems to be Republicans tend to follow the the the victim\nIt's the president's choice than at the nominee is qualified I can go with it whereas Democrats followed the victim uh I disagree with that person therefore anything and everything is fair game\nWell I I think if you look at it from the perspective of Republicans credit follow the constitution a little bit more than the Democrats do at least in this issue or and and they they are a collegial bunch of\nPeople which I'm not too sure that pays off anymore collegiate are being collegial doesn't work too well when you were in a bar fight\nAnd that's what we just witness frankly you know I I remember back when I was in high school\nAnd we talked about all this stuff in American government and and you know I had some good teachers back then people who weren't really afraid to ah to speak out call a spade a spade and say look you know people do this but\nThat's wrong it's not the government is supposed to work nowadays a ... it's almost like a a a\nPitch battle you know a food fight and what they tried to do to a Brett Kavanaugh the Democrats are with this eleventh hour Hail Mary thing bringing up the um [noise] uh the Ford accusations and and and frankly I have a lot of sympathy for I think she got thrown under\nThe bus a fifth of the dogs the ... just in order to uh to try to derail\nThe cabin on nomination uh they were both ... and it would probably be who the the Republicans now especially if they retain control on Capitol Hill after November\nTo launch some investigations into just how did that become public or what we witnessed with a judge can now justice cab at all or was it just deplorable if not despicable\nAnd uh you know I I wrote about this I've covered this thing for liberty park press and the gun Meg and I'm going to continue to cover it\nUh because I think what happened there was wrong and and certainly the polls\nSeem to be indicating that to the public is just riled up this really has fired up the Republican base I think\nIt's bringing people out to vote who probably wouldn't have voted at the midterms but Jim they're angry and and they have some people that they were angry at they can identify the people that they're really mad at me and I kinda think the Democrats are they might have blown this\nOne well we'll see certainly both bases seemed to be quite fired up we'll see who does the turnout trick the best Sharon in grain Missouri hello\nCan you can um you know I Hope that justice Kavanaugh\nJust vote\nThe constitution that but I Want to get to do I want to make a law I don't want them to a pack a day on the court I why ... pilot okay for some time that going to be happy with\nThat although it may go against something that I think by parents and then I Will I Will abide by ... and support it I hired this court\nAh making law than they are not supposed to get that that is currently I Want everybody to do their job Congress to do their job presidents yeah there are guys and they did bishop branch to did they\nCan for those in the judicial branch who do not do their job or I Would keep in mind one thing uh Sharon and I'll just notice to today as well you look at the constitution that information constitution\nOf the house is spelled out in the constitution the Senate\nThe president's either the chief executive officers the cabinet heads and the like and then you come of course to the article three the or the judicial branch of that is is particularly interesting because it says the judicial power of United States shall be vested in one Supreme Court\nAnd in such inferior courts as we Congress may from time to time ordain and establish that is to say all of the appellate courts the district courts are creations of Congress Congress can simply repeal any of those scores anytime it so chooses Dave\n[noise] yeah and I think we also know if you if you study the laws really will judges are on the lower federal courts\nAnd and there's even been some mentioned I think ... New York that is that is the liberal democratic congressman go ahead\nYeah and it it he's apparently already talking about a trend to I'm a recall or get rid of justice Kavanaugh\nYou can only do that by impeaching him convict\nI Know and and didn't just you know impeachment is just ... that came right out of left field but I think that shows just how extremist some of these people really are on the D side of the aisle and the country is looking at this and they don't like it no I\nThe base which increasingly has as Democrats or rather nervous or after what happened to Joe Crowley the New York other New York congressman but again keep in mind as in the case of the presidency\nIf the Democrats get so much as a bare majority in the house yes I'm sure the articles of impeachment against Donald Trump and possibly Kevin ... they'll never get sixty seven votes in the Senate to convict so it's not something that I've gone to lose any sleep over it will be back and just a moment\nWe\nHampton degree one on one side in Hampshire touting and one Seventy five\nFor most of the ... last fifty for gay for Tuesday partly sunny and warm high Seventy six to eight ten for Wednesday partly sunny and warm ties around eighty degree I was on his farm team urologist Adam Cohen one on one side and one of ...

frankly I think\nWe just witnessed with the cabinet or\nA confirmation process the rules just got changed even even Senator Lindsey Graham who is typically a laid back guy he ... his things were out the other day he was\nFurious at his Democratic colleagues are on the the Senate Judiciary committee and I don't think that's going to go away I think they changed the rules and you know what they're going to have to live with that for a very long time in ... when Republicans\nCome back and say there is a Democrat is president uh sometime in the next four to eight years on and we'll see how that works out or if\nIf someone is nominated to a a vacancy on the high court I think the globe's could easily come back off again and and I ... what is what good does it do for the country I don't know I don't know what some of these people are thinking\nWell I I I can tell you what some of them are thinking and then we'll take a quick break here but a lot of Democrats are really running very scared

at the\nThings that are my possibly come before new Supreme Court justice Brett Kavanaugh including mainly gun issues in this particular instance and that's an area of course where there have been many many resounding battle that has occurred at the Supreme Court Charles calls in from Springfield, Missouri this evening hello Charles\n[noise] Hi there how you doing Mr Bannon I'm fine thank you [noise] um I was listening and I\nA kind of a hot button for me and that is how the liberals always do get these ideologues that you know completely side with them but the um you know people get\nBored you know anytime that a conservative tries to get someone that really is on their side and not some halfway you know a ... a you know the Democrats are an absolute said but we the the conservatives do nothing they they have constantly there the\nThe party of appeasement and they need some on this got some site and then in just says no or we're going to fight for this\nAnd we just haven't seen it I mean I look at the Democrats and how they treated cabinet that'd be despicable and either party however why don't we ever fight\nYou know where you fight they put up\nYeah well that's a that's a good point I Would argue has to do address and I certainly agree with the Charles uh\nAbsolutely uh Dave in regard to the notion of or the next time there's a a a Democratic president if we put up a liberal justice will you start coming up with the stories about how they uh they uh the litter or have overdue parking tickets or what have you I think that that is a drought noted that disgusting practice\nBut uh I was wondering I have Republicans fought hard enough\nRegarding some of the more liberal a recent pick say for example a Brock Obama's pick some of which I I think sailed a ride through I mean it seems to be Republicans tend to follow the the the victim\nIt's the president's choice then it's a nominee as qualified I can go with it whereas Democrats followed the victim uh I disagree with that person therefore anything and everything is fair game\nWell I I think if you look at it from the perspective of Republicans tried to follow the constitution a little bit more than the Democrats do at least in this issue or and and the the or a collegial bunch of\nPeople which I'm not too sure that pays off anymore collegiate are being collegial doesn't work too well when you were in a bar fight\nAnd that's what we just witness frankly you know I I remember\nBack when I was in high school and we talked about all this stuff in American government and and you know I had some good teachers back then people are weren't really afraid to ah to speak out call a spade a spade and say look you know people do this but\nThat's wrong it's not the way the government is supposed to work now days or ... it's almost like a a a\nPitch battle you know a food fight and what they tried to do to Britain cabin or the Democrats are with this eleventh hour Hail Mary thing bringing up a um uh the Ford accusations and and and frankly I have a lot of sympathy for I think she got thrown under the\nBus a fifth of the dogs the ... just in order to\nUh to try to derail the Kavanaugh nomination or they were both ... and it would probably be who've the the Republicans now especially if they retain control on Capitol Hill after November\nTo launch some investigations into just how did that become public or what we witnessed with a judge Kavanaugh dental justice cabinet all or was it just deplorable if nut despicable\nAnd uh you know I I wrote about this I've covered this thing for liberty part for us and the gun Meg and I'm going to continue to cover it\nBecause I think what happened there was wrong and and certainly the polls seem to be indicating\nThat to the public is just riled up this really has fired up the Republican base I think\nIt's bringing people out to vote who probably wouldn't have voted at the midterms but Jim they're angry and and they have some people that they were angry at they can identify the people that they're really mad at me and I kinda think the Democrats are they might have blown this\nOne well we'll see certainly both bases seemed to be quite fired up we'll see who does the turnout trick the best Sharon ingrained Missouri yellow\nRed herring I can um you know whole\nJustice Kavanaugh\nYes vote the constitution that but I Want to get to get up wanting to make I don't want them to win a contest on the court I why then Apollo okay but for some time that going to be happy with that\nAlthough it may go against something that I think back pac man I Will I Will abide by ... and support it I hired this cork\nA making law and then they are not supposed to do that that is kind of guy I Want everybody to do their job Congress to do their job ... their guy and they did they show branch to do their\nCamp for those in the judicial branch who do not do their job or I Would keep in mind one thing uh Sharon and I'll just note this do today as well you look at the constitution that information and constitution\nOf the house is spelled out in the constitution the Senate\nThe president's either the chief executive officers the cabin and heads and the like and then you come of course to the article three the judicial branch of that is is particularly interesting because it says the judicial power of the United states shall be vested in one Supreme Court\nAnd in such inferior records as we Congress may from time to time ordain and establish that is to say all of the appellate courts the district courts are creations of Congress Congress can simply repeal any of those courts anytime it so chooses Dave\n[noise] yeah and I think we also know if if you study the laws really will judges are on the lower federal courts in and there's even been some mentioned I think ... in New York\nThey added that is the liberal democratic congressman going\nOn yeah and it it he's apparently already talking about a trend to I'm a recall uh get rid of justice Kavanaugh all you can\nOnly do that by impeaching him convict\nI Know and and and just you know impeachment is just ... that came right out of left field but I think that shows just how extremist some of these people really are on the east side of the aisle and the country is looking at this and they don't like it\nYou know I'm I'm sure they don't and I'm sure this appeals to the base which increasingly has a has Democrats rather nervous\nOr after what happened to Joe Crowley the New York other New York congressman but again keep in mind as in the case of the presidency\nIf the Democrats get so much as a bare majority in the house yes I'm sure the articles of impeachment against the Donald Trump and possibly Kevin ... they'll never get sixty seven votes in the Senate to convict so it's not something that I'm going to lose any sleep over it will be back and just a moment\n\nGiven point valley one on one five seven five fourteen hundred and\nForty ... gym\nSome of these things are obviously they at least somebody had to know about this did they ask the tough questions but I frankly I think\nWe just witnessed with the cabinet or a confirmation process the rules just got changed even even Senator Lindsey Graham who is typically a laid back guy he ... his things were out the other day he was\nFurious at his Democratic colleagues are on the Senate Judiciary committee and I don't think that's going to go away I think they changed the rules and you know what they're going to have to live with that for a very long time in ... when Republicans\nCome back and say there is a Democrat is president uh sometime the next four to eight years on and we'll see how that works out uh if if\nIf someone is nominated to a a vacancy on the high court ah I think the gloves could easily come back off again and and I ... what is what good does it do for the country I don't know I don't know what some of these people are thinking\nWell I I I can tell you what some of them are thinking and then we'll take a quick break your but a lot of Democrats are really running very scared right now the below happened to them is the same as what happened to Joe Crowley the prominent or\nA Democratic House member many thought my maybe a successor to Nancy Pelosi has Democratic House leader beaten by this Alexandria Ocasio Cortez\nWho doesn't know as much as they used to stick to pass in eighth grade civics class back when they had such things and just just cleaned his clock and now you've got to of course Dianne Feinstein let's not forget her situation in California because of that law out there where everybody runs in one primary and the top two finishers\nAutomatically go on the ballot in November which means that the Republicans this year have nobody on the ballot for Senate you've got Feinstein the incumbent\nAnd you've got a Democrat even further to the left that she is and the California Democratic party endorsed her opponent a lot of these Democrats I think in their heart of hearts are probably not thrilled with this but first and foremost they want to keep their jobs\nAnd they are running hard scared because of their own left or just imagine a state in which\nDianne Feinstein is considered just a little too conservative we'll be back and just a moment from a ...\nIn

Supreme Court now than it has it's neither justice Brett Kavanaugh who\nOfficially shows up for work tomorrow today being a Columbus Day a federal holiday or this was what ... going back to the D.C versus Heller\nA decision and this is what a judge Kavanaugh had to say in the twenty eleven\nIn and I'm quoting here from a cabinet position and disapproving D.C.'s ban on handguns in approving a ban on machine guns and in approving longstanding regulations such as concealed carry a felon in possession laws\nHeller established that the scope of the second Amendment rights and plus the constitutionality of gun bans on regulation is determined by reference to text history and tradition\nUnquote Brett Kavanaugh as an appellate court judge seven years ago or your your thoughts about that as a as a a philosophy going forward Dave\n[noise] well I think that it is one of the keys to white Dianne Feinstein and some colleagues were just going berserk over the idea of a cabinet or sending to the Supreme Court ah I think he looks at the historic\nA way that firearms have really been a part of the American fabric uh you know we talked earlier about\nA a law enforcement and and how the country didn't really have a law enforcement until the early Eighteen hundreds and I checked the Texas Rangers or were formed Eighteen twenty three places\nAustin now All right\nI'm ... the idea that ah when the constitution was written\nA it was commonplace for people walk around in the village they they'd go to trade they do think they had a firearm with them and it might have been a a Flynn lock or or abrasive pistols or something but they had guns with\nEverybody behaved themselves or at least most people behave themselves\nAnd uh I think he looks at the historic context of how fire which were were really part of the ... the American fabric and and how we advance as a country he also said something in in that ruling into this little living that\nBecause semi automatic pistols or protect their so also should be semi automatic rifles\nAnd you know that's in some of the Democrats into orbit\nThey'll try it out the terms if they could define that their lives depend on what about assault rifles and yeah I can defining assault rifle for you right now and that is it's a it's black and sinister looking it may have a pistol grip that that's an assault rifle go ahead\nWell uh yeah I think you just paint that because quite frankly the\nTerm is an invention by the the the gun prohibition lobby it and you know they this dates back I didn't twenty five thirty years we've got to demonize these things and and really make people think that their machine guns and this was the strategy back then and when when Dianne Feinstein opened her questioning\nOf a judge Kavanaugh\nThe first thing she turned to was guns and and the ... he is a\nA dissenting opinion which really was in two thousand eleven and what he said about semi automatic rifles and and then she said something that just is bizarre I called her on this in print she said what about the hundreds of school shootings that we've had over the years involving assault rifles\nThat was just hogwash and I don't know where she gets this stuff but ah too many in the media especially the media and so the beltway\nOr don't have the stones to call people out on this kind of thing they needed this rhetoric
