show and doing so well and your daughter\nIs doing a\nAn incredibly wonderful job for the president and for the country\nWell thank you very much I'm very proud of her ah I tell people that Donald Trump was not my first choice for president because I was my first choice as a buddy was my second choice and I also say wait at least we got a Huckabee and the White House just wasn't the one I thought what ended up being there\nYou know it's got to be tough or as a dad to watch people beat up on your little girl every day and let's face it doesn't matter how growing up she gets she's always going to be your little girl\nWell she is but you know it doesn't make me nervous as people think and I'll tell you one because I Know are well enough to know how tough years ... some guy like Jim Acosta smart off and try to you know put the squeeze on her\nI'm more afraid for what's about to happen to him I realized he's about to get his head handed to him who just doesn't know it yet and sure enough she turns and really takes him down a notch and I I watch or with guys like that and I'm thinking you know I've seen that same approach that she makes to her five year old and a three year old son\n[laughter] right I Love so much is the fact that you have supported President Trump\nAnd ... if everybody ... it would try to do that you know he in our president\nThat is true is a fact a lot of people seem to ignore [noise] Richard your call Charlotte let's go to a Calvin in St Louis hello Calvin\nHow are you where when\nYou're talking to the governor of the world there I mean I I I I grew up in Arkansas and when he said about girls is absolutely true 'cause I have five girls\nAnd every one of them can take down just about anybody after fighting in something they believe at it and you should just be so proud of your daughter I I agree with that lady earlier but I just wanted to ask you is what I wanted to say something to\nYou know you're one of the most triple people I have ever heard on the radio or TV or as a governor or as a politician or concerning abortion I think you're about the only person I hear\nA hundred percent of the time talking the truth about what that's about it and I think ... um I Would ask you I mean do you think that this has more to do about abortion but it does anything else work habits are facing this opposition\nI think it does a cow in in in large measure because the liberals were scared to death that there might be an honest look and a a revisit a rosy weight which was a ridiculous decision\nThat was a reaching out into thin air and creating a law that did not have any basis in the constitution\nBut what most people don't understand either to grow the weight or reversed it doesn't end abortion all it does is it gives it back to the states and each and every state would make its own decision how would approach it my own view is that the best way for us to deal with the abortion question\nIs to deal with it through the issue of person hurt because if we would accept the biological fact this is the science of of\nThe unborn that every person is a person from the point of conception\nThan the Fifth Amendment would actually be far stronger than any Robie way a ruling ever could be in protecting life liberty and the pursuit of happiness\nAnd would provide due process and would make it impossible for anyone to deprive a person of their life and liberty and I I really hope that that's where we ended up moving with this because there should be about protecting innocent people not just about stopping abortion\nGo up to ten seconds here am I going to want you to stay on the line we'll speak off air but I was doing a little checking your calendar on inauguration day twenty twenty five you'll be sixty nine same ages Reagan

had a chance one on one five [noise] mostly\nWhereas Republicans I think look at the ballot and they don't see the president's name anywhere instead they may see a lot of people that they made you ride as as rhinos Republicans in name only and uh\nAnd so I think those two viewpoints may not be a good news for Republicans\nYeah I'm up all true and I think all\nTrump has basically said that this is a referendum on the hand that that has helped nationalized election not good for a Republican\nOr any time the power and the party in\nPower and so all kinds of trying to get the localized election er and not have a Trump made the main issue and they want on may ... a judicial appointments or do they want that to me and talk about\nBecause a ... and still not great it's a in the\nIn the low forties if you look at a solid holes in the thirties and if you look at other polls and so ah he's seen as very polarizing figure and he seems to stoke the culture wars in a way that\nIs not helpful

them all of a call\nNow after the victim\nWhen when I when I heard that I remember thinking at the time you know everything he just said factually is absolutely one hundred percent true\nThat in fact in terms of someone who was a a bringing accusations against others that she was she was pretty vacuous at times and I I agree with that completely the same time I grand at what he said I also grown

five or six to six our guest is Peter Schweitzer and\nAgain he is the man behind the creepy line documentary how can people see this\nIs going to be available in a couple of days or on a I Choose a and Amazon or and or we're going to be doing limited theatrical a releases we've done a screening in Washington DC that had attendance from\nEverybody from the White House to Capitol Hill a just a few days ago and we had another screening in New York or we started out more around the country so you go to the website there'll be information there and you can sign up and get updates when it comes to your area but it'll be available shortly on line both Amazon and I\nDo still get to have a Facebook page\n[laughter] well you know it's interesting I'm a year to ... when we initially set up the trailer we actually had some glitches which we we have no reason to\nBelieve or to know that it was connected to the project itself but it does get one looking over their shoulder I mean what's interesting is uh Robert ... who's this a PHD used on always peer reviewed studies I'm actually did research um which demonstrated how Google could swing\nAn election uh well you know one direction or the other uh by shifting millions of votes spy controlling the information they got the Washington Post ran a story on this and the next day he was\nBlocked from Google you actually could not access Google products at all I'm a similar thing happened to a doctor Jordan Peterson a we highlight in the film you say a\nPsychology professor at the University of Toronto uh\nHe was actually a blocked by Google a from accessing his Gmail accounts and his Google Calendar and his YouTube channel which you know has millions of people that have downloaded his content so it does happen to people or more often than you think and it just demonstrates the power\nThat this company has to decide their whim\nOr how they are going to control what you see and what you have access to\nBut they don't play favorites well I mean that's what they claim right I mean I mean I I don't think that the example you just gave our our particularly noteworthy I mean there's sort of thing I I understand happens all the time and and and what the point being that that I I I just don't see how they can with a straight face claimed that they don't do this\nYeah no that well that's exactly right and and one of the research studies that up Stein did\nThat is particularly interesting we'd go to this in the in the film a is during the twenty sixteen election or they actually enlisted volunteers around the country this was a a you know John uh uh blindly um but they basically enlisted volunteers and had them conduct searches on both\nGoogle and bang as it related to the twenty sixteen election this was over five six month period\nAnd then they captured all the search results that people got now some of these volunteers were in red states where some were blue states some of the Republicans somewhere Democrats independents all kinds of genders you know all kinds of social economic status\nAnd what they found when they reviewed the result was that you know things seemed to be pretty balanced but Google and every single searched position of the top ten search results\nThis the results favored\nHillary Clinton what they essentially did was they suppressed negative stories about Hillary Clinton and the feed and they pushed negative stories by Donald Trump\nIn the same search results um and you know by his estimate this had a somewhat dramatic effect on the election now it didn't help the results at the end of the day um but ... contention is that Google was essentially\nWith the books and what's interesting about this is ... is essentially a political\nBut he actually was a Hillary Clinton supporter in twenty sixteen oh and what he is concerned about of course it's not political implications of this in terms of who wins who loses but here's real concern is do we really want to have a company\nHaving so much control over the flow of information that win undecided voters and you know there are a lot of undecided voters every election that one day sort sort of go into the Google Search and saying which candidate should I vote for\nA and looking at the search results do we really want to have a company with the power to influence the outcome potentially of elections and that's what the real concern is here\nI think that's a pretty fair concern will take some calls for our guest Peter Schweitzer at the one eight six six five oh jumbo one eight six six five oh five or six to six on the jumbo had a job when we come back in just a moment\n\nPoint though no one on one by one over seven five fourteen hundred and\nForty ... gym\nWas going to smash in control people so you know in Nineteen eighty four it's big brother and you have these you know large television screens or these voices that are sort of pumping information to us but it was simple it's kind of the you know the the\nThe clenched fist right in front of your face you know what we're facing now is not any kind of police state but what we are facing is this ominous power that is trying to persuade us that is trying to steer us in a certain direction but we can't really see the fist\nBut it's still there and the power is still there and I think you're exactly right I mean imagine a a global imagine I'm ... now or a stall in or a Mussolini\nThat had this kind of control over the flow of information I mean we've given them an enormous power and Google basically tells us is trust us yeah cost us\nGeorge Orwell you had no idea how right you were to Linda in Champaign, Illinois hello Linda\nHow can I Am I going to make a quick comment a lot of it they believe that the party has been building a Nazi techno state with still going on Facebook\nAnd all these people but when I really call let's say asking that want to thank our guests are when he's been doing and about search engines and they're used to be I click which had and they they have another wine cup start page the same company that they got rid of\nEx click and that was if he didn't want to use Google result he wanted other result and I don't understand that Google ... did they make them ... I think what happened to it and I use that that go\nYeah no that's a great question I mean this is this is fascinating when you look at at at how Google operates in the space so look at apple for example apple has this search engine called safari\nBut safari is actually run by Google Search algorithm and you know why because Google pays apple nine billion dollars a year\nFor the opportunity to run safari searches so think about that it's an apple product and Google is actually theoretically doing apple a favor\nBy doing their searches but it's actually Google that's paying apple and why is that\nBecause they wanted the information and the data that comes from search results because they can monetize it and sell it to other people and this is what Google is doing everywhere and you're exactly right start page a is a a search engine you get great results they actually use the Google algorithm\nThey have an agreement with Google that allows them to allow the search is to go without data being president\nI think that is that is going to change your ... biggest star pages becoming more popular it was a deal struck awhile ago duct duct go is good\nIt's it's not as good as Google and that's part of the challenge part of the challenges the best search engine out there in terms of results ineffectiveness is Google\nBut the price that you pay is they collect all this information on you and they are prepared to use that information against you to either steer you are manipulate you in a way ...\nSo again war for other parts of their agenda and there really are not many great options out there um there's even you know discussions about the fact that thing\nWhich is the Microsoft products which is sort of the great rival\nTo Google a century and twenty six teams struck a commercial agreements or Microsoft and Google struck a commercial agreement we don't know exactly what that agreement is but um they essentially have stopped being so hostile to Google with a lot of\nPeople believe that there is some kind of ... where they're doing a search they're cooperating and search so that's\nPart of the shelves there really aren't that many great alternatives\nWe'll be
