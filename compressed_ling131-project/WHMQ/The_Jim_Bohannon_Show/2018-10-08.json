Marines in documentaries that are kind of missed it ended up kicking today Ken mountain but one of the most important things in their stories you know all the military leaders with us troops are simpler by George Herbert Walker\nBush because people are starving to death in price and Bush said it can be an attack next month\nSo we had to send troops over there we went there for humanitarian reasons and minutes or getting the incredible fight but all senior military leaders in the same with the man said we need some armored vehicles over there and take our troops get in trouble she went on pace and Bradley fighting vehicle to protect them from the type of weapons the Somali a ramble hat\nAnd secretary defiance last Aspen said no we're not going to send them so when general day but it was colonel\nSimon and and and and colonel Allen bring it was a major like when they had to go out there and rescue those rangers asked the helicopters got shot down they had to go get the ladies in armored personnel carriers\nTrump south ... us troops in there the U.S troops couldn't speak Malaysian\nIt's night there's this incredible fire going on I Can't even imagine what that must have been light and so as I've been doing this research I mean I didn't so impressed with everybody from the AFC about or all\nThe N CEOs who are credible the senior in the house and the leaders like a bill David my that would be and that's who you should really be talking to here because\nFirst of all we should never put American troops in that position where we tell them here's a mission to go do but what you're not gonna give you the resource that you say you may\n... and ... I I just so proud that we get the honor these veterans ... Mountain Division here on the twenty fifth anniversary\nWell I certainly would concur with you entirely I remember at the time although not realizing the extent to which it was true but at the time uh when I was still I was doing this program as a matter of fact it's been a long uh but I remember\nA severely castigated the defense secretary Les Aspen for worrying about cosmetics about whether or not and and then one tank would make us look less like a peacekeeping mission at the time I thought you know the images is baloney uh although I was using stronger language isn't that what let's talk to a\nA General David or about that that part of this or that in retrospect would you say that you that you were sent into combat\nOr which which is what it was it what it turned out to be into combat with less than the resources that should have been made available to you\nOut Jim I I think any commander with uh what always want more resources but I think the um\nUm\nOfficers who were in command positions seeing or to me made it very clear to the national command authority is that um\nArmored vehicles were required for survivor ability and um and that basically protect our four so yes obviously I'm you know the more arm or you can have around you any time she was a pretty good so um yeah we we certainly could use that but we didn't have it\nOr the situation dictated that we use what we had and so that's what we do\nThat is true and and you know they operate fluid yeah just a guess please continue ran a yes\nNo I just want they build David my that would be went into the gunfight that night in a hungry and I'm armored Humvees and light like that in the trailer it's like going in you know in a convertible format in a parade everybody shooting that and they were in on armored on be more than a thousand people too\nAnd we all recall what happens to armored Humvees when they get hit with let's say I ... and ... ... ... uh it it was I assume common knowledge to everyone back then that among those forces active in Mogadishu at the time\nWere those with RPGs rocket propelled grenades or certainly more than a match for ah for example for a Humvee or right\n[noise] well I think that is true but I think you also have to look at it in context at least from my perspective you know the basic mission was to go in and and the seriously protects humanitarian assistance operations that were designed to feed the starving Somalis I don't think anybody anticipated\nI'm going in into a firefight I think part of that was a lack of recognition and in ... in my own over the last twenty five years that a lot of time to think about it when we we have this term called peacekeeping operations in for my perspective there's nothing peaceful about those kinds of operations\nYeah I'm In this case you had a set of ... you had to drive ... and having a beer\nYou brought the un and the un became my third drive by repair our food was the uh the the thing that I had the most value they were fighting for that and I'm In it escalated I mean there were things that occurred back in June and July with the out of the house raids\nAnd I don't think the folks at home recognize that there was a fire fight\nOr by until we got a free or I go and so\nI think a lot of the calls for armor that we're not consistent with the information that was coming out a theater with regard to what was going on\nWell maybe not to the general public I wouldn't have to think the defense secretary Aspen had that information\nI think that's probably true ah but I'm not sure that he had the ability and I can't really speak for us has been I mean I I can only tell you the perspective that the folks that are I was around on the ground have at the time\nAnd that was that the generally speaking a there was a very little information that was flowing out of Somalia back to uh either D.C or or back to to ah to centcom\nTo indicate what was really going on in theater so I don't I'm not sure anybody really understood how many firefights they'd already been in prior to the third and fourth of October\nDriven up where to pause briefly will come back with some more

much as they went out of it I I Will use that as an example um you know as we turn down a the the main route towards the object of say a it was almost the entire world open up and everybody started shooting at us\nAnd then uh once uh the two companies began to return fire\nUm you could you could almost feel that the change in the atmosphere that we are now getting the the initial Vietnam gained momentum and so Charlie company went south and uh and and ... and an outcome and moved to the\nCrash site where she woke up was a mess and we sat in the middle of the street and the command Humvee or with mortar rounds walking their way down the road\nOr in our bridges flying I thought you know this is a this is not going to be one of those days where everybody goes home and uh\nAnd ... and I at that point um and there were some level of recognition when colonel David got on the net and said you know we're going to stay here as long as it takes to get everybody out of here and I and I think that you're that statement\nAt that time was that created a calming effect you know throughout the entire organization which was essential in in a while ago are created conditions for us to get

just wanted to ask you ... well I wanted to say something to\nYou know you're one of the most truthful people I have ever heard on the radio or TV or as a governor or as a politician or concerning abortion and I think you're about the only person I hear\nA hundred percent of the time talking the truth about what that's about it and I think catalog or I Would ask you I mean do you think that this has more to do about abortion but does anything out of work habits are facing this opposition\nI think it does a cow in in in large measure because the liberals are scared to death that there might be an honest look and or a revisit a row the weight which was a ridiculous decision\nThat was a reaching out into thin air and creating a law that did not have any basis in the constitution\nBut what most people don't understand either to grow the weight or reversed it doesn't end abortion all it does is it gives it back to the states and each and every state would make its own decision how would approach it my own view is that the best way for us to deal with the abortion question\nIs to deal with it through the issue a person could because if we were except the biological fact this is the science of of the unborn that every person is a person from the point at conception\nThen the Fifth Amendment would actually be far stronger than any Robie way a ruling ever could be in protecting life liberty and the pursuit of happiness\nAnd would provide due process and would make it impossible for anyone to deprive a person a fair a life and liberty and I I really hope that that's where we ended up moving with this because this should be about protecting the innocent people not just about stopping abortion\nGo up to ten seconds here am I then I went through the stay on the line we'll

we initially set up the trailer we actually had some glitches which we we have no reason to\nTo believe or to know that it was connected to the project itself but it does get one looking over the shoulder I mean what's interesting is uh Robert ... who's this a PHD used don't always peer reviewed studies I'm actually did research um which demonstrated how Google could swing\nAn election uh well you know one direction or the other\nUh by shifting millions of vote spy controlling the information they got the Washington Post ran a story on this and the next day he was blocked from Google\nYou actually could not access Google products at all I'm a similar thing happened to a doctor Jordan Peterson a highlight in the film you say a\nPsychology professor at the University of Toronto uh\nHe was actually a blocked by Google or from accessing his Gmail accounts and his Google Calendar and his YouTube channel which you know has a millions of people that have downloaded his content\nSo it does happen to people or more often than you think and it just demonstrates the power that this company has to decide if their whim\nA how they are going to control what you see and what you have access to\nBut they don't play favorites well\nI mean that they claim right I mean I mean I I don't think the example you just gave our our particularly no worthy I mean there's sort of thing I I understand happens all the time and and and what the point being that I that I I I just don't see how they can with a straight face claimed that they don't do this\nYou know that well that's exactly right and and one of the research studies that ... did\nThat is particularly interesting we'd go through this in the in the film or is during the twenty sixteen election uh you they actually enlisted volunteers around the country this was a a you know done a a blind way um but they basically enlisted volunteers and had them conduct searches um on both\nGoogle and bang as it related to the twenty sixteen election this was all five six month period\nAnd then they captured all the search results that people got now some of these volunteers were in red states where some were blue states some of the Republican somewhere Democrats independents all kinds of genders you know all kinds of social economic status and what they found when they reviewed the result was that\nYou know things seemed to be pretty balanced but Google in every single search position of the top ten search results\nThis the results favored\nHillary Clinton what they essentially did was they suppressed negative stories about Hillary Clinton and the feed and they pushed negative stories by Donald Trump\nIn the same search results um and you know by his estimate this had a somewhat dramatic effect on the election now it didn't shelter results at the end of the day um but ... contention is that Google was essentially\nSettling with the books and what's interesting about this is ... is essentially a political but he actually was a Hillary Clinton supporter in twenty sixteen oh and what he is concerned about of course it's not the political implications of this in terms of who wins and who loses\nBut here's real concern is do we really want to have a company\nHaving so much control over the flow of information that ran undecided voters and you know there are a lot of undecided voters every election that when they start sort of go into the Google Search and saying which candidate should I vote for\nA and looking at the search results do we really want to have a company with the power to influence the outcome potentially of elections and that's what the real concern is here\nI think that's a pretty fair concern will take some calls for our guest Peter Schweitzer at the one eight six six five oh Jim boat\nMy four six to six on the jumbo had a job when we come back in just a moment\n[noise]\nThat was the way we can do matter from the twenty two new storm came last night with an all round sixteen

going to smash in control people so you know in Nineteen eighty four it's big brother and you have these you know large television screens or these voices that are sort of\nPumping information to us but it was visible it's kind of the you know the the\nThe clenched fist right in front of your face you know what we're facing now is not any kind of police state about what we are facing is this ominous power that is trying to persuade us that is trying to steer us in a certain direction but we can't really see the fist\nBut it's still there and the power is still there and I think you're exactly right I mean imagine a ... imagine I'm ... now or a stall in or a Mussolini\nThat had this kind of control over the flow of information I mean we give them an enormous power and Google basically tells us trust us yeah trust us\nGeorge Orwell you had no idea how right you were to Linda in Champaign, Illinois hello Linda\nHow can I Am I going to make a quick comment a lot of if they believe that the party has been building the Nazi techno state with going on Facebook and all these people but when I really call let's say asking that want to thank our guests are what he's doing and about search engines and\nThey're used to be I click which had and they they have another one called start paid for the same company that they got rid of ex click and that was if you didn't want to use the result he wanted other result and I don't understand that Google suppress\nDid they make them the ... what happened to it and I is that that go\nYeah I Know that's a great question I mean this is this is fascinating when you look at at at how Google operates in the space so look at apple for example apple has this search engine called safari\nBut safari is actually run by Google Search algorithm and you know why because Google have apple nine billion dollars a year\nFor the opportunity to run safari searches to think about that it's an apple product and Google is actually theoretically doing apple a favor\nBy doing the research is but it's actually Google that's paying apple and why is that\nBecause they want the information and the data that comes through search results because they can monetize it and sell it to other people and this is what Google is doing everywhere and you're exactly right start page a\nIs a a search engine you get great results they actually use the Google algorithm they have an agreement with Google that allows them to allow the search is to go without data being president\nI think that is that is going to change your bench Lee biggest star page is becoming more popular it was a deal struck awhile ago Dr go is good\nIt's it's not as good as Google\nAnd that's part of the challenge part of the challenges the best search engine out there in terms of results ineffectiveness is Google\nBut the price that you pay is they collect all this information on you and they are prepared to use that information against you\nTo either steer you are manipulate you in a way for commercial gain or other parts of their agenda and there really are not many great options out there um there's even you know discussions about the fact that thing\nWhich is the Microsoft products which is sort of the great rival\nTo Google a century and twenty six teams truck a commercial agreements a Microsoft and Google struck a commercial\nAgreement we don't know exactly what that agreement is but um they essentially have stopped being so hostile to Google and a lot of people believe that there is some kind of arrangement where they're doing a search they're cooperating inserts so that's\nPart of a challenge there really aren't that many great alternatives\nBe back in the moment what a day for tennis you ready to play

S. specializes in making just we were going to get huge amounts of weight\nColumbia says okay will specialize in just making coffee we get huge amounts of coffee then we'll trade our coffee for your and we both countries end up with more coffee and more weight without adding any more resources\nSo free trade benefits everybody well why is somebody complaining he would say and the answer is if we stop making coffee and my example that make just wheat anybody making coffee is out of a job you say well you can go next week\nBut the skills may not be transferable from the industries that leave to the industries that are built up and that's what happened in in Canada the U.S has a ... is very efficient at making dairy products\nTo to get free trade you should let us make the dairy products and sell them in Canada we'd end up both countries would end up with more a production of dairy products but the problem is\nWhat happens is the Canadian dairy farmers well they should go do something else but they say we don't want to do something else do we want to continue to make dairy products for and that's what the Rob is with with Canada All right\nTo a call from Sharon in ...

will find exactly why we have had bad trade agreements ratified\nWell we're coming up on a break here I'll lift the doctor gave is the link here I'm sure in more learned opinion after the break a chair and I will add a couple of things here are or what you just said and please stay on the line a one would be of course that are no matter how much lobbying occurs on behalf of foreign governments and goodness knows there's a ton of that\nOutright passage of money to a political candidates for public office from foreign sources is very much a no no and the second thing is I think you are vastly

have anybody can pay\nYeah except we don't have to have them built the tanks in the planes but if the tanks in the planes have so much steel and them we can buy to steal from the Chinese are much lower cost\nThan it cost them for us to make it ourselves then instead of these planes costing whenever they cost a few million dollars a piece you can reduce the cost to make the planes we don't need to give China our technology we don't need to let them make the finished product but if they can make components\nCheaper than we can make them ourselves are we better off taking it from them um and that allows us to produce the cheaper and that will be better off for us is\nWe rages another point and I always ... there'll be I'm going to bring up when we come back from the break but the point is you said that ... we\nWe shouldn't have to give the the Chinese are uh our intellectual property secrets but of course to build a plant in China Today that's exactly what the Chinese extracted from

come back to the gym ... six six five oh jumbo one eight six six\nFive oh five or six to six were talking to Dr Michael butler from Stockton University a professor of finance there and also a public policy analyst\nAnd we're looking at the new proposed a trade deal again it's not a done deal yet it has to get congressional approval but uh it uh I suppose it does a lot of a stretch to assume that even a badly divided Congress\nWould be able to say yes to a fair amount of what is in this\nLet's talk to David who calls in from San Francisco tonight to David good evening [noise]\n[noise] yes I Am a in your guest I I'm Out here in San Francisco we've got two major a financial problems directly tied to this Chinese steel\nAnd uh one is the bay bridge which got opened a just a fabulous the shore to five years ago and it was\nThis was the new post earthquake Bay Bridge right\nRight yeah and in fact uh if you remember just the dollar value or at at in the Nineteen eighty nine earthquake they said it would be a quarter of a billion dollars to fix the bridge when the new bridge opened a couple of years ago it\nWas a what six billion dollars in costs and six billion in financing so it went well forty eight times to become a twelve billion dollar broken rich\nAnd I was defective when it when it opened\nNow are you saying that that was built with with Chinese steel\nOh yeah and what was going well I didn't know that yeah and what was significant about it or not was the governor and this crush on Ron okay yeah ... was\nThe Republican governor and lily brown was the former mayor\nThe two of them put it together and they created they actually created a foundry in China to manufacture the ... the bridge apart\nThere were very few repeating part so it was almost entirely custom and the they had something like twenty thousand inspectors per part\nAre you know each park had to have an inspector massive art ... almost to the to the man they've refused to accept delivery on the part yet it was over written by a a project manager who had no right to override\nWell that does sound like a terrible deal I must say although I'm not sure quite how it fits into the context of this discussion regarding a trade matters other than the fact I I guess the professor bus or you should always look twice when dealing with the Chinese [noise]\nBut uh uh current in Rochester, Minnesota is a next step below Kurt\nHigh yellow the thing that bothers me about the ah the steel if you're from China is if you drive a car\nA lot and you have to have your brakes read done you may have found out over the last Twenty years that you can't turn a rotor anymore because the Chinese steel that all the car owners are made out of it is so poor\nThat it is not turn of all\nYou know years ago you used to be able to take your break rotors or your drums in and you could Milam down and get another life out of them but nowadays everybody has to throw away their owners because the ... the Chinese steel maybe cheaper\nBut the quality is also she\nAll right I Want our guest to comment about that we've had two calls regarding the quality of uh dealing with the Chinese\nIf it's that bad at least in regard to steal I mean you know when you when you buy a a broom and Walmart you're really not looking for the the\nThe the nicest brew him out there you want some little sweep the floor or something like this is well I mean a indicates will break drums a that's not such a good thing in the case of bridges that's a terrible thing maybe you will die\nOr is that the other problem in trading with the Chinese the question of quality if you do we had a question some time back about\nAfrican if it was food or pharmaceuticals but there was some serious question about Chinese quality\n[noise] yeah that's that's always an an an issue on a product like steel obviously quality is a essential there especially are going into products\nOr like a bridge or something that could cause a some severe a injuries but how about some of the uh smaller consumer prize look at the textile in industry\nSo if I'm In California used to have a huge textile industry and workers were making let's say twenty dollars an hour and as a result of that they made a real nice shirt that sold for fifty dollars well\nThey decided to outsource to make the ... the uh shirts in China where people are at the time or paid about a dollar a day so now they can make the shirt or and sell it instead of for fifty dollars they can sell the shirt now for twenty dollars go well that some people would say that's a very positive thing\nOr it's negative in that people will lose jobs here but it's positive in that all consumers now can\nPurchase much more uh goods and services because the prices\nAre are lower except
