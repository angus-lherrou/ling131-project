access facilities pills a day you thought that maybe the news media are brought this case it\nTheir faith comes down to reflect off a little fast it'd be interesting if anybody else who else throughout the country early elections for I think at the early voting places but I tell ya it's it's pretty nasty here\nBut when you say when you say pretty nasty there are sort of you are you're talking about an actual polling places that right\nYeah ... years you know you've got one side on one side and the other side on the other side and you know one side training at the ethics\nAnd you're talking about people who are effective lever although at a rather childish way campaigning at a polling sites most states have laws against actively campaigning with so many feet of a booming

the different parties were actually at one that's out there and in some cases this party for at one another so even when they heard this is what's going on\nThings here is paid and it'd be interesting if for cap and in other places besides Florida I'd like to know because that's the way it was here\nYeah well again or I or are you\nIn other words you have it in a in Florida formal polling place was established in many other states you may vote absentee or you may go to let's say the uh\nThe office of a voter registration let's say and cast a ballot but I I don't think a lot of places that you actually have I have a normal polling places like\nFire houses in in schools that are are are are opened up in this regard I Know that really because of course it's it's very hard to to protest outside of a of a mailbox you sit in an absentee ballot\nOr or or not protest in the offices of let's say a a cow the uh uh the county office building so these are actual polling places huh well\nYes well like what they call it in the early ... are they going to focus his early election but then after a certain state they have to go to their kids to have this ... thing to salt and then of course you can see the absentee ballot but you would if I Would say that one this story\nBroke gets ... they're not knowing that that they see the profits that ... I Believe the air that that there is warning that wasn't that I feel like out false uh latest and Afghanistan that if you heard\nOf them are expanding sustain fun it's really not war\nWell it is it is very very unfortunate I was wondering do you have anything to to say in regard to the specific topic of the rest of the suspect in the uh the uh the phony bombs tonight\nI think the thing that has always been I don't know if this is true is in other states\nIt's clear Wyoming today that's why you know people in these people in the state like if they had had this ongoing arrests factory I just can't help the people that have been arrested for twenty even out on the street I guess that's the thing that for like ... have\nA yes if it reflects as me as well of course obviously you can be arrested the many many many times a\nAnd a convictions or or what would matter in terms of ah of any ah what amounts to prior restraint but uh see what you're saying that yes obviously something that needs to be done in the in this regard I Would ... thoroughly concur\nLet get colds in from Philadelphia tonight the good evening\nOn land on your mind to hire so I'm fine I'm I'm a\nI saw was I going to follow up on what you're saying where laws and you know a person can only got so many chances but I was also looking at it from my mother proactive and go where we have a problem with the healthcare system in this country\nEspecially compared to other developed countries and I think the field of mental health\nIs even more under served in the medical field in general and so maybe after somebody goes then somebody times yeah they brought people on probation they put people on parole\nMaybe they could have a thing where they uh put people on a mental preparation where they they go to a specialist a health professional and they get help and maybe if\nThat kind of thing was more acceptable in the first place that person would never get to the place in their minds when they justify doing these things\nAnd you know and I guess that it costs money mental health professionals are expensive that's why part of it but then we have things like that and how much money was spent by the FBI on this investigation\nThat the financial part of it and I'm from the other side as a mental health professional is able to help somebody and prevent that kind of thing from happening on the first place that's just priceless especially if the you know especially somebody could be better buildings bombs and they I Would I say get lucky they get\nThe bombs or go undetected I something actually happens and people get hurt than to prevent something like that with a little bit of investment is definitely something\nSomething actually happens like people get hurt that prevent something like that with a little bit of it that's something I see a spice less\nWell widely anybody that I Would agree that certainly to the extent that in fact we are\nAble to be so proactive obviously the uh the area of mental health is under served in this country we do not have mental health and science down to ... to such that we can offer treatment and give but let's say a\nA Seventy percent chance that uh we've a fixture you're a defect your brain but a yes or the short answer is though we do need more resources in terms of mental health and maybe some kind of a\nIf you will mental health probation might be at least something worth pursuing Greg in Sioux City Iowa on the jumbo have a show on the arrest of a suspect in the uh\nSort of bombing case again since he has told authorities that they were never supposed to go off so what what trick combs things I don't know go ahead Greg\nYeah Jim ideas about as bad as believable at the ... this thing that there's been one big set up for this guy from day one\nThe whole thing is that is to try out a brand new sit there and support for the for the Democrat but older really hold there was one of the targets I could have waited maybe six or six years ago\nBut this is such a much BS it's unbelievable\nWhat I what I mean older was uh granted he tended to pick a a has been or never was targets that's very true but there is a I I'm not sure about why when you say a set up I mean uh it sounds like the guy was set up Jim Jim this well okay how do you know he was at a quote set up and by whom and that's what I get [laughter]\nOkay well I don't like us who worked at the CIA who does it does\nThere you're saying you're saying that you have knowledge that in fact the Democratic party establishment a hired to seize are say look\nI Will not put it past that I Would not I would not\nWell okay so it is or not a case of you know that at all it's the case of you who I was asked it out\nBut I I like it I Believe anything at this point it is so phoney and it's so unbelievable that that are like why don't we just put a like a a the act me a day on the outside it bombing side it was so unbelievable and they get start that uh this whole thing and it's just a\n... ... ...

true American Hero and patriot and one who's not got the credit that she deserved and uh we have a call for our guest Jason ... from Lawrence in the champagne Illinois Lawrence a good evening and do welcome to the program\nThank you and good evening in both I wanted to share\nA some information about what was it may have made that original comment a ten or more years ago I was watching a historical presentation on native PBS or CSPAN and uh\nWhat was portrayed was it was no less than Benjamin Franklin who approached John Adams us to make a comment that an apology was in order\nAnd the way for John could get on to apologizing or how they're he had spoken negatively about certain other members of the convention his wife uh\nTo apologizing or how they're he had spoken negatively about certain other members of the convention as wife a menu of and said that a famous line apparently that a gentleman don't read another man's letters to his wife\nWell who knows that may have been the ah the origin nation to them is the credit of the ships that I think in in general but of course the the important thing is is the notion that somehow that uh it's a sporting a I guess in in times of ran a winning or potential war when in fact\nUh it's it it may not be quote sporting but this uh this is a is a serious business\nWell I just want right I yeah\nWell I'll get a better get rid of the origin or or perhaps so I I had not heard that particular story Lawrence but like you for sharing a I'm going to take a look at how you came across this story a Jason\nSure shirt so are you talking about surveillance and wiretapping and sort of American attitudes about all of that I'm In twenty twenty Thirteen I was reading about the Edward Snowden leaks ah you know the Snowden story he revealed that the national Security Agency was gathering\nAh ah you know communications records of millions of sort of ordinary Americans in this as a very surprising a lot of people surprising me and I started to read about that a stack and history of being a sec when you read about the history of the NSA\nAll roads lead to this guy a William F treatment Elizabeth Friedman each husbands die he's considered to be the godfather you say\nIf you go to NSA headquarters at Fort Meade there's\nA large ordained by the way is in Maryland directly between Baltimore and Washington\nBut go ahead so if you if you go to and if their headquarters there um you know there's a bronze bus of William Freedman had outside of the auditorium that named in his honor\nAnd so he's he's considered to be the man but in reading about William a who was a code breaker famous code breaker I saw that his wife Elizabeth was off the hook brick yeah that's interesting right how ... how many husband and wife or could raking teams can possibly be a and so I started looking for more information on most of that\nUm and there wasn't really that much out there but I did find a a a link to a library in Virginia private library that that happened to have twenty two boxes of letters and other materials that she had lost their before she died in Nineteen eighty one day I just decided to drive down I Lived in Philadelphia\nSo I drove down to the library and I I went inside and I ... I I was curious about the Elizabeth Smith Friedman collection and\nAnd they were very friendly and they they brought out box one of the twenty two ah boxes that all is said last time I started reading her letters and ah it was just one of these moments in in your career that you'll never forget because\nAs soon as I started reading her her handwritten letter ... years ago I was just a immediately taken with her I mean she's such a [noise] a such a vivid kind of voice on the page uh and and the materials that library had where\nA or were the kinds of materials that any journalist and author ... would walk to stumble across it was her original college diary was there it was you know love letters that she wrote to William early in their relationship some of the letters were actually written code was one of the day is\nNot really the ... of course who else would do that right\n[laughter] right yeah no I mean it's it's actually it's actually kind of a I mean it's lovely 'cause we we tend to think of\nSecret right writing a secret message as as a way to um as a way to hide things but for them it was a way to flirt [laughter] I like to bring them closer together and I I was just a the the the texture these materials was was\nJust a very cool to me and I and I realized after\nSpending some time with them that uh there was an untold story here they're really good needs to be cold it is a story of you know this amazing hidden woman who was behind the developments of American intelligence and the twentieth century it's it's kind of a genius who solved all kinds of problems and fix\nAll kinds of messages and you know the more I read the more I realized that she she was kind of like a jelly figure and American intelligence district she'd\nBeen ... I Want to come back and continue that thoughts are as we will continue right after these messages\n\nAttending their trials and testify and\nSo they knew who she was\nRight the newer face they could see her and um it's just not necessarily the safest thing to be doing right you can you can uh you can imagine\nAnd um and so yeah so there were there would be you know there'd be gangsters or on trial\nA lot of these a lot of these running rings where international crime syndicates it was essentially the mafia and so she and she would walk into court a unprotected with you know a pink dress in a in a in a of a hat with a flower pinned to the breath and she would stare down these guys the fence table you know five three and she would\nExplain exactly how she had broken their coats exactly how she had essentially\nStolen their thoughts and uh you know and she did it fairly fearless we all all through that on\nBut it was necessary for her to actually get into the tradecraft in a court of law that's that's remarkable today it of course\nThe minute anything like that came up a federal agent would would would walk in with some kind of a of a federal court order and would immediately shut down that testimony at least in part of a public trial\nI mean that the free market you know these are things that were these are things that that uh\nLet me put it this way when I left the army uh I took an oath not to talk about certain things which I have not read many many decades later I was even forbidden to visit\nA a a an iron curtain country for five years after I left the army and I was a a relatively small player albeit with a top secret plus clearance and the idea that she was ... the court as well this is how we did it I mean that that's remarkable [laughter]\nWell yeah I mean so you your your in your career you you weren't able to expose your sources and methods that would\nGet right to the last thing that you'd be able to there'll be a good way to spend some time at Fort Leavenworth Kansas behind bars and that is correct\nExactly exactly and and and that's that was true that and it's true today but the fact the fact was at the time she had no choice she was she was asked asked to to do this testimony by a federal prosecutors because the prosecutors needed to make cases against some of these international crime rings um\nThat were killing people and network controlling the the ... and so they they they wanted to get these guys in prison they wanted to take down the east coast and it's the only way to do that\nWell it's actually try to make a case against them so in in which step Elizabeth and\nUltimately you know there would be a lot of publicity around these trials 'cause it's kind of spectacular\nVisual because he just petite ah America you know an American woman American mother testifying against these guys so she got all kinds of a newspaper coverage that were on edge newspaper stories about Elizabeth all through the Nineteen thirties and uh and the tone of them were ... it's sort of was like a\nThere was a woman doing things that men could into I'm I'm looking right now at a at one of my favorite clips which is a a story a true story published about Elizabeth and in a magazine called true detection a detective fiction we weekly\nOne of the true story about her though and the title was lady men out there and there was just lining the story about um how small slender American Woman stepped in and smashed crime where men had to sell [laughter] uh so she was she was a ... she was she was a spectacle\nAnd obviously that made a lot of her superiors very happy I'm sure okay we're going to come back at the talks of what was Jason ... the book the woman who smashed codes\nAgain Elizabeth Smith Friedman just to name but uh we should have done more about it and I guess we we still will more to go\nThe natural habitats the creepy ... is a horror movie it compelled being greedy it's that small sticks smiling ... who is more can you which are imagining it's mindless defend the creepy ... he's the guy who saves people money but it also gives them an easy access to emergency roadside service through an award winning apple\nDidn't notice you should switch because yes to a team to Geico is a no brainer\nDuring the question is how to repeat don't move from the bedroom would I Would have\nNoted author former chief medical correspondent and salon policies are Dr Bob are not\nThe human body has billions of pain receptors block those receptors with the anesthetics mounted salon ... plus and you'll have relief\nSalon ... plus contains two anesthetics including the maximum strength line again available that prescription they numb aggravated nurse for effective lasting relief for relief try what I use salon ... in the silver box with a blue wave ...\nIf you suffer from E.

what part of the early voting places but I tell ya it's it's pretty nasty year\nOld on but when you say when you say pretty nasty there are some that you are you're talking about an actual polling places that right\nYeah I hear you know you've got one side on one side and the other side and then the other side and you know one side screaming at the office\nYou're talking about people who are effective lever although in a rather childish way campaigning at a polling sites most states have laws against actively campaigning within so many feet of a booming side\nYeah it's like a hundred feet but what was happening if it wasn't it was it's not only screaming at the other people\nThat they were like that but it was it with a different party at the different parties were actually at one that's out there in some cases it's already for at one another so even when they heard fulfilling on\nThings here and it'd be interesting if for capping in other places that the Florida I'd like to know because that's the way it was here\nYeah well again ah I ah ah\nYou you in other words you have in in in Florida formal polling place was established\nA new one in many other states you may vote absentee or you may go to let's say the uh the office of a voter registration let's say and cast the ballot but I I don't think a lot of places that you actually have have a normal polling places like fire houses in in\nSchools that are are are are opened up in this regard I note that really because of course it's it's very hard to to protest outside of a of a mailbox if you send in an absentee ballot or or or no protest in the offices of let's say a a cow the uh\nUh the county office building so these these are actual polling places huh I well\nYeah well like what they call it in the early ... are they going to focus his early election\nBut then after a certain state they have to go for their kids to have a cream thing just out and you have course you can see the apple two thousand but

looking at for a while I was thinking about you know wait until\nSomething started falling into place that I I'm just going to add pose that question and I can't answer this question actually cause I Can't see that other people could look in the ... pictures of him at Trump rallies number one ... what are they like photo shop\nNumber and number two\nA lot of people have said he had this van in Broward County and they they said even if you're in if you're in Broward County in the places he even if you when they occur on a vehicle you're going to get ... you're going to have your vehicle you know attacked scratched whatever it's going to be\nI mean people are going to go after it in that van let you know like it was you know not attacked or nothing was done to it and so I'm kind of interesting observation and stuff like\nThat yeah there are pictures out there that the show him apparently at the at the Trump rallies although I Would agree that uh\nThat does certainly this is the day and age with with bumper stickers are virtually any kind of a kid could get your uh your uh your car uh vandalize the EU to view the judge says you're a member of the Rotary Club it would seem to this day and age of the big most of the center of some people out there\nAnd then I've lived here all Broward County ... car is covered when and I'm kind of stuff and all kinds of stuff in it it's just it's it's just curious and um there are a lot of curious thing about this way you look at it so I just thought that I as an old and just think about those things\nWell I think those reports the sort of me to do with the worth considering ... thank you for sharing that with this than I was eight six six by boat jumbo Standley in Raleigh North Carolina a good evening Stanley\n... thank you for taking my call waiting or a question uh\nI have no doubt that uh I'm probably not as up to date on this story as you are do I have read as much from the secret service reports and the FBI reports as\nBeen available or several times in the last Fifteen minutes you've made the comment that apparently this gentleman is not capable or was not capable of taking care of his own affairs\nNowhere have I read that he was not capable of taking care of his own affairs uh where where did you blame that from\nI get that from the all the various arrests were made of this man and the various activities threatening to bomb a power plant at one point or other brushes with the law I mean it is abundantly clear to me whether or not you have a basis they're under the law for some kind of a\nOf a preventive activities or something else again but I'd say his uh his record speaks for itself\nOr certainly but there are many people uh that had been arrested who has a criminal histories that pay their bills are that are are able\nTo take care of themselves are not the fares are speaking of I I'm happy if he was able to pay his bills I'm Talking about unable to manage his own affairs without
