tonight\nWell it certainly my pleasure thank you for having me\nAbsolutely let's start with just where you would start that is to say at what point did you say we had a political leader who could be defined as a populist\nWell think about it this way in American history even before there was a country or even before there was a constitution even in the discussion about drafting the constitution there were people\nWho felt perfectly convinced absolutely sure that there were elites who were crafting that document people in New York people in Philadelphia maybe wealthy planners in Virginia\nWere conspiring against their interests\nBecause really when we talk about populism in the American tradition what we're talking about is grievance we're talking about a subset of the population\nThat feels like they have been cheated or that they have been wrong or that their interests are being worked against off in in in the various way\nOr the bankers the of elites me they whomever\nA and populism ... when we have outburst when we have a rupture and a popular sentiment in the United states it's when that constituents he gets to be large enough so you know we all read the federalist papers that everybody knows Alexander Hamilton because of the play and all of that stuff but while they were doing that\nAnd he had whatever however much you may have exaggerated he had a huge following and he and Coughlin both using the ...\nRoosevelt said at the time um this that there was populism on the right\nUh uh Douglas MacArthur who had busted up the bonus army these were a pensioner from the first World War who are owed a bonus that had been approved by Congress from the first World War and during the depths of the depression they showed up on Mars in Washington they marched on Washington and then they set up a tent city on the other side of the Anacostia River from where I'm sitting right now\nAnd a MacArthur huh he was a veteran of the first World War rainbow division highly decorated he rode tanks into this camp and there was a reactionary hard line on the right\nThere was a reactionary we've got to deal with this and these things but Roosevelt biggest concern when he when he called a Huey Long and Douglas McArthur the two most dangerous man in America he was talking about those twin threats that you describe about the about the reactionary is on

showed one eight six six five oh jumbo when eight six six five oh five or six to six\nAlways the opposition to populism has tended to take and they lead his tone and certainly Chris Steiner wall points that out of the very beginning of his book every man of king\nAs he writes was Andrew Jackson was beginning a second term as president and Eighteen thirty three the board at Harvard University he thought it would be appropriate to bestow upon him an honorary doctorate of laws now than the man he had beaten was a Harvard alum a neighbor John Quincy Adams and\nHis response to this as he once told a cousin and this is a quote that has reverberated through his great\nAs myself and affection a child of our alma mater I Would not be present to witness her disgrace in conferring her highest literary honors above the barbarian who could not write a sentence of grammar\nAnd hardly could spell his own name unquote which uh aside from being shall we say a little bit opinionated was also way off the market Andrew Jackson himself happen to be a lawyer I'll be a lot a a Harvard law but could certainly manage a sentence and the spelling of his own name your thoughts\nAre accurate checks in with a rough uh was rough here and there are old hickory was a no sophisticated I'm ... and his spelling was spelling was uh interesting sometimes\nSo it was George Washington's for Pete's sake\nI was just about to say so and so's mind if I don't use spell check 'em but you know the the reality for John Quincy Adams the the belief among the founders and it very then um but even with Jefferson ah who invasion the Gilman farmer\nI'm reading the news under the shade of the tree is as he rested from his plow hum and the the rule of the commenters but so even among the\n... were then the Republican Democrat um but even among the ... the the the more democratically minded of the day it would have been hard to imagine\nThat there would be a leader arise that would not be from the nobility from the from the Chantilly right that you would not have the uh Presbyterian or not an Anglican uh not a congregation less but that you would have somebody who was not from Virginia\nNot from Massachusetts not to the men are born not to the merchant class not a planner but instead the frontiers Mitt now Jackson was astonishingly successful in Tennessee he made himself amazingly well the\nUh he was the governor of Florida he was a justice on the state Supreme Court or he was the states for senator\nHe was a general uh for the ... in the black hawk wars\nThe state Supreme Court or he was the states for senator he was a general uh for the in the black hawk wars he did a uh he did a lot or not in the black hawk words but in the uh uh the creek wore a he\nDid all kinds of things he was he was a renaissance man and a lot of ways but he felt way outside especially as a Scots Irish meant he fell way outside of what the expectations of the founders would have been for the kind of guys for the kind of man who would have populated because the assumption was that there would be such a press that\nThe natural human preference for um excellence for elite is um for those things would have drawn men from the same category but what they\nDidn't count on was when you do have a wave of immigrants and you do change the makeup of the population the expectations and descriptions for what an excellent man might be will change\nAnd certainly overtime ah they they obviously have a part of it I suppose will geographic here was the first or a president to came from uh west of the Appalachian Mountains\nAbsolutely and that westward expansion of the purpose so Jackson interesting Jackson's legacy is only ultimately field by James Paulk\nOne term president who should have

to spread out and of course this is how Jackson\nA earned the pigment may uh and the infamy for his trail of tears and the Indian removal act this is how\nJackson you know it's it's interesting if you see yourself as a victim as Jackson did Jackson no matter how rich you let her how powerful no matter how strong he became no matter how successful he ultimately saw himself as a victim as an aggrieved party and\nThe permission structure that grievance gives us is an interesting thing and it was very interesting with Jackson his heinous treatment of Native Americans what he did\nHe felt right in doing because he was doing it for his people he was doing it for his people who she saw as victims themselves he saw his fellow Scots Irish Americans he saw his fellow western ... the the

sensation that is an understatement\nHe was a while to man he was a wild thing and uh what's interesting is he had he had run for the United States Senate a as a staunch basically to re consolidate power\nIn Louisiana and his intention\nWas that he would try to hold the governorship in the Senate seat at the same time he\nWanted the legislature he was a lame duck and the legislature was being a was starting to a pale uh at the demands of the king fish the emperor of Louisiana all of the things that he told them to do there was they were starting to have some opinions and he did not like that\nSo he ran he figured if he ran statewide for that Senate seat he could show his great power\nAnd he did but then he found out he couldn't do both so he wins but doesn't go sir waiting in Nineteen thirty two but he doesn't go serve until eventually constitutional crisis he uh has called out the state National Guard\nA to prevent the lieutenant governor from take the oath of office he said but eventually he finds a a more accommodating Lieutenant General uh our our lieutenant governor who will be applying to a vessel for the will of the king fish\nAnd then human figures he has to go to Washington so he gets here and he finds out he can whip these people just as easily as he whipped him down in Baton Rouge\nAnd that the reporters here are just like the reporters they're desperate for good copy desperate for wild stories or he finds out that the same levers of power that work there work here and he went right to work in in the course of very little time he found

point of uh of him grasping for the ultimate political power\nWill take them out to the context in Nineteen thirty six I'm there were a lot of people who thought that the American system of government probably that the smaller Republicanism wasn't gonna work um that what was happening in Europe was maybe a better solution um the depression had proven intractable\nAnd you have national social national socialism in Germany or you have fascism in Italy and Spain you have a strong argument being made here including a with a bunch of American adherents people like Henry Ford and Charles

state\n[noise]\n\n\nYeah what about the jumbo had a job when I have six six five votes jumbo six six five oh five four six to six I can remember the last roller coaster I was all this was at a at Opry land as I recall and they have a a thing that the twist you through I guess a like a three hundred and sixty degree\nI think it's kind of like a model rail and I'm sure that our gifts to pay tribute go knows what it is I don't remember it was very brief I remember that I mean that that it felt like it lasted about one second [laughter] do you do you do what ride that was\nYes I Do actually I was one of the first rides I actually was on it it also had a little bit of a what we call a corkscrew\nWhich is just gave you exactly\nOn that that was a while Bosch I think it was called the ... or something along those lines and was very short it only had that one little law that one that one little area but yes I'm very familiar with it and uh\nUh in today's standards it probably like a kitty ride but back then it was a it was pretty good and and of course opulent was a great place to that to put an amusement park right next to\nThe er the opulent hotel and the and the grand old Opry\nAnd I have to admit it was ah how should I put an exhilarating\nAh I most viewed it definitely woke me up I I remember that that we had been quite busy we're doing my show from a from Opry land and and the couple of our staffers who were there with me and uh I guess you could say that I was a little bit tired at this point and and uh it woke me up Yes sir\nLived there'll be no doubt about that [laughter] certainly did [laughter]\nIt was actually called the ... if I ...\nOh yeah all that well anyway I'll put it this way it didn't lead me say this is off will just be saying well\nIt was okay and since you know as as a guest of the park I got to ride for free I okay that's fine but I paid to do it again no not really make them again of course that's that that's just me what are some of the places out there when you think Halloween and thrill rides\n... drove you go what places do you think about\nWell there's some great ones out there that started I actually ah a a in um in law actually have started a I guess it was around September late September and go all the way until Halloween some of the places that come to light of course the universal studios\nAll went to the hallowed Harlem Nights at universal studios and that's all based on a you know pretty much a American horror story the walking dead the shining great place to go a pretty scary now if you want to go the reverse and\nSo the place where you have to be totally scared and and uh you know they they do some good shows but it's a great place to go with the kids of course you've got Disney World\nAnd Disneyland that have the Mickey not so scary\nAnd uh you know they they do some good shows but it's a great place to go with the kids of course you've got Disney World and Disneyland that have the Mickey not so scary Halloween a I guess a park and\nOff for the kids and of course you got the food do you uh Halloween parade and of course the fireworks to happy hollow wishes or over the other thing uh some of the better\nOnes are as we just mentioned to that of course Six Flags and all the Six Flags locations have the right fast\nWhich is your Claire classic scare zones all you know where you go into these mazes and uh you know this stuff like uh the ... the the sewer soles in a which is layer and places like that um and of course the the point has got hollow ah weekends\nOr with the great pumpkin or that that that goes on there are ... high school shows the entertainment is absolutely amazing my daughter actually had to audition for one of these shows at Six Flags\nAnd are they really are they really get into this big time or I mean or even the chain stores sound extremely we'll plus David changed the names of the rides sometimes\nAre for example over at scare winds are which is a Carol wins in Charlotte North Carolina uh they've got an actual fleet street or where you can go through the cobblestones of the street and of course demented scare crows\nAnd zombies and then of course uh you know uh the the age old uh you know Dr Jekyll and Mr hyde or be be found there as as well as a you know a bunch of other characters are\nFrom a lot of the novel is a great place to go so there there's a whole bunch of places that I Would say there's about maybe two or three dozen or that actually do this uh and uh they're just a you know the rise is still open the weather is fairly decent and people have fun\nLet's talk about the term age appropriate over how many of these are places you wouldn't you wouldn't take your kid even if your kid loves a scary rides\nWell the good thing about all these places where they were universal studios knots berry farm which is in a ... that's ... that's ... basically Anaheim or we mentioned to the fight fast in the phantom lights over Kenny would ah how screaming Williamsburg Tampa Busch Gardens\nAre and of course Carolyn in Mickey's not so scary Halloween all these places that we've mentioned plus others um\nDuring the day you know during the day it\nReally is it like that or it all happens pretty much when the sun goes down and ... awake and that's pretty much or most of these places with you you have kids in there and they're pretty frightened you probably don't want to go at night to these amusement parks but if you do there were scare zones their actual zones\nWhere you'll you know you'll be scared and there'll be people that will jump out of corners and of course the mazes and and and all the different things that go on the actual entertainment themselves in the places that are non scare zones\nAre are very family friendly\nAnd very age appropriate so uh and and of course they they normally will or\nWill tell you with it if they're easily marks where these places are where you can bring your kids even at night or just to see the shows are we just have a good time on the rise and not have to worry about you know paint totally you know scared or or having a kid have a traumatic experience with that\nPut another way that the lawyers who have made sure that none of these places are going to subject your kids do something that might make mommy and daddy call the lawyer\nAbsolutely I mean that's the ah the people that are here you know and again my daughter actually did this for several years she loved it and she had a fun time\nWhile going through college in in a a there are rules and regulations that they follow you don't normally if you're an older person you know that they're probably not going to try to scare you is if maybe or a teenage gals\nOr or something along those lines so you know there are different marks and different people that they'll they'll actually go and give the full one hundred percent presentation and others\nThey know when to back down and do they know if if if they scared you\nThat probably the leave you alone if if if it's really really bothering you again that's all part of the training program one of the reasons why I I like uh he's amusement parks in what they do and how they train people in order to make sure that it is a very good experience for for many\nUh and again there are there is there a scare zones and there are ... are you know if you're going into a scare zone then you know something is going to happen\nOr not I don't want to go back and to take a look at that in greater detail in just a moment\n\nWhen does humor in the valley we're talking about in the home we live more news pioneer hand\nOr you will find them at the amusement parks because it's a way for the entire family to actually get together and enjoy a day I mean even the older people uh you've got scooters that can go are you know around with the scooters as now have to worry about the walking you know the miles as they say four miles on average that you would at an amusement park\nSo I think that's one of the things that was really really intelligent it was that uh that means imports and not just geared for kids anymore they're geared for all family members and that's why they do so well\nStay with us more to compete tribute go an expert on travel and amusement parks and look at some things besides the the bazaar the frightening him a match the

[noise] we do what we can write to ah to entertain ourselves\nTo what extent up each of you go have we become jaded and all of this that is to say uh you have to constantly come up with new things but the the been there done that syndrome is that something that plagues the people who who run the thrill rides\nWell that's the that's the key I mean going back to the Y. Bosch animal that you rode over a um I guess I have to be at least\nThirty years ago in order to to do that or you know from now take here um you know people that love to ride roller coasters or or or get you know that that that Russia or whatever you want to call it um they want well of course they're going to go higher they want to go faster and the manufacturers have a real problem because\nYou want to keep your writers conscious during the entire rely on their you know somebody in\n[laughter] so so you really have to to walk the line and of course but computer technology now uh it's actually a lot better than you know how many how much cheaper for so many G forces of body can take\nNot up highlights somebody who's experienced and trained to do that and in good physical shape\nSo that's the big key is to be able to make it stimulating exciting at the same time but not a you know have any problems or have any negative effects that are that occur that's wise stimulation rides are actually very big these days\nAnd what I mean by that is the track never actually really moves\nWhat happens is you actually have you with a three D. or forty glasses or you actually sit in in a compartment or that looks like it's actually moving for example storing is a classic example over at Disney where you think you're actually on hang glider and and being a pilot I can tell you it looks very real\nOr that this is all happening so the simulation right take a much smaller footprint there are a little less money but at the same time you can get that same impression and if you don't like the right just close your eyes and it pretty much all goes away\nInteresting ah if you buy that we'd never experience these are these virtual environments that they can be pretty intense I I have a chance to do that a number of years ago and I can only imagine how much a better they've gotten with the passage of time [noise]\nDo any of these thrill rides a emulate a a real life version of let's say a video game but we mentioned a movie like a like a ghost busters and what about video games\nWell not necessarily video games because of their life since then and then there are certain a deep\nYou're Ghostbusters in front of video games\nWell not necessarily video games because of their life since then and then there are certain details that you need to to follow but but you didn't mention ah like sitcoms like The Simpsons for example or different events like track of course the movie you'll find that a universal studios\nBut as far as an actual mimic it it does mimic what goes on is that nowadays the big thing happens to be on the old would roller coaster that really are not intense\nWhat you do is you put on the board the glasses and they cover your entire face a wire going through a small a roller coaster and feeling the wind and the breeze into your face\nOr what you're getting is you're actually getting a simulation ride or maybe out in outer space or something or or some other planet or or some other situation where now all of a sudden that ride that normally only goes twenty or thirty miles an hour it goes up and down maybe a little bit\nAs now more intense also that seems to be another way that they're revamping some of the old rides to make them a lot more interesting\nHere's a call from Rita in Dallas on the jumbo had showed one eight six six five oh Jim bow and our guest beat tribute go Hi Rita\nHi I just wanted to share something with you uh we're now in the last week of the great month long state fair Texas and my daughter took her four year old grandson to the fair and she told me that our state fair now as an information desk\nWhere they put a bracelet on the child which the child cannot take off with the child's name and the parents' phone number it's on the inside the brain so that someone could not come up and pretend they know that child in ... right here than me\nBecause of the names on the inside but if a child gets lost\nThen it's easy to find there at that age then\nThat's an interesting thought utterly of to say the least and encouraging one of the safety in general a peep tribute goes that some people it's practiced and all of these a major theme parks and uh and scary rides\nYes it absolutely has to be because of course the the life blood of any amusement park is directly proportional to the amount of accidents incidents of problems that occurred at a particular place a again you very rarely hear of a roller coaster incident and when it does happen\nIt'll be on CNN or MSNBC or Fox News or one of the major networks because it becomes a big news kind of like a plane crash\nSo it doesn't happen very often security has been a stepped up especially at places like ah you know it's a Six Flags or

understand that they were in fact that just to make up a safe\nFor I was under the impression that they were not detonated so as that that to keep the components\nAre intact enough to ah to examine them I think that they were certainly diffused that I Know the term that has been used by the the government potentially explosive devices which makes me wonder\nIf they might not have contained explosive but we're not hooked up in such a way as to go off which would certainly explain why none of them did but I don't believe that\nThat they were were detonated because you would be destroying evidence\nBy mistake well I I Know I I think so yeah I was just what I was just wondering if there was you know if they had given information as far as how strong they were\nI I've not heard any information about these except to have been called\nA potentially explosive devices I found that term to be a rather intriguing in terms of government euphemisms potentially explosive devices\nSays to me that it's something that contains explosive materials but it's not hooked up in such a way that it would go off now that that could be reading more into it then the government intended but that's how it sounds\nBottoms up by my main who cares that either went off for that I'm Still up\nA well it is edited it still is dangerous and all but it's certainly matters in terms of how it was put together if for example\nLet's say I jam a bunch of ah oh diesel fuel and ammonium nitrate or something into a package like the Oklahoma City bombing but I don't include any detonator or method by which it could be set off\nThen that would be a potentially explosive device but it would not be something that you could expect to go off and that makes a lot of difference in terms of the the the motive of whoever was behind this\nOh yes sir um I I don't know anything about Bob except\nThey go boom that these were exposed to good good absolutely good\nWell good certainly are in in in in terms of human safety and possibly good in determining a motive if you go to the trouble of sending out a a device that that is designed not to go off\nAnd at least in the case of the Brennan package or included white powder that was described by the government is harmless\nThen you wonder what's going on here then that gives a lot of credence to the false flag notion that this was designed simply to

the history there in what Chris was put together every man a king a short colorful history of American populace and it's published by a twelve and Chris thank you for joining us tonight\nWell it certainly my pleasure thank you for having me\nAbsolutely let's start with just where you would start that is to say at what point did you say we had a political leader who could be defined as a populist\nWell think about it this way in American history even before there was a country or even before there was a constitution even in the discussion about drafting the constitution there were people who felt\nPerfectly convinced absolutely sure that there were elites your work crafting that document people in New York people in Philadelphia maybe wealthy planners in Virginia\nWere conspiring against their interests\nBecause really when we talk about populism and the American tradition what we're talking about is grievance we're talking about a subset of the population that feels like they have been cheated or that they have been wrong or that their interests are being worked against often and then the fairest way\nOr the bankers the elites me they whomever a and populism ... when we have outbursts when we have a rupture and a popular sentiment in the United states it's when that constituents he gets to be large enough\nSo you know we all read the federalist papers and everybody knows Alexander Hamilton because of the play and all of that stuff but while they were doing that uh there were anti federalist too there were people who said you guys are cooking the books against us and we don't like it\nRoosevelt said at the time um this that there was populism on the right\nAh ah Douglas MacArthur who had busted up the bonus army these were a pensioners from the first World War who are owed a bonus that had been approved by Congress from the first World War and during the depths of the depression they showed up on moss in Washington they marched on Washington and then they set up a tent city on the other side of the Anacostia River from where I'm sitting right now\nAnd a MacArthur ah he was a a veteran of the first World War rainbow division highly decorated he rode tanks into this camp and there was a reactionary hard line on the right\nThere was a reactionary we've got to deal with this and these things but Roosevelt biggest concern when he when he called a Huey Long and Douglas McArthur\nThe two most dangerous man in America he was talking about those twin threats that you describe about the about the reaction areas on the right

lead his tone and certainly Chris Steiner wall points that out of the very beginning of his book every man of king as he writes was Andrew Jackson was beginning his second term as president at Eighteen thirty three\nThe board at Harvard University he thought it would be appropriate to bestow upon him an honorary doctorate of laws now than\nThe man he had beaten was a Harvard to allow them or maybe John Quincy Adams and\nHis response to this as he wants told a cousin and this is a quote that has reverberated through his great\nAs myself and affection a child of our alma mater I Would not be present do with this her disgrace and conferring her highest literary honors above the barbarian who could not write a sentence of grammar\nAnd hardly good spell his own name unquote which uh aside from being shall we say a little bit opinionated was also way off the market Andrew Jackson himself happen to be a lawyer I'll be a not a a a Harvard law but good certainly manage a sentence and the spelling of his own name your thoughts\nAre accurate checks in with a rough uh was rough here and there are old hickory was a no sophisticated 'em and his spelling was spelling was uh interesting sometimes\nSo it was George Washington's repeat snake\nSo I was just about to say so and so's mind if I don't use spell check 'em\nBut you know the the reality for John Quincy Adams the the belief among the founders and it very then um but even with Jefferson or who invasion Yom and farmer\nI'm reading the news under the shade of the tree is as he rested from his plow hum and the the rule of the commenters but so even among the\n... were then the Republican Democrat um but even among the ... the the the more democratically minded of the day it would have been hard to imagine\nThat there would be a leader arise that would not be from the nobility from the from the ... right that you would not have the uh Presbyterian or not an Anglican uh not a congregation less but that you would have somebody who was not from Virginia\nNot from Massachusetts not to the men are born not to the merchant class not a planner but instead the frontiers men now Jackson was astonishingly successful in Tennessee he made himself amazingly well the\nUh he was the governor of Florida he was a justice on the state Supreme Court or he was the states for senator\nHe was a general uh for them in the black hawk wars he did a uh he did a lot or not in the black hawk wars but in the uh uh the creek wore\nA he did all kinds of things he was he was a renaissance man and a lot of ways but he felt way outside especially as a Scots Irish men he fell away outside of what the expectations of the founders would have been for the kind of guys for the kind of men who the populated because the assumption was that there would be such a press that\nThe natural human preference for\nUm excellence for elite is um for those things would have drawn men from the same category but what they\nDidn't count on was when you do have a wave of immigrants and you do change the makeup of the population the expectations and descriptions for what an excellent man might be will change\nAnd uh certainly overtime ah they they obviously have a part of it I suppose with geographic here was the first or a president to came from uh west of the Appalachian Mountains\nAbsolutely and that westward expansion of the puppet show jacks and it's interesting Jackson's legacy is only\nUltimately sealed by James Paulk\nOne term president who should have finished his work\nUm who uh after a a a diversion a diversion folk gets back in and they finished the westward expansion everything was about moving west more space more land more room for Americans to spread out and of course this is how Jackson\nA earned the pigment may uh and the infamy for his trail of tears and the Indian removal act this is how\nJackson you know it's it's interesting if you see yourself as a victim as Jackson did Jackson no matter how

him moving had about a century now from Jackson as you right here is Christopher walled in the ...\nIn the summer of Nineteen thirty five Huey Long was the sensation that is an understatement [laughter]\nHe was a while to man he was a wild thing and uh what's interesting\nIs he had he had run for the United States Senate a as a stunt basically to re consolidate power\nIn Louisiana and his intention was that he would\nTry to hold the governorship in the Senate seat at the same time he wanted the legislature he was a lame duck and the legislature was being a was starting to a pale uh at the demands of the king fish the emperor of Louisiana\nAll of the things that he told them to do there was they were starting to have some opinions and he did not like that\nSo he ran he figured if he ran statewide for that Senate seat he could show his great power\nAnd he did but then he found out he couldn't do both so he wins but doesn't go sir waiting in Nineteen thirty two but he doesn't go serve until eventually constitutional crisis he uh has called out the state National Guard\nOr to prevent the lieutenant governor from take the oath of office he said but eventually he finds a a more accommodating Lieutenant General uh our our lieutenant governor who will be applying to a vessel for the will of the king fish and then he we figure she has to go to Washington\nSo he gets here and he finds out\nHe can whip these people just as easily as he whipped him down in Baton Rouge\nAnd that the reporters here are just like the reporters they're desperate for good copy desperate for wild stories or he finds out that the same levers of power that work there work here and he went right to work in in the course of very little time he found himself a absolute sensation a national political figure and people couldn't get enough of it\nHere is a floor speech just one excerpt from Huey Long talking to his fellow senators a mob is coming here and six months to hang the other Ninety five you damn scoundrels Lima undecided whether the stick here with you or go out and lead them\nWell okay [laughter] we'll put you down as undecided you see that as undecided\n[laughter] now that are there came a time when he became a something of a sensation about possibly challenging Franklin Roosevelt for the presidency what happened to at this point of ah of him grasping for the ultimate political power was\nAbout to the context in Nineteen thirty six I'm there were a lot of people who thought that the American system of government probably that the smaller Republicanism wasn't gonna work um that what was happening in Europe was maybe a better solution um the depression had proven intractable\nAnd you have national social national socialism\nIn Germany or you have fascism in Italy and Spain you have a strong argument being made here including a with a bunch of American adherents people like Henry Ford and Charles Lindbergh or Joe Kennedy and others who said hey you know maybe we ought to pay attention to this maybe this is a more modern scientific way to approach things\nAre and the moment we we take for granted\nOur our institutions are weak now relative to how they were say fifty years ago but we it's hard for us to grasp you know on the day that Pearl Harbor was bombed the American Nazi Party cling two hundred thousand members are a lot of the things and norms that we take for granted today in the pit of the great depression or not\nThat was not that was not everybody was an agreement that the American system was the best and long\nYou know this very vivid apostle this this this wild man who had an amazing gift for oratory and amazing gift for facts and figures could talk his way out of anything a and had developed because\nThe poor people in America show many poor people in America felt that he was one of them and understood their plight um it it was happening\nUm whether or not he was really getting challenged Roosevelt thirty six I don't know um he had a being Huey Long he had lied about it and he had talked about it and several different ways depending on who he was talking to 'em but whether or not he was going to challenge the threat that he could topple Huey Long and when\nAnd when and went on a platform or that he can topple Roosevelt and when and do so on a platform that basically called for repealing the American system that it was time that we had something more like a dictator who had the power\nTo deal with entrenched interests who where he said we're harming the common people\n[noise] how did he die [laughter]\nWell I I Would say I would say absolutely um he was killed so a on a white as he was sort of reaching the peak or in August of thirty five is his big it he he is swinging for the fences um but then he has to go back to Louisiana\nTo finish up some work he's got to go back and tell the legislature what to do ... what to do and straighten some things out and he's got one judge who is a real problem for him and this judge keep striking down the obviously unconstitutional actions that he is trying to take 'em and so he is going to root this judge out", "year": "2018", "show_name":
