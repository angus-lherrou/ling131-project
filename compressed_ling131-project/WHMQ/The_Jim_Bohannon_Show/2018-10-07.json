name in it disintegrated into chaos it was a well meaning motivation as you heard from the beginning of that trailer about this new documentary uh but nonetheless\nAs they say about the the road the hell it is often paved with good intentions we're talking with a couple of the veterans of that particular conflict\nRetired brigadier general build David\nAnd a retired lieutenant colonel Michael Ettlinger beep and also another military veteran retired air force colonel\nRandy Larson the executive producer and the director of this new documentary film a sister was brought up I I think that it's a good time for you to inject this before we returned to the other two guests are Randy and that would be\nA or the or a bureaucracy ... through which you had to bludgeon your way or how how serious was that I mean did you receive a lack of cooperation or did you see outright opposition to what you're telling\nNo there was no opposition is trying to put a documentary film togethers are set up a nine month it's a marathon it's her dad at at the at the paper in the spring\nAnd at one to get the facts right and he was a lot of different ... movies and documentaries that kind of missed ... mountain but one of the most important things in this story is you know all the military leaders that us troops are simpler\nBy George Herbert Walker Bush because people are starving to death in President Bush said it can be annoying intact next month\nSo we had to send troops over there we went there for humanitarian reasons and then it turned into a credible fight but all senior military leaders in the show that the man said we need some armored vehicles over there and take our troops get in trouble she landed on space and Bradley fighting vehicle to protect them from the type of weapons the Somali a rumble hat\nAnd secretary defense laugh at me and said no we're not going to send them so when general day but it was colonel Simon and and and and colonel Ellen\nBut he was a major science when they had to go out there and rescue those rangers at the helicopters got shot down they had to go get the ladies in armored personnel carriers\n... their troops out ... us troops in there the U.S troops couldn't speak Malaysian\nIt's night there's it's incredible fire going on I Can't even imagine what that must have been light and so as I've been doing this research I mean I Am so impressed with everybody from the AFC or or\nThe end CEOs who are incredible that senior in the house and the leaders like a a build David my that would be and that's a nice should really be talking to here because\nFirst of all we should never put American troops in that position where we tell them here's a mission to go do but what you're not going to give you the resource that you say you need\nAnd and but I I just so proud that we get the honor the bedrooms and Mountain Division here on the twenty fifth anniversary\nWell I certainly would concur with you entirely I remember at the time although not realizing the extent to which was true but at the time uh when I was still I was doing this program as a matter of fact it's been that long but I remember\nA severely castigated new defense secretary Les Aspen for worrying about cosmetics about whether or not and and then one tank would make us look less like a peacekeeping mission at the time I thought you know the images is baloney although I was using stronger language and that ... let's talk to a\nA General David ... about that that part of this or that in retrospect would you say that you that you were sent into combat\nOr which which is what it was it what it turned out to be into combat with less than the resources that they should have been made available to you\nWere out to them I I think any commander with a would always want more resources but I think the uh\nUm\nOfficers who were in command positions senior to me made it very clear to the national command authorities that um\nArmored vehicles were required for survivor ability and um and to basically protect our four so yes obviously I'm you know the more arm or you can have around your anytime it's usually pretty good thing so um yeah we we certainly could have used it but we didn't have it\nYou know uh the situation dictated that we use what we had and so that's what we do\nThat is true and and ... yeah there's a gift please continue ran a yes\nNo I just want they build David Mike our be went into the gunfight that night in a hungry and I'm armored Humvees and like Mike that in the trailer it's like going in you know in a convertible Corvette and a parade everybody shooting at you and they were in a on armored on be more than a thousand people too\nAnd we all recall what happens do armored Humvees when they get hit with let's say I ...\nAnd ... ... ... uh it it was I assume common knowledge to everyone back then that among those forces active in Mogadishu at the time were those with RPGs rocket propelled grenades or certainly more than a match for ah for example for a Humvee or right\n[noise] well I think that is true but I think you also have to look at it in context at least from my perspective you know the basic mission was to go in and in the ... protects humanitarian assistance operations that were designed to feed the starving Somalis I don't think anybody anticipated\nI'm going and into a firefight I think part of that was a lack of recognition and in in my own over the last twenty five years at a lot of time to think about it and we we had this term called peacekeeping operations in Vermont perspective there's another peaceful about those kinds of operations\nThem in this case you had a set of ... you had to drive ... and having a beer\nYou brought the un and the un became a third drive by repair our food was the uh the the thing that had the most value they're fighting for that and I'm In it escalated I mean there were things that occurred back in June and July with the out of the house raids\nAnd I don't think the folks at home recognize that there was a fire fight\nOr until we got the three were up and so\nI think a lot of the calls for armor that we're not consistent with the information that was coming out a theater with regard to what was going on\nWell maybe not to the general public I wouldn't have to think the defense secretary Aspen have that information\nI think that's probably true ah but I'm not sure that he had the ability and I can't really speak for was asking I mean I I can only tell you the perspective that the folks that uh I was around on the ground had at that time and that was\nGenerally speaking a there was a very little information that was slowly out of Somalia back to uh either D.C or or back to you or to centcom indicate what was really going on in theater so I don't I'm not sure that they really understood you know firefights we'd already been in prior to the third and fourth of October\nDriven up where the

able to reconnect with you you may not remember may at the she'd made so many thousands of people make six years ago I asked permission to give you a hug which you granted when you were at a fund raiser\nFor our now lieutenant governor Dan Forrest\nI Do recall it'd be great is a is very rare that somebody wants to make usually they don't want to slight may\nHappen next year I understood correctly and it's a delight to talk to you\nAgain well we had our picture made together and I was just like a child I was just so thrilled because I have so much a respectful you and um you know just thrilled to pieces that you've got this show and doing so well and your daughter\nIs doing a\nAn incredibly wonderful job for the president and for the country\nWell thank you very much I'm very proud of her or I tell people that Donald Trump was not my first choice for president because I was my first choice as a buddy was my second choice and I also say wait at least we got a Huckabee and the White House just wasn't the one I thought what ended up being there\nYou know it's got to be tough as a dad to watch people beat up on her little girl every day and let's face it doesn't matter how growing up she gets she's always going to be your little girl\nWell she is but you know it doesn't make me nervous as people think and I'll tell you one because I Know are well enough to know how tough years in law she some guy like Jim Acosta smart often try to you know put the squeeze on her I'm more afraid for what's about\nTo happen to him I realized he's about to get his head handed to him who just don't know it yet and sure enough she turns and really Texan down a notch and I I watch are the guys like that and I'm thinking you know I've seen that same approach that she makes to her five year old and a three year old son\n[laughter] right I Love so much is the fact that you have supported President Trump\nAnd ... if everybody ... it would try to do that you know he did and our president\nThat is true is affected a lot of people seem to ignore [noise] Richard your call low Charlotte let's go to a Calvin in St Louis hello Calvin\nHey how are you where well\nYou're talking to the governor of the world there I mean I I I I grew up in Arkansas and when he said about girls is absolutely true because I have five girls\nAnd every one of them to take down just about anybody of fighting and stuff that they believe that it and you should just be so proud of your daughter I agree with that lady earlier but I just wanted to ask you as well I wanted to say something to\nYou know you're one of the most truthful people I have ever heard on the radio or TV or as a governor or as a politician\nOr concerning abortion and I think you're about the only person I hear a hundred percent of the time talking the truth about what that's about it and I think ... um I Would ask you I mean do you think that this has more to do about abortion but it does anything else where Kavanaugh facing this opposition\nI think it does a cow in in in large measure because the liberals are scared to death that there might be an honest look and or a revisit a rosy weight which was a ridiculous decision\nThat was a reaching out into thin air and creating a law that did not have any basis in the constitution\nBut what most people don't understand even grow the weight or reversed it doesn't end abortion all it does is it gives it back to the states and each and every state would make its own decision how it would approach it my own view is that the best way for us to deal with the abortion question\nIs to deal with it through the issue of person that hurt because if we would accept the biological fact this is your the science of of the unborn that every person is a person from the point of conception\nThen the Fifth Amendment would actually be far stronger than any Robie way a ruling ever could be in protests\nWhite liberty and the pursuit of happiness\nAnd would provide due process and would make it impossible for anyone to deprive a person of bear a life and liberty and I I really hope that that's where we end up moving with this because there should be about protecting the innocent people not just about stopping abortion\nBecause after ten seconds here my that I Want you to stay on the line we'll speak all fair but I was doing a little checking your the calendar on inauguration day twenty twenty five you'll be sixty nine same ages Reagan was when he was elected president a year younger than Trump and and we've never had a president named Mike of what do you think [laughter]\nA gym I can tell you that there's a greater likelihood that I was a transgender surgery ever run for any public office\nFair enough [noise] well you can catch the man in

weather chance that some sprinklers on Monday and highest Seventy two and we are expecting temperatures on next week to be in the seventies I'm ... I'm not on one side and one is seven five yesterday my campaign\nOf whereas Republicans I think look at the ballot and they don't see the president's name anywhere instead they may see a lot of people\nThat they made you ride as a as rhinos Republicans in name only and uh\nAnd so uh I think those two viewpoints may not be a good news for Republicans\nYeah I'm up all true and I think all Trump has basically said that this is a referendum on the hand that as a nationalized election not good for a Republican\nOr any time the power and the party in\nPower and so they're trying to like that's a localized election er and not have a Trump is the main issue they on on a ... a judicial appointments or do they want that to me talk at\nBecause a ... story and it's still not great it's a

page\n[laughter] well you know it's interesting I'm a year to ... when we initially set up the trailer we actually had some glitches which we we have no reason to\nTo believe or to know that it was connected to the project itself but it does get one looking over the shoulder I mean what's interesting is uh Robert ... who's this a PHD used don't always peer reviewed studies I'm actually did research um which demonstrated how Google could swing\nAn election uh well you know one direction or the other\nUh by shifting millions of vote spy controlling the information they got the Washington Post ran a story on this and the next day he was blocked from Google\nYou actually could not access Google products at all I'm a similar thing happened to a doctor Jordan Peterson a we highlight in the film you say a\nPsychology professor at the University of Toronto uh\nHe was actually a blocked by Google or from accessing his Gmail accounts in is Google Calendar and his YouTube channel which you know has millions of people that have downloaded his conscience\nSo it does happen to people or more often than you think it just demonstrates the power that this company has to\nDecide if their whim a how they are going to control what you see and what you have access to\nBut they don't play favorites well I mean that they claim right I mean I mean I I don't think that the example you just gave our our particularly no worthy I mean there's sort of thing I I understand happens all the time and and and what the oil being that I that I I I just don't see how they can with a straight face claimed that they don't do this\nYou know that well that's exactly right and and one of the research studies that up Stein did\nThat is particularly interesting we'd go through this in the in the film or is during the twenty sixteen election uh you they actually enlisted volunteers around the country this was a a you know John a a blind way um but they basically enlisted volunteers and had them conduct searches um on both\nGoogle and bang as it related to the twenty sixteen election this was all five six month period\nAnd then they captured all the search results that people got now some of these volunteers were in red states where some were blue states some of the Republican somewhere Democrats independents all kinds of genders you know all kinds of social economic status and what they found when they review\nSo it was that you know things seem to be pretty balanced but Google and every single searched position of the top ten search results\nThis results favored Hillary Clinton\nWhat they essentially did was they suppressed negative stories about Hillary Clinton and the feed and they pushed negative stories like Donald Trump in the same search results um and you know by his estimate this had a somewhat dramatic effect on the election now it didn't\nShelter results at the end of the day um but ... contention is that Google was essentially\nSettling with the books and what's interesting about this is ... is essentially a political but he actually was a Hillary Clinton supporter in twenty sixteen oh and what he is concerned about of course it's not the political implications of this in terms of who wins who loses\nBut here's the real concern is do we really want to have a company\nHaving so much control over the flow of information that when I'm decided voters and you know there are a lot of undecided voters every election that one day sort sort of going to the Google Search and saying which candidate should I vote for\nA and looking at the search results do we really want to have a company with the power to influence the outcome potentially although elections and that's what the real concern is here\nI think that's a pretty fair concern will take some calls for our guest Peter Schweitzer at the one eight six six five oh jumbo one eight six six five oh five or six to six on the jumbo had a job when we come back in just a moment\n[noise]\nThat what you can see why there from the swim team ... something interesting about fifty one of my first Sunday\nA totalitarian has and it was all predicated on one thing Jim essentially the power of the state was going just smash in control people so you know in Nineteen eighty four it's big brother and you have these you know large television screens or these voices that are sort of pumping information to us\nBut it was visible it's kind of the you know the the\nThe clenched fist right in front of your face you know what we're facing now is not any kind of police state about what we are facing is this ominous power that is trying to persuade us that is trying to steer us in a certain direction but we can't really see the fist\nBut it's still there and the power is still there and I think you're exactly right I mean imagine a ... imagine on now or a stolen or a Mussolini\nThat had this kind of control over the flow of information I mean we've given them an enormous power and Google basically tells us trust us yeah last us\nGeorge Orwell you had no idea how right you were to Linda in Champaign, Illinois hello Linda\nHow can I Am I going to make a quick comment a lot of it they believe that the party has been building a Nazi techno state with still going on Facebook and all these people but what I really called to ask and I want to thank our guests for what he's doing and about search engines and\nThey're used to be I click which had and they they have another one called start page the same company that they got rid of X like and that was if he didn't want to use Google result he wanted other resolved and I don't understand that Google press\nDid they make them the press I click or what happened to it and I is that that uh\nYeah I Know that's a great question I mean this is this is fascinating when you look at at at how Google operates in the space so look at apple for example apple has this search engine called safari\nBut safari is actually run by Google Search algorithm and you know why because Google pays apple nine billion dollars a year\nFor the opportunity to run safari searches to think about that it's an apple product and Google is actually theoretically doing apple a favor\nBy doing their searches but it's actually Google that's paying apple and why is that\nBecause they wanted the information and the data that comes through search results because they can monetize it and sell it to other people and this is what Google is doing everywhere and you're exactly right star page a is a a search engine you get great race\nAbout her with them they have an agreement with Google that allows them to allow the search is to go without gay to be president I think that is that is going to change your bench leap you could start a de becoming more popular it was a deal struck awhile ago Dr phil always good\nIt it's not as good as Google and that's part of the challenge all of the challenges the best search engine out there in terms of results ineffectiveness is Google\nBut the place that you pay is they collect all this information on you and they are prepared to use that information against you\nTo either ... here you are manipulate you in a way Marshall gain or for other parts of their agenda and there really are not many great options out there and um there's even you know discussions about the fact that thing\nWhich is the Microsoft products which is sort of the great liable\nTo Google a centrally in twenty sixteen struck a commercial agreements a Microsoft and Google struck a commercial agreement we don't know exactly what that agreement is but um they essentially have stopped being so hostile to Google it a lot of people believe that there is some kind of a wage\nWith where they're doing a search they're cooperating and search so that's\nPart of the trails there really aren't that many great alternatives\nWe'll be back in the moment what are they pretend to be ready to play a is

S. specializes in making just we\nWere going to get huge amounts of weight\nColumbia says okay will specialize in just making coffee we get huge amounts of coffee then we'll trade our coffee for you and we both countries end up with more coffee and more weight without adding any more resources\nSo free trade benefits everybody well why is somebody complaining you would say and the answer is if we stop making coffee in my example that make just weak anybody making coffee is out of a job you say well you can go next week\nBut the skills may not be transferable from the industries that leave to the industries that are built up and that's what happened in in Canada the U.S has a a is very efficient at making dairy products\nTo to get free trade you should let us make\nThe dairy products and sell them in Canada we'd end up both countries would end up with more a production of dairy products but the problem is\nWhat happens is the Canadian dairy farmers well they should go do something else but they say we don't want to do something else do we want to continue to make dairy products for and that's what the rub is with with Canada All right\nTo a call from Sharon in crane Missouri yeah good evening Sharon\nGood evening can and not have made us a kid I think I heard today only what on radio is that China has announced that they are going to be paying tariffs\nOn Chinese specified items and it sounds like there's going to be quite a few items that they are terrified and second\nBad trade agreements that we had had\n... I'm Sorry I I just I'm too jaded anymore I Do not believe it's added sent out to its stake notion of well we've got to help everybody else\nThere is one law that goes about all of their lives when it comes to politics and power and that followed them money and if you follow in flood that is put on our politicians\nBy that audience by different governments by our own government if you follow that money you will find exactly why we have had bad trade agreements ratified\nWell we're coming up on a break your uh lifted Dodger give is the link here I'm sure in more learned opinion after the break a share and I will add a couple of things here uh to what you just said and please stay on the line or one would be of course that are no matter how much lobbying occurs on behalf of foreign governments and goodness knows there's a ton of that\nOutright passage of money to a political candidates for public office from foreign sources is very much a no no and the second thing is I think you are vastly underestimate him the extent to which so many elites in this country ... oh so so guilty about how rich we are I'm Jim ... and we'll be back in just a moment\n\n\nGiven point valid one on one by one seven five fourteen hundred and\nForty ... gym\nYeah except we don't have to have them build the tanks in the planes but if the tanks in the planes have so much steel and them we can buy to steal from the Chinese are much lower cost\nThan it cost them for us to make it ourselves then instead of these planes costing whenever they cost a few million dollars a piece you can reduce the cost to make the planes we don't need to give China our technology we don't need to let them make the finished product but if they can make components\nCheaper than we can make them ourselves are we better off taking it from them um and that allows us to produce the cheaper and that will be better off for us is\nWhich raises another point and I always ... there'll be I'm going to bring up when we come back from the break but the point is you said that ... we we shouldn't have to give the the Chinese are uh our intellectual property secrets but of course to build a plant in China Today that's exactly what the Chinese extracted from us\nAnd we'll come back we'll talk some more about uh some of the the Chinese applications that possibly this new trade agreement with Mexico and Canada a

when eight six six five oh jumbo one eight six six five oh five or six to six were talking to Dr Michael butler from Stockton University a professor of finance there and also a public policy analyst\nAnd we're looking at the new proposed a trade deal again it's not a done deal yet it has to get congressional approval but uh it uh I suppose it is not a stretch to assume that even a badly divided Congress\nWould be able to say yes to a fair amount of what is in this\nLet's talk to David who calls in from San Francisco tonight to David good evening\n[noise] yes I Am up in your guest I I'm Out here in San Francisco we've got two major a financial problems directly tied to this Chinese steel\nAnd uh one is the bay bridge which got opened a just a fabulous the shore to five years ago and it was\nThis was the new post earthquake Bay Bridge right\nRight yeah and in fact uh if you remember just a dollar value or at at in the Nineteen eighty nine earthquake they said it would be a quarter of a billion dollars to fix the bridge when the new bridge opened a couple of years ago it\nWas a what six billion dollars in costs in six billion and financing so it went well forty eight times to become a twelve billion dollar broken bridge\nAnd I was defective when it when it opened\nThen are you saying that that was built with with Chinese steel oh yeah and what was going well I didn't know that yeah\nAnd what was significant about it Arnold was the governor and this\nCrush more funding right okay yeah\n... was the Republican governor and lily brown was the former mayor the two of them put it together and they created they actually created a foundry in China to manufacture the ... the bridge apart there\nWere very few repeating part so it was almost entirely customs and the they had something like twenty thousand inspectors per part\nOr you know each park had to have an inspector massive art ... almost to the to the man they refused to accept delivery on the part yet it was over written by a a project manager who had no right to override\nWell that that sounds like a terrible deal I must say although I'm not sure quite how it fits into the the context of this discussion regarding a trade matters other than the fact I I guess the professor bus or you should always look twice when dealing with the Chinese\nBut a a Kurd in Rochester, Minnesota is a next step below Kurt\nHigh you know the thing that bothers me about the ah the steel if you're from China is if you drive a car\nA lot and you have to have your brakes read done you may have found out over the last Twenty years that you can't turn a rotor\nAnymore because the Chinese steel that all the car owners are made out of it is so poor that it is not turn of all\nYou know years ago you used to be able to take a break rotors or your drums in and you could Milam down and get another life out of them but nowadays everybody has to throw away their owners because the ... the Chinese steel may be cheaper\nBut the quality is also she\nAll right I Want our guest to comment about there'll be led to calls regarding the quality of of dealing with the Chinese [noise]\nIf it's that bad at least in regard to steal I mean you know when you when you buy a a broom and Walmart you're really not looking for the the\nThe the nicest brew him out there you want something that will sweep the floor or something like this is well I mean uh in the case of the break drums a that's not such a good thing in the case of bridges that's a terrible thing maybe you'll get will die or is that another problem\nIn trading with the Chinese the question of qualities that we had a question some time back about\n... I forget who was food or pharmaceuticals but there was some serious question about Chinese quality\n[noise] yeah that's that's always an issue in a product like steel obviously quality is a essential there especially are going into products\nOr like a bridge or something that could cause a severe a injuries but how about some of the uh smaller consumer prize look at the textile in industry\nSo if I'm In California used to have a huge textile industry and workers were making let's say twenty dollars an hour and as a result of that they made a real nice shirt that sold for fifty dollars well\nThey decided to outsource to make the ... the uh shirts in China where people are at the time were paid about a dollar a day so now they can make the shirt a and sell it instead of for fifty dollars they can sell the shirt now for twenty dollars so well that some people would say that's a very positive thing\nUh it's negative in that people will lose jobs here but it's positive in that all consumers now can\nMuch more goods and services because the prices are are lower\nExcept of course those workers are outta work who can't afford anything at all I mean the notion that we should we should we should build our economy strictly around consumers uh that that strikes me as a little short sighted and in fact it may be one of the principal reasons for what happened in the twenty sixteen presidential election", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Jim Bohannon Show", "city": "Greenfield", "day": "07"}
