I Would do too I I Would to David's point also say this is that um\nI have spoken to some congregations were her from congregations that say even if they the option\nOf an armed guard were were viable for them\nIn many cases is some of them have very been very clear and expressing to me the fact that they don't want to do that they don't want to worship with\n'em an armed guard it almost gives them

of the imagination and to your first point Jim heartening every target is neither possible nor practical there's a men's cost there\nAre I Am saying that within the confines of the or the options that you have it is certainly preferred to do that than it is to station the armed guards if if if David concerned about\nThe image of the ... you know philosophy that it gives of of having a a an armed guard they're hardened target you know put the overlay of a hard target and unarmed card there I'm suggesting\nOf all of them heartening that target before you put a guard there at least ... seats to dissuade or deter or to protect from those that are inside it there so\nUh you know one of the spectrum of things I'm not I'm not suggesting we go to this I think that the degree that David thing the other thing is is that\nWe we we have heart and targets every everywhere it's just the terminology we go to the courthouse ... you know you're the courthouses oftentimes protected that's a form of art and target\nYou when you fly from point a to point B you go through TSA checkpoint there's a lot seen and I've seen things that go along there that target as hard as well too so that that's not parts

everything\nTo being Donald Trump's fault I mean you you you got I got I understand that you have not jobs on either side so you have the job that was supposedly a Trump supporter that sent you know those bombs and everything like that but then you have a\nSpecific shooting which is a terrible tragedy but how do you blame him for that\nWell I mean he he is on record the shooter in Pittsburgh it's really the Donald Trump is they try to even use\nAnd he's anti Donald Trump either their leader that is true I I just don't understand how that happens and I think the more that that do the liberal media pushes that that the more that the right\nRises up and it's going to get out there and vote because that's really the only way you can dispute this [noise] and I like it out there and vote\nThat I've certainly I'm all in favor of everyone the getting up there and the and voting and uh let's bring this to our guest\nI've I Believe the as the caller that there is a great deal of blame placed on the president when in doubt blame the president on the other hand\nA President Trump I think at times is his own worst enemy he makes enemies he doesn't need to make and there's sometimes more interested in getting an applause line from his base is in\nThe thinking about the the way he says things he creates problems for himself in in my view a doctor banks can\nBut you know I think that can be said object cannot everybody who's ever served in political off it but he clearly you know we've got our eyes on yeah but we have to situation here in San Juan where we have an outlet ad that Trump supporter\nAnd then on the heels and that that we've got to get your waist and with someone who gets spies that's ... so its outlay isn't that ball cap blame this\nAnd then on the heels and that that we've got a situation where someone who gets spies that's ... so it's not reasonable blame this on the president's ... had issues like this before Trump as president and they will have an average of hot and we will\nWe will that is the state of the world that we live in right now unfortunately though can blame it on someone who is in political office that's just kind of a cop out in my opinion\nI Would agree with you completely and certainly unfair to blame these incidents on the president\nBut it I think is fair to say that the president sets themselves up as an easy target for criticism sometimes maybe not maybe not fair criticism but as an easy target\nA and he could avoid some of that if you would ah would simply go about about doing so let me ask you a doctor bench than about the state\nOf a mental health care and facilities in this country right now I Would assume that you would be among those who say we need more\nOf everything a clinics Monday a therapist what have you\nOh absolutely right Jim you know it it's not good\nFor sure but then there's plenty of room for improvement you know as a mental health provider in the field for Thirty years I've taken a pay cut every year because the rates of Medicare go down and the insurance goes with it and then where we were asked to see more patient and a shorter amount of time\nIn the in a certain amount of time to make an accurate diagnosis that an accurate treatment plant and when individuals can't find help\nThen they just go further and further into that ditch\nAnd in many of these situations worse team that there is a history of at least symptom even that's not diagnosable mental health conditions about what we're seeing in America is that the American Psychological Association has found that\nIt can nine percent of Americans consider us to be at the lowest point in the United states history and that's causing them stress\nAnd what do you know it might help if they if they understood something about American history or well it literally the sixties only you only have to go back fifty years to find a comparable period and have you back a hundred and fifty years to ... the civil war and leading up to it it vastly exceeded today so again we have\nNo rational basis for that guy the script worse than American history only says one thing that you don't know much about American history of you believe that\nI Would agree with you can but they they're in lies the problem the problem is that we're dealing with people's perception\nAnd their perception is their reality so

Sasse was written them published by St Martin's press and ...\nWhy we hate each other and how to heal talking about the impact of pushing us away from knowing for example who lives two doors down\nA a warning here ah ... alert coming up yeah back in my day good being an older fellow I can recall pre air conditioning and we used to sit outside of a summer evening because it was a cool place to sit on the porch and neighbors would be outside and we would just naturally start to converse\nI remember when we got our first air conditioning unit\nIt was awfully comfortable in that house but I Confess at that point oh I I still do the people I had known before but new people to move into the area I was less inclined to know your thoughts\nAnd I don't think that the games are allowed I think that the wisdom\nBut new people to move into the area I was less inclined to know your thoughts\n[laughter] um I don't think that the games are allowed I think that the wisdom advisory I'm so let me give you another one that that's not from my book but this is one from the book but it's the same exact point\nIn the last Seventy years in America the average size of new home construction in the U.S has grown by more than three acts\nMore than three times larger average new home sized now compared to the midnight in fifty\nBut one of the things we know is that when your house gets larger and your life get large it gets larger the separation from your neighbors gets larger and you end up having fewer of those relationships in your community\nAnd so there are places in America where people are thinking a lot about what do you do to restore that sense of walk ability so that neighbors know each other and rely on each other more and there is there's a move in some communities again it it feels artificial sometimes ...\nAt one of the things we're trying to do is move from a big huge back deck like I Confess we have at our house\nOr to a front porch which is closer to the proximity what are your neighbors are walking by\nThere is happiness it's correlated with having gone through that shared experience not just of getting to converse with your neighbor 'cause you're not locked up inside your house\nBut frankly having even something in common as boring as the weather on those days when it's really hot and you were sharing that front porch of because you didn't have the air conditioning it was something you went through to gather humans are relational beings we are social animals were not just mounds\nOur verbs we want to do stuff and we want to do stuff in common with other people and a lot of times shared experiences even if there are imperfect or become the foundation of future character and future bonds even scar tissue or on your on your fourteen year old or when you're a seven year old is something that becomes a foundational experience for future memory\nNow than the drop in our average lifespan now that's a real physical problem it's not about relationships\nOr at least I don't think it is ... this has been one of the hallmarks of the American existence shura the next generation has been or opportunities higher income or education and they live longer what happened\n[laughter] yeah I actually think it is related to relationships at the national institutes of health now there's a new consensus emerging in the last five to seven years um that the number one health crisis in America is actually loneliness ten years ago you couldn't find anybody at the national institutes of health\nWould have told you anything other than obesity as the number one\nDriver of health problems are and and public health expenditure and the U.S now about Seventy percent\nOf obesity is viewed as after Saddam and all of that sort of a downstream consequence of loneliness it isn't the case that people get fat and then they lose their friends if\nThe people get lonely and then they get fat and so in the near term biggest driver of costs that American health care is an obesity is defined as being more than thirty pounds overweight and a a pretty hefty share of American about thirty four percent of folk\nUh are obese most of that as a downstream consequence of loneliness\nOpioid addictions overdoses suicide a whole big range of the new drivers of early mortality are things that seem to be related to not having a lot of social architecture and your life not having a lot of friends not having a lot of community\nNot having membership and a lot of organization this is really new we've had\nPretty good public health data on what people die of\nFour eighty to a hundred years right now and we've only one time in the last six years at\nEven two years is declining lack of expectancy in Nineteen sixty two Nineteen sixty three that was a flu epidemic that bridge over the calendar year and we had two straight years of declining life expectancy this you're turning Eighteen we're gonna have a third consecutive year of declining life expectancy in the U.S\nAnd it is driven overwhelmingly by deaths of despair suicides an addiction and overdose and opioids is one of the debate drivers most all of that is related to decline and community that's not to say there are also\nEconomic consequences but there is an interplay between declining economics and declining community\nSo a bunch of places in America that we think about sort of be industrialized saying you have economic collapse and community collapse working in tandem fewer jobs are less sense of meaningful shared work with other people and the declining sense of participation\nAnd neighborly association of America and these kind of crisis or the crises are vicious cycles\nAll right that covers the problem is most of which I think we were vaguely aware of all not not as well outlined certainly as in the book them but the second part of the subtitle why we hate each other and how do you feel what are your solutions\nI give you a three and four big ones are

I Would do too I I Would to David's point also say this is that um I have spoken to some congregations are her from congregations that say even if they\nThe option of an armed guard were were viable for them\nWhich in many cases it is some of them have very been very clear and expressing to me the fact that they don't want to do that they don't want to worship with\n'em an armed guard it almost gives them the feeling that they've ... related to terrorism or terrorism or the threat is driving in clearly that's an option you know clearly that is an option that's what they've chosen I also want to be clear is I'm not suggesting by any sense of the imagination and to your first point Jim\nHeartening every target is neither possible nor practical there's a men's cost there\nAre I'm saying that within the confines of the or the options that you have it is certainly preferred to do that than it is to station the armed guards if if if David concerned about\nThe image of the ... you know philosophy that it gives of of having a a a\nAn armed guard there are a hardened target you know put the overlay of a hardened target in an armed guard\nThere I'm suggesting of all of them heartening that target before you put a guard there at least ... seats to dissuade or deter or to protect from those that are inside there so\nUh you know one of the spectrum of things I'm not I'm not suggesting we go to this I think to the degree that David saying the other thing is is is\nWe we we have heart and targets every everywhere it's just the terminology we go to the courthouse you know you're the courthouses oftentimes protected that's a form of art and target\nWhen you fly from point a to point B you go through TSA checkpoint there's a lot of scene and unseen things that go along there that
