five oh jumbo is our number Dr ... you\nTake note of the idea that there are two spectrums of any allergy objective truth and subjective truth I Would contend that while that indeed maybe put forward out there in this world of ours that subjective truth is an oxymoron your thoughts\nYes absolutely totally I I think it was incredibly telling a if you call this in the cabinet or hearing the Democrat Senate the starting with Cory Booker used the phrase\nA truce when talking about the test Monday from Dr Ford buddies so telling her truth\nThere's no such thing as her truth either the truth or there isn't true so yes this is\nThis is what you get this post modern is and this is the the the construction of the left and the twentieth century whereby there is a denial of objective truth so yes the politics to be divided into two groups\nThose who believe there is one truth and those that believe everything is relative the those that believe that everything is relative um they they create the atrocities of the twentieth and twenty first century\nBut what if I put forward a subjective truth\nThat says that every single member of the Democratic party is actually a communist and they were out to destroy the United states I mean I don't have to subscribe to that view although I Would concede that in many cases they are\nCertainly pushing policies in that direction but what I just said I wouldn't subscribe to but how would a believer in subjective truth telling me that my subjective truth\nWas wrong but there's this right\nWell you know the best they they'd have to fall into their own trap there'd be no way if they if you believe in the concept of subjective truce for multiple truth there'd be no way for them categorically to deny your accusations so this is\nThis is the absurdity of of the whole situation so\nYes it's it's a very powerful weapon that you can use against the the liberals the spouting it every day\nYou identify Islam as an extremely radical religion certainly as it is practiced in much of the world today that's obviously the case now uh what about those who identify Islam as a a radical political ideology or in Islam is there really a distinction\nWell it depends\nI mean the the the theories as the theology and then there's the practice so the question is what what is the practice if\nIf it's a Muslim who's living in America uh um uh the behaving in accordance with the U.S constitution then there's no problem if it's a country as such as Bangladesh show or elsewhere\nWhere it's all a becomes the legal system where shall real law actually becomes the rich of the land of such as Afghanistan then we have a problem because then the the truth that we hold to be self evident the quality of the quality of the sexes\nThese things fall by the wayside so you know blanket statements or a dangerous in this case because we have Muslim allies Jordan is one of our closest allies\nThat is a Muslim state but we have to be specific about the context in which country and who we are actually talking about\nOne thing that has bothered me a great deal about where this country finds itself today with the people on the left are pushing harder and harder or to outright a call for socialism I suppose in a way it's an improvement\nThat or you have people on the left who uh or at least are saying openly what I always suspected they were thinking over the years and that is the socialism is the path to go I Do think that they overstretched overreached I should say in that regard or is that the term socialism no longer a four letter word in this country\n[noise] [noise] yeah it's a very good question I Am disturbed that in the upcoming Mitt was\nFor the of the Democrat Party candidates have\nOpenly labeled themselves a socialist\nOr in a recent poll by the victims of communism foundation more than forty two percent of American millennials said that they would like to live in a socialist or communist America\nThis is incredibly disturbing if you look at the fact that in the last hundred years more than a hundred million people were killed in the neighborhood socialism communism so yeah I think the Democratic party all the radicals who have taken over the Democrat Party\nHave managed to socialize this word and make it more acceptable than it ever was before\nAnd as we go to a call here I just have to add this it it it seems to me that what we are getting is nothing more than we should have expected we have for about two generations\nAdvocated control of the education of our young people to people especially at the College of faculty level in many cases have an absolute axe to grind and very anti American ideology who are less and less likely to try to even hide that fact now\nAt a private school it's probably difficult to do a lot about that but in many cases we're talking about faculty who are paid\nAt a private school it's probably difficult to do a lot about that but in many cases we're talking about faculty who are paid out of state tax dollars and why the chancellor of the presidents of these universities about been called before the education committees of every state legislature in America\nAnd demanded to know why such and such and such and such is inspired if they want to see another penny of state tax dollars is beyond me\n... I I couldn't agree more are we abdicated the schools the high schools and colleges\nStarting in the Nineteen seventies and that's where we are today so if you want to understand how somebody as a as a as dangerous as Bernie Saunders becomes popular in America it's because we allow the education system to be taken over by the radicals\nTo David in Cedar Rapids Iowa the bull headed show with Dr Sebastian Gorka hello David\nEl ... okay hey you guys had mentioned earlier that there is a subject of truth in that ... a\nC.

resonate we were just trying to be nothing honest candid\nAnd open the window up here too because sometime here to let you guys want to get some things off of our chest because it's not like the way they were doing in Donald Trump him under the bus and back in that buzz on him but no reason at all he had been in the public eye for all these\nYears and now what did they call them those nasty nasty and they got it running against Hillary Clinton\nWell certainly there was a shall we say a major turn around and it and when they want when he won\nThen obviously that is something that a major sector of this country is not come to terms with they cannot accept that he was making them out except that he signs bills into law economic subsidies dictates national policy the cord and supposedly\nThe Constitution's or this was a major problem from then on it's been now two years and I'm not sure exactly when this was going to sink in ... yeah he really did when\nHe really with all of his accomplishment look at what he's a tea for two years have done more that Obama could do an eight years but they don't like that so I think President Trump is not\nA career politician either businessman I always say if you want to know what's going on with the body look at the head to head as prosperous and successful the body of people are going to be specific says one look at today what's happening\nBut there's no question about the fact that he's is really had a major impact did ah I'm Wondering how you you got to be connected with his campaign I mean obviously there are a lot of people out there who\nWho are rally to his his support but not many people have gotten to actually speak at a at a rally is held on for a candidate Trump and President Trump how did you come to the attention of the Trump campaign\nAt all I can tell somebody from is the topic was um it it's so often there he came in North Carolina there was no way they were going to be here in North Carolina we not be there\nSo it was a race for us to be at one of his rallies he invited on his day to day but says Mike we didn't have to take his Mike He gave it to us to let us say whatever we want to say in front of all of those cameras back there to back was it was probably over a hundred of them\nAnd I'm Out there that\nThat was just it just after that I think that next January and Mississippi open up for a rally and we've opened up for so many of them yeah I'm I just can't column this week\nThey didn't frantic we didn't we didn't have to talk to anybody it's always been like that it's just everything just don't bother to old ... says and it was really\nThink about it I'm President Trump Donald Trump at the time he is about the people he wore that people will people\nUm he's not you can have all these different degrees or what have you uh and just be so politically correct I Donald Trump he's just a real person if you remember before he ran for president\nI mean he ... he looked at who we hung out with the real people like he was not even a a billionaire\nEven though he has a billionaire he just said I ... I don't like yeah I hear what the paypal paypal because hey us go ahead\nSay Oh yes he hurt us and if you look at it either right now in his presidency he's bypassing all of these organizations and taking it directly to the people nobody saw him he's not beholden to Hollywood or the lobbyists\nNobody bought him a paid him off he's only beholden to the people that voted him in office\nTo analyze it all and I look at the left wing media how they spend installations gossip stories and they always mayor who they fear they fear you know because they know each way that they don't try to stop loses but they will try and stop all winter\nAnd now they they certainly are there I've taken a menu of course now too I mean you are women you are African American and oh that really sets off the the far left crowd because you people have minds of your own and you're not doing what you're told to do I messed up so much the\nSame way that they will\nCome along diamond is filled with it and just say that people will stop speaking out like ... you know they wanted us to\nHear or continue all with the same kit that three as thinking on the inside of the box not say nothing it remember down because that's the good what Obama did back in the day I'm a papal\nStaff that Obama didn't create an atmosphere for economic opportunity for people he pushed what Hollywood wanted him to play with a puppet\nAnd the puppet master ... look at how the leaders are so upset with down but the Trump upset with President Trump because hey how does it does it lead as he is the average American person and that's the way he's working for it and they do not like it\nNow right now I have to ask you about this where did the names diamond and silk come from\nWould go in the political atmosphere back in two thousand and Fifteen it was really really ... up and it was very nasty so we could not go out with a\nMan named Ryan ... nobody went up at our house it was just nasty guy named after my childhood or

Benny we toured with George Burns\nWe toured with red Skelton as well as doing a lot of this television specials and a\nJackie Gleason dean Martin the Jerry Lewis we were in that realm we were kids

and they take so when it comes to a question like that my answer is I prefer boat because it does\nIf you're the studio for a month or so and then you're on the road from it gives you that friday of
