I guess major guarantee is with us tonight CBS News the White House correspondent to talk of his new book\nMr Trump's wild ride published by all points books subtitled the thrills chills screams occasional blackouts\nOf an extraordinary presidents I Love the prologue you want I should have learned you lead off with this quote major fantastic I watch it with President Obama two weeks ago he was not thrilled I'm sure I'll be more thrilled\nUnquote the first words Donald Trump spoke to you [laughter] know factory right yep please continue with what you you felt you should have learned\nSo uh what I wanted to do at the beginning of the book Jim boat is approach my audience from a posture humility 'cause I don't think anyone who writes about American politics right now who comes across as a full blown no at all or at aspiring no at all it's going to have that core credibility that our audience can feel\nAnd touching relate to you have to understand and you have to communicate that you're gonna miss things and even as someone who is professional inexperienced and been around the track is I certainly have been you can\nAnd do miss things and if you do you owe to you'll read or a sense of personal accountability so that whole prologue is what I should have learned that I didn't learn or took me longer than in retrospect I think I should have taken me to learn\nSo with that sentence that you just read and I don't want to give it all away but I'll give the listeners a sense I take that sentence apart a deconstructed almost word by word\nAnd said to the readers here with things that Donald Trump was telling me about himself and if I only taking the time\nTo look at that sentence deconstructed and ask myself some basic that super high level psychological analytical questions but just basic questions what is he trying to say what does he mean how is he coming at you\nI Would have learned about eighty percent of what I came to know about Donald Trump after sixteen months on the campaign trail if I just paid closer attention to that very first sentence and one example of a major fantastic\nWhat is that about well it was a press conference before rally in Bertrand Michigan early August of twenty Fifteen so long long ago feels like a million years ago\nAnd it was the first big rally that Trump had after the first Republican debate and why did he say major fantastic because he noticed me in the pool of reporters covering his press conference before\nThe rally and I was the only network news correspondent in that group of reporters and the first one he'd ever seen any of his press conferences so major fantastic wasn't about me it was about you're here\nYou're network corresponded I'm getting more important that's why it's fantastic that Trump\nI should have learned a paid attention to what he was telling me what what is that those two words actually meet in the sense as I say in the book of adjunct evil exuberance that is part and parcel of the way Donald Trump thinks about the world talks about the world and views himself with in the world\nAt your table exuberance all the time in every example and then I deconstruct the rest of the sense and I say to myself they're all sorts of\nThese great clues that Donald Trump was essentially laying before me and if I had taken more time\nBeen more curious\nAbout this different kinds of political actor and there's different ways of dealing with language\nI'd I've learned a lot more than it would have taken me nearly so long as it did during the\nCampaign just to sort of practice lock\nWith all due respect to you and do all the other reporters now you covered\nIt wouldn't have taken me nearly so long as it did during the campaign just to sort of crack this lock well\nWith all due respect to you and do all the other reporters now you covered\nAh let's see for presidents have for three news outlets yeah and let's face it this\nWas an entirely new experience for any of you you just were not prepared for it I don't know I mean it looks like just your look at the at the circumstances of this man I I was wondering can you compare him not to any other president ... but not even any other governmental leader any other\nKey public figure that you've ever recovered can you compare him to anybody\nNo I Can't I mean he is one of a kind in the sense that\nHe is this very large personality and as I write in the book\nHe was a fully formed celebrity before he got into politics politics as we've learned can make people into celebrities Ronald Reagan though in retrospect people think he was a big celebrity he was a B list movie actor he had some recognition for his General Electric uh sponsored\nRadio editorials but he was not a fully formed\nBig time celebrity Donald Trump was he was also a developer of real estate golf courses he had brand identity not just domestically but globally he checked a lot of different boxes and he was a completely different actor at different\nCompletely different instincts and orientation to the underlying rules of the game and\nI write it early on in the book that there was a kind of school of rock improvisation if you love that movie as much as I Do Jack Black or that Trump brought to politics and I describe myself in the book is one of those fussy parents in that movie those\nUptight parents who want to a school to be as it always was rigid following the rules everything by the book\nAnd Jack Black topples all that in the movie school of rock on behalf of rock and roll and music Donald Trump in his own ways toppled a lot of the rules and I was one of these fussy parents say don't you know the rules why don't you following the rules and\nWhy can't you a color but in the inside the lights and you know that sort of thing and it took me awhile to get out of that it took me awhile to get out of it and say you know what the lines are different he's drawing them and look at all these people lining up to see it\nThis is a new experience and take it in\nYou know we're gonna have to pause on that note that when it come back with a look at how some other Republicans learn these lessons with major Garrett in a

people yanking your chain to try to do things\nGo with what you think you believe in what you think you know what works for you president elect Trump appreciated that like wow I'm already being taken seriously and giving ... given ... real practical advice by sitting president\nAnd the other hand he gets this Michael Flynn thing\nAnd he wonders well are you sitting up here or what is this about why you just picking this one guy had you know I like him you know he was a surrogate of mine\nI knew he fired him President Obama when he was head of the defense intelligence agency because Michael Flynn\nThought you weren't being aggressive enough on counterterrorism I didn't think so either so I agree with Flynn not you jump really had a hard time as president elect processing this bit of information and yet as the book unfolds and as we all remember\nThere was a very short and very turbulent time with Michael Flynn he was bad news and it didn't work out and in retrospect\nNow

off and now the FBI almost completely stopped I Would imagine investigating them and it's running around trying to find out who set the bombs I think and this happens right before the election Boston

town\nAs you stop the endless hostility and constant negative and oftentimes false attacks and stores\n[noise] President Trump speaking at a rally tonight in most of the Wisconsin and of course it is there is a certain amount of irony obviously attached to the president\nCalling for a a civil tone or would have been a lot I think a a better for him had he not engaged in some of the told that he is set in the past because that would have given a clear of moral superiority\nOr in contrast to a party which has stood by and essentially in some cases are actually whipped up the Bob and in other cases that just sat back and ignored the Bob but uh uh give the president is often hard pressed to uh\nTo curb his tone so as a result he finds himself a dipped into the mix with the with the others who are your thoughts on that a doctor you were to go back to some calls here\nWell I think I think when we talk about President Trump we're talking about actually a businessman who at a political solution not a politician he practiced and uh I think that's one of the reasons why he was and he he was not a career politician\nAnd a lot of um middle America just upset and having to deal with\nWith both parties it seemed to become kind of a ruling class and they were tired of that so they put somebody in there are different and uh\nI think they expect him to make mistakes and ... and it doesn't bother to the middle class or the middle group of America\nSo I I think they feel he's\nOh a pause and it doesn't bother to the middle of the middle group of America so I I think they feel he's justified in the state\n[noise] or I'll put it this way he makes the enemies he doesn't need to make and that would be my resume to complete a tale that David in San Francisco hello David\nWell Jim when your guest sure you know it says I've I've always had a fear of a a a fear based budgets are or something I Want to stay away from and waste I'm Sorry Fairbanks budgets yeah like my main eleven you know something like\nI don't I don't know where the term budget but you're right yeah\nGo into instead cost over and and usually know accounting so top secret budgets fear based budgets are certainly some times are bad science budgets are can clearly go out to just off the register if you're trying to check the books for Congress\nAnd you discover that some program is just looking at for all its worst or you know when you get whistle blowers we the people need to whistle blowers okay and and so this idea of getting every uh getting America to start spending that money and then every Willie mentally ill as opposed to this whole incident\nThe Saudis are so guilty\nAnd these two versions of trying to be afraid of of people seeking freedom\nAmerican you know I guess I tried to put your comments in the context of the discussion at hand we're talking about the uh the seven pipe bombs that were delivered to today various locations I mean\nI remember the Palmer rage ... are you familiar with\nThat but I doubt that most of the people in the audience source of water the Palmer raised them how does that relate to what we're talking about\nWell that's out there who've got his start and it was in Woodrow Wilson's day and they had these pipe bombs that went off in Vanderbilt\nActually went off in this case pipe bombs could have gone off I trust your not not assuming the track you down these people would not be a legitimate public expenditure this was a I mean it may be budgetary expense based on fear but it's a very reasonable fear\nWell after nine eleven they invented the Patriot act and they\nCame out here I Am about this where they didn't call just invent the Patriot act and point of fact we face an actual attack and if we in fact sometimes spend money because of fear if it's they founded fear I personally have no problem with it not can we go overboard I suppose I don't feel that these particular instances we did Dr Huber\n[noise] I think anything that that is reactionary that causes us to give up our rights for quote unquote safety is a bad mistake or I think we have to be cautious as\nCitizens and pay a lot of attention to what our government is doing our politicians and we're we're the watchdog so\nI I see where he's coming from we need we need to maybe slow down some of this knee jerk reaction and make it more of a thoughtful\nProcess new on and you know there are times and you know I Know it can but yeah we just have to react because we all have fine yeah anything\nAlthough of course I Would note that that in some cases we're not talking about taking away our rights for example we don't have a right to get on an airplane quickly\nCorrect but All right to a dog in Albany, Oregon now the gentleman who did everything\nThat I thought at least for me it's sounding like Sam wack job took President Trump's rhetoric for marching orders\nMaybe or maybe he decided that he would still be try to smear conservatives we don't know\nThe security district true yeah and that was the gift for like\n... so I don't know how much of a quote unquote white job because could've coordinated\n... that's the thing that I think that you make a very telling point Dr Huber is that this would require have required very well organized whack jobs plural and they don't come they don't tend to come in well organized groups exactly\nYeah that that that that I think to the doctor makes a very good point there that's for this to have been delivered the ban is that it was would indicate that we were talking about more than just a whack job which is even more disturbing because I Will take it as a as a given that we will always have people of that nature we've got three hundred and twenty five million of us\nBut organized a that\nThat of course is a whole nother level of concern yes All right well six six five oh jumbo into more with Dr John Huber and your calls as well but the boy had a job in a moment\n\nIt could be out but I'm old enough to look at all the you know you\nKnow I ... thought I again I I look at it from the standpoint of if it was designed Dr uber to take our attention off of something\nWhat would it possibly be because it clearly couldn't be the caravan which will be a story long after this bomb thing has gone away it can be the midterm elections that's Thirteen Days away and we're going to be all elections all the time leading run up to that point so maybe Linda's right maybe there was an attempt to describe for something\nWith what's going to be ah that ah that we're going to forget about it and the next couple of days which is about how long it's going to take us to forget the bombs\nExactly well historically terrorists and terrorism was used to uh oftentimes terrorize a culture or a specific population and what that off them did was you know sway that people's fear of a cultural annihilation and and usually\n... while those individuals up and made them move into action so if we take the idea that maybe this was a political uh the\n... play that they're trying to get maybe more Democrats now to go to the polls that actually vote by say look they were all targeting Democrats we almost lost a whole generation of our leaders\nOr maybe I mean as I say you were at the age where we we just at this juncture we just don't know they're all gonna come back and talk more with our
