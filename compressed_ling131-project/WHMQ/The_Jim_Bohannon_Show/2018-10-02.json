friendly will look see just how that goes over with or the Congress or whichever Congress it turns out to be of course with the mid term elections coming up and keep in mind of course\nThat although

Michael ... is our guest is a public policy analyst ... finance at ... university and\nA lot of what we've been saying you're I think goes to the very core of a problem but I have always seen with the sort of thing and I guess I could summarize it this way that the more that a free trade zone involves disparate economies\nThe less likely is to succeed and again that's just right off the top of my head and I never got past econ one oh one but it just strikes me\nThat a disparate economies note worst things are so well so I think what I'd probably most surprised about is that we worked out this deal with by far the weaker less developed of the three North American economies Mexico first\nAnd it's the Canadians whose economy is much more similar to ours with whom we're having the biggest trouble slip you would address my theory of professor you may give me an a through an ethanol take my lumps go ahead [laughter]\nWell let me let me say this um you're you're you're correct um unless that less than developed country has some real advantage and making something versus another country for instance\nI suppose the uh in here's the example I use them I classrooms um suppose the the the U.S needs a week and they need coffee\nSo we're very efficient at producing we we have the right climate for it we use small amount of resources get a large amount of we were not so good at making coffee we don't have the right climate for it we can use a lot of resources and not get much coffee\nA country like a Columbia let's say and South America is just the opposite\nThey don't have the climate or to grow wheat nor the the know how do they have to use a lot of resources and get a little bit of weight on the other hand they have a great climate for growing coffee and they're good at it so they use a little bit of resources to get a lot of coffee what happens they say\nSuppose the U. S. specializes in making just we\nWere going to get huge amounts of weight\nColumbia says okay will specialize in just making coffee we get huge amounts of coffee then we'll trade our coffee for a year and we both countries end up with more coffee and more weight without adding any more resources\nSo free trade benefits everybody well why is somebody complaining you would say and the answer is if we stop making coffee and my example that make just wheat anybody making coffee is out of a job you say well you can go next week\nBut the skills may not be transferable from the industries that leave to the industries that are built up and that's what happened in in Canada the U.S has a a is very efficient at making dairy products\nTo to get free trade you should let us make the dairy products and sell them in Canada we'd end up both countries would end up with more a production of dairy products but the problem is what happens the Canadian dairy farmers well they should go do something else but\nThey say we don't want to do something else yeah we want to continue to make dairy products for and that's what the rub is with with Canada\nAll right to a call from Sharon in crane Missouri ah gave me Sharon\nGood evening can and about ... ... a kid I think I heard today only what on radio is that China has announced that they're going to be paying tariffs\nOn ... specified items and it sounds like there's going to be quite a few items that they are terrified and second\nBase bad trade agreements that we had had\nThis I'm Sorry I I just I too jaded anymore I Do not believe it at a ... how to shake notion of while we've got to help everybody else\nThere is one law that goes about all of their lives when it comes to politics and power and that gave followed them money and if you follow the influence that is put on our politicians\nBy that lobbyist by if governments by our own government if you follow that money you will find exactly why we have had bad trade agreements ratified\nWe're coming up on a break your uh lifted larger give is linked here I'm sure and more I learned that opinion after the break this year and I will add a couple of things here uh to what you just said please stay on the line\nThat are no matter how much lobbying occurs on behalf of foreign governments and goodness knows there's a ton of that\nOutright passage of money to a political candidates for public office from foreign sources is very much a no no and the second thing is I think you are vastly underestimating the extent to which so many elites in this country ... oh so so guilty about how rich we are I'm Jim ... and we'll be back and just a moment\n\nGiving voice to the valley one on one I Want to own seven five fourteen hundred and\nForty ... gym\nYet except we don't have to have them built the tanks in the planes but\nIf the tanks in the planes have so much steel and them we can try to steal from the Chinese are much lower cost\nThan it cost ... then for us to make ourselves then instead of these planes costing whenever they cost a few million dollars a piece you can reduce the cost to make the planes we don't need to give China our technology we don't need to let them make the finished product but if they can make components\nCheaper than we can make them ourselves are we better off taking it from them um and that allows us to produce it cheaper and that will be better off for us is\nWhich raises another point in my early ... or something I'm going to bring up when we come back from the break but the point is you said that ... we we shouldn't have to give the the Chinese our ah our intellectual property secrets but of course to build a plant in China Today that's exactly what the Chinese have extracted from us and\nWe'll come back and talk some more about uh some of the the Chinese applications that possibly this new trade agreement with Mexico and Canada ah may preview one eight six six five oh Jim boat with our guest Dr Michael ... from Stockton University in just a moment [laughter]\nI'm a ...

this\nLet's talk to David who calls in from San Francisco tonight to David good evening\nJim up in your guest Amy I'm Out here in San Francisco we've got two major a financial problems directly tied to this Chinese steel\nAnd uh one is the bay bridge which got opened a just probably sort of five years ago and it was\nThis was the new post earthquake Bay Bridge right right yeah and in\nFact if you remember just a dollar value uh at at in the Nineteen eighty nine earthquake they said it would be a quarter of a billion dollars to fix the bridge\nWhen the new bridge opened a couple of years ago it was a what six billion dollars in costs and six billion and financing so it went well forty eight times to become a twelve billion dollar broken rich and I was defective when it when it opened\nThere are ... are you saying that that was built with with Chinese steel\nOh yeah and what was said okay well I didn't know then yeah\nAnd what was significant about it Arnold was the governor and in this\nCrush more right okay yeah\nI was the Republican governor and Willie Brown was the former mayor the two of them put it together and they created they actually created a foundry in China to manufacture the the bridge\nApart there were very few repeating part so it was almost entirely custom and the they had something like twenty thousand inspectors per part or you know each part had to have an inspector massive art ... almost to the\nTo the man they refused to accept delivery on the part yet it was over written by a a project manager who had no right to override it\nWell that that sounds like a terrible deal I must say although I'm not sure quite how it fits into the the context of this discussion regarding a trade matters other than the fact that I guess is a professor bus or you should always look twice when dealing with the Chinese\nBut a a current in Rochester, Minnesota is a next step below ...\nHigh yellow the thing that bothers me about the ah the steel here from China is if you drive a car\nA lot and you have to have your brakes re done you may have found out over the last Twenty years but you can't turn a rotor\nAnymore because the Chinese steel that all the car owners are made out of is so poor that it is not turn of all\nYou know years ago you used to be able to take a break rotors or your drums in and you could Milam down and get another life out of them but nowadays everybody has to throw away their owners because the ... the Chinese steel maybe cheaper\nBut the quality is also cheaper\nAll right I Want our guest to comment about that we've had two calls regarding the quality of uh dealing with the Chinese\nIf it's that bad at least in regard to steal I mean you know when you when you buy a a broom at Walmart you're really not looking for the the\nThe the nicest brew him out there you want some little sweep the floor or but does something like this is well I mean uh in the case of the break drums a that's not such a good thing in the case of bridges that's a terrible thing maybe you will die\nAre is that the other problem in trading with the Chinese the question of qualities do we had a question some time back about\n... I forget who was food or pharmaceuticals but there was some serious question about Chinese quality\n[noise] yeah that's that's always had an an issue on a product like steel obviously quality is a essential there especially you're going into products\nOr like a bridge or something that could cause some severe a\nInjuries but how about some of the uh smaller consumer products look at the textile industry so if I'm the California used to have a huge textile industry and workers were making let's say twenty dollars an hour and as a result of that\nThey made a real nice shirt that sold for fifty dollars well\nThey decided to outsource to make the ... the uh shirts in China where people are at the time or paid about a dollar a day so now they can make the shirt a and sell it instead of for fifty dollars they can sell the shirt now for twenty dollars so\nWell that some people would say that's a very positive thing uh it's negative in that people will lose jobs here but it's positive in that all consumers now can purchase much more goods and services because the prices are are lower\nExcept of course for those workers were out of work who can't afford anything at all I mean the notion that we should we should we should build our economy's strictly around consumers uh that that strikes me as a little short sighted and in fact it may be one of the principal reasons for what happened in the twenties sixteen presidential election\nMy life my show Barney and good ideas for things to do and mountain biking and ... the\nMakes me laugh a lot and we always Latin music in the car is a good role model we've been real them they one\nBoy and then they want you know it's about a complicated isn't making rent you know have a great person in my life and we had to hang out new\nPumps are more information about how you make it in this than I Am life as a mentor problem they'd rather just Hampshire\nMore when we used five nine three three four five you're a new best friend is waiting [noise]\nTo the gym you reveal somebody you are as I age they do Turner's false W.

that I mean did you receive a lack of cooperation or did you see an outright opposition to what you're telling\nNo there was no opposition but trying to put a documentary film together is that a nine month marathon ... at the at the\nPaper in the spring and want to get the facts right and as a lot of different ... in movies and documentaries that kind of ... now but one of the most important things in the story is you know all the military leave the u._s. troops sent there by George Herbert\nWalker Bush because people were starving to death in Britain Bush said it'd be annoying and kept next month\nSo we had to send troops over there we went there for humanitarian reasons and then it turned into a credible fight but all senior military leaders and the chain of command said we need some armored vehicles over their case our troops get in trouble helium one case and Bradley fighting vehicle to protect them from the type of weapons the Somali a rebel head\nAnd secretary defiance laugh at me and said no we're not going to send them so when general day but it was\nColonel Simon and and and and colonel elevated was a major like when they had to go out there and rescue those rangers after helicopters got shot down they had to go get Malaysian armored personnel carriers\n... their troops outlive us troops in there the U.S troops couldn't speak the Malaysian\nIt's night there's this incredible fire going on I Can't even imagine what that must have been light and so as I've been doing this research I mean I Am so impressed with everybody from the AFC corporal\n... and CEOs who are incredible the senior and you know and and the leaders like a a bill ... and that's it you should really be talking to here because\nFirst of all we should never put American troops in that position where we tell them here's a mission to go do but what you're not going to give you the resource that you say you need\nAnd and but I I'm just so proud that we get the honor the bedrooms and Mountain Division here on the twenty fifth anniversary\nWell I certainly would concur with you entirely I remember at the time although not realizing the extent to which it was true but at the time uh when I was still I was doing this program as a matter of fact it's been a long but I remember\nA severely castigated the defense secretary Les Aspen for worrying about cosmetics about whether or not and and then one tank would make us look less like a peacekeeping mission at the time I thought you know the images is baloney uh although I was using stronger language and that ... let's talk to a\nA General David ... about that that part of this or\nThat in retrospect would you say that you that you were sent into combat\nOr which ... which is what it was when it turned out to be into combat with less than the resources that they should have been made available to you\nWell I think any commander with a would always want more resources but I think the uh um officers who were in command positions senior to me made it very clear\nThe national command authorities that um\nArmored vehicles were required for survivor ability and um and to basically protect our four so yes obviously um [noise] you know the more arm or you can have around your anytime it's usually a pretty good thing so um yeah we we certainly could have used it but we didn't have it\nYou know uh the situation dictated that we use what we had and so that's what we did\nThat his crew and grateful yeah just a gift please continue ran a yes\nNo I just want to build David my that would be went into the gunfight at night in a hungry an armored Humvees and light Mike that in the trailer it's like going in you know in a convertible Corvette and a parade and everybody shooting at you and they were in an armored on be more than a thousand people too\nAnd we all recall what happens do armored Humvees when they get hit with let's say ... and and colonel ever be a it was I assume common knowledge\nTo everyone back then that among those forces active in Mogadishu at the time were those with RPGs rocket propelled grenades or certainly more than a match for ah for example for a Humvee or right\n[noise] well I think that's true but I think you also have to look at it in context at least from my perspective you know the basic mission was to go in and and the seriously protects humanitarian assistance operations that were designed to feed the starving Somalis\nI don't think anybody anticipated I'm going and into a firefight I think part of that was a lack of recognition and in in my own over the last twenty five years at a lot of time to think about it you know we we have this term called peacekeeping operations in from my perspective there's another peaceful about those kinds of operations\nThem in this case you had a set of ... you had to drive ... and having a beer\nYou brought the un and the un became a third drive by the power who was the uh the the thing that had the most value they're fighting for that and I'm In it escalated I mean there were things that occurred back in June and July with the out of the house raids\nAnd I don't think the folks at home recognize that there was a fire fight\nOr by until we got the three were up and so\nI think a lot of the calls for armor\nThey were not consistent with the information that was coming out to either with regard to what was going on\nWell maybe not to the general public would have to think the defense secretary Aspen had that information\nI think that's probably true ah but I'm not sure that he had the ability and I can't really speak realized that I mean I I can only tell you the perspective that the folks that ah I was around on the ground at at the time\nAnd that was that the generally speaking a there was a very little information that was flowing out of the Bali back to uh either D.C or or back to to ah to centcom\nIndicate what was really going on in theater so I don't I'm not sure that everybody really understood how many firefights we'd already been in prior to the third or the ...\nThere are enough where the pause briefly will come back with some more one eight six six

took place it included a rescued yes but at at a quite a cost if you could summarize what what was the action that took place in Mogadishu\nA is up to ...\nI'm Sorry that was the general David if yes okay\nUm well in summary I mean it was an Eighteen our um the rescue effort took Eighteen hours it involved one uh one failed attempt as a as much I Love the um\nPointed out earlier and then they then a second attempt and I'm the second attempt we actually picked up some are so small elements of the um\nThe ground delta force that was there as well as some of the rangers and um [noise] uh in the course of the battle we had a you know not surprisingly we had a lot of unexpected things happened we had some or what's called breaks and contact some ... went the wrong direction\nI'm broke off from the main element we had to recover them um and ah\n[noise] I guess the the thing that probably took the longest was extraction of the bodies out of the uh super six one helicopter um uh the attitude the helicopter landed was uh was actually it was a\nUm and he flipped over and so it was very difficult to get those bodies out so um [noise] uh and intense fighting the entire time uh getting to the crash site so while we were on the crash sites and then extraction off the crash site so I'm\nIf you've seen the movie a Black Hawk down as Randy mentioned earlier the the movie that was very very good job of portraying the intensity the battle and uh it was a\nThere was a long night\nVery much so tell us about the battle from your perspective the colonel Michael ...\nI I think it's pretty much his colonel David pointed out I I Will use kind of as an example um you know as we turn down a the the main route towards the objective side uh it was almost as if the entire world opened up and everybody started shooting at us\nAnd then uh once uh the two companies began to return fire\nOr you could you could almost feel that the change in the atmosphere that we are now getting the the ... gained momentum and so Charlie company went south and uh and and drew mar which in an outcome and moved to the\nCrash site where she woke up was not who we sat in the middle of the street and the command Humvee or with mortar rounds walking their way down the road or in our bridges flying I thought you know this is a\nThis is not going to be one of those days where everybody goes home and uh\nAnd I and I at that point um and there was some level of recognition when colonel David got on the net and said\nYou know we're going to stay here as long as it takes to get everybody out of here and I and I think that that statement ah at that time was that created a calming effect do throughout the entire organization which was essential in in a while ago are created the conditions for us to

like you are and I still remember a Nineteen Ninety One and hearing the words on the Senate floor that a man is innocent until proven guilty what we had was not a hearing about a trial\nAnd in this trial there was not enough evidence so I'm going forty to support that Clarence Thomas and that was none other than Democrat Dennis deacon see any of Arizona who Jeff Flake replaced\nA that's a that's true you do have a good memory and so we'll forgive the fact that you are I gather one of those old white men who are evil and that never to be trusted All right one eight six six five oh Jim bar number one eight six six five oh five four six to six and yes it is true that this was not a court of law so technically\nUh the presumption of innocence does not apply but in practice it has and it should to Randy and crushed in Iowa good evening Randy\nHi Jeremiah just or whether to call you I I'm a product of the eighties and I just am concerned with Kevin out what he says he he never blacked out I don't I don't have a problem with a anybody that had they drank in the eighties everybody\nBut when he says ... is ... says that he did not ever blackout I don't disagree I think\nThat was a late night why and that's that's why I have a big problem with him holding the highest court you're like\nWell I used to I used to drink a lot of our blacked out either I I I I drank too much and there were times when I should have stopped him frankly these days I hardly ever drink at all\nI may be in this calendar year we're in October I maybe had maybe eight or nine drinks this entire year but uh I drank too much and I didn't like the idea that if you drink at all regularly that you automatically blackout is simply not true\nWell I don't know what I'm saying if you drink as it is not true but\nThere's so many people that said yes I just to find that hard to believe and I\nMean again there are various levels of of drinking I mean he said that he's he drank more than he should have but of course the real issue here is not whether or not he at one time ESPN blacked out\nA veteran of itself is not what's at issue here the idea is that he would have done something horrendous like sexually assaulting somebody I mean for example I uh I I drank too much of an occasion but it's where they didn't improve my my capacity for sexually assaulting anybody you know I just simply\n[laughter] I'd lose interest in the world you know\nYeah he's never been interested in either because it's so I I certainly understand that but when at on a college student in the eighties I find that hard to believe\nAs well just does the Irish are that the majority of college students in the eighties did not suffer blackouts as such\nA again or even if they they drank more than they should uh there are gradations of drinking and they do not in my mind constitute an issue of uh of confidence to hold disposition especially for someone who today apparently a drinks very responsibly so\nTo me that's that's not the issue here the issue is the credibility of the sexual assault charges more to come only six six five oh jumbo one eight six six five oh five four six to six audible

suddenly have no statute of limitations but if you did a certain bad thing before twenty twelve it has no statute of limitations you cannot\nMake a law that applies to things that happened before the law was passed so that statute of limitations for a Brett Kavanaugh even assuming that he did what he's accused of doing a would would still not apply\nYeah and the other thing too I don't know why a lot of people don't understand or surprised by this whole thing because I didn't really see something like this happen in the United states wants before [noise]\nI well I mean there were certainly there were charges were brought against Clarence Thomas before his Supreme Court confirmation that consisted from from one person of course\nUh not not all of a variety of such people and and of

they may have merit to her\nBut there's no proof I mean there's well it's you wonder where am I going with our society Bloomberg guilty before with presumed innocent\nWell again some people to keep in mind here from a purely legal point of view Dave and that would be that the presumption of innocence\nTechnically legally only applies in a court of law\nOr the presumption of innocence has as a matter of general practice usually applied before congressional hearings\nBut it does not apply a as a anything more than a usual practice there is no presumption of innocence before a a a congressional hearing in this sort of thing\nAnd and you are you you do not have a again because we're talking about elevating someone to a privilege you you do not have a right to be on the Supreme Court is a privilege\nUh whereas the presumption of innocence goes to a removing of one's rights throughout one's property to one's freedom and in some cases one's life more to come on double ... will

Congress\nAnd the doctor Michael ... is our guest is a public policy analyst in reverse array of finance at Stockton University and\nA lot of what we've been saying here I think goes to the very core of a problem but I have always seen with the sort of thing and I guess I could summarize it this way that the more that a free trade zone involves disparate economies\nThe less likely is to succeed and again that's just right off the top of my head and I never got past econ one oh one but it just strikes me\nThat a disparate economies don't worry things are so well so I think what I'd probably most surprised about is that we worked out this deal with by far the weaker less developed of the three North American economies Mexico first\nAnd it's the Canadians who was economy is much more similar to ours with whom we're having the biggest trouble so if you would address my theory is professor you may give me an a through an ethanol take my lumps go ahead [laughter]\nWell let me let me say this um you're you're you're correct um unless that less than developed\nCountry has some real advantage and making something versus another country for instance suppose the uh in here's the example I use them I classrooms um suppose the the the U.S needs a week and they need coffee\nSo we're very efficient at producing wheat we have the right climate for it we use small amount of resources get a large amount of we were not so good at making coffee we don't have the right climate port we can use a lot of resources and not get much coffee\nA country like Columbia let's say and South America is just the opposite\nThey don't have the climate or to grow wheat nor the the know how\nDo they have to use a lot of resources and get a little bit of weight on the other hand they have a great climate for growing coffee and they're good at it so they use a little bit of resources to get a lot of coffee what happens they say suppose the U. S. specializes\nIn making just we were going to get huge amounts of weight Columbia says okay will specialize in jest making coffee we get huge amounts of coffee then we'll trade our coffee for your wheat both countries end up with more coffee\nAnd more wheat without adding any more resources\nDo free trade benefits everybody well why is somebody complaining you would say and the answer is if we stop making coffee in my example that make just wheat anybody making coffee is out of a job and say well you can go next week\nBut the skills may not be transferable from the industries that leave to the industries that are built up and that's what happened in in Canada the U.S has an egg is very efficient at making dairy products\nTo to get free trade you should let us make the dairy products and sell them in Canada we'd end up both countries would end up with more a production of dairy products but the problem is what happens to the Canadian dairy farmers well they should go do something else but\nThey say we don't want to do something else yeah we want to continue to make dairy products for and that's what the rub is with with Canada All right\nTo a call from Sharon in crane Missouri a gleaming Sharon\nGood evening can and about ... ... a kid I think I heard today only what on radio is that China has announced that they're going to be paying carrots\nOnion and specified items and it sounds like there's going to be quite a few items that they are terrified and second\nBase bad trade agreements that we had had\n... ...

I forget who was food or pharmaceuticals but there was some serious question about Chinese quality\n[noise] yeah that's that's always an issue on a product like steel obviously quality is a essential there especially you're going into products\nOr like a bridge or something that could cause some severe a\nInjuries but how about some of the uh smaller consumer products look at the textile industry so if I'm the California used to have a huge textile industry and workers were making let's say twenty dollars an hour and as a result of that they made a real nice shirt that sold for fifty dollars\nWell they decided to outsource to make the ... the uh shirts in China where people are\nAt the time or paid about a dollar a day so now they can make the shirt a and sell it instead of for fifty dollars they can sell the shirt now for twenty dollars so well that some people would say that's a very positive thing\nUh it's negative in that people will lose jobs here but it's positive and not all consumers now can purchase much more uh goods and services because the prices are are lower\nExcept of course for those workers were out of work who can't afford anything at all I mean the notion that we should we should we should build our economy strictly around consumers a bet that strikes me as a little short sighted and in fact it may be one of the principal reasons for what happened in the twenty sixteen presidential election", "show_name": "The Jim Bohannon Show", "year": "2018", "city": "Greenfield", "day": "02"}
