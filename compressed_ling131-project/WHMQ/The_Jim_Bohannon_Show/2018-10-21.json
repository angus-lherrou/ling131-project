the defense intelligence agency and the national Intelligence Council\nHis previous book is defeating jihad the winnable war and the\nOne eight six six five oh jumbo is our number\nDr Gorka you take note of the idea that there are two spectrums of any allergy objective truth and subjective truth I Would contend that while that indeed maybe put forward out there in this world of ours that subject the truth is an oxymoron your thoughts\nYes absolutely totally I I think it was incredibly telling a few cook this in the cabin or hearing the Democrat Senate starting with Cory Booker used the phrase\nA truce when talking about the test Monday from Dr fold that is so telling the truth\nThere's no such thing as her truth either the truth or there isn't true so yes this is\nThis is what you get this is post modernist and this is the the the construction of the left and the twentieth century whereby there is a denial of objective truth so yes the politics going to be divided into two groups those who believe there is one truth and those that believe everything is relative\nThe those that believe that everything is relative\nUm they they create the atrocities of the twenty ... twenty first century\nWell what if I put forward a subjective truth\nThat says that every single member of the Democratic party is actually a communist and they were out to destroy the United states I mean I don't have the subscribed to that view although I Would to concede that in many cases they are\nCertainly pushing policies in that direction but what I just said I wouldn't subscribe to but how was it was a believer in subjective truth telling me that my subjective truth\nWas wrong but there's there's right\nWell you know the best they\nThey'd have to fall into their own trap there'd be no way if they if you believe in the concept of subject of truth for multiple truth there'd be no way for them categorically\nTo deny your accusations so this is this is the absurdity of of the whole situation so yes it's it's a very powerful weapon that you can use against the the liberals spouting it every day\nYou identify Islam as an extremely radical religion certainly as it is practiced in much of the world today that's obviously the case now uh what about those who identify Islam as a a radical political ideology or in Islam is there really a distinction\nWell it depends I mean there's the theories\nAs the theology and then there's the practice so the question is what what is the practice if if it's a Muslim who's living in America\nAre um uh the behaving in accordance with the U.S constitution then there's no problem if it's a country as such as Bangladesh show or elsewhere\nWhere it's all a becomes the legal system where shall real law actually becomes the rich of the labs are such as Afghanistan\nThen we have a problem because then the the truth that we hold to be self evident the quality of the quality of the sexes\nThese things fall by the wayside so you know blanket statements ah a dangerous in this case because we have Muslim allies Jordan is one of our closest allies\nThat he's a Muslim state but we have to be specific about the context in which country and who we are actually talk about ...\nBut one thing that has bothered me a great deal about where this country finds itself today with the people on the left uh pushing harder and harder\nOr to outright a call for socialism I suppose in a way it's an improvement\nThat or you have people on the left who uh or at least are saying openly what I always suspected they were thinking over the years and that is the socialism is the path to go I Do think that they overstretched overreached I should say in that regard or is that the term socialism no longer a four letter word in this country\n[noise] yeah it's a very good question I Am disturbed that in the upcoming Mitt whose\nFault the of the Democrat Party candidates have\nOpenly labeled themselves a socialist a at a recent poll by the victims of communism foundation more than forty two percent of\nAmerican millennials said that they would like to live in a socialist or communist America\nThis is incredibly disturbing if you look at the fact that in the last hundred years more than a hundred million people were killed in the day was socialism communism so yeah I think that the Democratic party all the radicals who have taken over the Democrat Party\nHave managed to socialize this would make it more acceptable than it ever was before\nAnd as we go to a call here I just have to add this it it it seems to me that what we are getting is nothing more than we should have expected we have for about two generations\nAdvocated control of the education of our young people to people especially if the collegiate faculty level in many cases who have an absolute axe to grind and an very anti American ideology you are or less and less likely to try to even hide that fact now at a private school\nProbably difficult to do a lot about that but in many cases we're talking about faculty\nLess likely to try to even hide that fact now\nAt a private school it's probably difficult to do a lot about that but in many cases we're talking about faculty who are paid out of state tax dollars and why the chancellor of presidents of these universities about been called before the education committees of every state legislature in America\nAnd demanded to know why such and such and such and such isn't fired if they want to see another penny of state tax dollars is beyond me\n... I I couldn't agree more we abdicated the schools the high schools and colleges\nStarting in the Nineteen seventies and that's where we are today so if you want to understand how somebody as a as as as dangerous as Bernie Saunders becomes popular in America it's because we allowed the education system to be taken over by the radicals\nTo David in Cedar Rapids Iowa the boy had a job with Dr Sebastian

more plug into the present dot com or something like a group of America\n[noise] [noise] [noise]\n\n\n\nLooking back it was kind of showed one eight six six five oh jumbo one eight six six five oh five or six to six as we talk with Bill O'Reilly\nHis latest in the killing series killing the ss co written with Martin do guard is are already working its way up to the top of the best seller lists and there were going to look a bit of just what this book reveals because like most of the things that bill is tackled you look at the titles you'll say oh well I Know about that\nAnd what usually is the case is you know some of the things about that so the first broad picture of the world war two Nazi Germany is collapsing and the rats are fleeing the sinking ship that much we know\nWhat I did not realize until ah killing the ss came along bill was the extent to which some of these people\nHad help from the United states government\n[noise] sure um after Iraq killing Patton which I became an enormous salary a lot of material leftover be as Patton\nUh was an occupier in southern Germany uh before he was a killer met his death in a hospital in Germany and the prevailing wisdom from pat in and many other\nA powerful people in the U.S government was we've got to use these captured Nazis to spy and work against the Soviet Union\nWhich is moving in and wants to conquer a Europe\nAnd you'll remember from killing time I'd want to actually fight them you wanted to fight Stalin\nYeah so that's what the new CIA or that took over from the ... did\nThey enlisted a lot of these uh ss people and to stop all people to spy against ah the Soviet Union work against the Soviet Union and they didn't really much care what they did during the war in addition there was an organization set up\nBy Heinrich ... the head of the ss one of the most of our human\nBeings ever walked the planet called Odessa and and we knew about a year a before the third Reich collapse of Germany was going to lose and he thought he can negotiate a separate piece is kind of crazy delusional stuff from him but he formed this organization and they had a lot of money and a lot of assassins within the\nKind of crazy delusional stuff from him but he formed this organization and they had a lot of money and a lot of assassins within the organization and so they helped\nThese guys are get out of Germany and we have a you know we tell you step by step how that happened and also the American not the American Red Cross in in Switzerland to help them or elements of the Vatican helped them and they got them from Germany down to general Italy\nAn on boats to Spain and South America and South Africa\nOr it was an amazing assembly line to get these guys out and we took him big guys and we took it Eichmann andme angle a Klaus Barbie the Bush early on and one woman\nWho the myth was died in Berlin as a as Hitler\nCommitted suicide well he didn't he got away to South America and we kinda we prove that in the book by dental work [noise] so ... it's a compelling compelling a story almost on every page\nUm and I want Americans particularly younger Americans to understand the evil that was in play you know Jim these ss people I mean they were farmers and bankers and merchants they didn't go to hell university\nYou in the world war two broke out they just signed up and put on a black uniform with the debt said just go on a cap\nAnd ... and ran a concentration camps where they could kill millions of people\nWho just ordinary people are just amazing I'm ... and when you read it people to all that couldn't happen yeah it it it and it can happen here by the way\nA will certainly return to that thought here in a moment that it's good to happen here and by the way I happen to agree with you but I'm sure many out there are a raise their eyebrows right now the thought of that I certainly understand the motivation\nBut I have to ask in retrospect since we now have a three quarters of a century since World War two and certainly time to weigh whether this was even remotely worth it is there any kind of justification\nFor whatever intelligence these people may have revealed to justify what this country and others the Vatican and others did in in a sparing these people and spirited him away is there any justification at all\nNo but it's another case of people looking away from evil that sort of Harry Truman did ill and killing the assets we show you how Harry Truman almost had to be black male to go after it off Eichmann ...\nThey had to say if you don't Mr President will lead to the press that you're not going to go after I\nWho who did that that that forced forced Truman to do it who who who blackmail on it who blackmailed and\nI'm a element in the state department made it clear and we named the man I'm that if Truman didn't sign on the order for the CIA to look for 'em I meant that he was going to go public with it he was a judge\nOr an American judge who was at Nuremberg and it turned his stomach that the U.S government was looking the other way and didn't want to know or hear about the atrocities\nThat happened in a concentration camps and an insult true that Harry Truman was a bad man he just didn't want to acknowledge it is the same thing in in in a FDR FDR knew that the Nazis were more wind down innocent people\nKnew it but he couldn't sell it or wouldn't sell it because half the public didn't want to get involved with World War two\nWhile he's six six five oh Jim ... number one eight six six five oh five or six to six lots of other revelations like this that are astounding and the bill O'Reilly will tell you all about them or just a a a a tad bit if you will or some hors d'oeuvres for thought from his latest of the killing series\nKilling the ss and uh it is a a gang buster read to just published by the way by Henry Holt and company again our number one eight six six five oh jumbo one eight six six five oh five or six to six if you'd like to talk to bill about\nHis book killing BSS or any of the big issues of the day and of course we haven't even talked about mid term elections which we will do with Bill as well so a standby more to come on the boat had a show and just a moment\n[noise]\nI don't think they had a horse and the Kavanaugh saying um I think that\nUh the Democrats are counting on this anti Trump wave but at the economy is booming for every one that takes a lot of the edge off that anti Trump stuff\nSo I'm ... you know again it's impossible to predict there is anger\nBut there's also a you know let me give you an example Jim and this is a pretty vivid example of what I'm Talking about here with the rise of evil in this country after Kavanaugh is confirmed and the day that he was confirmed a writer for the call bear program put out a tweet that said okay\nWell maybe he got the Supreme Court job but at least we ruined his life\nYeah okay that by the way it was ... and that's what he said\nRight I'm going to submit that no one on your staff\nAnd certainly no one of my staff at Bill O'Reilly dot com who'd ever put out its we'd like that and keep their jobs because it's hateful\nAnd it is an evil act and I'll tell you why because capital as children\nAnd he has a wife and a mother and father\nAnd this guy writing for cold there who still working at Kobe or to no action against the ... is is applauding the fact that we ruined his life like that's a good thing and I think Americans are picking that up\nThe picking that this progressive left movement and teeth are these people they're dangerous yeah\nAnd and there's nothing in the world more tragic ironic that people are calling themselves and anti fascist\nWho's tactics would be recognized by any member of the brown shirts the Nazi movement I mean they called themselves anti fascist is just tragic ironic and sadly most of them would not even understand the irony\nYeah the good news is the good news is that there's not many of them the the bad news is is that they're identical to the S. A. in Germany in the late twenties and thirties there were Hitler's bully boy so went out and beat up everybody that oppose Nazi isn't\nIt's the same tactics is the same same thing but in\nAmerica a lot of these people and they apparently they all live in Portland, Oregon\nI have a lot of 'em do yeah yeah\nSo I take a quick break come back with more from a Bill O'Reilly or get his new book killing the S. S. including some remarkable takes about those engaged in hunting down these Nazis or they did not a unanimously agree with one another far from it plus your calls one eight six six by boat jumbo backing them up\nAnd I can't believe that we're playing for for basketball with a barbershop quartet\nAs a ball a fad or\nUm\nYou know I Can't believe how easy it will save hundreds of dollars in my car insurance with Geico\nShoes you\nKnow ... percent or more car insurance\n[noise] here's the cold hard truth about hard water in our home nearly Ninety\nPercent of America is affected by a hard

the left him from the Islamic world not merely from the white right wing neo Nazi world\nAnd I took heat and that I wrote a book called the death of feminism where I look at the failure of women's studies\nWhich became rapidly gender studies sexuality studies gay and lesbian studies but no women the women would disappear and all of our civil rights issues which are still burning issues will forgotten\nAnd our feminists knowledge was not systematically passed on to next generations and that's why the me too movement arose\nAs a way of reinventing the feminist we'll we\nIn the early

Letterman his compatriots with the Letterman these days not a tea and Bobby point does have only been with the group well over Thirty years so their relative newcomers\nThis new CD we should tell you is called by request it has some wonderful selections on it\nAnd what a number of album is this I Know you've just done so many uh Tony about how many does this make\nSeventy six thousand like total total sounds recorded in the last ... years we've her record the eight hundred plus songs\nUnbelievable ... and over the years just go ahead and hit us with some statistics of of record sales and a and top hits and the like because the the numbers for the Letterman are extremely impressive Tony\nWe end you know Jim thanks for bringing that up because you know we have quite a kind of quiet career compared to other groups the Beatles just\nBritish Invasion music and the beach boys with just surfing in hot rod music well we didn't get all the notoriety because we never get drugs and we never were that or is he never got in trouble we never were political we never got you know just go to\nThe waters weirdest three squeaky clean boys from next door that happened to go out there do good show so at the press and media they will only\nPut stories out about that that boys so we were kind of under the radar all these years\nAnd uh I I kinda like it that way because we never uh we we toured with some of the biggest entertainers we were just a Jack Benny we took the Jack Benny we talked with George Burns we toured with ... as well as doing a lot of his television specials and a\nJackie Gleason dean Martin the Jerry Lewis and we were in that realm we were kids doing rock and roll or being that boy so I I like the fact that we had a clean cut career and we're still very healthy it's still around to this day\nWell it certainly is it didn't just burned across the sky like a shooting star the Letterman have had to stay in power and I was amazed to discover this\nBut in fact it is next year but it's not until next year that the Letterman will finally get what they have so long deserved and that is a star on the Hollywood walk of fame you must be very proud\nOh my gosh you know you have a survey that's a very big but it's in the in our little [laughter] bit post I'll bet it's a very prestigious thing to have millions of people visit Hollywood and millions of people take southerners city on the star of the sacred entertainer in the Hollywood Boulevard so it's it's yeah\nWe are very very proud of it that the cheating that\nWell you certainly should be now I have to look at at this career this this uh this traveling around the country and the like don't you ever get tired of the tour\nAll the ways that you know I see people on television don't know Carson's show in the David Letterman show and there's the other day it's the talk in and they put their hands on there for the oh my gosh it's so hard and they try to get pity for themselves I think they're trying to get pity for all the millions of dollars they're making\n[laughter] they always say that\nIf I'm On the road and getting up some occasionally you have to six than after one of the foreign catch that's like you know what I think at the alternative Jim his shirt Pete's digging ditches\nDoesn't do it it really does now you have such a beautiful pure sound and yet you interact with an audience so well so I'm curious about this you've got the touring the live shows and you've got the recording studio and of course\nUh with the live show or you have that immediate spontaneous reaction but it's it's one take mistakes at all whereas in the recording studio wild granted\nA nobody's cheering but maybe the a and R guy behind the window but but you could do take twenty eight if you need to to get a perfect and so I'm curious which did the Letterman prefer the studio perfection or the on the road live spontaneity\nWell you know I I'm probably the worst interview were in the world is if you eat in the world just on the very positive guy I don't look to the negative and they think so when it comes to a question like that my answer is I prefer boat because it does\nIf you're in the studio for a month or so and then you're on the road from it gives you that friday of seeing the country she in the world the yet being able to get in there and and do some create Kennedy of your with your friends in front of my microphone\nDo you guys have anything that approaches oh a a bucket list that you've done so much and you have received these honors and accolades and I'm just wondering is there something out there but the letter but I haven't done the whole I don't know like a maybe a a Broadway musical or something I'm just curious\n[noise] yeah you know those are always wonderful things uh if it would be great to have like the ... you know the four seasons have apparently show here\nAgain because they were controversial that they were very ... uh offstage it did some things but yeah well I tell you what ... not really young because let me tell you one thing back in you know the first men on the moon Armstrong and John Glen you know and the altar and well yeah a Armstrong his\nIt was a big fan of the letter and and his wife was a really big fan so when they won\nOr lost to the moon is the first man to the moon Armstrong he they have this little pot they weren't sure if that\nWas in the work that they had in their capsule they would choose the music that they wanted to hear just in case he got stranded up there for a year in a capsule and they call the doctor\nSo what happened was he ... he got for\nLetterman touch with him and when he landed on the moon and spent the time on the moon\nHe left his packet by the U.S flag us flagpole and when they and then came
