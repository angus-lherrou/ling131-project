defense and currently columnist with the American spectator online and spectator dot org we're talking about the end of this intermediate range nuclear forces treaty which President Reagan had concluded that thirty one years ago with Mikhail Gorbachev\nAnd let's see what we have denied on the mind of a Glenn who calls in from Cedar Rapids Iowa the boy had a job Glenn the good evening\nThey chew first satellites to uh agree with President Trump's withdrawal from the tree and then also at general comments about job bowl but I think he's a national security stood my comment is is I was in the military all to the seventies and eighties and that was a person to lose so cruel\nAnd Germany what they say that the European Union is still out there he's at our immediate wanes weapons that we may or may not produce to be put on their soil they scream bloody murder about this with any of these\nWell I don't know I mean I assume the NATO countries that have a certain obligations Jed but you would know better than I\nWell I mean they certainly do but I you know where he's ready to get very very good point I don't think that the NATO countries are going to allow\nUh enter and medium range ground launch cruise missiles or any other kind of nuclear capable missiles on their territory oh so that's one of the reasons that I'm saying in my article or that we probably don't need necessarily to develop a tit for tat\nAh there are a lot of things that are driving us to do so I mean certainly the defense against the Chinese intermediate\nRange of weapons could include a an intermediate range weapon of our own but I'm not advocating necessarily that we have to develop and field and I ended up and violating type cruise missile ourselves are a lot of other ways to do this my preference frankly\nIs for us to bolster our missile defense systems\nWe have some very good missile defense system but they're not perfect by any means uh they're probably not going to stop more than twenty five or thirty percent of any missile attack\nAnd that certainly is not good enough for we want to do I think is to offset what the Russians are doing here put a lot more money and a lot more time into perfecting are missile defenses\nThat deserves a follow up of course the whole notion of missile defense so derided as the star wars by Senator Ted Kennedy and others in point of fact there is nothing\nAbout the notion of a missile defense is in the least impossible you were talking about the speed of missiles at the speed of computers and uh the the the course of the speed of computers is increasing every second it seems like\nIt was only a matter of time before we will be able to as the old expression went shoot down a bullet with another bullet that this is not something that has any inherent impossibility difficulty yes\nWell and you're right but we've already done it I mean the question is how to get it better I mean we have systems right now our our strategic missile defense system station and California and Alaska are capable of intercepting a ballistic missile in flight\nA we have the bad a terminal high altitude air defense system we have batteries are and I think South Korea I Know we have them in other nations to I don't know if they're in Britain or not but yeah we have a lot of other places\nOr you know the systems work they're not a hundred percent sure

continue to lead the banker wars dictate politics\nWhy don't we are allowing any quote banker wars to dictate any politics nor do I see anything in tonight's discussion Jeb that wouldn't be in reality a pulling back from war anytime you allow someone to aggregated treaty in this way you're almost inviting trouble aren't you\n[noise] well I ... I mean even the Romans had his phrase sports used a rebel of if you want each for war\nAnd that's really what we're doing here we're not allowing someone to violate the treaty and get away with it and whether or not we\nUpped the ante as you know a very different question and how we do it is it much better questions so I don't know what jak means by bankers sponsored wars or you know that that

for that reason alone\nI think that a puente is not going to just directly attack a NATO member a you know he's got a lot but I don't think he is dumb enough to do that on the other hand he might be crazy like a Fox and bet on the idea that we would not respond\nBut we had Mr Obama said in twenty fourteen that we didn't have a strategic interest in Syria and again as as well for lack or points

after year fewer\nAnd fewer families are sending their students to the Pittsburgh public school they'll go anywhere else private school a Catholic school charter schools et cetera ...\nHow the Oklahoma City public schools are they going through the transformation of the economy\nCity well it's it's a little inconsistent certainly\nWe're we're a little different and that we have twenty four school districts that are inside the city limits of Oklahoma City\nAnd so you have all sorts of different success stories inside those twenty four but the largest district as about forty percent of the population at the Oklahoma City school district and it's it's a you know performing poorly\nLargest district is about forty percent of the population had the Oklahoma City school district and it's it's a you know performing poorly\nA similar to what you're describing in Pittsburgh\nSo I mean the the urban public school setting it's still at a very much a stressful situation across the country in Oklahoma City there are a lot of good public schools um out all around you know that center part of the city\nAnd people have gravitated and that's part of the you know the ... issue that took place over the last few decades people were searching for a better education for the kid\nAnd so we're trying to get more options you know charter schools than at other options for kids that for for parents that want to come in and provide more density and the core of the city\nBut I I don't know the single mayor out there that satisfied with the level of education in their inner city district\nYou mentioned charter schools I wanted to ask you more about how successful they've been\nWell most of our biggest success stories are charter schools are ... now I Can't tell you that they're all high performing but a lot of them are\nUm and um you know or like my one of my granddaughters attempts at a charter school downtown and you know it it's run by a board of our business leaders are who you know kind of\nInsurance success and uh you know there's nothing magical about the about the model it's not that they have a bigger budget they have a smaller budget it's not that they get the hand picked their kids they don't any kid can go there that lives in the district\nA but they've taken out some of the inefficiencies I think that our public school system is played by and created a model that puts more dollars into the classroom so you know in in that one instance it seems to be working better I I liked the idea that parents have choices um and in in Oklahoma City there's a lot of choices\nYeah I I Know of course you're acquisition of the NBA thunder franchise and also the opening a part of the maps three project was the the opening of the new stadium for the Oklahoma City reading archer AAA a baseball team are sports franchise is a good way to enhance the city because I Know some\nSome urban areas have become a disgusted with the exorbitant demands from most sports franchise owners\n[noise] well it's been a big positive for us I I think one of the differences is\nIf you if you don't have a a major league sports franchise and you get one it is on a superficial level up a level of quality that she didn't have before and I'm not saying it should mean this much but it does and the fact that\nThat suddenly your sports teams are playing teams in New York Chicago Los Angeles it and that matters because the image of your city to a certain extent is who your sports teams play\nAnd there's a level of quality that a major league sports team can provide to a city the size of Oklahoma City I think it helps or CEOs attract talent from around the country\nWhen you know you offer some want a job at a company in Oklahoma City that person no matter where they live in the United states they're going to think of themselves if I take this job I have to live in Oklahoma City or if I take this job I get to live in Oklahoma City\nAnd having a major league sports team is an asset that would get more people that would be more likely to take that job\nOn on a millennial basis my my input from young people is that they want to live in a city that's culturally relevant\nAnd that includes the pop culture\nAnd a major league sports team mates you culturally relevant I mean when Russell Westbrook and Paul George to name a couple of our players you know choose to live here and and choose to sign contracts here when they're\nOffered contracts by every other team in the league seemingly\nUm that sends a message that this is a good place to live uh in ... I think that when sports starts to become\nTired in a city is when they have more than one franchise and people get tired of subsidizing what new facility after another new facility now and so I I get it you know if you have three sports teams like Seattle there\nBut we're coming up on a break here that that does move here I'm going to finish your thought on sports teams in just a moment we'll be right back\n\nThe money we have\nCar insurance I'm Jay foreigner seats\nI'm Jay foreigner CEO of Quicken Loans America's premier home purchase lender\nWe've created a new way to protect you from unpredictable interest rates are exclusive rate shield approval first we lock your interest rate for up to Ninety Days then if rates go up your rate stays locked but you've rates go down your rate drops either way you win call us today at eight hundred clicking are going to rocket mortgage dot com\nRacial upheaval only on certain three year fixed rate loan scholar concentration in conditions causing Leonard licensing office effects analyst number three thirty initial conditions are solutions may apply\nI used to post the job boards that send me ... residents just\nTo find a few people who are right for my job at old process was not smart man I went to ... for me to find the right people and actively invites them to apply it so I get qualified candidates\nSmart and see if we could and read it never went by employees in the U.S try now for ... dot com slash free net difficulty dot com slash free zip recruiting the smartest way to hire a central celebrating hiring tied to the radio\nWhen the need for senior characterizes there's no place like home\nYou're allowed to run should never have to give up living at home visiting aims of will provide home care for your mom and dad at home a twenty four hours per day including personal care meals and White House for your select get professional can't give it was visiting in you know look up things getting into dot com or calling eight\nSeven seven three seven four men in seven seven three seven four men franchises or an animal visiting injunction America's Choice in senior home care\nWhat's happening this Friday night in in this week's shop friday I seen oriental they go on sale this Friday at night in print scene oriental preteens run back\nAt the top ten free gentle cleaning products from no chemical owner or rented him pristine read that uses a gentle helped to refresh and renew Iraq the the profits on Fifteen Orientals website boring person at the Greenfield run back plant getting ready to have thirty per se beginning friday at ...

our number one eight six six five oh five or six to six years we talk tonight with a man who was a quite familiar with the problems in urban America he was a\nFour terms the mayor of Oklahoma City and he's the author of the next American city when you speak of the the next American city uh how how next is that is this like a five years or ten years down the road or is this a city or a popping up right now\nWell you know cities are never reached their journey that they're at least the end of their journey\nThey're always ... me and what we're talking about is starting to purposely create inner cities that urban corps where young people get around in a\nIn an environment that has fewer automobiles um more pedestrian amenities and it's still you know look at the quality of life and the cost of living\nUm and amenities that appeal to that generation\nOr any you know it's hard to generalize 'cause every city stiffer\nBut almost every city out there in the category we're talking about has some sort of urban revitalization taking place and young people are attracted to that there's an urbanization going on all over the world and midsize metros are capitalizing right now for the foreseeable future\nWhen he's six six five oh jumbo return to a call from Brian in Ozark, Missouri small town of not that far from a a a somewhat smaller midsize cities Springfield than the good evening Brian [noise]\nThey're they're they're fine they had a question\nFor your guest sure are you saying that you have earthquakes in bank flat full of it\nI think it's played or will yeah let's here's my question is given no we'd rather minor earthquakes in\nBranson here in uh Springfield actually oh or how we got a new lacquered fall there is no right here but we have\nWe got to the present you with your\n... shore if the black or white or maybe the ... fault around or\nI don't think that they needed ... votes or impact to which is by the way based in in southeastern Missouri a down toward do roughly the Memphis metro area and along the Mississippi River ah I don't think the the New Madrid influence extends as far west as Oklahoma\n\nAre your thoughts are Mr Mayor well\nI yeah I think I think he's just listening to us there's an extra trying to oil and gas exploration and uh-huh and the earthquake it does seem like there's a connection there so\nYou know central Oklahoma was already on a fault it was probably more susceptible when these water injections took place\nUm and like I said you know they pretty much diminished at this point is I think the scientists worked really hard and they know that you know you you can't survive a politically um if you're the cause of these ... a nerve or being a earthquakes\nBut I think most people in Oklahoma have been very patient with oil and gas industry it's been a significant part of our economy for a long long time but most Oklahomans are thrilled that United States\nIs in more control of its energy future going forward that we've been burned and oil and gas industry playing a major role in our economy\nUm but you know at some point their their technology is got to catch up and figure out a way to do that you bring up the oil and gas that they'd like to bring out a without causes the harm on all the rest is\nNow in the Oklahoma economy of course a a began a pretty much what's uh uh uh the presence of a lot of oil was discovered in and of course the automobile really coming into its own just about the time that Oklahoma became a state back in in Nineteen oh seven\nOr the Oklahoma economy has been tied with energy for for many years is the the state's economy are still that directly tied to do energy or has it been in effect diversified\nYeah uncle in the city has diversify with the ... and so Oklahoma as a state is overly reliant on the oil and gas industry and\nIf you're a guy with the ... and so Oklahoma as the state is overly reliant on the oil and gas string and as a result it's it's a it's caught on me and it's tax revenues cyclical\nAre based on you know how the oil and gas industry is doing but in the oil and gas industry is going through such a transcript ... all of the technology of the advancements that they've been baking and\nMade them more efficient industry a year with the current price which is much lower than it was just a few years ago they're able to make a profit\nUm I I Would say we've already reached peak oil and gas industry it just simply takes fewer people to extract oil and gas grill it's more technology driven and they get more oil and gas that it was just go well used to ... and so the result of that as a ... is\nA one day they will pull its fewer people are but that has really helped the guided states determine its own energy future ... we need to be less reliance on foreign oil\nAnd uh I write the oil and gas industries you know it's it's been a wonderful job in creating a better resources for our country here at the United states\nYou mentioned the progress that you've made from that one cent sales tax I'm Wondering the extent to which Oklahoma City depends on a sales tax versus let's say the property tax or is it one of those few urban areas which as an income tax even what what is the basis for Oklahoma City taxes\nWill most of our operations comes from a sales tax and most of our capital states come ... property tax the or the maps program is a little bit outside of the scenario I just described it but it's for capital projects as well but\nIn general it's all government in Oklahoma but is funded operationally by sales tax and capital by property tax\nWill take a break come back with more with our guest Mick Cornett his book the next American city could be yours back in the moment\nI'm Jay foreigners CEO of Quicken

but\nThe other jobs when they had their attitudes disgust me yeah but go ahead\nYes the other gentleman had a good a good point where people can end of the country the right way through Ellis Island you know through the the right process I don't understand and I am I'm a Marine Corps war veteran and I've been to some of these countries\nI don't understand why Mexico is not doing\nThey're letting them come through that show and we deal with it and they don't have to\nThat's right ah they're they're doing it because it's to their advantage and that's why they have always until now suddenly had a very tough southern border with Guatemala their northern border they've always looked upon as essentially\nA toilet to flush their uh unemployment and other problems on to the United states Yes sir Ben Stiller absolutely\nAnd I I I'm forty nine years old I'm a I'm a war veteran and I voted for the first time for president this last election and I am a Trump supporter and I believe what he is planned on putting our military out on the line to stop them is absolutely correct\nI I don't see how there's an argument for that\nOh there there's no no rational argue but you'll get all kinds of people who get hot and bothered about the fact\nThat we're not being generous enough it's always interesting for me to hear all the people out there who were so generous with the your dollars in my dollars to the editor veal morally superior so thank you for your service DJ and for your good thoughts David in Gainesville, Georgia lizard a WD un radio good evening David\nYes Hi Jim Hi there it's been a while since I talk to you I'm Glad you joined as a yeah I had\nA one or two questions that are ... you have to kind of get a handle on ... and I know ... ... troops that are\nAll over the glow a cold beer for border to North Korea order your\nDifferent places right when I was just wondering do you think maybe the president they are\nOne pressure point is for him has to go to put it in the fish will request for military assistance on their southern border\nThat why you think it's in our troops to their says or order like\nMexico southern border yeah\nWell first of all I\nMexico should be doing their job on their border that's number one and number two I don't know that that uh we need the opposite way they're quite capable of gardening that border is a proven over the years they suddenly decided\nThat it's to their advantage to let people through but it's not as though they're capable of defending that border they have done so very effectively over the years and then suddenly stopped which for whatever reason there's a new\nA new president in the in Mexico city ah\nIf I thought that that would make a difference and there was no other way to do it I could go along with that idea David but honestly I don't I don't think that it's necessary to do that and I do believe that that's the the appropriate way to go\nAnyway uh by the way I almost was in a visiting your good friends building Joel on the Wu end this past mourning but\nAt the time was a having a dental problems so was unable to make the trip ... had a job in a moment\n\nWhen did happening here in the valley we're talking about in the home we live and you buy any rally\nHave to gain a out of it the other thing that a jam in a ... in in second Timothy it clearly states that a man that will not look after his own household is worse than an infidel we're not looking after our own and I think it is beyond disgraceful that we have millions of\nVeterans in eight\nYears there's no doubt about the fact that we often do not have the do not do enough for our veterans point well taken Charlotte I I Would have to agree with you completely in that regard are jolted Pittsburgh ... had a job that evening Joan\nOr put another way Joan in Pittsburgh hello Joan or is it gene observing its gene I sorry I uh go ahead Jean\nAlright hum my question that I have not heard any news media or anybody address is that a\nCaravan of this magnitude doesn't just spontaneously happened\nAll of a sudden though he's ... people in these countries have been oppressed for decades mhm that's running what he has to be leading this ad right planned this somebody organized than\nIt is paying for and who I mean how how are these people eating how are they sleeping are they going to the bathroom I mean that's a lot of people\nYou know where's the expos they on the leadership of this group who's paying them it seems to me if somebody could figure that out which I Would think that our government's already looked into this\nThat that would disclose the true nature of what why this thing is happening by you're figuring out who's in charge and who's paying them your problem it\nYes I think the the there's absolutely a somewhat behind this ah if it is a a a Americans that wouldn't surprise me at all of\nA judicial watch president Tom ... says that there is evidence that this the care of that is comprised mostly of military age males that was in fact financed by people in the United states so uh that's his view or investigative reporter Sarah Carter\nWho was a appear to this program before I was in Guatemala says she is out of this mostly banned the crossing the Guatemalan border and they are given a rehearsed answer\nThis was not politics this is about poverty she tweeted that uh there were women and children but they were at the front of a caravan smaller numbers none would say who the organizers are but several said that it was in fact\nOrganizers so yes I think ah the short answer gene is that the you're absolutely correct and that is precisely what we're talking about here we'll talk some more about it it just a moment you'll see one our earnings\nGo up we earn more\nIf you've done clots um squeaking white board marker [noise]\nEasily won the most annoying office noises there is right up there with the woman who capture Penn like she's doing a drum solo at a sold out arena
