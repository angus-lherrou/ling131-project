Bill O'Reilly\nHis latest in the killing series killing the ss co written with Martin do guard is are already working its way up to the top of the best seller list and they were going to look a bit of just do what this book reveals because like most of the things that bill is tackled you look at the title just say oh well I Know about that\nAnd what it usually is the case is you know some of the things about that so the first broad picture of the other World War two Nazi Germany is collapsing and the rats are fleeing the sinking ship that much we know\nWhat I did not realize until a killing the ss came along bill was the extent to which some of these people\nHad help from the United states government\n[noise] sure um after Iraq killing Patton which became an enormous salary a lot of material leftover because pat and uh was an occupier in southern Germany\nOr before he was a killer met his death in the hospital in Germany and the prevailing wisdom from pat and and many other a powerful people in the U.S government was we've got to use these captured Nazis\nSpy and work against the Soviet Union which is moving in and wants to conquer a Europe and you'll remember from killing a bad one actually fight them you wanted to fight Stalin yeah so that's what the new CIA or that took over from the AOL says did\nThey enlisted a lot of these uh ss people and get ... people\nTo spy against ah the Soviet Union work against the Soviet Union and they didn't really much care what they did during the war in addition there was an organization set up by Heinrich ... the head of the ss one of the most vile human beings ever to walk the planet called Odessa\nAnd Emily knew about a year or before the third Reich collapse of Germany was going to lose and\nHe thought he can negotiate a separate pieces kind of crazy delusional stuff from him but he formed this organization and they had a lot of money and a lot of assassins within the organization and so they helped\nThese guys get out of Germany we have a you know we tell you step by step how that happened and also the America not the American Red Cross in in Switzerland helped them\nA elements of the Vatican help them and they got them from Germany down to general Italy and on boats to Spain South America and South Africa\nAh it it was an amazing assembly line to get these guys out we took a big guys were talking I meant andme Angola Klaus Barbie the Bush early on and Martin Mormon\nWho the myth was died in Berlin as a as Hitler committed suicide well he didn't he got away to South America and we kind of we proved that in the book by dental work and so it was a compelling compelling a story almost on every page\nUm and I want Americans particularly younger Americans to understand the evil that was in play you know Jim these ss people I mean they were farmers and bankers and merchants they didn't go to hell university\nYou wouldn't World War two broke out they just signed up and put on a black uniform with the death said go on a cap\nAnd we're in we're in a concentration camps where they could kill millions of people\nWho just ordinary people is just amazing\nI'm ... and when you read it people ... all that couldn't happen yeah it did it and it could happen here by the way\nA will certainly return to that thought here in a moment that it could happen here and by the way I happen to agree with you but I'm sure many out there are a raise their eyebrows right now the thought of that I certainly understand the motivation\nBut I have to ask in retrospect since we now have a three quarters of a century since World War two certainly time to weigh whether this was even remotely worth it is there any kind of justification\nFor whatever intelligence these people may have revealed to justify want this country and others the Vatican and others did in in a sparing these people and spirited him away is there any justification at all\nNo but it's another case of people looking away from evil that is what Harry Truman did ill and killing the ss we show you how Harry Truman almost had to be black male\nTo go after it off Eichmann ... they had to say if you don't Mr President we're going to lead to the press that you're not going to go after I\nWho who did that and then adding that forced forced Truman to do it who who blackmail on it who blackmailed him\nI'm a element in the state department made it clear and we named the man I'm that if two men didn't sign the order for the CIA to look for a man that he was going to go public with it he was a judge\nOr an American judge who was at Nuremberg and it turned his stomach that the U.S government was looking the other way and didn't want to know or hear about the atrocities that happened in the concentration\nCamps and an insult true that Harry Truman was a bad man he just didn't want to\nAcknowledge it is the same thing in in in a FDR FDR knew that the Nazis were mowing down innocent people you knew it but he couldn't sell it or wouldn't sell it because half the public didn't want to get involved with World War two\nWhite six six five oh jumbo our number one eight six six five oh five or six to six lots of other revelations like this that are astounding and the bill O'Reilly will tell you all about them or just a a a a tad bit if you will or some hors d'oeuvres for thought from his late ...\nFounding and the bill O'Reilly will tell you all about that or just a a a a tad bit if you will or some hors d'oeuvres for thought from his latest of the killing series\nKilling the ss and uh it is a a gang busters ... just published by the way by Henry Holt and company again our number one eight six six five oh jumbo one eight six six five oh five or six to six if you'd like to talk to bill about\nHis book killing the ss or any of the big issues of the day and of course we haven't even talked about the mid term elections which we will do with Bill as well so a sad by more to come on the boat had a Joe and just a moment\n\nWhen Ben whether his agent the steps to bad weather when you need it with the twenty storm team had a chance one on one five [noise] mostly\nI don't think they had a a horse and the Kavanaugh saying um I think that\nUh the Democrats are counting on this anti Trump wave\nBut at the economy is booming for every one that takes a lot of the edge off that anti Trump stuff so um you know again it's impossible to predict there is anger\nBut there's also you know let me give you an example Jim and this is a pretty vivid example of what I'm Talking about here with the rise of evil in this country after Kavanaugh is confirmed and the day that he was confirmed a writer for the cold there program put out a tweet that said okay\nWell maybe he got the Supreme Court job but at least we ruined his life\nYeah okay that by the way the bill is on his ... he said\nRight I'm going to submit that no one on your staff\nAnd certainly no one on my step and Bill O'Reilly dot com could ever\nPut out a tweet like that and keep their job because it's hateful\nAnd it is an evil act and I'll tell you why because capital as children\nAnd he has a wife and a mother and father\nAnd this guy writing for cold there who's still working at cold there to no action against it ... is is applauding the fact that we ruined his life like that's a good thing and I think Americans have picking that up\nThe picking up that this progressive left movement and teeth are these people they're dangerous you know\nAnd and there's nothing in the world more tragically ironic\nThat people calling themselves and anti fascist who's tactics would be recognized by any member of the brown shirts the Nazi movement I mean to call themselves anti fascist is just tragic ironic and sadly most of them would not even understand the irony yeah\nThe good news is the good news is that there's not many of them the the bad news is is that they're identical to the S. A. in Germany in the late twenties and thirties there were Hitler's bully boys who went out and beat up every body that oppose Nazi isn't it's the same tactics\nIs the right to same same thing but in America you know a lot of these people and they apparently they all live in Portland, Oregon\n[laughter] I have a lot of them do yeah yeah\nSo I take a quick break come back with more from Bill O'Reilly or get his new book killing the S. S. including some remarkable takes about those engaged in hunting down these Nazis or they did not a unanimously agree with one another far from it plus your calls one eight six six five oh jumbo back in the moment\nFrom a massive cactus falling on a home was here dancing on cars who we've covered have talked to farmers we know one thing or two because we've seen a thing or two we\nAre ...\nYou're right my name is ... from from my family and everything\nI'm Jay foreigner CEO of Quicken Loans America's premier home purchase lender we've\nCreated a new way to protect you from unpredictable interest rates are exclusive rate shield approval first we lock your interest rate for up to Ninety Days then if rates go up your rate stays locked but if rates go down your rate drops either way you win call us today at eight hundred clicking or go to rocket mortgage dot com\nRacial upheaval only valid uncertain three year fixed rate loan scholar cost information in conditions people having winter licensing office he thinks analyst number thirty thirty initial conditions are exclusions may apply\nDiabetes high blood pressure anxiety meds everyone's on them if you want to fifty year old male maybe it would be for you or even with type two diabetes a million dollars of term insurance my only cost you about two hundred bucks a month of Ford of alternate life insurance is out there called term provider and speak with big blue and eight hundred for a one\nFourteen fifty eight eight hundred for a one fourteen fifty eight or is it big\nThey're called term provider and speak with big Lou and eight hundred for a one fourteen fifty eight eight hundred for a one fourteen fifty eight or is it big blue dot com remember big lose IQ he's on meds to\nWhen the need for senior characterizes there's no place like home\nYour loved one should never have to give up living at home visiting angels will provide home care for your mom or dad at home I'm twenty four hours per day including personal care meals and light housework your electric professional can't give it with visiting angel look up and getting into dot com or calling eight seven seven three seven four men\nThan eight seven seven three seven four men franchises or an animal visiting in jail America's Choice and senior home care from a beer messing up ...\nWith the er damaging\nWe've covered it talked to farmers we know one thing or two because we've seen a thing or two we\nAre are ...\n... have you seen\nSunday mornings and nobody you may be means polka polka carousel with ... and the winters are on Sunday mornings from eight to ... answering their award winning ... nobody wants to be\nSomeone writes a pioneer valleys proud polish heritage was pong a carousel one on one by one on seven five fourteen hundred\nAnd twelve forty W.
