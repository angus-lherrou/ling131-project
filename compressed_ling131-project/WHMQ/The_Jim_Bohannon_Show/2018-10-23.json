knows whom and Univision tonight had a guy in Spanish that's why we don't play it but uh one of their reporters embedded with the caravan says he's met migrants from known terrorism hot spots\nLike Bangladesh\nAre they doing there this is part of the fear but the other is what Trump ran on tonight in Texas we're seeing rallies that is the card games when is anything we've ever seen\nUpwards of a hundred thousand people may have been there all day long with cookouts and tailgating and packed a basketball arena tonight with Trump and cruise now here is though something a little bit different Fox infringed today\nThey had on independent voters member it's Fox News channel and they were asking these people about the caravan and here's what the Democrats are believing and I don't believe them and you can tell us that eight six six fifty jumbo\nThere believing there's a lot of people in America we're going to see this as you get a mandatory in crisis they're going to see this as evil wrong Trump I'm not proud to be an American if he stops this caravan and all the threats listen to these independent voters according to Fox News on Fox and friends this morning\nRejecting pushing back against this caravan saying it's fear mongering and the like here's how it sounded\nMichael let's start with you\nHow big a problem is that that the United states has even immigration laws\nI I think even the immigration laws are a problem for any country and I think our immigration laws are needed to be modernized and updated ah ah but this country is founded on immigration and all of us come from immigrants\nSure so what should the United states do if those seven thousand people by the time it gets there can be ten thousand gonna be twenty thousand what should the United states feel about this\nThis is the ... country on the planet I think we can handle a a a a caravan of people unarmed come into this country so let them in time well I I'm saying to process improper John real quick on the immigration there is a humanitarian\nCrisis taking place in Central America and yet this issue gets turned into a complete political football there's very little honest discussion about what's actually happening and kept turning the talking points interests\nYou know treating I'm treating this as an invasion is is a bad idea and it's going to end hardly if it is treated such as that way so I I think people have to realize yeah these these are human beings coming here and there needs to be a real solution um do a fall for it um in in\nDealing with a sure but the backdrop is the midterms and so it all becomes political let's see what happens discussion\nAlright that's on Fox and friends that weren't in my audience was outraged after they heard that in Philadelphia today how about you eight six six fifty Jim let's not all political stop as a political stuff this is a real issue we go back and forth with this we have awkward says he said it could be twenty thousand I'm seeing various caravans various things come together\nJust they they're gonna punch through Mexico it appears they've already broken through in they're headed toward the border and it may happen next week challenge of next week right before the midterms\nWell this is the issue writ large in front of its this goes on every day\nChallenge him next week right before the midterms well this is the issue writ large in front of his this goes on every day not not in the staggering numbers on bass but this sort of invasive behavior has gone on every day it's I've been to the border I've done shows from there\nThis is a type of thing that goes on and I think this plays badly for the Democrats and open borders and these independent guys here saying we'll just let them in is that the solution now you know President Trump is even talked about shutting down the entire border that's commercially and the military\nAnd the only hesitation I have there is you would meet an ass massive number of military to apprehend and stop this church\nAnd if the military had to use physical force firing on people that would not be good but short of that I think Americans say no they analogize it I've had all kinds of people tell me this is like someone just saying they're coming into my house because there's enough of them and they're going to come here and that's it\nIs that wrong we do have laws we do have asylum laws we do have the ability to process this is not just political\nAnd all this comprehensive reform enforce the laws we already have first how about doing that before we stop at this comprehensive nonsense all the time back and forth with this\nWhat would you do in this situation I got a lot more sounds on this coming up but I'd love to get you in and if you have a reaction to us the ban and that was really good stuff you're the man of mystery open up about some things\nEight six six fifty Jim boat that will do it eight six six fifty jumbo get you to me I'm sure you're down into this caravan story\nIt breaks right if they reach the border say days before the midterm election could be a game changer Democrats in the media are thinking in America it's totally sympathetic they'll see Trump for the bully and all this stuff it is they won't feel good as Americans have trumped stops it\nI think it's the opposite if he doesn't stop it he\nLoses faith in the base of people saying that's why we elected you to stop stuff like this we don't want this love to hear from you my name is Tom junior Dana I'm sitting in for Jim go hand in on Westwood One\n[noise]\n\nWhat is happening here in the valley we're talking about the only live and more of a new kind of pioneered rally\nWithout anyone losing their life or anything like that\nBut this is going to be an ongoing problem this is going to continue and continue and continue until we put up enough of a barrier a K A wall\nTo stop this but this is why Trump was elected Democrats in the media or not they think this

what we supposed to have\nThis sense insane to let these people come from these countries and they're going to run over the border and I'm going to the bar\nOh what we supposed to have this is insane to let these people come in this country and they're going to run over our border and I'm going to the bottom of it\nIf we have to do all means necessary if Donald Trump got the call the army out on the air force of the Marines to stop them then all means necessary it must be done\nBecause I I hear you I hear you the logic of that Steve I mean mark but I don't think that's exactly what the Democrats in the media are hoping for you know would that would be like in the short term as people are emotional if it happened right before the election in the long term\nYou're absolutely right we cannot have people think they're just going to storm the border\nWe you know are behind Donald Trump one hundred percent he's doing a great job he's a great guy and if it gets to it I mean it always

enough to inundate the border with agents are where we have controlled the better but now with these words coming as it's getting back out of control\nWhat used to have a good yeah\nWell the here's what it is and I've been thinking about this um you know uh he called the president could send the military down there which is a smart move however listen to these people are coming and it seems that that's inevitable so my thought was\nTo set up a massive refugee camp or we have the greatest military on us you could set it up in no time set up with candidates and with mess halls in the shower facilities and everything that they could possibly need therefore a we would not be splitting up families and so on and so right\nThere for the Democrats can't go crazy over that kind of thing and then what we do oh by the way we set it up next to a place that has a big airport so you can either do it by the human error stationery over in Sierra Vista at the ... and here's the thing is and we used to do this a long time ago ... what you do is it\nSo these people are overly claim some refugee status or some asylum status and stuff that ... and what they do is they they um\nSet them up in front of an immigration judge who will eventually make the determination on them okay so what they do what they should do is set up these um um um\nThe dry heat you camp and then have to go in there

settle for that they're saying they're just coming into the country and that\nBingo but that here's the problem though my sense is that so far they're not going to settle for that they're saying they're just coming into the country and that's it because there's well by the numbers whoever's organizing this and it's going to be bigger\nI don't know how you're going to hurt them toward these

very very liberal running for president ultimately even though he's barely been in office as governor probably in twenty twenty or the next cycle\nAnd she claims that during the campaign this guy named\nAlvarez have got a hundred and forty thousand dollar jobs housing czar\nIn the Murphy administration after he won drove her home or you know they were at a rally or something for Murphy asked you use the bathroom comes in and then attacked her\nShe gets a rape kit done tells her best friend who joined her she shaking tells her husband about it reports it to the authorities reports it to the Murphy people\nAnd then when nothing is done and Murphy's elected and this guy comes up for a job interview reports it all over again reports it even according to the wall Street Journal reports to Mrs Murphy Eddie Murphy's tower they'll get back to meet with her at least the governor did and then they never do\nHere's my point the national media is not telling you about this\nComing off cabin on all that we saw wouldn't this be the perfect follow up story if they were really serious about talking about these issues the only national media that's done anything with this is the wall Street Journal they gave her a forum they did investigation they wrote this up\nAnd now the legislature apparently is going to have a special team investigate this and a a former a judge is being brought in to investigate it\nBut why should the national media not interested in is even the local media only talk radio twelve ten and somewhat in Jay dot com occasionally they write about it\nYou would think there should be all the rage given what we went through with cabinet here's a woman with resources does it by the book\nNow Dr Ford you can argue arches only Fifteen back in the day she doesn't can't remember and all this and we're told if the woman says all that though it's true you have to believe or Cory Booker in Jersey and these others right well this woman said the same thing and what does this guy gets\nCriminal penalties or not he was applying for a job in the Murphy administer a big job a high paying job\nAnd despite all these complaints they still gave it to them without any investigation she alleges and that's where the wall Street Journal seems the point being that double standard rears its head her name is Katie brand name\nIn any way that you can spread that around tell people you see the wall Street Journal piece\nAbout it it's just one of the best examples I've seen in years of the double standard of what actually goes on so if the standard coming out of cabin up people on the left in the media you shouldn't be on the court\nIf a woman makes the allegation without cooperation that's just too bad it's a job interview this is hanging over his head\nHow does this guy then she'll get appointed how is it the Murphy's have not met with her how is it the national media doesn't want you to know out there and gyms audience\nAbout this nobody no follow up\nNow even if they want to say they follow the story and the woman they think is crying wolf here well that's an object lesson I could live with that if that's where they come up with a

terrorism hot spots like Bangladesh what are they doing there\nThis is part of the fear but the other is what Trump ran on tonight in Texas we're seeing a rally that is is gargantuan is anything we've ever seen\nUpwards of a hundred thousand people may have been there all day long with cookouts and tailgating and packed a basketball arena tonight with Trump and cruise now here is though something a little bit different Fox infringed today\nThey had on independent voters member it's Fox News channel\nAnd they were asking these people about the caravan\nAnd here's what the Democrats are believing and I don't believe them and you can tell us that eight six six fifty jumbo\nThere believing there's a lot of people in America we're going to see this as you know mandatory in crisis they're going to see this is evil wrong Trump I'm not proud to be an American if he stopped his caravan and all of his threats listen to these independent voters according to Fox News on Fox and friends this morning\nRejecting pushing back against this caravan saying it's fear mongering and the like here's how it sounded\nMichael let's start with you\nHow big a problem is that the United states has even immigration laws\nI I think an even immigration laws are are a problem for any country and I think our immigration laws are needed to be modernized and updated ah ah but this country is founded on immigration and all of us come from immigrants tour\nSo what should the United states do is so seven thousand people by the time it gets there can be ten thousand going to be twenty thousand which the United states do about this Fisher\nSays the ... country on the planet I think we can handle a on a a a caravan of people unarmed come into this country so Letterman and well I Am saying too cautious improperly John real quick on the immigration there's a humanitarian\nCrisis taking place in Central America and yet this issue get turned into a complete political football there's very little honest discussion about what's actually happening and kept turning the talking points and they're\nTreating I'm treating this as an invasion is is a bad idea and it's going to end hardly if it is treated such as that way so I I think the ... these are human beings come here and there needs to be a real solution um ... offers um in in dealing\nWith a sure but the backdrop is the men terms and so it all becomes political let's see what happens rate discussion\nAlright that's from Fox and friends are sworn in my audience was outraged after they heard that in Philadelphia today how about you eight six six fifty Jim what's not all political stop the political stuff this is a real issue we go back and forth with this we have up words as he said it could be twenty thousand I'm seeing various caravans various things come together\nJust they they're gonna punch through Mexico it appears they've already broken through and they're headed toward the border and it may happen next week tail end of next week right before the midterms\nWell they see the issue writ large in front of his this goes on every day not not in the staggering numbers on mass but this sort of invasive behaviors gone on every day it I've been to the border I've done shows from there\nThis is a type of thing that goes on and I think\nThis place badly for the Democrats and open borders and these independent guys here saying we'll just let 'em me is that the solution now you know President Trump is even talked about shutting down the entire border that's commercially and the military\nAnd the only hesitation I have there is you would meet an ass massive number of military to apprehend and stop this church\nAnd if the military had to use physical force firing on people that would not be good but short of that I think Americans say no they analogize it I've had all kinds of people tell me this is like someone just saying they're coming into my house because there's enough of them and they're going to come here and that's it\nIs that wrong\nDo have laws we do have asylum laws we do have the ability to process this it is not just political\nAnd all of this comprehensive reform enforce the laws we already have first how about doing that before we stop at this comprehensive nonsense all the time back and forth with this\nWhat would you do in this situation I got a lot more sounds on this coming up but I'd love to get you in and if you have a reaction to us the ban and that was really good stuff you're the man of mystery open up about some things\nEight six six fifty Jim ... that will do it eight six six fifty jumbo get you to me ... this caravan story if it breaks right if they reach the border say days before the midterm election could be a game changer\nDemocrats in the media are thinking in America is totally sympathetic those\nFor the midterm election could be a game changer\nDemocrats in the media are thinking in America is totally sympathetic they'll see Trump for the bully and all this stuff it is they won't feel good as Americans if Trump stops it\nI think it's the opposite if he doesn't stop it\nHe loses faith in the base of people saying that's why we elected you to stop stuff like this we don't want this love to hear from you my name is Tom junior data I'm sitting in for Jim ... on Westwood One\n[noise]\n\nWe have from North Hampton to bring the one on one by
