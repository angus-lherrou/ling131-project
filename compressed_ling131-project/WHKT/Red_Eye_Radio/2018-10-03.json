victory dance on this great trade agreement know born after we've been fighting it for thirty five years I hate NAFTA I never thought I'd see the day where it was done ... gone and replaced by something better than actually helped the American worker\nAnd more good news if you're working in America today and you have a job even more good news if you want to three hundred and fifty thousand people that worked for Amazon guess what you just got a raise if you are below Fifteen dollars now you're going to be starting November first at Fifteen dollars Amazon\nSaying you know what we have to raise wages we have to find a key people see when you're counting is booming and you have\nMore jobs that people to fill the jobs that means companies are searching for good people they\nTo applicants for three jobs and if they're good applicants they're going to have to pay them so he I'm In favor\nOf a Fifteen dollar minimum wage as you know\nBut even better when you don't even have to have it mandated by the federal government when the market driven by Trump's economic is so vibrant that companies have to make decisions in their best interest to raise wages to keep good people that is a great\nSo you think of all the entry level people that went to work for Amazon or are going to work for Amazon if that can accompany continues to grow that just got a rain is because of the Trump economy\nThey tend to have to put forth a thin air\nHappens because wages are rising so now Amazon has to compete with other companies UPS FedEx whenever\nThey have to compete and they have to pay\n[noise] and that's what Trump and that makes sense and that's how the rising tide lifts all boats so wages continue to derive this is this is great news is that amazing thing today and we finally got rid of NAFTA oh my God I just a\nYou know what when that was first going down Curtis Ellis is with us so we're we're going to bring him in now Curtis Ellis a senior policy adviser with America First of all this and\nYou could go back to the nap today I mean I remember this over lose like Nineteen with the Clinton they got elected\nAnd then getting rich came I was like Ninety five and [noise] it's big NAFTA thing was going on and you know what's going to be like the ... the head all these jobs are going to be created and and you know we were going to be the service the kind of whatever nonsense they were selling us and back\nYou know how many Republicans were fighting NAFTA like history like maybe Trump and Pat Buchanan that's it\nIf you were against NAFTA in the nineties you looked at as like some kind of an economic Neanderthal\nLike jumping in a box of rock like you couldn't see the future you're via word mired in the Eighteen hundreds and you wanted to bring back a blacksmith or something the horse and buggy like you just couldn't get with that you could understand the global world economy and\nWith the help of the wall Street Journal editorial page and the wall Street Journal is of course the the the mouthpiece of the global corporations who I Believe in open borders no countries at all just let us rape and pillage anywhere on earth without\nUh any anything like a national legislature or national board or getting in a way of our ability to just exploit the cheapest labor anywhere and rape and pillage all over\nAll over the world as as we wish the wall Street Journal editorial page invented this lives that the Smoot Hawley that the terrorist act of Nineteen thirty created the great depression\nWhy [laughter] why and and now has become accepted gospel wisdom everywhere and he was still pops up\nAnd you find Republicans saying it you find Democrats sang it you find that they were saying it in Texas you find every moron idiot who doesn't even understand\nEconomics but they know for sure\nThat the the the the Great Depression was caused by terrorists right that's what causes it the Smoot Hawley tariff act\nAnd that's what caused the great depression and it's a complete lie complete fabrication than no basis in truth whatsoever but that is now the accepted wisdom and anytime anybody attacks Donald Trump's for standing up to China\nAnd putting terrorists in place for defending American industry to say well don't you know that terrorists called the great depression and how do you know that well I read it somewhere you know where you're reading well everybody knows that\nCase closed and so that all happened as a result that all came out of the debate over NAFTA in Nineteen Ninety four thank you\nAl Gore another ally from the Democrats than well made by the Republican at the wall Street Journal editorial page all of the Republican\nI mean I mean back then Curtis that Republicans were totally complicit in this this was driven by Newt Gingrich I mean Bill Clinton basically came along for the ride getting rich and the Republican majority John patients they all drove it\nPeople forget that I remember I remember the Republican drove this and they really believe that you know this was open trade open borders everything was going to be fine and\nLook at Wall Street driven right they got they got they don't\nThat's on the ownership class that's on if you are an owner things will be good for you because you make more money and they workers as simply take commodity the first thing you learn in economics one ... one is you go into a junior in high school and they they talk to you about\nDiminishing resources and supply and demand and they say the number one biggest costs the businesses what labor labor labor right I mean you learn that as a sophomore in high school\nSo it never stops no uh we're with Curtis Ellis he's a senior policy adviser for America first policies he's also the chairman of Emma richest of the American jobs that lives Curtis or worked in the Trump Administration and the department of labor he was also on the campaign\nCurtis so way out for us this is a great victory for American workers American farmers laying out like the top three or four changes and\nHousing positively affect the Americans going from and then you have to yang to United States Mexico Canada or us and saying hey\nThe top ah some of the top changes increases the amount of a car or that must be made in North America it increases it up to Seventy five percent three quarters report to enter the United states duty free\nThree quarters of an automobile must be made in the United states\nIt increases the amount of dairy products that the United states can sell in Canada so that our dairy farmers in upstate New York Wisconsin and the northern tier in California a lot of daring California number one dairy state America\nWill have a greater access not just to Canada\nTo third countries because Canada under this agreement\nWill reduce subsidies to the dairy products exports to third countries it subsidizes its excess\nDairy production and a ... under cuts are prices in third countries are you there yet\nOkay I heard a click that wasn't true\nAnd it didn't it it it increases protections for digital trade intellectual property rights in the digital trade which of course did not exist at all and the previous now after ... there was no digital trade there was no Internet\nAh there was a and and what's happened over the last twenty five years\nIs Canada put all these crazy a protections in requirements and regulations so that Americans couldn't even sell stuff to Canadians on E. bay uh it it became virtually impossible so\nA e commerce is now increased we can now actually sell stuff to Canadians over the Internet and um\nStill trying to check this out there and didn't agreement there is a stipulation\nIn the U.S MCA that if Canada or Mexico in terms of trade agreement with a non market economy and that means China right there the biggest non market economy out there\nIf they do all bets are off we can withdraw from NAFTA we can withdraw from our trade agreement with that country so basically what they say you can't set\nUp Mexico or Canada can't enter into a trade deal with China and then trying to be calm and then use NAFTA as a way to get there it's\nThe subsidized goods into the United states\nRight and that's that's what that's what was happening on NAFTA\nAnd that was also what was going to happen on steroids if we if we testing the pain\nExactly the Chinese a cheap bike rather than shifting to a stranger the you'll you'll you'll you us they go to Mexico or they go to Canada becomes part of that and we only have a great deal right yeah yeah I just like yeah you know the\n... the other huge thing about this since it's a step back for a minute and look at the big picture NAFTA was supposed to be the first step in the free trade area of the Americas right first we bring together North America countries\nThen we get kept or Central America free trade agreement and the next step was going to be the free trade area of the Americas from\nFrom tierra del sway you go to the north pole one big happy free trade zone and then we saw was with ti ti ti tree and specific partnership we were going to bring in the other side of the Pacific as well and see all of these things are part of the\nOf the vision the grand vision of creating a border was world and I am not exaggerating misses on some John birth society conspiracy top ...\nTeams the fact the wall Street Journal again they\nHave said on the record there should be a law or they want to amend the constitution to add a sprays\nThere shall be no borders that is the dream of the global is of the global is corporations the fortune fifty the fortune five corporation they want no borders no nations they don't want\nPesky things like Congress or the president's ah ... making it difficult for them to do their thing anywhere on earth find cheap labor over here find cheap minerals over their combined them into third place and sell them into fourth place that's their vision been laid out before\nIn front of Congress this is not a conspiracy\nThis new deal recognizes that we have a country and we are entitled to have a country than it is a privilege for people in other countries too\nTo make things under laws [noise]\nLabor laws environmental laws whatever laws that are good for the American people can decide what are the conditions in situations for making stuff in this country treat everybody right\nTreat their workers right treat private property rights respected and you can make things and do well and have a good living in this country if you're from another country and your company from another country\nThe privilege to be allowed to sell stuff in this country not a right\nAbsolutely Curtis something better than anyone we could have

victory and\nI'm going to start like this and we're going to bring her in but I think it was a week ago or two weeks ago right two weeks ago I covered the two weeks ago or ... I don't remember I covered the a lot of the county debate between uh Jennifer Wexton\nBarbara costs like and we ran out live on the radio and\nWas [noise] that was the biggest thing crushing\nI've ever seen in my life partner is that the top of her getting all all property was rattle off solution after solution after solution success success after success plan\nMean I was embarrassed for actually uh I was a parish for Jennifer it was so bad it was like she was in ... and\nThere was a lot of talk after that debate like who prepared or and what the deal was but um [noise] you know when is what it is so okay ... joining us now we declared her the huge debate Victor Barbara Comstock hey Barbara\nGood good to have you with us [noise]\nGreat to be what John yeah morning [noise]\nUm what was the deal in that debate I mean\nI really expected Jennifer to do better than that I went to Paris for her\nWell [laughter] what can we focused on without hurting me to have you thought it wouldn't be the result that I personally gotten that I've worked on a part of it to promote our prosperity you know the tax cuts that in the economic growth me out for\nA lot more things possible we just passed\nA budget that had record funding for things like Alzheimer's research and I have cancer research to court for our veterans so large military pay raise some things are good things that she can't say anything about of course these are all things that she resisted\nThe agenda that I'm getting attacked on the ad that they have left right now attacking me is\nAn eighty two percent bipartisan agenda that included things like you know record funding for opioid addiction treatment and\nEducation and the ... and so she's doing is resisting and when you actually look on her legislative record there has been cruel she doesn't have any job accomplishments nothing on our website about anything she's\nDone jobs ... jobs because it does not as focused and co when she was there with the chamber is is never something she focused on you know that they do a job she has this been\nLess winning number one liberal candidate who's opposed things as reasonable as that's just

you need to get to pass the major bill and this is somebody who cannot go out work across the aisle to get anything major with Twenty one people now when you go to Congress you need\nTwo hundred and twenty and I've done that and I've gotten my bills and things like my two thousand dollar child tax credit got into into the tax bill got my colleagues to support that\nMy project steak neighborhood which is providing more\nFunding for a crime and put on guns to fight gun crime drug crime and and like Thirteen gang crime to get hurt that sucked into score card that they're attacking so\nShe just doesn't have a record to run on for a dog resent spending cuts on negative and it's going to fail because people just says for someone focused on your priority and getting resolved and prosperity public safety and national security not already disturbing sets out fighting you know say no to everything\nWell I think was obvious in the debate and\nYou know it's it's fun to go to your party [noise]\nDo you have to be able to articulate a vision and a set of policies the odd or we just want to resist the other guy and\nI think that's where she fell down in this debate or she really didn't have anything and then her closing statement she attacked I'm your record on women which I thought was laughable to be honest so I don't think she did very yeah\nThis is somebody Jennifer Wexton has been campaigning with former representative Jim Moran now this is the man who had not one but two I call the police telling them for abusive behavior\nYou know provide with and this is somebody he

make sure that the [noise] any current credible allegation that has been mainly just told me that it does no good to have an investigation that just gives us more confidence or example\nWe actually need to find out where we can find out [noise] and we\nHave to realize that we may not be able to find out everything now [noise] this is something\nThat was awhile ago\nWitnesses or potential

five days ago to deal with this guy but here's the Ninety\nFive days will come and go and then I'll never\nHave to play a clip from Jeff Flake you'd get oh I'm going to play the clip when he gets a ten percent of the vote New Hampshire [laughter]\nI'll play that clip [noise] okay Jeff thanks for a\nGreat thing the which you're miserable person that's got to touch five actually that's what's

the way you're tired of winning yet MSNBC subjects [noise]\n\nMake no mistake political waiting for President Trump at the problem with me promise kept feeling good about it he talked about it according to eleven o'clock Rose Garden about you'd also have been reading about it but yeah I think that like the top line takeaway is that it opens Canada up\nLet me see as a liberal or left wing fake news is they are have to admit it's a big win for the president I Will get the phone lines of get to either been in Woodbridge I've been here on the air\nJohn good morning saying I haven't talked to you in a while and a mistrial diary I I Do have you on my on my work\nI hear your text number to call it so quick I don't know I don't think you mentioned this morning or something that senator um [noise]\nOh now I'm In South Carolina senator or what's his name a limo rail Lindsey Graham was on the last night and humid just hoping rather interesting and I thought I get your feedback on it [noise]\nAnd it's really simple there if you can't get enough votes to get parents service [laughter]\nProposal that President Trump doubled down on your point to him as a candidate for the Supreme Court position [noise] parents become [noise] election issue for the nation to vote on\nAnd I thought that that was rather interesting and I'm actually pretty smart we did is we don't get enough votes ... becomes more click I accept trust so I thought I'd\nThrow that out you wonder if your opinion [noise] it's a gamble that I wouldn't take because well let's see if we don't get the vote in the Senate\nRight right because you have to think if he doesn't get the votes in the Senate there was nothing in the FBI report that disturbs somebody and then the actually Irene tort become like the campaign is I don't want to talk about this hour to talk about the economy I mean anything to me that takes away from the economy is bad I\nThink if he goes down or if I was the president I Would nominate Amy Coney Barrett the next day like if the vote it's Saturday\nAnd he goes down right right right\nOn Monday I Would nominate company beret\nAnd I would make her the campaign issue I Would make the whole travesty of the Senate to campaign issue\nBut I Would get Kavanaugh off the table because now we're going to be related gaining all these uh uh people that are going to come out of the woods works they pulled somebody's pig tails and middle school or something you got it in a fight with ... when he got off the basketball but who knows what they're going to come up with\nThat is just a distraction so I I I think that's a horrible idea maybe they'll do it I Would not advise that I Would nominate a New Orleans that it was\nLindsey Graham's advising um any dictator on their last I just wanted her to get your your thoughts on it and uh [noise]\nWe should we should do is just not a good one um but I suspect some thinking about it in fact what why not because I think the American people are there\nAre short something that was true in the background investigation that would get exposed shorter\nTo vote for Republicans throughout the country but [noise] I just wanted to get out there is\nAn interest in doing\nSo well I don't like\nI don't like anything about it because I think it it would take all the focus all the economy and I think you've already motivated the Republican base and I just don't like hanging out there for six for thirty five days I Would go with ...\nThe only beret and yeah I Would push that I Would I Would make that the campaign issue and you know good luck feeding her she's got nine ... ... I mean good good good luck with that one\nIn supporter view physician actually it kind of worried matter what it would have an aunt Amy Barrett\nWe would stay with somebody to watch an election willing to who's going to get on to the Supreme Court if Kavanaugh can't make it so I really actually planning is a valid one um [noise]", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Red Eye Radio", "city": "Portsmouth", "day": "03"}
