forty and very sunny skies so great to have you with us one of the most interesting things here that is going on is this caravan which many of these migrants have\nCrossed Mexico I'm not sure I'm not sure really how steadfast the Mexican effort was in order to stop the caravan but we understand now there is a is about five thousand people strong and\nMany of them have gotten through the Mexican authorities they were stopped on a bridge they jumped in the river many of them now just getting through and\nThe other way to the United states now the Trump Administration has got to make a decision in a very short period of time on this caravan\nI'm just going to say this straight out when you have four or five thousand people storming your country and this is what this says they're storming the border their strength in numbers they're getting money along the way they're being encouraged\nAs the president said we don't know who is part of their certainly CNN is going to play a mom with babies that's all they're going to play they're not going to play the raptors\nOr anyone else that happens to be involved in it that might not be the type of person you want the United states are open to show the moms with the babies but at the end of the day you have five thousand people crashing the border of the United states where I come from at sixty years old\nI think that's Conan invasion I don't know what else do you call it a migrant right at what is it a like may we come in\nI mean we have laws in this country the president's gonna have to act on this he has no choice and he threatened to send the military there\nUm hopefully they'll turn back hopefully they'll turn back and they have to turn back and fix their own countries everybody would love to come to the United states as an economic refugee\nWe fill the country up with five being people in the collapse you simply cannot allow five thousand people to simply storm over the border and then be fed closed education and who's paying for it\nA thousand and then what do you do then you have a country that's common that is absolutely coming and it's coming sooner than you think it is because thousands of these um what what you want to call them migrants or a\nTerror banners resume their journey on Sunday despite the Mexican government or just submit\nTo processing ready immigration authorities they simply ignored or just like though will ignore ours\nAnd the differences CNN will be there with cameras\nAnd God Forbid and all they're going to do is take pictures of moms with babies that's it they're gonna put all the Miles Davis up at the front and take all the pictures and I don't know one or the CNN people and all the other liberals just take them into their home and go through just drive your car down there take five other men\nDriving through the process of yourself spend the money how's the feed them closer I don't know maybe he didn't that they're not going to that they're not going to do it\n\nAnd all of the things that you're going to see is about how mean we are not letting them at\n\nIt's incredible now this is going to turn into a major campaign issue\nAnd to be ... this is the worst possible scenario you're talking about an October surprise here it is you're watching five thousand people trying to invade the United states from the southern border and there is no wall and President Trump got elected on this issue and now here comes\nA week before the election a week\n\nAnd a James says this is the timing of this kind of an interesting yes I think maybe it was put together they thought it would help the Democrats because we have kids in cages again it's going to blow up in their faces got back fire\nI mean average Americans look at this and they're like I don't think it's a good thing for tens of thousands of people just stormed the country I mean that's where the Taliban is your storming the country is is not like you're just a group of people in an orderly fashion\nOr they sneak through a rancher there was a handful here and a handful there\nI mean you get five thousand people that's a mob and then it's an invasion and what are we going to do there's no one is I mean what are you if you put the military and string them out of the border\nHow are we going to stop that you're not going to shoot them so her going to stop them then the confrontation goes on TV and the Democrats were screaming about how mean we are or Trump is it\nIt's a it's a powder keg it's a powder keg and you've got fourteen days away fourteen days but it's going to blow up because look if you listen to me right now I don't think you're excited about five thousand people just storming into the United states\nAnd breaking all of our laws and suddenly their nose and everything and then say take care of me I mean you don't have a country if you allow this to happen and Trump said somebody gets a relative\nOr send you an invitation because then I got a stern\nI got to stop it and the invitation is come on it he said the next ... will be fifty thousand is right because the Democrats are campaigning I let them it basically they don't want to stop

as that\nAnd uh the easiest case is for the father king Solomon\nSomebody else they got a lot of people not family as guy has proven to be a disaster so far that might be the answer we don't know the Trump Administration is considering classifying gender as determined by Gina cilia at first\nPart of a government wide effort to roll back recognition of transgender people under federal civil rights law the New York times obtained a draft a member of the department of health\nAnd Human Services that what you find sex as either male or female and on changeable the move would be the most significant of a series of maneuvers to exclude the estimated at one point four million Americans\nWho identify as transgender from receiving civil rights protections under the Obama administration the recognition of gender identity\nBecame more fluid as you know\nSo the Trump Administration uh gradually doing away with transgender as a sex for purposes of gaining civil rights now that has nothing to do with gay rights has to do with defining a gender\nAnd I don't know I don't know I Am\nAs you know pro gay rights and uh people want to be transgender I'm for whatever they want to be but um I don't know that this is a tough one John fragrance radio network we'll be right back stay with [noise]\nOrganized then trained and you know what to ask for when they get to our border and maybe a

the prosecutor\n[noise] uh well let me get the back part of your question the answer to that is I really don't know so I'm going to be honest about that I don't know what's up hello applies to that\nUh if people are giving food and water to the caravan or there are other sponsors supplying them with cash they need to feed themselves to go forward what how you would implicate them or\nHow you would go to a foreign country prosecute them I don't know that's certainly if that money was coming from the United states ah that that went\nBy the same way that the organ I heard is [noise] excuse me a lot of churches and God Bless them\nBut a lot of churches are taking care of these people once they get here and they're making a good little dollars off of doing that and I just wonder if the lane I'm going on in\nThe ... the people who do they like you said from the United states\nOh by the United states all\nWell know number one others or even the president said at this rally they were getting money he didn't know where from but there there's no evidence is coming from the United states doesn't mean it's not okay so let me just stop there doesn't mean it's not but there is no direct evidence right now might come out\nThis afternoon but right now\nAre there is no evidence linking to that the churches that make money off this the reason they make money is because they've set up businesses\nIn order to take the refugees in seed them close them and then they charge the government and uh they make a very tidy profit over there and got a lot of money means is this a migrant refugee illegal immigration saying\nThat people always find a way to make money off the government and so there's plenty of companies associated with plenty of church is making a lot of money off the government because they provide for the food the clothing that housing in the education and they get more than they put out so it's becoming a very profitable business for people and\nThese are short term it's right it's a very profitable business for ...\nIt's almost all going to attack on it and then [noise] and then people down south to organize the rally to bring people more than you could say it's a [laughter]\nIt's all going to have [noise] and I think we can you take 'em very close to his organizing these people whose\nFunding these people and see if there are cities organizations here in the United states than profit off of them mhm once they get here you know you're looking for illegals coming means no means made\nMake it ... Glen you make you make a very good are you making very good argument for that I mean it should get looked into now if it's being funded by drug runners and sex traffickers and other uh bad people that are have a better themselves in a caravan and if their funding it then there was not a lot that we can do about that\nAnd there's a lot of people ah who have inferred that that's where they're getting the money in order to make the track to the United states is by bad actors are\nHave access to resources that have a better themselves in the Caribbean whether it be sex traffickers drug traffickers meals if you call them uh you know there's been rumors that there's a a that there's other people from parts of the country and this caravan\nThe way that I like that it doesn't really matter who's there good bad or not it's an invasion if you enter the United states and if you let the stand if you let the stand if you let them come in\nI'm In the political pressure become such that they get in or the majority of them again in five seven thousand to get in and you you know apprehend five hundred of them\nThe next caravan is not going to be seven thousand Glen is going to be Seventy thousand and the one after that's going to be seven hundred thousand and then they're simply going to crash the United states and you can't do anything about it\nThe zero tolerance policy which was the antithesis of catch and release was put in place by the Trump Administration and Jeff Sessions in order to act\nAs a deterrent and for a short period of time it did until they have to go back to catch and release because they separate the kids from the parents and we got the CNN kids in cages headline and it all blew up and it was a PR disaster and that was the end of it\nAnd so you know there's not we have to figure this out\nAnd some kind of immigration reform in the hall and the Congress isn't going to do crap when he got seven thousand people ready to crash the poor\nThey they're going to have to figure it out thank you blend but we'll have to see how that goes for a meantime the uh the caravan is becoming an election issue the Democrats think it's going to help them they really do they think that\nThe fact that these people are coming under his mom's with babies and it goes back to the kids in cages and don't you have a hard and Trump's meaning that all the Trump supporters I mean they don't want help the kids with the base the moms with the babies are they think it's going to help them I think this is a disaster if you're the Democrats right now\nEvery day this caravan gets closer to the United states they are losing votes because people looked at this and they said the same thing I Do this is an invasion into our country\nThat we're powerless to stop powerlessness

come in and breaks our laws are just coming to the United states what what stops it next caravan from being Seventy thousand people or the one after that from being seven ... seven hundred thousand people\nI mean what would be the deterrent if they're simply allowed to\nI'm Jane I basically gained them mob status and just overwhelming is hard Eason and come in as you've seen them do in Mexico

we know\nAh the estimates are about twenty five thousand people and night are homeless in Los Angeles or sleeping under bridges and drink types that's a lot of people and San Francisco rivaling that\nAccomplishment I Want to get to what exactly do I mean I've asked this question a number of times to pose it to you also this caravan is coming they've crossed Mexico is coming the president says I'm going to stop it I might send the military there\nWe've already gone through these heroes tolerance policy and that was a public relations disaster so what I mean there's not time to enact anything in in in ... days it is going to happen you guys aren't even in section\nSo what should the president to how does he stop it like what exactly what he says I Want to send the military they close the border what does that mean\nYou can beef up the defenses in ... you know to where they started a folk pair of Maine are coming through out but more importantly we have a lot of leverage over Mexico right and back to where\nIt's got to be done to president Mexico there's already a hundreds and hundreds of law enforcement to weaken and pick off some of the folks and send them back home already and I think that's the primary Lou that's what happened last time\nAnd we come awarded they hear a number problem and so it's just it's just by the way we gotta send our own resources to send the wrong signal our that our our border is secure and and obviously you need to build a wall and put up security measures\nKind of thing can you imagine the difference if you had a world versus what we got married in ...\nIt's the fact that the left is so hard and against it is is almost the evidence itself that they know what will be a factor right if they wouldn't be a factor they just want to say good go ahead and do it [noise] but they know that would be a factor in and they don't want it so we need all the above we we have good\nA law enforcement on the books and we\nJust need to enforce

of the rain it is beautiful here showing no question about it okay we've we've got a\nWe've got some things I Want to go over I Want to start with the caravan coming here the the the ... to the United states fourteen days before the midterms short and we understand this now grown to seven thousand people the president saying or they're not going to come in is going to close the border if need be how does this play out Sean Spicer\nOn it I think it ... it ... there's a lot of things right now is going to head into the mid term elections that are sort of act very electorate is a demonstration of what the difference between the two parties are and as you see these things happen it Chris Wise is\nThe importance of this election so you saw that to some degree with cat and our people saying okay I get it this is why this is the policies and people that will come in with this administration and having a party in power\nSimilarly I think that you look at these people kind of a coming marching on up through Mexico trying to come into our border\nAnd the president in very clear about what his position is and that he's going to make sure that we are eight eight hundred law and order and it catches march on into our country if they see fit uh I don't think the Democrats clearly have that same kind of policy oriented so so you know getting back to it I think a lot of time that you get into an election\nInto our between the two parties in various candidates as you head into an election and right now it could be quicker\nSo what should ah\nWhat should the president's action thing now as they get if they if they did get through Mexico and you'd have seven thousand I mean I understand the politics of it but let's get to the policy what should the president said he's going to send the military there how would how would that work how would\nThat play and wouldn't CNN be saying okay you've got to stay in that so pointed that moms with babies that is what CNN held up\nBy you know I it it's just it's a it's actually a very complicated policy that I'll probably not the right person to get into it in the sense that there there's something about I think that you can send you the national guard a federalized are nationalized them or or utilize certain aspects of National Guard\nI there is a tricky issue between title ten and title thirty two that detail how you could use certain members of the military for domestic purposes\nBut regardless I think that the point that he's making if he couldn't figure out what it takes to do that put them along the border and make sure that people can't cross over a but there is an obligation for anyone to make sure that we're protesting for any president especially this when he's made it clear what his priorities are\nThat we protect the border and we've got to make sure that people come into our country or company so legally incorrectly and and not with not sort of [noise] uh\nI Will eat nearly an ad they see fit this is a country of laws or it's um you know people are here to seek asylum I understand that we need to make sure that it's done through with the current process\nWe're with Sean Spicer he was the former press secretary the first press secretary for President Trump and it's probably the ministry and he's also a longtime F. O. J. that means ... John's us Sean\nAnd Sean is also the author of the book called the briefing politics the press and the president which you could buy on Amazon your favorite book store or you can buy it on his Web site\nGo to Sean Spicer dot com is also a senior advisor for America first policies the number one political action committee in America that supports President Trump's America First agenda\nUp showing the show the situation and Mohamed been solving um you're in the White House at the time all a lot of our relationship with the Saudis was being discussed that was the president's first ... says it\nUh but now in a BS is really embarrassed President Trump with uh the nonsense that's done on this or what appears to be a some kind of an assassination and they're constantly\nOh what do you think the president does now if uh it's proven to be true\nAnd don't you find one NBS if he was involved in a signing off on this don't you think that was a a basically a slap in the face to the president\nI think you're absolutely right that the idea that if you're that comfortable with the relationship that you feel that you can be just pray and that that really helps you to President Trump\nYou know to begin with it but but especially with the relationship that this president is trying to find her it was Saudi\nArabia that was his first try at your calls abroad because he really wanted to try to that relationship so\nI think that the actions that have been taken and the idea that it's taken too weak or a bit ridiculous you know these guys knew from the get go how serious this was\nA debut clearly it's it's one thing when they initially claimed that they didn't know anything about it I Would talk to believe but the two weeks later they say well okay 'cause something did happen and there was a fight with that you knew that two weeks ago that this is an unbelievably insulting stall tactic\nUm and and I think that you know all the steps that they've taken has just been ... I mean the the the cleaning crew\nSending in the team um they either to explain all of this which I think it's beyond the pale of of explaining a but right now I think the president should not just look that's in terms of the relationship with Saudi Arabia but as a personal insult because\nThe idea that we treated Saudi Arabia the way that we have and he made a such an amazing gesture of respect by visiting the person in the presidency\nAnd trying to foster and strengthen the relationship we have this is how we get repaid or the president needs to be strong and tough\nI'm agreement with that show in a hundred percent I think that is spot on a ... exactly what we've been saying for some time it is insulting you there's a slap in the face and it was very disrespectful and it's kind of like hey look we're friends I've got a hundred and ten being the arms deal therefore I can do whatever I Want\nAnd I I think they're gonna find with this president that's really not the way a relationship work so\nWe'll see how that plays out she wants to myself I Want to uh I I Want to ask you about these mobs these left wing wing moms that are going around I mean in Minnesota last week or two candidates were actually assaulted two Republican candidates were assaulted by these\nBombs is going all over the United states that threads through Susan Collins and others\nAre people getting chased out of um of a role restaurants being a being chased down sub subway stairs what's the deal here\nBut look here's an interesting thing I I was really not a column last week that I'm I'm a constitutional lawyer or a scholar I Can't remember which what really positive in an interesting theory which is that what he's talking about how our constitution protects the reality is if you actually read the first amendment protects our ability to peacefully assemble\nRight and that's the key word peacefully assemble and if you think about how normally things work you need you know there's you want to go to temple and particular city and whether it's for January where else you've got to ... you got to do it and that's that's because you have a right to do it just doesn't give you an opportunity to do it where however you want to think about that because\nIt it all the action from the last against the right it is not it it we have a right to to express ourselves to we you know address our government and our elected officials don't give us a carte blanche to do it however we want and touching something threatening way here's\nThe thing that I think the bigger problem to me John not only is it happening but they're actually not a ... Japanese\nTumor all of these people who are leaders of their parties should be standing up and saying this is unacceptable you have any right to protest\nBut there is a way and I mean going into a restaurant and basically threatening someone or if they're sending their having dinner and must be clear because we're all these people on the left to go oh well they just stood in front of him one let let them try to have that kind of how you how it feels when you are surrounded by turning twenty thirty people\nCan't connect you to get out get out we're going to throw you out\n[noise] you can't tell me that that doesn't make you feel current\nAnd that's what they're doing and I just I think that the biggest thing the media is frankly a complete mess because this is happening on the right\nPeople would be calling for people's recognition why are you standing against that whatever good because they basically agree with them the folks from endangering media or alternative complicit

and his reforms he had these ambitions in dreams to some of which we shared here at the Washington Post to\nExpand the platform uh for voice is a particularly in\nOr about Saudi Arabia in the middle east\nOr to allow for the kind of open debate which he felt those countries are entitled to in people there want but their governments don't allow so I think this uh uh last October and if that's what it is which\nYou know now kind of reads like a final will and testament was not that it was a a mission statement and for what he thought the region needed and and what he still hopes to do\nHere's what we know Jamal walks into that consulate on October second and he didn't walk out\nThe Saudis to know what happened\nSo the idea that we need days and days of investigation uh and forensic work and it's ridiculous\nJust tell us what happened and in my opinion I you know in the United states government that was\nCommitted to the values that we should be standing up for it would be saying that\nWe wouldn't be sending people over the smile next to the crown prince we wouldn't be raising ridiculous series about road operators we were just saying we need the facts we need them yesterday and then we can figure out what the right policy\nAt the post in our global opinion section we are dedicated to I'm the same thing that your mom was a kid too which is\nProviding a forum for a range of voices\nAnd that can debate each other and have ideological diversity and half you know particularly if we can do that or for people who are living in countries where the governments don't allow their own press to do it\nAnd that was Jim miles vision for the middle east is why we've translated some of his pieces when our editorials into Arabic it's wire transfer some some ... pieces into Turkish you know I'm sure a\nWe will redouble our efforts in that direction and and you know we will always had them all in our mind as we do it\nKnow when you hear that music on the John hundreds

up\nAnd early voting science show that this mid term there's gonna be a record turnout is I'm not even going to be comparative to anything we've ever had record numbers of people are coming on both sides of the that's where he got to get involved\nThis election the most important ever in the mid term a lot of things are on the ballot not only Republican candidates that are going to preserve the president's economic resurgence bought tax savings that money in your pocket that's on the ballot\nWell I can assure you that we're going to follow the facts and the secretary of state received a commitment for\nInvestigation by the Saudi Government\nLeaders in just a matter of a few days [noise]\nWe won't totally rely on that information was\nThen the president and I have a decision\nYou know what has been on the edge [noise]\nWants to live in the hands of my one to be condemned the drone particular [noise]\nLost their life in the hands of violence from\nThere will be waiting for the fact

with his check our van and people coming up through Mexico's from Guatemala to get into the United states\nIllegally basically\nWanting some of your nose at old laws many people like me to see this as an invasion we don't know who makes up to seven thousand terror of an elite we know there's people that are there for economic these we also don't know what the bad actors that might be better than their what should we do in this situation\nWe should immediately deployed the military to our border and make sure not to eat when one of them get into the border I get into the United states look we know that a part of the people and the caravan members of the law for example\nMiddle Easterners or we all are very aware that for a lot has major\nOperation centers in South America\nTo train people on how to come to the United states look worn out anybody who wants to come to America we have to do is make your way to Mexico pay some money to the drug cartels and you'll be smuggled into the United states this has been going on for decades and no one president because President Trump\nHas basically put ... put down whether they are Republican or Democrat I mean this is happening under Bush\nIs what's happening under Obamacare is what's happening under Clinton had just got word especially under the Obama years so we know right now that they are operative within that caravan from people from the middle east are within that caravans trying to get into the United states\nThat many actors are trying to get into the United states who are involved in putting together in this caravan including people from within the United states from political party within the United states basically creating this whole problem right before the election\nFor any purpose but the American public has not done the American public are waking up and the American public is behind it presidents\nWho is committed to putting America First and is doing everything he can to ensure that America remains protected and safe and you know what John in a way this is good and that this is happening before this very important election we're heading do\nBecause when I was doing and it is you will not be conservatives\nAnd ... and freedom loving Americans who love this country who are concerned about this country and not just talking about Republicans are conservative I'm Talking about independence I'm Talking about these people are thinking okay we can understand about helping some people who need help you know here and there\nYou know maybe a hundred here on a hunger there\nBut the caravan upon caravan over a thousand seven thousand this caravan it's coming you cannot control your country and allow open borders with this type of gas coming into the country\nRegime let's get to what you said earlier I only get to do things the the caravan coming over and the president saying we'll give Mexico they're opposite we just heard some clips from a boat so much for the parents and Sixers they prepare their really banking on\nFifty right now whether they're going to be able to do that if they get to the border and the president does deployed meant the military obesity or whether the national guard or not in closing the border\nUm what is the risk that that becomes another PR disaster for Trump and the Republicans like changes when we went to the bureau tolerance policy how do we deal with that\nLook at low jumped mobilized the base for Trump and those who care about the country at this hope mayor look the pay anyway that left dates from the left does not want to pick your borders the left wants to open borders bring everybody in here give them I'm given shelter and giving them free it's free\nThat as a matter of fact freebies and let the rich pay for it you know what that is an old ... that's not to identify with the American public anymore\nThey they are the ones on the left fringe is the one that's making it screaming and yelling but in the last election the presidential election in twenty sixteen thought us one thing is that the decent American people who care about what America be America which was imprisoned by our founding fathers\nWant change will

very upset by otherwise that have come out of the Saudi embassy again\nUm yeah I had a couple callers earlier that really questioning like why are you know who cares and it doesn't matter what his Muslim Brotherhood\nThe Turkish government but you have to really understand that's why it to me and you have to understand what's going on here and uh Sean Spicer said the same thing day brat said the same thing uh this is a slap in the face\nTo President Trump and you just sort of spice or an hour ago who was there in Saudi Arabia\nWhen the president made his first trip I chose to go to Saudi Arabia is his first trip in order to build a relationship\nThat they basically took for granted and put the president now we're very awkward position and so it's a trust issue and the problem with NBS says he's thirty three years old she this is why you have a war the United states like like you can't be president until you're thirty five\nTo thirty three years old the Geron pushed her is thirty three years old that's why you can't be president three thirty five you you know you're just is a maturity issue and you know what they did and they're sending these operatives in and\nSomebody coming
