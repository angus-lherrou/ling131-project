don't know if that's because I've never seen anything like that aspect on what's the solution to that because we disagree with the right in the last tapes the right\nRight ... the last one who he was a country\nWe're gonna we're gonna [laughter]\nHe ended up\nGetting the big one [noise]\nThat we can\nEat it [laughter]\nYou\nCan eat what you really\nGet into media really care about\nPeople you know [noise]\nIt was before that [noise]\n\nNetwork drug across America there's one Godzilla the truth and that to me it's great to have you with us today well the fake news regarded again with fake polls coming at you all over the place they make these pulled up to drive a\nAfter that I thought the Cory Booker thing was odd today because look like okay so it's getting out of the news cycle and now we get another one right I don't\nKnow I just I don't know that some crazy person doing it but it just seems awfully odd to me here's\nThe thing is the Democrats the Schumer is the the whole crowd that whole mob over there that were screaming\nWe must have the FBI investigate before we can vote on Kavanaugh there must be a full investigation before we can vote on him before we can decide whether he should be you know we send to the Supreme Court right the same mob is saying we must have an FBI investigation before we can let that happen [noise]\nThey're not even waiting for the FBI to investigate where the bombs are coming from before they start blaming President Trump declared President Trump guilty responsible for the whole thing they're not waiting for the FBI to investigate these are the same people that three weeks ago\nSaid we cannot do anything until the FBI finishes its investigation\nSo I mean they were total hypocrites it it is absolutely irresponsible or beyond counterproductive it's it's absolutely you're responsible for them to be saying this is all about because of the President Trump uh they're they're trying they're trying to score political points off this which\nYou have to ask who benefits from these bombs that's all I'm not saying who did it it it's obviously some crazy person because no sane person inside the bombs or\nCrackers put it in a in a in the toilet paper tube\nAnd a ... a attached to a digital watch to to make it look like a scary thing we don't know it's Halloween time it's easy to scare people what can I tell you\nWe don't know and I'm not going to go down that road where I can say is whoever did it is crazy in one way or another whether they're sort of fire bleed can be committed to an institution crazy or just ... they've got a screw loose you don't do that kind of normal people\nWell adjusted people don't do that okay by definition\nPat Buchanan has a column out today very makes the point that when John Kennedy was assassinated Lee Harvey Oswald who defected to the Soviet Union was pro Cuba\nUh he was found to be the shooter or yet who got blamed for the John birth society and all the conservatives so there's not the first time that\nThe guilt by association or let's let's let's slammed the conservatives let's blame everything on conservatives not the first time it's been done before we even know who actually sent these packages so\nIt's a everybody's got to calm down take a breath and ah I think Sarah Sanders had it right\nWe should be coming together the president is calling for unity dialing down the rhetoric\nAnd the Democrats are going in the opposite direction they're they're they're blaming the president unequivocally no question about it taking responsibility whatsoever\nFor calling the guy look at this guy Brennan said the president's guilty of treason what's the what's the penalty for treason death he's basically a former head of the CIA had been out they're\nCalling for the president to be hung by the neck until dead and this is not considered inflammatory rhetoric or it's it it's disgusting the whole thing is just just hypocritical each people will go down as the all time greatest hypocrites\nSomething a Curtis I\nI think you make a great analogy on the depression and other Democrats who cried and screen than wind about Kavanaugh not getting the FBI not investigating everything I mean why don't we just waiting here I mean the FBI seems to be home again\nIn southern Florida they're going to come up with a report from you know we're we're we're going to find out the answer and why not just wait\nExactly how about everybody say calm down let's we got we we have the FBI on the case unless this guy was a or gal or or or bought or whatever [laughter] whatever entered the it was that created these packages\nUnless that entity was a very very very sophisticated person\nOr a boat and by it and if they were very sophisticated they were able to cover their tracks but considering the number of packages delivered to these various places\nFor them that the FBI will be able to figure something out here and find out who did it for narrow it down\nThe fact that they use Debbie Wasserman Schultz as a return address that kind of interesting in itself Debbie Wasserman Schultz is the one who was forced to step down\nFrom head to the Democratic National Committee\nOr because she had been reading the system for Hillary against Bernie I don't know what that means but it's sort of an interesting clue you know maybe somebody thought that was funny to use her name out all these bombs I don't know\nUh but my point is that unless this was a very sophisticated operation that they knew how to cover their tracks at every step of the way you've got twelve packages now\nThat the FBI is investigating it let's wait for the FBI to figure this out to come up with something yeah why not wait before you start\nA and and why not why are they not waiting because they want to politicize it\nThe Democrats are missing no opportunity to score political points on this\nWell it's uh it it seems to it it just seems odd to me that at all this is happening but luckily I mean that's where everybody's saying let's wait time let's get to get the economy will get to the Taliban invasion after the bottom of the hour a\nBut let's get to the new economic numbers that just came out the gross domestic product GDP growing another three and a half percent now let me just say what this means right that's the first time that we have had\nBack to back quarter a in a\nLong time of of of over three and a half percent growth back to back and consumer confidence uh up at an all time I can do for spending was four percent another great a\nQuarter of economic growth and this is more bad news for the damage they don't want to talk about that that they don't talk about the economy or jobs or the gross so what did they talk about\nHow they talk about all they talk about they've got this wonderful thing to talk about this horrible thing to talk about here with the with the bombs and they talk about the president the again they're falling in they don't realize they're falling into a trap and and it's their own trap a trap of their own making\nPeople don't want to hear the Democrats talk about the president they want to hear Democrats Republicans the politicians in Washington talk about what they're what the politicians are going to do for them to make their life better write\nWhat I I I go to work every day I got a family to support\nI got a job I'd like to get a raise what are you going to do to make that happen how are you gonna make my life better easier make me rich uh make make make my kids you know healthier\nTalking about President Trump talking about you're a Native American DNA doesn't do that [laughter]\nI wouldn't do that\nDo that so going back to the for the last two years older than talking about as President Trump is a Russian agent and now they're President Trump as a Russian agent who creates bomb scares I mean they're they're not doing themselves any favors\n[noise] on the other side I mean it is very clear jobs no jobs President Trump and the Trump Administration has created the best economic conditions in this country in in a generation the best we've seen in ten Twenty years\nAnd that is a long way that\nAnswers peoples' questions what have you done for me lately you got me a job you've gotten your ways you've gotten my kids on food stamps got kicked out of the basement there now great thank you very much\n[noise] pose questions answered when I get back so stay with us for another thing when you got to get the bottom of the hour but\nWhen you get where Trump Tower for the last two weeks of the joke was like all over again I mean [laughter] I mean\nI could go back to the scene and it's the same thing we're only speak for everybody to Trump couldn't when it was it was you know whatever it was that he was going through at the time with all the way it was that we're going to be right back I'll go way\nThese are the Trump supporters these are the people coming out of the woodwork coming out of the hills coming out of the bally's coming out of town is coming out of earth's farms coming to vote for Trump they've never voted before\nAnd uh so yeah there is a feeling of danger here all of these national generic ballot polls are meaningless because there's not a national election\nOther they're all like I mean it's all the calls I I've been talking all day about the Washington Post poll that came out yesterday that shows Jennifer West and they\nHad a Barbara Comstock are getting a sense just replace Thirteen look like in my way and she said she's a favorite no doubt that's a very tough district for the Republicans can win barb is tough\nBut every internal poll that the Republicans have from the White House in the end our ceasing to Barbara on down shows the race to watch that not have a Thirteen point but this is what the Washington Post jobs they get a uh\nThey get a ridiculous methodology to get a state polls get a fake analysis of it to do fake news to get a bank conclusion drawn so they could take narrative and like we've already been down this path so now I'm going to start calling them on how ridiculous it isn't there it's the same\nNow by the way you're on

with President Trump he doesn't like being lied to here's the other thing that they're like dealing with incompetent people he doesn't have a lot of patience\n\nAnd I'm telling you crown prince\n\nMohammed bin Salman is incompetent everything the guy at thirty three years old has gotten involved in has been a complete undone mitigated\nDisaster for the Saudi kingdom so eventually the

show was brutally murdered it's clear that it was premeditated it's clear that uh that\nI said I think have a lot to answer for and I think they have to be held accountable [noise] so I Do think that there has to be significant penalties\nThat they suffer I Do think the question has to be asked is like does the United states believes that\nIt can carry on a continued relationship with Saudi Arabia which I Do think we need to but can that be with the crown prince I I think that's a pretty compelling question I think the administration is going to have to ask that I think Congress will eventually addressed that an asset to you know what will be the penalties are\nTo uh to Saudi Arabia I listen I understand the impact of those of those contracts for what we're doing\nJust supply a military uh equipment to Saudi Arabia I I\nThink Saudi Arabia I can be a like a a force on that is is a is a is an ally to us in the in the middle east but I don't think that it can it can be that\nType of ally that we want him that we need to you if this is how they're going to operate I mean we have ... you know we have principles in the United states that we that we stand by\nAnd our allies have to have to abide by those in I just don't see Saudi Arabia doing that you know you you're pointing out the issue with Yemen too and you and I have talked about that before a those are all questions I think they've come up and how\nWe see Saudi Arabia operating under each have their policy is being played out and are are they are they doing the things mass hysteria\nIn that region that create stability and that\nAnd that are working in the in the best interest of all involved not just Saudi Arabia but ah other allies in the middle east and listen I I I understand what they're doing that to push back against the Iranian\nBut are are they doing things that in the long term about moving the middle east at the right direction I think those are questions that we have to ask them up or foreign policy standpoint and I think that U.S policy toward Saudi Arabia\nYou know needs to needs to be directed by those I think very I'm very sobering issues that we had before us\nSo there's like congressman Whitman a we're told agreement and it seems like what you're saying is the best way to solve this is a four crown prince\nMPs will hammered than solving to maybe a step aside for\nSomeone else had his

Yemeni civil war and backing the Saudi\nCoalition yes or no\nI'm John I I I I Can't can't predict\nBecause I don't know where the discussion is going to go over all with Saudi Arabia but I Would say that it will it will be part of the debate in Congress about what our policy is I Wish Saudi Arabia and conflict there in Yemen are they going to go more information\nBiggest election midterm election

read the paper you got the fake news you've got fake\nPolls and we just had a fake poll yesterday from the Washington Post it's unbelievable I mean the Washington Post like when did they can learn\nLike they don't want our people say well what are they going to change the polling methodology to get it right never because they didn't want to get it right because it's not about\nAccurate poll it's about the poll driving fake news to get a fake narrative to draw the conclusion that's all it is it's all on the Washington Post\nActually putting out a poll yesterday actually putting out a poll showing Barbara Comstock\nTrailing Jennifer ... than in the ... district by Thirteen points now there is no way that western has a Thirteen\nPoint lead over ... recounts like every internal poll that I have seen on top stock every internal poll that his pay four and a lot of money showed this race a dead heat or cops are slightly ahead\nIn the Washington Post has got Comstock down\nBy Thirteen this is a complete and utter lie\nIn his fianc fake news and it's beyond the onion it's beyond the national\nEnquirer what they try to do they hate tops not so much they want that seat so bad they want the liberals do nothing Jennifer watched them they're so\nThey can taste it they want their\nLeft us in that seat so much that they will actually conducted a poll make things up do it in such a way to get a result that they want so they could put it out there and say the races over don't get ... cops are getting money and don't work for her\nIt's a lost cause so they do have the pole in order to do think it's unbelievable nobody in that district is gonna look you in the eye and say the same thing a general Washington as a Thirteen point lead this race is tied\nThink Comstock is gonna win for the Washington Post started to care do not own up to any of this and neither one of the New York times or ABC\nNews or anything or MSNBC or any of the polling companies that are in cahoots with a fake news and that's what they are so it's it's ... it's the fake news network and it's designed to drive\nA conclusion to make you not want to do anything to help\nHer if you're in the tent district go volunteer for cops like she is going to win this race if you get out and help her\nPresident says it's fake news editor he says it's an enemy of the people when you walk out of the people and masquerading as a legitimate news networks with a legitimate poll is not an enemy how would you define that\n\nThis poll for the poster so\nAstronaut that even westerns most staunchest supporters think it's a joke\nBecause they know it's not true so what are we just let me just ask you a question\n\nIf they're putting out purposely putting out the information driving it so that the snake is that not\nThe people it's certainly an hey it's an enemy the truce maybe the president needs to change one where it's an enemy of the truth it's certainly an enemy of fact\nIt is unbelievable they're doing it again\nThey did it in two thousand sixteen and they're doing it again things you learn nothing you know when the Democrats have to learn nothing from two thousand sixteen the legacy media has learned nothing in fact what they're doing now is they can't believe they were wrong\nAnd so they're doubling down and here's the thing if the Republicans don't relinquish the house\nThe legacy media after two elections in a row going all aimed for the Democrats and losing them both on a federal level will become irrelevant this one of the structure of them are so high there'll be come relevant\nI'm\nGood I certainly tell you the truth 'cause ... roughly\nThey'll become a relevant they are doubling and tripling down a moral ah\nOn more fishing poles and more fake news again to drive the result they want I don't like to date again and it's going to backfire on them and get\n\nI mean they actually think that somebody semi pipe bombs that don't go off at like how to change the trajectory the election\nMaybe get a life\nWe're going to get an economic report coming\nForty five minutes that are going to show another over four percent GDP Growth\nAnd their banking on hatred of the Trump and somebody sending pipe bombs or don't go wash targeted at Democrats had already been influencing anything right now it's very bizarre it's very the whole thing is very suspicious and it's very bizarre\n\nRight now if you're a national Democrat here's what you have to deal with mobs and caravans and you're running against Republicans who are for jobs and country bombs versus jobs and

things and also I also finding amazing that lately issues have taken a backseat on co burns campaign now it's all personal it's taken Halloween pictures from my face look now\nShe's doubled down you know now it's not big for that you know they're trying to portray me as crazy based on I guess Halloween costumes and you know me John I have a good time so if they it's just it's amazing that last week here pretty much apologizes for marginalizing veterans\nSays she's going to stick to the issues then she puts out a commercial or calling me an extremist and trying to make fabricated things up again this is what the left does\nTheir own hands it's desperate ploy by desperate candidates and that's why common sense is back that's why I conservatism and fat and that's why I'm going to win the fifth\nCommonsense backing commander of commonsense Dennis ... without running\nFor Congress that's just drink Virginia let's get to the caravan I'm the president with my later today saying he's going to deploy a thousand troops you've\nGot to do a series of executive orders that wanted to stop the caravan from\nComing into the United states the problem is as soon as they stepped foot and say the word asylum we can't do anything are lower than the loopholes\nIn Denver are written in such a way that all they have to do was get a job when get their hand grabbed and say asylum and then we can't do anything they cannot do back what are you seeing the\nPresident's proposed action here if you're in\nCongress now what would Denver Riggleman the proposing on the air that\nYou know we're a rule of law and uh we're we're we're a nation of laws and we believe in the rule of law and the way the laws were written right now you're exactly right John I don't know you know how we we don't honor that based on what we believe us conservatives in rural and and people who follow the road while however\nI think Congress needs to start fixing is immigration laws as soon as possible\nAnd I also believe once that happens are vetting process for any of these people that are coming through has to be extreme vetting\nUh we do have some of the technology in place now\nBut we don't put time limits on this if there's that many people are that are headed\nTowards the border or we don't know what's in better than those in John my biggest fear um it's easy you know it's like a Trojan Horse right listen Ninety five percent Ninety nine percent of those people could actually be seeking asylum um does that you know our hearts sort of go out\nTo ... with compassion however\nWithin this caravan we have to a fair amount and my guess is this going to be sending some pretty healthy intelligence assets down range\nI think we're going to be monitoring and my guess is I can only speculate right now my guess is what I've joined operations with Mexico on monitoring this caravan of seeing any type of emissions that are coming out of there talking about radio emissions or any kind of been told that we can blame\nThis is not a good situation this is not good and at some point I think we have to fix or immigration laws in a way that again are are\nMuch more common sense than the sort of as sort of ridiculous since we have now are going on on the border\nUm uh the\nI think the concern that everyone has Denver is that okay there's twelve or Thirteen or fourteen thousand people we have to deal with it and\nUh everybody wants to be concerned everybody's concerned about\nThe humanitarian aspect but a lot of my course here's what they're concerned with okay if they get in the Seventeen thousand to get then the next one's going to be a hundred and fifty thousand and you're not gonna be able to stop that either of because we'll never get a wall up in time and even if you have a wall you got a hundred and fifty thousand people that it's just a lot of people [noise]\nSo um are you in favor of the\nPresident taking action now to stop these are this a mob caravan\nFrom bomb rushing the border and coming in are you in favor of\nStopping them from coming here now\nYes yes I mean it's this is the I mean this is a matter of national security or it is a matter of precedent\nUm and again this comes back to it was a normal American will say hey\nYou know we understand people want to come to the United states but there is a legal process [noise] um and we're going to have to we're going to have the legal process you know we we think that legal process needs to be applied all immigrants and you and you're exactly right John this would set a precedent that could really be damaging to the United states' security\nTo our policies into our rule of law uh you're right if the if we allow everybody in we're actually sort of acknowledging that open borders is what we want if we don't follow the rule of law and we don't stop these is a migrant sadly we we have to stop him now from coming in and set a precedent Denver\nUh but uh in about five or ten minutes the U.S government is going to release the new economic numbers or GDP expected to grow again this quarter at so over for for that could be four\nPoint one four points to four point three a bomb in China me was chugging along in about a half percent growth I mean this growth unprecedented where do you look for in that report\nIn ... which can close and you think you might draw out of it on the economy general recommend\nWell the thing up first I'm going to look for [laughter] and it's just because I'm\nA geek out on the stuff is I'm going to look at the specific whatever report that I have I Want to look at the number of jobs are based on that are open right now and I look at Virginia but I also see where we are going as far as unemployment but GDP Growth I'm going to look at manufacturing I'm look at agriculture I Love looking into the numbers this year that grow there's an\nNine years if we're continuing with Los minority unemployment in for continuing with GDP Growth four percent of every quarter which you know is amazing ah it's a new normal was too I mean this is pretty incredible\nIf you're looking at all these numbers I think right now what you're saying is that the tax cuts were other jobs reform act worse\nOpportunities zones can be lovers here in the in the commonwealth a ... and opportunities on investment all the things that we look at to encourage opt entrepreneurship to encourage people keeping their own money is working and that's what I'm going to look at it this report is is this just a continuation\nOf this amazing amazing search or are we seeing and even more positive future for the people enough that district but also in the United states and then the commonwealth of Virginia\nI think we are I think you're just seeing the beginning of this economic boom and um I I'm really just really excited to see what those numbers say based on what job growth on what sectors are growing right now\n[noise] well it's going to be interesting to see these are coming out momentarily we expect that that we're going to get over four percent growth and it's really really tough for a Democrat\nRight now to talk about economics the economy or any of the issues that pertain to job and prosperity in America so they'd rather talk about something else that's why your opponent lovely Coburn is talking about your Halloween costume\nBecause he doesn't want to talk about the economy she doesn't want to talk about job she doesn't want to talk about growth didn't want to talk about kids moving out of the basement she doesn't want to talk about the boom and small business\nThat she doesn't want to talk about the deregulation she doesn't want to talk about the number of investments that are going on because of the tax\nCut especially as it relates to one hundred percent deduction of capital investments you didn't even understand it and so she doesn't want to talk about any any of that she'd rather talk about your Halloween costume in two thousand five\nYeah and I mean which I Will not take down off and that by the way here's what you would rather talk about she'd rather talk about forty million dollars in spending not only for Medicare for all but also for forgiving student debt right which is one point for a trillion dollars right now free community college for our free college for all\nEverything she had an even a debate she was like I Want to give away this she doesn't understand the taxpayer money is what you're using I get so limited based on what I fought for\nYou know in government overreach she says she loves government I fear government I think government should be limited I think government should be a fish and she's also the taxpayer money for the middle class is nothing more than confetti\nShe's compared eyes to the Nazis\nI mean I I find it's stunning John get anybody would vote for Leslie\nHer views are great for San Francisco and maybe a three square mile area there or somewhere up in Georgetown right in DC\nBut for the fifth district it's absolutely appalling\nThat she thinks these values are actually applicable to the people the fare if not every day and work for a living and don't give a rat's with the chattering class is saying on CNN or MSNBC or any of these other far left\nAnd that they are now they're just they're just propaganda machines and I think at some point ah that's going to break through that you have comments you have this coalition of common sense\nAgainst progressive ... and I think that's what's happening in the ...\n\nAnd that's why we're going to win\nI Wonder if you've ever being\n[noise] on this morning in\nA limited or\nNo no I don't ever\nShore positive no doubt absolutely don't worry about it when for the Democrats [noise] now it's slipping away by the very our\nIt's slipping away Republicans in swing districts in Congress those that were tied are moving ahead those that were slightly behind are moving the tide everything is moving in the ... direction or the Republicans were going to get the jobs report I jobs they economic report\nOut today momentarily out given your ... soon as they get it off the wire\nMore economic

headquarters\nLadies out what what do you make of the fact that we've heard a lot of voice in the last uh Seventy two hours or so where people say well yeah of course uh somebody who's male the Christians packages and you can blame Donald Trump for his rhetoric [noise]\nWhat do you have to understand\nWhat they do they ended up playing them you know when they get one\nLast year when they got in the streets in a little dog was barking when in fact we think that they say [noise] supported the days\nWhen you when\nWant to [noise] you you understand this is merely the are being used to\nHang up and I need some golf balls and\nPlayed it you know the United states has used tough rhetoric\nThey\nStay the\nKnow\nThe counter culture [laughter] that way you\nCan listen to that because we've seen this political season and I don't know that's that's because I'd never witnessed anything like that back on what's the solution to that because we disagree with the right and left hates\nRight ... Selassie [noise] what are we here in the country and when we when\n[laughter] yeah he is quite\nNine state\nThen we get housing that's right [laughter]\n[laughter]\nYou know\nYou can eat or if you really\nMedia really care about\nPeople you know [noise]\nIt was just for that [noise]\n\n\nTried and convicted and found and all that stuff but what happens after that I thought the Cory Booker thing was odd today I think it was like okay so it's getting out of\nThe news cycle and now we get another one right I don't\nKnow I just I I don't know if there's some crazy person doing it but it seems awfully odd to me here's\nThe thing is the Democrats the Schumer is the the whole crowd that whole mob over there they were screaming we must have the FBI\nInvestigate before we can vote on Kavanaugh there must be a full investigation before we can vote on him before we can decide whether he should be you know to send to the Supreme Court right\nThe same mob you're saying we must have an FBI investigation before we can let that happen [noise]\nThey're not even waiting for the FBI to investigate worthy bombs are coming from before they start blaming President Trump declared President Trump guilty responsible for the whole thing they're not waiting for the FBI to investigate these are the same people there are three weeks ago said we cannot do anything until the FBI finishes its investigation [noise]\nSo I mean they were total hypocrites it it is absolutely the responsible or beyond the counter productive it's it's absolutely you're responsible for them to be saying this is all about because of President Trump\nUh they're they're trying they're trying to score political points off this which you have to ask who benefits from these bombs that's all I'm not saying\nSame person sending bombs or fake bombs through the mail we don't have the bombs are real are fake or\nThey emptied out some firecrackers put it in a in the toilet paper two and a ... a attacks for digital watch to it to make it look like a scary thing we don't know it's Halloween time it's\nEasy to scare people what can I tell you we don't know and I'm not going to go down that road what I can say is whoever did it is crazy in one way or another whether they're sort of fire bleed can be committed to an institution crazy or just that they've got a screw loose you don't do that kind of normal people\nWell adjusted people don't do that okay by definition\nYou're turning out of the column today very makes the point that when John Kennedy was assassinated Lee Harvey Oswald who defected to the Soviet Union was pro Cuba\nOr he was found to be the shooter or yet who got blamed for the John birth society and all the conservatives so\nThis is not the first time that the guilt by association or let's let's let's slammed the conservative let's blame everything on conservatives not the first time it's been done before we even know who actually sent these packages so\nIt's a everybody's gotta calmed down take a breath and ah I think Sarah Sanders had it right we should be coming together the president is calling for unity dialing down their rhetoric\nA and the Democrats are going in the opposite direction they're they're they're blaming the president unequivocal early no question about it taking no responsibility whatsoever\nFor calling the guy look at this guy Brennan said the president's guilty of trees and what's the what's the penalty for treason death he's basically a former\nHead of the CIA had been out they're calling for the president to be hung by the neck until dad and this is not considered inflammatory rhetoric I it's it it's disgusting the whole thing is just just hypocritical these people will go down as\nThe all time greatest hypocrites\nJust asking something a Curtis I I think you make a great analogy on the depression and that's how the Democrats to cry and screamed and whine about Kavanaugh\nNot getting the FBI not getting everything I mean why don't we just wait here I mean the FBI seems to be home again in southern Florida they're going to come up with a report for you know we're we're we're going to find out the answer I mean why not just wait\nExactly how about everybody say calm down let's we got we we have the FBI on the case unless this guy was a or gal or or or bought or whatever [laughter] whatever entered the it was that created these packages unless\nThat entered see was a very very very sophisticated person\nOr a boat and by it and if they were very sophisticated they were able to cover their tracks\nTo these various places coming out of one place there are a lot of clues there and I'm confident that the FBI will be able to figure something out here and find out who did it or narrow it down and the fact that they use Debbie Wasserman Schultz as return address\nThat's kind of interesting in itself Debbie Wasserman Schultz who's the one who was forced to step down\nFrom head of the Democratic National Committee\nA because she had been rigging the system for Hillary against Bernie I don't know what that means but it sort of an interesting clue you know maybe somebody thought that was funny to use her knee modeled these bombs [noise] I don't know\nUh but my point is is unless this was a very sophisticated operations that they knew a how to cover their tracks at every step of the way\nYou've got twelve packages now that the FBI is investigating it let's wait for the FBI to figure this out to come up with something yeah why not wait before you start\nA and and why not why are they not waiting because they want to politicize or the Democrats are missing no opportunity to score political points out miss\nWell it uh it it seems that it it just seems odd to me that that all this is happening but let's wait I mean that's what everybody is saying let's wait time let's get to get the economy will get to the Taliban and they didn't happen to the bottom of the hour a\nBut let's get to the new economic numbers that just came out the gross\nDomestic product GDP growing another three and a half percent now let me just say what this means right this is the first time that we have had\nBack to back quarter a in a very long time of of of over three and a half percent growth back to back and consumer confidence uh up at an all time I can see we're spending ... percent another\nGreat a quarter of\nEconomic growth this is more bad news for them they don't want to talk about that that they don't want to talk about the economy or jobs or the growth so what did they talk about\nHow are they talking well they talk about they've got this wonderful thing to talk about this horrible thing to talk about here with the with the bombs and they talk about the president's seat again they're falling in they don't realize they're falling into a trap and and it's their own drop a trap of their own making\nPeople don't want to hear the Democrats talk about the president they want to hear [noise] Democrats Republicans the politicians in Washington talk about what they're what the politicians are going to do for them to make their life better write what I I I go to work every day\nI got a family to support I got a job I'd like to get a raise what are you going to do to make that happen how are we going to make my life better easier make me rich uh may make make my kids you know healthier talking about President Trump talking about\nDo that\nPresident Trump causing the bomb scare\nDoesn't do that so going back to the for the last two years old I've been talking about is President Trump is an agent and now they're President Trump as a Russian agent who creates bomb scares I mean they're they're not doing themselves any favors\nA [noise] on the other side I mean it is very clear jobs no jobs a President Trump and the Trump Administration has created the best economic conditions in this country in in a generation the best we've seen in ten Twenty years\nAnd that is goes a long way that\nAnswers peoples' questions what have you done for me lately you got me a job you've gotten me a raise you've gotten my kids all the food stamp gotten my kids out of the basement there on their own now great thank you very much\nSomething I'm going to pose questions\nTo answer when I get back so stay with us for another thing when you got to get the bottom of the hour but um\nWhen you get back you know you and I were Trump Tower for the last week job you'll see almost like deja vu all over again I mean [laughter]\nI mean I could shut my eyes go back to sixteen and it's the same thing we're only take out everybody Trump credit\nWhen it was all it was you know whatever it was that he was going through at the time with the Access Hollywood there was never going to be right back I'll go way\nAnd uh so yeah it is there is a feeling of danger here all of these national generic ballot polls are meaningless because there's not a national election\nOr they're they're all like I mean it's all the calls I I've been talking all day about the Washington Post poll that came out yesterday that shows Jennifer ... that had a Barbara Comstock genius Ted district like Thirteen look like they might when she said she's a favorite no doubt that the very top side just for Republicans to win barbecue\nEvery internal poll that the Republicans have from the White House\nTo the or the scene to Barbara on down shows the race like that not have a Thirteen points but this is what the Washington Post jobs they get a uh they get a ridiculous methodology to get a Saint Paul get a steak and now all of it\nTo use fake news to get a bank inclusion drawn so they continue on with their fake narrative and like we've been\nDown this path so now I'm going to start calling them on how ridiculous that they just say no\nThat's why the way you're on the John triggers radio network I\nAm your God of the truth in America where eleven days out to the biggest
