somebody who's male suspicious packages and you can blame Donald Trump for his writer [noise]\nWhat do you have to understand that operate when they do it they try to blame them\nYou know they didn't

know if that's because I'd never witnessed anything like that but on what's the solution to that because we disagree with the right the last tapes the ride\nWriting the last one of the country when we when we\nHave to learn how\nTo be at the\nBeginning to see it like\nThen we can ask me\nEat [laughter]\nIllusion\nYou can eat or did you really\nCan really be American you\nKnow even just the new poor [noise]\n\n\nOr there was one of the truth to that to me it's great to have you with us today with a fake news regarded again with fake polls coming at you all over the place they make these pulled up to drive a fake narrative don't believe that it's the same thing they did it two thousand sixteen they're doubling down they wanted to press\nAnd convicted and sound and all that stuff about ... months after that I thought the Cory Booker thing was odd today because I was like okay so it's getting out of the news cycle and now we get another one right\nNow I just I I don't know if there's some crazy person doing it but it just seems awfully odd to me here's\nThe thing is the Democrats the Schumer is the the whole crowd that whole mob over there there were screaming\nWe must have the FBI investigate before we can vote on Kavanaugh there must be a full investigation before we can vote on him before we can decide whether he should uh be you know send to the Supreme Court like\nLet's say mom just saying we must have an FBI investigation before we can let that happen [noise]\nThey're not even waiting for the FBI to investigate where the bombs are coming from before they start blaming President Trump declared President Trump guilty responsible for the whole thing they're not waiting for the FBI to investigate the same people that three weeks ago said we cannot do anything until the FBI finishes its investigation [noise]\nSo I mean they were total hypocrites it it is absolutely irresponsible beyond counterproductive it's it's absolutely you're responsible for them to be saying this is all about because of the President Trump\nUh they're they're trying they're trying to score political points off this which\nYou have to ask who benefits from these bombs that's all I'm not saying who did it it it's obviously some crazy person because no sane person\nThey emptied out some firecrackers put it in a in a in the toilet paper two\nAnd a a attached to a digital watch to it to make it look like a scary thing we don't know it's Halloween time it's easy to scare people what can I tell you\nWe don't know and I'm not going to go down that road where I can say is whoever did it is crazy in one way or another whether they're sort of fire bleed can be committed to an institution crazy or just ... they've got a screw loose you don't do that kind of normal people\nWell adjusted people don't do that okay by definition\nPat Buchanan out of the column out today very makes the point that when John Kennedy was assassinated Lee Harvey Oswald who defected to the Soviet Union was pro Cuba\nUh he was found to be the shooter a yet who got blamed for the John birth society and all the conservatives so\nThis is not the first time that the guilt by association or let's let's let's slammed the conservative let's blame everything on conservatives not the first time it's been done before we even know who actually sent these packages so\nIt's a everybody's got to calm down take a breath and ah I think Sarah Sanders had it right we should be coming together the president is calling for unity dialing down the rhetoric\nAnd the Democrats are going in the opposite direction they're they're they're blaming the president unequivocal early no question about it taking responsibility whatsoever for calling the guy look at this guy Brennan\nThe president's guilty of trees and what's the what's the penalty for treason deaf he's basically a former\nHead of the CIA had been out they're\nCalling for the president to be hung by the neck until dead and this is not considered inflammatory rhetoric I it's it's disgusting the whole thing it's just just hypocritical and people will go down in the ... and the all time great is hypocrites\nItself to something a Curtis I I think you make a great analogy the depression and other Democrats who cried and screen than wind about cabinet\nGetting the FBI now that message getting everything I mean why don't we just wait here I mean the FBI thinks the horn again and southern part of the guy to come up with a report from so we're we're we're going to find out the answer why not just wait\nRight exactly how about everybody said calmed down let's we got we we have the FBI on the case unless this guy was a or gal or or or bought or whatever [laughter] whatever entity it was they created these packages\nAnd less that entity was a very very very sophisticated person\nOr a boat and by it and if they were very sophisticated they were able to cover their tracks but considering the number of packages delivered\nClues there and I'm confident that the FBI will be able to figure something out here and find out who did it or narrow it down and the fact that they use Debbie Wasserman Schultz as return address\nThat's kind of interesting in itself Debbie Wasserman Schultz is the one who was forced to step down\nFrom head of the Democratic National Committee\nA because she had been reading the system for Hillary against burning I don't know what that means but it sort of an interesting clue you know maybe somebody thought that was funny to use her name on all of these bombs [noise] I don't know\nUh but my point is this unless this was a very sophisticated operation that\nThey knew how to cover their tracks at every step of the way you've got twelve packages now that the FBI is investigating it let's wait for the FBI to figure this out to come up with something yeah why not wait before you start\nA and and why not why are they not waiting because they want to politicize it the the Democrats are missing no opportunity to score political points on this\nWell it's uh it it seems it seems to me that that all this is happening but let's wait I mean that's what everybody's saying let's wait time let's get to let's get the economy will get to the Taliban invasion after the bottom of the hour a\nBut let's get to the new economic numbers that just came out the gross domestic product GDP growing another three and a half percent now let me just say what this means right that's the first time that we have had back to back quarter a in a\nLong time of of of over three and a half percent growth back to back and consumer confidence uh up at an all time I can do for spending without one percent and now they're great a quarter of\nGrowth and this is more bad news for the dams they don't want to talk about this that they don't want to talk about the economy or jobs or the gross so what did they talk about\nThey talk about all they talk about they've got this wonderful thing to talk about this horrible thing to talk about here with the with the bombs and they talk about the president again they're falling in they don't realize they're falling into a trap and and it's their own drop a trap of their own making\nPeople don't want to hear for Democrats talk about the president they want to hear Democrats or Republicans the politicians in Washington talk about what they're what the politicians are going to do for them to make their life better write\nWhat I I I go to work every day I got a family to support\nI got a job I'd like to get a raise what are you going to do to make that happen how are we going to make my life better easier make me rich uh make make make my kids you know healthier\nTalking about President Trump talking about you're a Native American DNA doesn't do that [laughter]\nBomb scare\nDoesn't do that so going back to the for the last two years old I've been talking about as President Trump is a Russian agent and now they're President Trump as a Russian agent who Craig creates bomb scares I mean they're they're not doing themselves any favors\nAnd on the other side I mean it burns very clear jobs no jobs a President Trump and the Trump Administration have created the best economic conditions in this country in in a generation it's the best we've seen in ten Twenty years\nAnd that goes along the way that\nAnswers peoples' questions what have you done for me lately we've got a job you've gotten me a raise you've gotten my kids or food stamps got kicked out of the basement there on their own now great thank you very much\nOr something I'm going to pose this question to answer it when it gets back so stay with us for another thing when you got to get the bottom of the hour but uh\nWhen you get back you know word Trump Tower for the last week so they can't do the same it's almost like deja vu all over again I mean [laughter]\nI mean I could shut my eyes and go back to you again and it's the same thing we're only about everybody tell Trump credit when it was all it was all whatever it was that he was going through at the time with the Access Hollywood stay with us that we're going\nPeople coming out of the woodwork coming out of the hills coming out of the valleys coming out of the town was coming out of the farms coming to vote for Trump they've never voted before\nAnd uh so yeah it is there is a feeling of danger here all of these national generic ballot polls are meaningless there's not a national election\nOr they're they're all like I mean it's all the calls I I've been talking all day about the Washington Post poll that came out yesterday that shows Jennifer ... that had a barber comp or junior ... district like Thirteen look like in my way and she should choose the favorite no doubt that's a very tough a district for the Republicans don't when Barbara\nEvery internal poll that the Republicans have from the White House to the at our ceasing to Barbara down shows that race why does not have a Thirteen points but this is what the Washington Post jobs they get a uh\nThey get a ridiculous methodology to get to the polls interstates analysis of it did you fake news to get a bank inclusion drawn so they can continue on with their fake narrative and like we've only been down this path so now I'm going to start calling them on how ridiculous it isn't there it's the same\nThat's why the way you're on the John triggers radio network I Am your Godzilla of the truth in America where eleven days out to the biggest ... election ever Curtis Ellis is with us

is going to be [noise]\nThis president does it take well to being lied to and I don't think there's any doubt crown prince Mohammed bin Solomon like to I don't think that goes over well with President Trump he doesn't like being lied to here's the other\nThing he does it like dealing with it competent people he doesn't have a lot of patience\n\nAnd I'm telling you crown prince\nMohammed bin Salman is incompetent everything the guy at thirty three years old has gotten involved in has been a complete on an mitigated disaster for the Saudi kingdom so eventually\nThe father just have to say you know what my son is in a competent bubbling fool and I got to put somebody else in\nCountry to to lead because it's guys and capable of being king because he does stupid stuff including this is talk of the nation allegedly\n\nThe Saudis have now shut settled by just on a final story there say but that's going to change again\n\nSo who knows what the uh to showcase has here's what it is tough it is really brought renewed focus\nTo the Saudi Emirates tactics and they support that we're giving them in getting involved in that Yemen's civil war which is causing a horrific very disturbing very growing\nHumanitarian crisis where I can tell you this um on al Jazeera every day I see the pictures you do see because uh the fake news networks today they don't want to show your real news they want to talk about you know President Trump and Stormy Daniels or whatever they do\nBut I\nI see the pictures on TV and I'm and it'll really tear out your stomach I mean you've got children just starving I mean they can eat that ... they they got mother's stripping park from trees bark and boiling it just matching it up so there's\nSomething in this in this in their stomach the reading grass\nI mean there's no food\nI mean just think about how to get your child you're sitting there they starve to death I mean think about how that feels that made this thing is is a horror show it is worse than the area it's worse than anything I've seen and\nOur involvement in it is shameful and it's absolutely shameful and if there's anything that's going to come out of this show get fair or\nWe're going to get the hell out of there as well sure it is just it it's horrific that the United states is involved in something of this nature all because you know we've got the Iranian bogeyman with their nineteenth street post or whatever they have All right let's get the phone\nLike Mike in Oakland Europe you're on the air Mike\nAnd I think you're exactly right about that so um I like you know comes out this was anything good could come out of this\nThing I like I have to point out the irony or something you said just a few minutes ago I'm sure you didn't pick up on it if you don't agree but um you know you said the president or the the two things he doesn't like he doesn't like to be lied to and he doesn't like incompetent\nAnd I I Can't help but think he must be he just wants all that to him so\n[laughter] I'm sure he likes to lie to us and I feel even competing for the jobs this doesn't want to share those two ferns with others [noise]\nWell I guess uh I guess you'd say just tremendous economic renaissance and booming tremendous economy we have an all these jobs I\nGuess you think that's the work of incompetence I guess you'd think the fact that we haven't heard from ISIS in that they'd been kicked kicked out of the majority of their caliphate and they they now only can throw a tiny part of terror tore yet what he took over it was a master might get you think that's a top and it's I guess\nYou think that the fact that the wacko when North Korea has not done a nuclear tests and see now my kitchen thing that's on top of that I guess you think all these new jobs we have in the fact that when you just keep going up in the confidence and there's a tax cut and you figure that's in competent so I guess your nice definition\nOf incompetence Mike\n... is just a little bit different\nI guess it is you know some of those things could have happened whether he was in office or not\nOr you\nMay want someone\nWho is competent than that but this and what kind of progress should we Libyan right thank you and now that\nThank you for straightening yeah it's the\nEconomy Obama leaves office it\nThere is plenty wages are Rob savings in jobs there are people are moving out

the gang of four embargo against the state of guitar that backfired and blow up in their face guitars better off today than they were now he's got this thing where they changed their story nighttime what are we do here\nOr John as you point out\nTell you that it's clear that\nUh that I think the crown prince knew about that a NBS will have it there and solvent banks I think have a lot to answer for and I think they have to be held accountable so I Do think that there has to be significant penalties that they suffer\nI Do think to the question has to be asked is like does the United\nStates believes that it can carry on a continued relationship with Saudi Arabia which I think we need to but\nCan that be with the crown prince I think that's a pretty compelling question\nI think the administration is going to have to ask that I think Congress will eventually addressed that in aspect to you know what we'll be the penalties are to uh to Saudi Arabia I listen I understand the impact of those of those contracts for what we're doing\nTo supply a military uh equipment to Saudi Arabia I think Saudi Arabia I can be a like a a force\nAnd that is is a is a is an ally to us in the in the middle east but I don't think that it can it can be that\nType of ally that we wanted that we need if this is how they're going to operate I mean we have ... you know we have principles in the United states that we that we stand by and our allies\nHave to have to abide by those and I just don't see Saudi Arabia doing that you know you you pointed out the issue with Yemen too and you and I have talked about that before a those are all questions I think that come off and how\nWe see Saudi Arabia operating in the region house policies\nBeing played out and are are they are they doing the same is necessary in that region that create stability and that and that are working in the in the best interest of all involved not just Saudi Arabia but uh other\nAllies in the middle east and listen I I I understand what they're doing that to push back against the Iranian but are are they doing things had in the long term moving in the middle east in the right direction I think those are questions that we have to ask ... foreign policy standpoint and I think that us\nPolicy toward Saudi Arabia you know needs to needs to be directed by those I think very a very sobering issues that we have before us\nSo it seems like congressman Whitman ah we're drilling agreement and it seems like what you're saying is the best way to solve this is a four crown prince MPs from Harvard that Solomon to

right here right now getting involved with me and keeping up on the topics because no fake news here just the truth great to have you with me\nJohn triggers radio network you're Godzilla of the truth in America boy that nonsense that is going on up there every day got a people I compete with hosts like people they just get up every day they read the paper you got the fake news you've got fake told we didn't have the big poll yesterday from the Washington Post is unbelievable I mean the Washington Post like what are they going to learn\nLike they don't want to work people say well what are they going to change a pony methodology to get it right never because they don't want to get it right because it's not about\nAccurate poll it's about the poll driving fake news to get a fake narrative to draw the conclusion\nThat's all it is it's all why the Washington Post actually putting out a poll yesterday actually putting out a poll showing Barbara Comstock\nTrailing Jennifer Wexton in the ... district by Thirteen points now there is no way that western has the thirteenth\nPoint lead over Barbara contact every journal poll that I have seen are Tom stocked every internal poll that has paid for in a lot of money show this raised a dead heat or cops dodge slightly ahead and the Washington\nPost has got Comstock down by Thirteen this is a complete and utter lie in it to be on fake news it is and it's beyond the argument it's beyond the national Enquirer what they tried to do they have Tom starts so much they want that seat so bad\nThey want the liberal do nothing Jennifer watched it in there so\nBad they can taste it they want their\nLeft us in that state\nSo much\nThat they will actually conducted poll make things up doing in such a way to get it resulted they want\nSo they could put it out there and say the races Dover don't give top start getting money and don't work for her it's a lost cause so they do a fishing pole\nIn order to do think it's unbelievable\nNobody in that district is gonna look you in the eye and say that they think that general Washington as a third gene point lead this racist tied and I think Comstock is gonna win for the Washington Post doesn't care they'll not own up to any of this uh neither one of the New York times or ABC News or read anything or MSNBC\nOr any of the polling companies that are in cahoots with a fake news\nAnd that's what they are so it's it's fake fake news network and it's designed to drive in conclusion\nTo make you not want to do anything\nTo help\nShe is going to win this race if you get out and help her but they lie to you on a daily basis and that's why the president says it's fake news and then he said this is an enemy of the people when you widen the people and masquerading as a legitimate news network was that legitimate poll is right\nNow to the enemy how would you define that this poll for the poster so astronaut\nThat even westerns most staunchest supporters think it's a joke because they know it's not true so let me just let me just ask you a question if they're putting out purpose link putting out\nThe information driving it so that to me is that not\nThe people it's certainly an hey it's an enemy the truth maybe the president needs to change one word it's an enemy of the truth it's certainly an enemy of fact it is\nUnbelievable they're doing it again they didn't do as a sixteen and they're doing it again things word nothing do you get a job with the Democrats have learn nothing from two thousand sixteen the legacy media has learned\nNothing in fact what they're doing now is they can't believe they were wrong and so they're doubling down and here's the thing if the Republicans don't relinquish the house\nThe legacy media after two elections in a row going all and for the Democrats and losing them both on a federal level will become irrelevant this sort of strange for them are so high that will become a relative that\nI'm more\n'cause I simply tell you the truth good bad or ugly\nThere'll be relevant they are doubling and tripling down on moral eyes\nOn more fake polls and more fake news again\nTo drive the results they want on election day again and it's got to

FM one hundred twenty\nNow he has some of these same questions and um I I find it amazing um that they're doing the exact same things and also I also finding amazing that lately issues have taken a backseat on ... campaign now I mean it's all personal it's taken Halloween pictures from I think look now\nShe's doubled down you know now it's not big for that you know that they're trying to portray me as crazy based on I guess Halloween costumes and you know me John I have a good time so\nIf it's just it's amazing that last week she pretty much apologizes for marginalizing veterans says she's going to stick to issues then she puts out a commercial or calling me an extremist and trying to make fabricated things up again this is what the left does their own hands\nIt's desperate ploy by desperate candidates and that's why common sense back that's why conservatism is back and that's why I'm going to win the fifth\nCommonsense is backing I'm your commander\nOf commonsense Dennis ... with us running for\nCongress that's district Virginia let's get to the caravan I'm the president with my later today saying it's going to deploy a thousand troops he's got to do with the origin of executive orders that\nWould stop the caravan from coming into the United states the problem is that soon as they step forward and say the word asylum we can't do anything are lower than the loopholes in Denver are written in such a way that all they have to do with yet at tell when get their hand\nGrabbed and say asylum and that we can't do anything they cannot go back what or you've seen the president's proposed action here if you were in Congress now what would Denver Riggleman the proposing on this herb that\nWell you know where a rule of law and uh we're we're we're a nation of laws and we believe in the rule of law and the way the law as written written right now you're exactly right John I don't know you know how we we don't honor that based on what we believe us conservatives in rural and and people who follow the rule of law however\nI think Congress needs to start fixing these immigration laws as soon as possible and I also believe once that happens are vetting process for any of these people that are coming through has to be extreme vetting\nUh we do have some of the technology in place now but we don't put time limits on this if there's that many people that are headed towards the border uh we don't know what's in better than those in John my biggest fear um it's easy you know it's like a Trojan Horse right listen Ninety five\nPercent Ninety nine percent of those people could actually be seeking asylum um does that you know our hearts go out to ... with compassion however if you have people inside there that are bad actors\nI guess is is we're going to be sending some pretty healthy intelligence assets down range I think we're going to be monitoring and my guess is I can only speculate right now my guess is we'll have joint operations but Mexico on monitoring this caravan of seeing any type of emissions that are coming out of there talking about radio emissions or any kind of into that we can glean\nThis is not a good situation this is not good and at some point I think we have to fix our immigration laws in a way that again are are much more common sense than the sort of sort of ridiculous since we have now are going on in the border\nUm uh\nThe I think the concern that everyone has Denver is that okay there's twelve or Thirteen or fourteen thousand people we have to deal with it and\nUh everybody wants to be concerned everybody's concerned about the humanitarian aspect but a lot of my color or their concern was okay if they get\nIn if it's Fifteen thousand to get then the next one is going to be a hundred and fifty thousand and you're not going to be able to stop that either of because we'll never get a wall up in time and even if you have a while to get a hundred and fifty thousand people that there's a lot of people [noise] so um are you in favor of the\nPresident taking action now to stop these are this a mob caravan from palm rushing the border and coming in are you in favor of stopping them from coming in now\nYes yes I mean it's\nThis is the this is a matter of national security\nOr it is a matter of precedent um and again this comes back to that was a normal American will say hey you know we understand\nPeople want to come to the United states but there is a legal process um and we're going to have to we're going to have to follow that legal process you know we we think that legal process used to be applied all immigrants and you and you're exactly right John this would set a precedent\nThat could really be damaging to United States security to our policies into our rule of law or you're right if the if we just allow everybody in we're actually sort of acknowledging that open borders is what we want if we don't follow the rule of law and we don't stop these these migrants sadly we we have to stop all now from coming in and set a precedent\nDenver at about a in about five or ten minutes the U.S government\nIs going to release the new economic numbers or GDP expected to grow again this quarter at so over four percent could be four point one and a four point to point three a bomb autonomy\nWas choking along in about a half percent growth this growth unprecedented where do you look for in that report\nAnd ... what's your clothes and you think you might draw out of it on the economy general recover\nWell the thing I first I'm going to look for [laughter] and it's just because\nI got on this stuff is I'm going to look at the specific whatever report that I have I'm going to look at the number of jobs are based on that are open right now and I look at Virginia but I also see where we're going as far as employment but GDP Growth I'm going to look at manufacturing and I'm looking at agriculture\nI Love looking into the numbers and see where that growth is and we're continuing on this line John if we're continuing with the\nFor continuing which he ... he grows four percent of every quarter which you know it was amazing a it's a new normal was too I mean this is pretty incredible\nOr if you're looking at all these numbers I think right now what you're saying is that the tax cuts were other job for format worse opportunities zones can be lovers here in the in the commonwealth\nA ... and opportunities on investment all the things that we looked at to encourage opt entrepreneurship to encourage people keeping their own money is working and that's what I'm going to look at it this report is is this just a continuation of this amazing just amazing surge or are we seeing and even more positive future\nFor the people know if that district but also in the United states and then the commonwealth of Virginia\nI think we are I think we're just seeing the beginning of this economic boom and um I I'm\nReally just really excited to see what those numbers say based on what job growth on what sectors are growing right now\nWhat kind of interesting to see these are coming out momentarily we expect that or we're going to get over four percent growth and it's really really tough for a Democrat right now to talk about economic the economy or any of the issues that pertain to job\nAnd prosperity in America so they'd rather talk about something else that's why your opponent ugly Coburn is talking about your Halloween talk\nTo him because he doesn't want to talk about the economy she doesn't want to talk about job she doesn't want to talk about growth didn't want to talk about kids moving out of the basement she doesn't want to talk about\nThe boom and small businesses just want to talk about the deregulation she doesn't want to talk about the number of investments that are going on because of the tax cut especially as\nIt relates to one hundred percent deduction of capital investments Rob doesn't even understand it and so she doesn't want to talk\nAbout any any of that she'd rather talk about your Halloween costume in two thousand five\nYeah and I mean which I Will not take down off the net by the way so here's what she would rather talk about she'd rather talk about forty trillion dollars in spending not only for Medicare for all but also for forgetting student debt right which is one hundred trillion dollars right now free community college for all her free college for all\nEverything she had an even in debate she's like I Want to give away this she doesn't understand the taxpayer money is what you're using I get so limited based on what I fought for you know in government overreach she says she loves government I feared government I think government should be limited I think government should be a fish and\nShe's also said that taxpayer money for the middle class is nothing more than confetti\nShe's compared I used to the Nazis I mean I I find it's stunning John did anybody would vote for laissez\nHer views are great for San Francisco and maybe a three square mile area there or somewhere up in Georgetown right in DC\nBut for the fifth district it's absolutely appalling\nThat she thinks these values are actually a political ball to the people to fare if not every day and work for a living and don't give a rat's with the chattering class is saying on CNN or MSNBC or any of these other far left and they are now\nThey're just they're just propaganda machines and I think at some point or that's going to break through that you have comments you have this coalition of common sense\nAgainst progressive ... and I think that's what's happening in the fifth district and we're going to win this John because I represent American values\n[noise]\n[noise]\n[noise] [noise] [noise]\n[noise]\nNo\nAbsolute shore positive no doubt absolutely don't worry about\nIt when for the Democrats [noise] now it slipping away by the very our\nIt's slipping away Republicans in swing

liberty hill share has been a godsend for our family to gather we're changing health care for good\nSocial media stars in a Donald Trump supporters diamond itself is from diamond and silk world headquarters\nLadies out what what do you make of the fact that we've heard a lot of voice in the last uh Seventy two hours or so where people say well yeah of course somebody who's male the Christians packages and you can blame Donald Trump for his rhetoric [noise]\nWell you have to understand\nWhat they do it they try to blame them you know when they did one\nLast year when they got three little ones [noise] [noise] right [laughter] [noise] [noise] or names\nThe White House when you when\nWant to tell you that you\nUnderstand isn't nearly the are being used to\nThink of you and I need some people\nGo\nAnd play you know the part of the United states has used tough rhetoric [noise]\nThey\nSee what they tell you\nOnly hit you you can't [noise]\nThe counter\nAnd and I don't know if that's because I'd never witnessed anything like that back on what's the solution to that because we disagree with the right the last hates the rise\nThe last what are we as a country where\nHave any [laughter] been trying to get the credit\nWant [laughter]\nAnd we get a little\nBit [laughter]\nDeal you know\nYou can eat what I mean if you really\nThe Iraqi people don't really care about the American people you wouldn't [noise]\nIs that the poor [noise]\n\n\nThere was one of the truth and that to me it's great to have you with us today with a fake news regarded again with fake polled coming at you all over the place they make these pulled up to drive a fake narrative don't believe that it's the same thing they did a Jew thousand sixteen they're doubling down they wanted the press\nOut of the news cycle and that we get another one right I don't\nKnow I just I don't know if there's some crazy person doing it but it just seems awfully odd to me the title here's\nThe thing is the Democrats the Schumer is the the the whole crowd that whole mob over there there were screaming\nWe must have the FBI investigate before we can vote on Kavanaugh there must be a full investigation before we can vote on him before we can decide whether he should be you know the sense of the Supreme Court right\nLet's say mom saying we must have an FBI investigation before we can let that happen [noise]\nThey're not even waiting for the FBI to investigate where the bombs are coming from before they start blaming President Trump declared President Trump guilty responsible for the whole thing they're not waiting for the FBI to investigate the same people that three weeks ago\nSaid we cannot do anything until the FBI finishes his investigation so I mean they were total hypocrites it it is absolutely hear responsible or beyond the counter productive it's it's absolutely you're responsible for them to be saying this is all about because of President Trump\nOr they're they're trying they're trying to score political points office which\nYou have to ask who benefits from these bombs that's all I'm not saying who did it they it's obviously some crazy person because no sane person sends bombs or fake bombs through the mail we don't know the bottom of the real thing\nFor two and a a attacks the digital watch to it to make it look like a scary thing we don't know it's Halloween time it's easy to scare people what can I tell you\nWe don't know and I'm not going to go down that road where I can say is whoever did it is crazy in one way or another whether they're sort of fire bleed can be committed to an institution crazy or just that they've got a screw loose you don't do that kind of normal people\nWell adjusted people don't do that okay by definition\nTop you can have the column out today very makes the point that when John Kennedy was assassinated Lee Harvey Oswald who defected to the Soviet Union was pro Cuba\nOr he was found to be the shooter or yet who got blamed for the John birth society and all the conservatives so\nThis is not the first time that the guilt by association or let's let's let's slammed the conservative let's blame everything on conservatives not the first time it's been done before we even know who actually send these packages so\nIt's a everybody's got to calm down take a breath and ah I think Sarah Sanders had it right\nWe should be coming together the president is calling for unity dialing down their rhetoric\nAnd the Democrats are going in the opposite direction they're they're they're blaming the president unequivocal e no question about it taking responsibility whatsoever for calling the guy look at this guy Brennan\nSaid the president's guilty of trees or what's the what's the penalty for treason death he's basically a former\nHead of the CIA had been out they're\nCalling for the president to be hung by the neck until dead and this is not considered inflammatory rhetoric or it's ... it's disgusting the whole thing is just just hypocritical and people will go down as the old time greatest hypocrites\nSomething a Curtis I I think you make a great analogy the depression that of the Democrats to cry didn't screen than wind about cabinet\nDocumenting the FBI not investigating everything I mean why don't we just wait here I mean the FBI things in the horn again in southern Florida they're going to come up with a report pretty so we're we're we're going to find out the answer why not just wait\nRight exactly how about everybody say calm down let's we got we we have the FBI on the case and less this guy was a or gal or or or bought or whatever [laughter] whatever\nEntity it was that created these packages unless that enter to eat was a very very very sophisticated person\nOr a boat and by ... and if they were very sophisticated they were able to cover their tracks but\nConsidering the number of packages delivered to these various places coming out of one place there are a lot of clues\nOut here and find out who did it for narrow it down and the fact that they use Debbie Wasserman Schultz as a return address that kind of interesting in itself Debbie Wasserman Schultz was the one who was forced to step down\nFrom head of the Democratic National Committee\nA because she had been rigging the system for Hillary against Bernie I don't know what that means but it's sort of an interesting clue you know maybe somebody thought that was funny to use her name out all these bombs [noise] I don't know\nUh but my point is this unless this was a very sophisticated operation that they knew how to cover their tracks at every step of the way you've got twelve packages now that the FBI is investigating it let's wait for the FBI to figure this out to come up with something yeah why not wait\nBefore you start a ... and why not why are they not waiting because they want to politicize\nThe Democrats are missing no opportunity to score political points on this\nWell it uh it seems to it it just seems odd to me that that all this is happening but luckily I mean that's where everybody's saying let's wait time let's get to get the economy will get to the Taliban\nInvasion after the bottom of the hour a but let's get to the new economic numbers that just came out the gross domestic product GDP growing another three and a\nHalf percent now let me just say what this means right that's the first time that we have had back to back quarter a in\nLong time of all of over three and a half percent growth back to back and consumer confidence uh up at an all time I can do or spending was four percent another great a\nQuarter of economic growth this is more bad news for them they don't want to talk about that that they don't want to talk about the economy or jobs or the growth so what do they talk about\nAh they talk about all they talk about they've got this wonderful thing to talk about this horrible thing to talk about here with the with the bombs and they talk about the president's feet again they're falling in they don't realize they're falling into a trap and and it's their own drop a crop of their own making\nPeople don't want to hear the Democrats talk about the president they want to hear [noise] Democrats Republicans the politicians in Washington talk about what they're what the politicians are going to do for them to make their life better write what I I I go to work every day\nI got a family to support I got a job or I'd like to get a raise what are you going to do to make that happen how are you gonna make my life better easier make me rich uh make make make my kids you know healthier\nTalking about President Trump talking about you're a Native American DNA doesn't do that\nI really do that you're talking about President Trump causing\nBack to the last two years old I've been talking about President Trump is a Russian agent and now they're President Trump as a Russian agent who create create bomb scares I mean they're they're not doing themselves any favors\nA [noise] on the other side I mean it very very clear jobs now President Trump and the Trump Administration has created the best economic conditions in this country in in a generation the best we've seen in ten Twenty years\nAnd that goes along the way that\nAnswers peoples' questions what have you done for me lately you've got a job you've gotten me a raise you've gotten my hands on food stamps got kicked out of the basement there on their own now great thank you very much\nOr something [noise] I'm going to pose questions to answer when it gets back for another one of the hour what a\nTrump Tower for the last week so they don't feel like all over again I mean [laughter] I\nMean I could go back to [noise] and it's the same thing that everybody from when it was all it was all whatever it was it was going through at the time with the Access Hollywood there with us that we're going to be right back I'll go with\nAnd uh so yeah it is there is a feeling of things I hear all of these national generic ballot polls are meaningless was on a national election\nThey're all like I mean it's all the calls I I've been talking all day about the Washington Post poll that came out yesterday that shows Jennifer ... than they had a barber complex ... district like searching and watched it might when she should be the favorite no doubt that's a very tough for district with Republicans to win barb it's\nLike every internal poll that the Republicans have\nFrom the White House to the interesting thing to Barbara down shows the rate that not have a Thirteen point link but this is what the Washington Post jobs they get any uh they get a ridiculous\nMethodology to get a fake polls get a fake analysis of it did you think news to get a fake inclusion\nDrawn so they could continue on with their fake narrative and like we've already been down this path so now I'm going to start calling them on how ridiculous it isn't there it's the same now\nBy the way you're on the John triggers radio network NPR Godzilla of the truth\nCurtis Ellis is with us She's a senior policy adviser for America first policies this segment brought
