of issues that are alive today where where he raised the idea of the ...\nAnd and pro growth tax cuts and medical savings accounts term limits and he really is a ... that was really a a a full\nRunner of Donald Trump right now so uh uh a lot of the issues that he rents are alive today you know and very well and that would serve our country well if they acted on those things\nAbsolutely John\nTell us about\nYour association I Know you're associated with a couple of things you associate with Steve Bannon hacking told me that and then also job creators network um tell me about why you see happening\nOut there you did a poll the other day saying things are changing because of the cabin on the way she can you share with their audience John McLaughlin what that is\nSo sure what it is is is that um I think who's the whole cabinet situation was more than just the Supreme Court it was really apply to a bike Chuck Schumer and the Democrats to try to win the Senate and when you look at the field of of Senate seats\nThat are above the thirty five Senate seats that are up this year\nTwenty six are in states that that uh uh are held by Democrats [noise] twenty six seats in ten of those seats\nOf the Democratic seats are in states that Trump won by a\nOne in the twenty sixteen presidential election some midterm elections are decided by people that are coming out that that may voted in the presidential but a lot of the people that vote in the presidential don't come out in the mid term so when Trump brand our strategy was to bring out millions of new voters that\nMitt Romney didn't appeal to get them to come out and vote for it so we got a hundred and thirty nine million voters which has nine million more than came out for Obama or Romney\nAnd those voters voted overwhelmingly for Trump particularly in the heartland of the country where there was some built for the rust belt and in the midterms you only get about Ninety million people so it's the sixty three million voters who came out for Trump coming out more heavily\nIn the midterms the Democrats are going to lose a lot of seats for the U.S Senate side think\nSchumer played a gamble to try to suppress the Trump thought where if the Republicans get embarrassed and half the poll cabinet or if the Republicans don't provide the votes he needs to get confirmed dead and the Trump voters would be mad at our own party and not show up sort of millions of Trump voters stayed home a civil\nOr would have a play to win the Senate where keep his Democratic seats and possibly win a tendency Nevada Arizona and become the new minority leader because the Democrats are really fighting hard to take over the house and make Nancy Pelosi\nA a packet al as a bipartisan projects so packed a bill that a project with the ban and where you could see it in the numbers Nancy Pelosi still very unpopular September showing her thirty percent favorable numbers ... orange here this time unfavorable and the vast majority of voters\nDon't want her to become the next speaker of the uh you know the Republicans whatever reasons aren't claim that up to where they should I mean a lot of the house candidates will challenge to policy their districts [noise] but you really should have\nTheir you know when you think about it he should have a a a an agenda where she wants basically she wants to open borders she was the was increased taxes she wants to weaken security\nI mean everything stance towards the antithesis to the majority of voters right now he's going to be the face of the Democratic party if they take over the house if they take over the house Nancy Pelosi will be the most powerful Democrat in the country and in Washington [noise]\nContract for state she has said on numerous occasions that she's going to be the speaker and she said even the other day a\nLet those people that are running as Democrats say what they want at the end of the day I'm going to be the speaker I have the votes in the caucus and it was like do you have to do to win but then I'm going to be your speaker words with John McLaughlin a CEO and\nJohn has worked professionally as a strategic consultant and pollster for over three decades about how long I Know John [laughter] and he's worked on\nA presidential campaign starting with ah our favorite scene for Fred Thompson and many many others so great to have when she was also involved in the governor Nathan Deal campaign\nOur number two thousand and ten and\nI was covering that when I ran to begin in a\nIn a in the Atlanta market the newspaper there so a lot of interesting things that he's been involved in it now he's doing work was patted down and others to try to figure out what is going on in the midterms here John\nLet's get to let's get to the\nName of the house in a minute so based on the generic polling I ... the ... when I\nThat was not a couple of weeks ago he told me something he said for the Democrats to take control the house pat\n... outside the generic\nHas to be um\nA minimal twelve he said for them to gain a seat standing to gain the the twenty five seats to gain the house because he said if it's under twelve what happens is a lot of those polls are in districts where the Democrats are way ahead and uh in California and New York cetera\nSo he said basically it's gotta be twelve or right\nThe real politics average hazard about sex right where I don't know what the Republicans chance that was actually keeping their houses\nNumbers but the but with ... uh he's got a point I don't think it's called but I think it's close to the sex and they write about there we had a survey that when you compare August September\nWe do a thousand likely voters across the country and all this there were times forty four forty four Republican to Democrat in ah September the day before the cabin are hearing we were down for the Democrats were hit forty six to forty two uh the president chose a tower\nCruel and falling from forty to forty six bands and differences since capital those Republicans that\nThe Democrats are trying to you know the press and have not come out the Republicans have they been Trump voters or have them that perhaps uh they've been re energized and the the pollsters have seen come back in the states where\nTrump won like we had a poll this week last week where\nOther Republican was the head of a Democrat McCaskill of Missouri by eight points there's been other media polls were Indiana's a dead heat Montana's a dead heat everybody knows that he can't Heitkamp in downtown in North Dakota so she's an old is\nJoe Manchin must have ... so he switched his vote but on the house side the Democrats and and the reason I say it's probably close to the sex because the Democrats in two thousand six when they took the house from us they are they only got fifty two percent of the national book the forty eight\nFifty to cause us to lose over thirty feet and lose the house now

joining us now live from New Hampshire Corey Lewandowski great to have him in\nThe morning just happy to say\nOkay what a great speech the president may yesterday I Know you saw it you know where he starts out by apologizing to the American people for the debacle offer the clown show the Democrats put on which was a great opening and that was their lives and\nI was only four rows back in the media so it was right there front and center and\nI was shocked by it and I thought it was great and then he also apologized to judge Kavanaugh and his family for having a job through the nonsense and a lot of polls showing Cory now that the Democrats overplay their hand backfiring that Trump voters are fired up what are you seeing on the ground\nOr what is exactly right look this president came out yesterday and apologetic judge Kavanaugh family for what doors and windows on the street there will never apologize the accusations the attacker character and his reputation was unprecedented\nAnd apologies from anybody in the mainstream you know these people doubled down\nIt's such a Christian when it's a conservative it's one thing when it's a liberal than other times now no matter what the issue is when you catch liberals why they were with the truth when they're using language that conservatives couldn't say well you know that was the person\nWas young we stand by them or whatever it is it's always a double standard so with the\nPresident outlined yesterday when he was saying a judge Kavanaugh as justice Kevin [noise] something's different temperament older has to do\nWhich is to bring attention back to where it should be which was the person or an appropriate tactic judge Kavanaugh\nFamily received from not just the way out but also for the mainstream [noise] and the president has the biggest microphone world and what was the right thing to do and I can tell you and I said the times there are multiple\nTrump one of the party everybody right now is fully for four weeks from today because they've seen\nNow wants to do what they're capable of doing and what they will do if they come back the house of representatives\nWhich is talking about impeachment both of our president and moreover of jumped to his cabinet already so the Republicans have been fired up at the polling and this is going to be much closer election in Israel wants to give us credit for\nThat's what these guys want to do a kids' book comes out in\nEarly December McCain who is the deputy director of the FBI who was fired for among other reasons you know running in line to the FBI under oath on three occasions he was fired for that his book is coming up because they aren't profit off of Donald Trump won cells in the book world certainly\nStories about Donald Trump we've seen\nThat now with fire and fury in Woodward and all the other you know tabloids that have been out there and published but my guess what Rod Rosenstein is going to do he will use his perch and number two person at the department of justice took when he finally leads whether he's firing quit\nGoing write a book and just you know be skating against this president because that's how these guys stay alive and this is how these guys state you know in the public arena and it really it's a terrible terrible thing to be honest with you\nAgree with the new allegations out now\nThe rock scene\nComments that he was going to attempt to wire get wired change the president and then go with the tape for Santa Monica and then go to the cabinet to invoke between just to get him out I get to ask me I said to up the seniors saying they believe them and they thought he was dead serious\nThey reported that too and they're now to James Baker sorted was serious McCain thought it was the origins of the way now to information\nThat's awful me why doesn't the bird to just find this guy now\nBut I think I think you're exactly right I think the president wants to get through this election cycle doesn't want anything to distract the Republicans have momentum on their side but I Do think you have to look wrong term at\nThe ability of Rod Rosenstein to stay in that position slipped if God wants to leave that position he can do that anytime he can resign if he wants to but I think you have to call into question do you have the ability to continue in his capacity\nAs the deputy attorney general based on the information that we're hearing from other members other senior members that served with him in official capacity in the department of justice or the FBI and they're saying is their accounting for what McCain said to be true\nThat should be very troubling to everybody and we do know unequivocally that Rod Rosenstein who signed one of the fires are application renewables which allowed them to continue to spy on us\nThe veil to what the president is not on redacted that we need that we need to see that we need to see the three oh two news which are the FBI's note\nAfter they talk to Bruce or at the department of justice to see what's in there and we have to understand what the insurance policy wise to keep Donald Trump from being elected that the FBI was talking about what role if any Rod Rosenstein how to in that because as the deputy attorney general he had the right to sign\nThat find that application and from what I understand and what is becoming widely known now that's why the application was riddled with mistakes and\nAnd it was based on the false premise about fake dossier and that last renewable who's actually signed when Donald Trump wasn't a sitting president of the United states and the American people deserve the rights\nTo see what was there in that renewal applications that Robert Hussein signed\nYou recommend to the Robin Jones' November\nAnd look I what I Would recommend to the president is declassified all the documents let the American people decide and see what has actually transpired the FBI's credibility because of what gym called me and Amy McCain and now James Baker and Peter shock and Lisa\nPage you done to that organization's is just devastating it will take decades to recover\nFrom what they have done jet organization\nTrying to use their positions people were already people when the badgers going after American citizens spying on American citizens because they didn't like the political affiliation of their opponents or anything that our country has been against censorship in ...\nAnd guys like Peter Straub where the head of the counterterrorism\nUnit had more ability than anybody he was in one box to the Clinton email investigation he's the one who led the team that was called a crush on Hurricane Sandy hey there's nothing to seeing these extra six\nHundred thousand Clinton the emails they were all part of Anthony when your laptop and he's the one who said hey let's go after Donald Trump he's one of the investigations we've\nSeen it now with the text messages between leads a page and Peter Struck and they were at least minimum complicit\nWith what gym called me and Amy McCain and Jim Baker and potentially Rod Rosenstein and one and done and the question is John and this is a very very big question how did this go to the U.S government we know that the director of the CIA\nAnd the ... and the director of national intelligence and others were aware of this spying going on on domestic soil against us citizens but exactly how high did it go which is the biggest untold story of the last two years because this could lead right up to the very top of the government\nWhich leads to Jeff Sessions\nOr what is your what what happened to just not doing anything launching these special counsel to investigate\nThat's why people for political gain all the way up to do everything else where Jeff Sessions\nWill look this whole investigation has been by and large turned over to the I mean the inspector general of the department of justice to find out if there's been any wrongdoing and we've seen some of that report already I because there's been released publically the report that recommended\nThe number two person at the FBI not only be fired but charged criminally we're waiting for that to occur\nUh we're waiting to see what happens to\nBe a strong and Lisa Page and and and Jim Baker the general counsel for the FBI we're waiting to find out what happens when Jim Comey because it is very possible that Jim Comey has brought up on charges of potentially perjuring in front of Congress leaking of classified information even though Jim said he didn't think it was classified that's not an excuse\nWindow that he gave his notes\nHis work product which was he was not allowed to do\nTo the a law professor to make sure that can lead to the media has been new accountability anybody at any level of government for what they've done\nWhich was try that try to influence the outcome of the U.S election because or Clinton supported by and large and they did not want to see a candidate Trump become President Trump and I don't understand what the accountability is and why it hasn't come out yet\nNovember's are we going to\nBlow up so John I really hope so and I and I and I hope for the president sake on that\nHe has a team focused on helping him achieve all over the results which he's been able to do by and large almost singlehandedly\nIf you look at what the president's been able to accomplish with three point seven percent unemployment the unemployment rate for African Americans and Hispanics he's done some of their uh when I wrote the help of their staff in lieu of her\nStaff quite candidly and we've seen in the Woodward book toward the staff cried on multiple occasions to stop him from doing things and\nStopping trying to stop them from being successful but he's persevering he's gone on and dumb thing and the historic\nLevels just think for a second if he had a staff that surrounded him that actually wanted him to be successful\nTo how much more he could accomplish he's done so much already but there are still people who don't want to see him be successful they were still people who serve in the government or whether they're bureaucrats elected officials or people who have taken positions\nThat didn't support him in the campaign and they're still trying to doctors are gender at every turn and\nAll of the grass and he has had in the first two years of history and I can only wonder how much more he could have had if he had the white team around him supporting him every step of the way in all these government agencies [noise]\nFor the first thing you do on the number seven story is bringing down the street and it's my goodness you're right you think if you look at all this the topless in twenty months and he did that\nJust targeting things from a checking your cell phone could go to websites or not divulging information I mean it's almost criminal what they've done their jobs or don't staff just the people that are there to serve the president's agenda and\nThey were nothing but an obstacle trying to stop he was doing and he still got all this accomplish it's an amazing things you can only imagine in the next two years what he could do if he has a house and he has a center and he's got people in there actually are\nAdvocating for his agenda rather than doing everything to stop it or stall it unbelievable corn without you thank you for being with us recording spoke like Trump the Trump got another great for coming out Trump's enemies that's due out in November I Believe that it\nTwenty I
