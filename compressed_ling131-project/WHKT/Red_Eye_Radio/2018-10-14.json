Warren none of that could have happened without the shapes your act that set up\nAnd you were the one that said you keep covering ... giving government this unlimited power\nUp surveillance and its eventually going to come around and bite you in the bud center that's exactly what happened\nWhy have the same very saying the conversation yesterday with the director of the art because I asked him point blank argue gathering information including the president's phone calls and of course he fired you know I Can't answer that they're setting\nAnd the answer for my ... answering yes there\nWas an article about two or three years ago saying that they recorded Fifteen hundred of President Obama's up on call and then they minimize hand which means ... markets name out but how hard is it to tell when President Obama or President Trump was talking to a foreign leader at the end of their voices [noise]\nEven if you're minimized or in a parked out the names\nVersus conversations were listening to journalist conversations businessmen and women conversation and their record it and then they're out there and then the FBI in there and search this day without a judge is Warren and my point to him was and I think keeping it and understand or didn't understand it is [noise]\nIf you're recording things on potential terrorists from overseeing the cost of government lawyer Carter but if they're talking to Americans or just random people are talking to American when you do get constitutional protections because many of the phone call the art discussions with terrorists in fact the vast majority are innocent international phone calls\nAnd so we have had this discussion with them and uh it should be protected by the cost in fact some say the Fourth Amendment you know John Adams said of the spark that led to the revolution or are we getting like the British soldiers coming into our houses you know breaking down the doors are stamp tax [noise]\nAh we really wanted protection and we wanted to say the government and never come to your house or any private\nConversations are belonging without talking to a church first\nWell and that's a that's why you were so adamantly opposed to when you were a predictor of the future when this whole thing senator uh\nYou've also been a very strong voice on the disappearance of juvenile to show the there's a lot of talk about what should be done and we want more information\nAnd like I get that but as a member of the Foreign Relations committee you're the only senator that has proposed action which isn't to get answers on his disappearance because\nCenter the thing is we haven't videotape showing that he went in there is nobody ... showing that he went out and I'm a crown prince NBS Mohammed bin Salman says the camera footage was corrupted or the battery went dead\nThey can't really only by that it's like the dog ate my homework or I didn't get ever ready battery and so the battery died\nNow you have more in a meeting in suspension of ah the arms sales to the Saudis until we get some kind of a satisfactory answer can you elaborate on that sir\nI think everybody should remember that Saudi Arabia and it's the largest state sponsor of radical Islam around the world what I mean by that or if they had been funding for decades mature officers in Pakistan\nIntermediate Philippines even in the United states teaching hatred of the west bank of Christianity and teaching radical violent jihad just as the salaries are we shouldn't be selling a weapon simply because of\nHis queen of the Nineteen hijackers who came here were from Saudi Arabia Saudi Arabia is a big part of our terrorism problem they are gay funders of terrorism and teaching of radical Islam around the world [noise] their latest episode\nI I see no way that this could have happened without there being it's all too private planes with clean guys on on some of them if there are a link to Saudi security services and intelligence from now it doesn't cost us\nHe just spent the arms sales to halt the arms sales it's the only thing they listen to in addition to them killing a journalist [noise] they're paying tens of thousands of civilians killed in Yemen they're doing it with our bombs when we're refueling they're farming they're\nWired and two weeks ago or three weeks ago they killed the school bus full of children's school children were killed\nA year ago they killed a hundred and fifty people in a recession and we wonder why someone in Yemen wants to drop a bomb on and kill the Saudi are killing American because they climbed the fragments of the bombs were saying you know America [noise] and so we have to realize that reaction there's the action and that's a blowback\nFrom us being involved in some ... gotten civil war is one that we actually create more terrorists but here's the other possible thing that's going to\nHappen again or what happened in Libya when we toppled Gadhafi we got chaos and more terrorism it became a breeding ground for terrorism\nMy fear is that there is some evidence at fairly fairly strong record of al ... India but we're not fighting them that were Mitchell stricter civil war between the who these in the south and also with Iranian influence as well but my fear is that ... cents into chaos\nAnd that you get to ride out period at the same thing happening is that civil war that we got involved in the house you got the rise of ISIS\nWell actually the network that I go on a ... near a couple about a month ago was reporting that al Qaida fighters were actually given safe haven a by the by the Saudi forces in Yemen in ... in in order to fight the who the so\nCalled this wouldn't you wouldn't be surprising because here that the Saudis support in Syria they support her ground news round which is essentially an offshoot of al ... the Saudis are all these poor people who hate America Israel who have a western ways and\nYet we kind of big arms deal the president because I Do it for a job for a job that's not something that we should be\nConsidering what we argue arms deals we need to be considering our national security not trying to have some sort of Keynesian job scope\nYou're on the John triggers reading your network trucking the truth across America where when Kentucky Senator Rand Paul Republicans on the Foreign Relations committee a he's been the strongest ... voice in the U.S Senate on\nHow we react to the uh Jamal ... disappearance\nSo have you recommended this to the president\nCenter have you on a direct conversation can remember a look than when I was an original Trump supporter everybody knows day when it came down the escalator he campaigned on getting out of these entanglements not staying in the have you had a direct conversation with the president on how we should react to this\nNonsense revealing out of the journal asked um he does know my feeling was talking about once every week or two and when we have our conversations general ours by\nThat uh he has the same\nA million times is unusual instincts on Syria or that we should stay forever and\nYet he's surrounded by stay forever crowd and that's the real problem is I think the president's instincts are good I'm sort of in the crowd at what the president bigger president right and\nYet the people surrounding him are I think you are and you know part of the traditional foreign policy around here which is go stay forever and bankrupt and\nSenator Paul the president has invested a lot of political capital in the Saudis that was the first place and he went in his first foreign visit a MPs came to the United states he did his media\nTour within the Saudis spend a ton of money on media PR as you know uh in in in the swamp and so he's put a lot of uh and and you know we kind of looked the other way when NBS rounded people up jailed him in that hotel whatever they did\nThis administration has looked the other way is the fact our relationship with the Saudis and my entire to that is it going to change the president's position on the Saudi ... book Fargo of the state of
