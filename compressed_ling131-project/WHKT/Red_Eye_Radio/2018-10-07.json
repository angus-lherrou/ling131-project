a couch and my entire life and [noise] the amount of um English I think that all caps fans have\nHave had over ... over that time um and the number of times that we were right on the cusp and just couldn't couldn't make it and um it was a great night and a great Germany [noise]\nAnd then seven nothing when and yes the cats can repeat I think that actually gonna be better this year I think a cloud\nOf pessimism has been lifted from that team you know John one of the things that I can tell you the season ticket holder that was just so frustrating but you just couldn't break it was in the playoffs you know that that we have a great\nThey go down one goal and the life out of the stadium because we've seen it happen\nOver and over again we're moving in a fire right in the game and and and the whole the whole ... admitted jets um I've never seen an arena just goes so\nLast year game seven against Pittsburgh in ... when we when we went out the ... in in twenty sixteen and um they went down one nothing and it was like you know one nothing that hockey is is nothing nothing and and I mean you get a funeral that we already lost the game they were they're short haired\nOld again just collapsed right and and and and that's and now it's like it's lifted and and and you could feel the playoffs last year once we got through Pittsburgh it didn't matter if we went down and again people could still believe in a team and the team could believe in itself I think I think the\nThe the caps in their history was Wayne on the players were they were believing when they went down a goal that\nThey the games where you can also and how they because the fans blamed for every everyone believes it and I didn't once Pittsburgh got the last year everything changed you could feel the change their I'm Thomas a season ticket holder honestly the ticket older we set a poor sections away from each other sometimes to each other in the Dunkin' Donuts line in between factions [noise]\nUm but um [noise] this is going to be a great era for the caps now I don't think this was a one year thing I think that you look at who's not solved is young I'm over in his in his you know not in the mid mid thirties and when you're thirty three thirty two\nUm he's gonna make a run a grassy for the most goals scored of all time the regular season is over six hundred rescue the Ninety four he's going to make a serious run it being the number one goals for\nAn edge on history and the caps have an incredibly bright future um [noise] and I'll just end with saying that my dilemma right now\nI put a thousand dollars in the capital last year when the Stanley Cup in Las Vegas Fifteen the one we want to in Vegas got the cash for tickets Fifteen thousand dollars when I catch the ticket the person at the counter told me the biggest payout she's ever paid at the sports book\nOr when people will take about like that and rolled over for two or three seasons and she said you know the caps repeat and he wrote us money over it'll be two million dollars by the time they have three so I'm Still having this dilemma for the rest of the season I have not done anything with the money yet because it may be that like you know it was just a thousand dollar additional investment\nI might need to roll it over a couple of times because I think the caps are legitimate threat not only to repeat this year to ... you have to repeat I'm only after all that every year by year so that's my dilemma but I'm leaning towards the right now I actually think this team is a special team and one that um is going to have a lot of successful important [noise]\nWell uh I forget what you're saying I bet the Astros last year to win the world series of tech and one as you know because you put

[noise] one by twelve points twelve to Fifteen points I got an ear a in a\nBlacks district and even more I think in Stuart events district and uh you know the dynamics are changing in this and it's not just so much a matter of Trump or anything the demographics in the state or changing and they're changing almost daily [noise]\nAnd ah it's obvious which way you know they're moving are we going to be like Maryland now we're not going to be like Maryland but we um northern Virginia is beginning to look more and more\nThe northern Virginia suburbs more and more not totally but more and more like the Maryland suburbs\nNational it's not just reached want me right happening naturally and these guys are very\nBright New Jersey suburb send things going on everywhere around us are separate but you're seeing this you're seeing this an awful lot and um [noise] I think we have an excellent chance\nAnd no question we're getting help from the guy in the White House whether it will be there or not you know uh I I was joking with Mark Warner and I said well we we need 'em they're just one more election\n[laughter] you know but I mean it's you know\nUm [noise] generally speaking we done better [noise] generally speaking when there's been a Republican and the White House have there been exceptions yes\nGenerally speaking the Republicans have done better when the Democrats than in the White House have there been exceptions yes but the trend is there and it was a mistake of a trend yeah I don't understand and I\nI I Would be surprised if we didn't know you know get to Twenty one in the end of the election that are minimum\nI think I I I tend to agree you know\nYou still have to defend a couple of the like you got a couple of comments got one over on the eastern shore that this is in play I think Republicans can hold the black sea if they don't have to buy I I think that [noise] far weaker today a it's an incumbent and probably anybody else to get some personal proclivities and\nAnd and things that I think that hurts him among some of those voters we have some stronger candidates I don't have to or black\nOr and I don't know what happens there he's got a hundred and fifty thousand in the banks are like that it sounds like he's ready to go away very quickly but I Will do my advice to him and he got to know when when the phone and you want to go out to undefeated not indicted if you could do that and it gets lost before\nBut I don't think you want to end your career because I I think you beat him a disturbance of very attractive candidate a you are but you've got some issue ... after the initial matrix there where he has not really thinking or his voting record 'em to that district and you've got the state house at fifty one forty nine into redistricting\nThat's critical happened many many I mean we have to wait and see but may work and the Democrats said with the\nUm [noise] I mean it would appear that the judges are going to wind up throwing that house district was held eleven house districts and I think that's what whatever formula they come up with that is going to a also be what the Senate's going to have to abide by twenty Twenty one\nAnd uh it could change or you know it could change an awful lot [noise] um you know a part of the districts aren't unpacked not totally but below the numbers I mean look what Bobby Scott\nI'm In his district one from what fifty some fifty six percent down to\nYou know low forties and I'm a [noise] you know produced another democratic district so you're gonna have to see how that plays out\nBut it seems to me that uh the judges drawing that district is by far and away their their best bet\nAnd if they do you know Supreme Court I think it ruled before the\nGerrymandering is is has been constitutionally permissible until it spills over and racial discrimination\nAnd therein lies the problem and that's what\nThe Republicans are facing there and it's going to change its going to change the way you know a whole makeup of legislatures around the country of course of course it's a five to four court will do this differently\nBlocks from the other point and they send it back if I may be wrong but I think when they sent it back to the lower court it was like seven to two or nationally\nBut I I just think one of the thing is you've got to understand the Republican base for better for worse is migrated from your country club in the country and instead of doing they're taking their self out of some competitive districts where these are economic issues it'd be very viable\nSo it's not just the demographics of the fact that they can change the emphasis on issues in ways that help them in South West Virginia but but it hurts them in the growing parts that\nCan we talk about the ... and also with a very popular governor with very low negative and you look at ... numbers ... support amongst Democrats\nWas not popular among Republicans was more polarizing in numbers Ralph Northam has incredibly low negatives for somebody in this environment you look nationally um he has very high positive very low negatives um and in going into these competitive seats [noise]\nUm I remember in ... eleven and Democrats drew the state Senate lines and they lost the majority and who was the the person who was in every Republican ... that was flipping seats\nThat's a big um item that timetable here\nRan these are still nationalize races I don't care how you slice it the national environment plays Baltimore\nThat you have to have a messenger boring to operate the respect Tom you're turning out the communist right the the I mean it that that national same ways very heavily you know which is why you've had you know the the patterns that you've had\nUntil McCarthy Cuccinelli I mean you know what happened for almost fifty year I'm gonna I'm into I mean here's one of the surveys like let's take for example the start of empty it's sort of been seat was not driven by national politics and twenty fifth and it was driven by local politics in Chesterfield versus Richmond\nAnd I'd like to be democratic um and I think that we're\nAnd we don't believe we have more whereas if Canada but we don't have the ... campaign still matter yeah yeah I don't think we had to I don't think we had a great message or that I think if you read right in that same race in twenty Nineteen\nAnd you had Ralph Northam auntie I'm In that district route for children under that let me just say I don't know how to vote the votes for stardom and it's chaos is going to create problems for them\nYeah I think that's a greater problem is that he's he's he's not harmonious where the district on some of this hot button issue I just say that like Rob working good governor I think it's a wonderful man but he gives a fireside chat in the FARC has now you put him on TV it it it's not the same kind of rally the team but he's an attitude that\nEveryone can lead to use that ... I don't know if that's the kind of governor you actually need this and he picked up not a fire already picked up Fifteen states\nI mean I think the attending the color the fiery and I'm at a carnival Barker one and and he doesn't he doesn't pick up seats away Ralph Northam dead\nWrong north in didn't pick them up from picked him up for him yes if Trump would have been president and twenty Fifteen we'd be in the majority\nThey look I I decided I don't want to date on Ralph Northam\nDisagree however I think he's been very much just say the\nChemical upon by three points and rapper with them on by eight and ... picked up the earth heats up north and picked up Fifteen five point difference was not Fifteen slow I'm telling you that but there was also a hotel different let me tell you the\nWhite House district about Trump okay I was a driving factor sure last November on top of that [noise] um [noise] you had a ... and spilled over into everything\nAnd keep in mind Gillespie was not true but you know I mean he was very polarizing [noise] but um\nI just think people keep underestimating the governor\nOh oh I don't think anybody underestimating I don't think anybody under estimate same but they know it was I mean you know what's driving politics in Virginia right now is not a Ralph up its it's what's going on across the Potomac River [noise]\nIt's ... driving politics on both sides right now in the one thing about reference he doesn't have any negative [noise] doesn't have many many he's a very likely not\nI'm not you know I've now go you know been knocking on doors since may I have not gotten one\nHow many people like him he's just a likeable person\nIs not the problem is you know I I agree with that he is an asset but he's not a fire reader that gets voted off for\nYou you know I I think Tom Davis is not a fire leader that got to put up for the Republicans but for Twenty years\nEvery single Republican Murphy she would have thought the person was married to Tom Davis because the Republican candidate had his picture bigger than their own picture with a quote from him saying like here's what it'd be great for your time sometimes without my permission um [noise] so I mean having a messenger is important and democratic not had good lecture slowdown letting Ralph Northam is the first time in a\nMargaret right I agree but you're always taking our income but that was not entirely different that\nI don't know I tell you what man I I mean that's the joke joke kind of Peter ... you can't underestimate Morsi and I'm telling you\nWhat he had a disastrous press conference I wasn't there and it was a disaster of all time so he had a disastrous press conference that really hurt him all kinds of underhanded things going on but you know after that\nI'm more she's married and and [noise] you know the the thing about Joe is he's an independent thinker he's got to go is the only way uh you know he's not\nA he's not a whole bunch of any of the establishment caucuses or anything like that\nI think he's gonna play very well in that district and I think a lot of friends there that I don't think that he got screwed\nBy what they did to him and and take an average of more sort of the smartest\nI've ever seen anyone to in politics when he won the was it I think it was ... he won ... teaching moved up I think\nAnd in that primary people and think he was gonna win that primary crowded field any more than a landslide networks people are asking what did he do he went around and after he knocked on doors at you know and I\nWrote a handwritten note every voter he spoke to the data that for a week and a half before the election in the context of as if he had remembered the conversation\n... kept these postcards for six months and send them all out of ten days before the election with a handwritten note from him talking about how their conversation and\nYou know I met your dog Sam or you're a teacher here and I remember that conversation and do you know hope I can count on your support next Tuesday and people\nCan out in droves I mean for him to go do that though and I I actually people read postcards but I've never seen one posting them to make it appear as ... months later okay what companies I'm Tom Davis has everything better than anyone in politics but [noise] but he did that and and he won in a landslide and like in ...\nIt's I feel I'm not the guy and says I'm going out of the time on TALK of the four or five people in that race either going to just to I'm not an expert on that's the big difference you know if we had you know there's a whole lot of people have gotten in the journal stomach because we don't have run all in this day a whole lot [noise]\nAnd and you won't have that you'll just have to people in there\nAnd she's well like [noise]\nI don't think I if I had the gas and I think it would tell her I went to live in that district I I guess that round dance has extremely low name id pardon I Would guess that route the answer is extremely low name id and that if you tested there were more seats and they might have to say the ...

that they'd back then when I was in high school you know that kind of thing people and\nYou didn't hear about the product and I'm not a human but extremely credible yeah very emotional\n... and and I do think this I I think that taking that extra week going back and interviewing some of the people more judging others around it I think it was with the right thing I think slam dunk and just playing a role in the day after her would have been terrible politics or would have been a terrible on these two ... having said that\nNobody else can remember the party\nWho was there ... there's just too many holes to really make the case that doesn't mean she's wrong [noise] but but that's a tough standard for the future you know anybody can come forward and say anything\nI appreciate that but that's the way to go back within six days and remember after she testified Chris Wallace from Fox News and the president to talked about how credible she was an old Republican operatives protects everybody right after she testified this is done it's over\nThe world changes but back to what we're talking about before either we've gotten his crop ration sidebar mentioned a blast poll for mentioned I think had him up Fifteen\nI Want to say now that he's up by five or say no but I saw a poll last week that I'm a fair thing that's ... that's the polls you read when they're asking you to do that on our new certainly certainly is not a question\nBy by either under fifty he's well into well under shift and I and I think what you got to remember this is if you go to you know he is independent this whole shtick I think this is for him this this changes the outcome if he's right\nYeah I I Can't I ... and I'm not an expert on West Virginia but it seems meet Joe Manchin soul position that I'm an independent guy I'm not beholden to either side and uh\nI think it would be hard for him to get reelected it would seem to me and what what a Trump when the state by like fifty points or something like that\nAnd I'm not on also documents and Susan Collins is going to run again either and I don't know that\nThat I think it's all I'm not either but she says she never voted against the Supreme Court judge ever you have any group in the state that it could a million dollars up to ... votes against millionaire has meant\nYeah okay now it's up to a million and a half to go find me but then it looks like a bribe I'm I mean I I think at the end of the day without corroboration she's going to be there for for for which we agree with Tom ... not only twenty twenty twenty is she going to run again well she'll make that decision at the appropriate time [noise]\nI I think I think Tom now that I think she is going to vote yes ah the one that I have no read on the top Davis is I'm Lisa Murkowski of Alaska what about what about you [noise]\nPretty independent I mean just remember this when she lost that primary to Joe Miller last Republican primary right she run is they\nWrite in with the name Murkowski that where he just felt I ended up and also as you want to that last ... but you know the the part about the independents pieces when you guys mentioned when it's because they claim they're they're reelected comes looking out for their state right mhm yeah and Murkowski has a big issue with the cabin opinion about Alaskan natives I think what's up much\nOf it either and she ... she she she does on on that issue so now it's not clear cut I haven't seen the polling in Alaska or the but the I think if you get ... like and I think you're going to get flaky booed him out of committee so I think without some crap ration Jeff Jeff is fundamentally\nVery conserved right now you got to do more research through he's also very independent and I think a very principled guy which is why people think he's flaky because he doesn't always stay in one boxing\nIsn't always predictable but let's judgeship you're going to understand for Republicans this unites us this this is a very important vote on the court or as it is on the Democrats on the other side of wanting somebody else\nCan I ask a question has ever has a a vice president were broken a tie on a Supreme Court nominees chocolate not that I'm aware of here I think that would be unprecedented everybody [noise]\nBut that can kind of a challenge that\nBut it's still counts how do you know that just sort of thing a competition just as advice and consent and there's got to be no ... he's the president\nIt's not Virginia your nomination yeah [laughter] yeah that might already lawsuit there's already a lawsuit challenging the whole procedure on the other Democrats\nIf he's confirmed that they're going to do and they take over the house or the sense that going to move\nTo impeach that would be a disaster to Thursday and it's not good luck [noise]\nYes I just I I think you're going to get our arms and\nOf elections have consequences that's when I take away but here's a ... let's get some Republicans have noticed stealing Supreme Court [noise]\nWell I I mean it all in one policy from one problem I still can't get over the fact that Trump won two years later you still can't get over ... let me think what\nAm I married Garland well let me let me talk about murder on I think might bite every indication is a very honorable three four would have made a good Supreme Court judge in in the traditional sense with these balance sheets not completely a liberal democratic operate before he wanted the bench but but met the criteria for it for a judge\nBut what is better not holding a hearing on them are doing what they've done in this case that it's bringing is putting the sham of of hearing him and then finding a way to trashes reputation and voting no they weren't there to confirming it we're gonna lecturing here [noise] it Republican senators were confirmed school you seat and putting on a more liberal members just wasn't going to happen\nYou know presidential politics here not a mid ...\nWho knows what the rules are writing about it but it's the president is the president United States to nominate somebody from the frame court not to set up their mind right that's right so therefore I think McConnell's argument is out when he says look a that was the presidential election yeah like one of the voters decide\nThat but I'm just saying that they stretch it each time I don't know who started it but it keeps getting worse and worse and worse\nAnd once you do it for one year you could do it two years you could do it three years I I don't know there aren't any guard rails on this I think I was they moved it from sixty votes to fifty votes for everything but the Supreme Court of course they're going to do it for the Supreme Court has made there are new guard rails many more on this and that's what's scary\nAre not going to you again it's actually you're from a\nDJ Republican operative in Virginia Beach if there is such a thing he just says Joe mansion is only apply

I don't eat the fact that the numbers would change [noise] um but from my perspective I think it Kavanaugh's confirmation to is probably the terms of democratic enthusiasm probably next five to ten sheets maybe a Senate seat or two I mean well I think it helps in the house and her two because the Senate\nOn very red character North Dakota uh Missouri I mean these are pretty solid see West Virginia in the Senate race since Kavanaugh thinking republic\nOr wherever we're where we're at a time for a couple of unscheduled finally our news but one thing I\nThink Tom nail this this is the only thing I've seen in since Trump announced that has a unified Republican [laughter] I've never seen anything like this we couldn't figure out how to do it we're going to talk about that plus Redskins cats when I get that keep it\nI said Fifteen I was twelve point for when I went back and actually look at the\nLimits of the cabinet discussion yeah we want to go ahead what do you go ahead and do it but don't get to get the fuck for football hockey but go ahead go ahead\nOh well when I'm like last night among the winner and the Senate Judiciary committee the official account of the Senate Judiciary committee is tweeting about Democrats do not understand the definition of boating\nI doubt if the\nSenate Judiciary account\nThis thing is so off the rails and and and I feel like you know people were completely missing the point with all this process crap\nYou know the reason the judiciary committee's tweeting as that the Democrats have the definition Ronald ... our process\nAnd none of it is actually on where people are on it and where voters are on on this is the Kavanaugh only has the support of the conservative base and the message that women are getting around the country is that you know people are OK with sexual assault\nNo I think that that is that the\nMeasures they're they're they're getting is you're now a pronounced wrongdoing or joining it it'll it'll image that good I mean this is the same\nDemocratic Party to defend that Bill Clinton bit of tactics accuses him a right to especially the one that got raped\nRape against Bill Clinton which which exists actually didn't exist during the impeachment process do you remember that woman came out a week after on national television that whole process going so when you say the Democratic party rallied around through whatever that allegation wasn't out there at the time I Will say second thing is\nThat was why he lied he was saying\nYou're talking about with John Powell Jones is different than ... then that was not rape are just threw me oh just relax all cats are really cannot after that was ever catch the interview was a week after the centered in the Senate about that you had to sequence Kevin really with the same time it's ball Joe [noise]\nOr that you're thinking about the need money to buy a drain abroad flipping is the first time in the ... were not retaliation anyway the point [laughter] the message that\nWomen are getting around the country is that this is okay\nAnd Republicans are now into a debate about the definition of ... I mean that will try and and doubled struggle I mean it is a this is on the official Senate district ... look everybody knows what blew the nets either not or you have to first of all I don't know I I\nI've seen is boosting its inserting drugs in your ... instead of taking them down your throat because you for your body will process the faster ...\nYou're going to ride as you mentioned that I learned during the ... All right where that everyone\nKnows what that means I order I Hope you don't want to be a\nVery very interesting out here and it's been crowded here that no idea what that word me I Do not and then and then you don't count on going to go on national television taking notes and be like oh it's a party and joke I mean this is so ridiculous and absurd wouldn't embarrass the nominee that talk\nAbout the process a Democrat\nAnd let me just really get beyond the world you're talking about pulling going on in the winter stuff\nGoing on this very split the ... this is not overwhelming pulling against capital which is right down the middle at this point in which is the worst in history but we could Supreme Court justice or never done that or what ever down in the dark matter because they were just\nTalking about the electoral repercussions when during the ... kicked the hornet's nest and the Republican base that was kind of depressed at this point in what you've seen now in in terms of the energy base of both parties the enthusiasm gap as close and that's going to cost Democrats a couple of times at least\nI guess when you look nobody wants to have a company that are doing sexual has done sexual assault get off of that\nWe want people to come over here Keith Ellison it's okay you have perfect for the double standard right she fell into it or or the guy who was the guy in the ravens beat up his girlfriend and ... by the hair and they they pay them more money\nJust for for whatever it's worth I mean I I totally concur on ... and I said that publicly I campaign for his opponent you know on line when he got into the primary for attorney general I said this is not right the way he's doing it um and\nYou should you should be that's an ... not you've been my biggest thing in general but it is it and it and it is bad because a lot of people will look the other way 'cause any should not be the number two person on the Democratic\nNational Committee right [noise]

Thirty years ago or or I remember them differently than they were in his corrected\nLook I don't know who's telling the truth here but I think the mere allegation enough if that's now the standard to take somebody down\nI think we wanted to I don't think there is an allegation I mean I I think we know that I think that when you look at you know I'm ... ... people have put a lot of holes in the story of the the third accuser um and I think that you know you obviously have to hear both sides of\nYou know when an accuser comes forward of their credibility\nThis this is user everything she has

trashed I'd be a little emotional ... as well what happens\nNow everybody's back to their corners it's a very divided country what it has done is equalize the enthusiasm gap which was in the

senator so I'm Talking on policy side I'm so she's not without chops right but at this point in this rates she's being told we just script don't mess up that's what happened in that debate I don't disagree with you that like you know\nDid was she a little plane at the debate yes did she make any major errors no and that's what Barbara Comstock so upset about the debate that you know wants to

terms of their operate search our market tell you what it is so I think this race closes I've seen races close a lot more at this point but this is this is a tough race it's a tough atmosphere and it's a tough district then remember\nA tribute band well [laughter] somebody thing you said again just as she wants to make the ... [laughter]\nI just I got to treat that out at eight thirty\nAre driven Tom Davis ... Peterson and you've got a lot of the truth you John just rhetoric let's get to the other ranchers\nLet's get to the seven I just said Barbara I just said ... around my show yesterday she's a very Catholic candidate no doubt but uh I met some go on for days I didn't think he was gonna win or we should go that way I think he is going to win a Ben how do you see that race\nSo I I had that one had slightly Republican up until the Kavanaugh hearings at this point I think it's a toss up um because what the Kavanaugh hearings did was really re energized and fire up the one voter block that's the problem for Dave Brat in some district which is suburban women\nUm and I think that the seven districts historically Republican should be Republican voter Republican bread left me I'm Still writing my ship 'em but I'm the one path for a Democrat there isn't in regular in Chesterfield with the suburban women\nUm and I think Abigail the match for them and I think that the Republicans are doing everything they can to lose that block naturally right now um and so I haven't is tossing\nI think Bennet drinking Kool Aid on his cabinet nominations in terms of I mean I enter let me just say yeah in in terms of what this is doing politically and I think we all live in our own echo chambers and we all have our own perceptions of how it's done but what this was done in the ... and some other polling demonstrate this is the Republican base is now\nActivated in the enthusiasm gap which is favored the Democrats for the last year and a half is now closed substantially\nAnd I think that works to perhaps paper they bred has two two issues though outside the demographics the district in the DNA that district is Republican number one he is not close the deal with some of you can't trust people and they were just assume thrown under the Boston Red that she'd out for two years\nAnd bring back you know somebody it's more in line with their thinking and and even some scores and secondly Tim Kaine is going to be exceptionally strong in that district he was mayor of Richmond if he has a political he's widely ...\nAnd I think that ... that the I think that's right this this jacks up that democratic turnout there so you got a factor that into this thing I still think at the end of the day that the DNA of that district establishes itself and bright wins but the but this is a close race in Democrats have nominated medical care she's\nVery and whatever happens you're talking about uh somebody that's got to be involved in democratic politics for some time I think I think Abigail Spanberger is going to have to be somebody that has got to be reckoned with a in a democratic circles for some time shop\nDot die you know I don't I'm not I don't know a ton about the district uh uh you know I Will say I was driving down the south side Virginia to go to an event last weekend and going through some of the rural counties and it seems like you and Brad can pull margins out of those counties [noise] uh but obviously the critical mass of the the district is in Chesterfield Penn right go so\nYou know I I Would probably say you know robotically it's a Republican district but obviously if it's a wave here than it could be one that the Democrats deal that would have to defend the twenty twenty\nOr let's get the second district Taylor Maria or whatever happened was Scottsdale or the other day I had him on my radio show or the campaign put my [noise] my name and their team TV ads so I appreciate the PR for that one out of that race but\nThis is my first chance to respond to Scott right after he had his milked on on your show on that went viral yet I'm Upset about our analysis last time I'm announces has not changed he's still news [noise] um and\nUm I don't think I don't believe in New York Times book I think it was you know I I ... up to this point I'd not near controls were pretty good at the last week they've they've not been um I think there's some noise going on\nUm but I think what is going to win and she's going to win going away um so I think she's going to win going away I think it's going to be a [noise] a secular up until two months he was doing everything like um and he's really blown it\nAnd he's not going to win reelection and so are you saying because of the whole the valid issues real soon as there's this you in a way he's handled it and remember that this district is one of the few in the country\nThat not only sits in the ... side a media market but isn't a media market that doesn't really stretch too many other districts so the media has been all over this is on the evening news every night you know if Barbara Comstock at a petition scandal and attempt district\nIt would have made the TV for forty five seconds one night\nOr maybe a week later they quickly re mentioned that you know it goes way you you cannot\nWith something like the tide water it's been on hand to roast so let me let me ... I like I think a New York times for property rights taken is fix that district very well\nOr you know it was a Navy SEAL all kinds of stuff has issued matrix and he's chosen I think you're in line with that district is not a far right kind of guy he understands us a suburban Virginia Beach in those areas too\nAre Democrats have a very good candidate and you have a year that favors Democrats ... which is a Republican what scares me about this is the fact that if you look nationally Democrats just a ton of cash\nAnd dropping a couple of million dollars on that race in the last week get that megaphone just can overwhelm at this point in exaggerate these things and I think they are trying to force correcting papers up today a again if are betting I I I think he wins\nBut in this environment with the kind of money Democrats put down a you've got to be nervous about this here to watch this on election night if the Democrats win this seat it tells me it's going to be a pretty good year for farm in terms of we're talking thirty five forty yeah I just think about [noise]\nThe thing about this district is different than Comstock and it's definitely different than a brat\nIs the turnout model is totally different and I think it's hard for Democrats to win the seat and are not presidential year I just based on who votes democratic and Virginia Beach Norfolk it's you know that the typical democratic voters going to be a minority down there and in less you get an outsized performance it's not\nThat I think it's tough for the Democrats to win that seat I mean Glenn I wanted two thousand and he got flushed down the drain and twenty cats\nAnd the reason was democratic book came out in the presidential year for Brock Obama wasn't there the next cycle for Glenn Nye 'cause nobody knew when I was [noise] um I think God's got an advantage is that the turnout I remember back when I was in the house carcass we'd look at the turnout bottles and the numbers and\nYou know Virginia Beach in Norfolk the numbers are just forty percent of what they are in other parts of the state so it's just it's it's you got a lot of people that lived there that are you know enlisted men or women that are registered to vote elsewhere so it's just it's hard\nYou know to have to bring people out in that type of environment even though was bench correct your one media market and\nYou know they could possible Scott from now till the end of the time but there's going to be a conservative there's going to be a conservative votes is going to come out\nAnd whether I'm a ... I don't know how to pronounce it ... whether or not she can get people out based on her name as opposed to you know Tim Kaine is not as big a magnet there is in Richmond [noise] um so I I still think it's up for the Democrats even though I agree that looks like Scott's kind of watch this one issue\nNineteen Ninety six and Tom Davis one member of this well I'm ... we had a we had a scandal um statewide where John Warner put a television ad up against Mark Warner who was John Warner was far ahead and um he photo shop Mark Warner and do a picture\nOr who's in the picture I Can't remember what we do to stop what he thought it was shot but Clinton I think yeah you ... with Clinton with while her when I was glad there was a racial aspect to it too I Can't remember what they did but they sort of shut my corner into a picture he wasn't in\nAnd I'm an artist TV ad and it was a huge went national scandal for John Warner who had a moderate brand and was a guy that you know everyone looked she likes you know what you're trying to say Scott Taylor is\nThere like had a friend okay and and and that people you know like respected John Warner much higher than Scott Taylor though [noise] and and this number ... ...\nWalked out and he said on the needy person and and the captain of my ship and I'm responsible for what happened and I apologize and it's got telling her down that he would have been around\nFor August I was worse campaign chairman that year and it was a it was a close race Merck more than fourteen million dollars of his own money that year that means is really a much closer race than it might have been otherwise good strong when it was used on the beat of course we'll put them out and you kind of earn it after running a close race there but I remember it out I mean they fired\nThe people that were involved in the ad and everything else and you're broken and it it was an issue for a week or two and then John to accountability and he took accountability [noise] said or has mishandled this thing I think it's just kind of destruction and having his people take the Fifth Amendment doesn't help it just keeps it in the news\nIs that enough to bring down somebody with a good reputation just done a good job in their first term or not\nUm and also I think the wave turnout are they talking about a new wave I think you're really talking with a ... wage that's really what's happening with the Democrats is that the suburban female voters who swung radically or to the Democratic party and that's\nAll right we're going to take our forget our predictions when we get back the next segment we got to get to run again yeah I agree with us\nI'm an ... billion Thirteen when there but not that popular when they're running and libertarian broke five percent and libertarians to automatic ballot access to the next five years in Virginia what's your ... going which are the Republicans\nThat was going to expire this year because of the times had not crack five percent again\nNow they're taking Corey Stewart there'll be another five years would libertarian automatic ballot access loud they're\nGreat and why is that that is a good point point as a matter of fact what is going to get over five no no question probably seven Godfather's here take so what do you think do you think Barbara is going to winter when\n[noise]\nUh what what uh what about Scott ...

quickly John [noise] different it's an amazing that they're not for the reason the Republicans wanted you to be in the making stat [noise] because [noise] people say nothing sticks on Trump\nAnd I think it's the opposite I think everything that comes from the fact that you have an economy that's as good as it is and he's having a going to have a bad of an election as he pointed out everything is sticking to him because you should have with this economy\n[noise] one of the first time that the president picks up see if it was an economy election [noise] um\nYou're having the best economic performance and the biggest gains in the high income areas are the ones turning against in the fastest so for people to say nothing sticks to Trump everything into trying [noise]\nWell I think he get

I was saying this do I think the Democrats take the house is I think it's more likely than not\nUh I I don't know how they don't impeach the president when it comes out you've got to the Democratic

reasonable evidence now I don't know what more is going to say none of it you know what are you going to say um but I just think you look at the base and you look at the fact that the primary

was like you're at a funeral that we already lost the game they were there for a short haired again [noise] [noise]\nRight [noise] and and and and that's and now it's like it's lifted\nAnd and and you could feel the playoffs last year once we got through Pittsburgh it didn't matter if we went down and again people could still\nBelieve in the team and the team could believe in itself I think I think the\nThe the caps in their history was Wayne on the players were they were believing when they went down a goal that the the games are over you and how they because the fans ... every everyone

Vegas that the cash for tickets Fifteen thousand dollars when I catch the ticket the person at the counter told me the biggest payout she's ever paid at the sports book\nOr when people will take about like that and roll it over for two or three seasons and she said you know if the caps three feet and you're all this money over it'll be two million dollars by the time they have to repeat so I'm Still having this dilemma for the rest of the season I have not\nDone anything with the money that because it may be that like you know it was just a thousand dollar initial investment\nI might need to roll it over a couple of times because I think the caps are legitimate threat not only to repeat this year to potentially do you have to repeat I'm only after all every year by year so that's my dilemma but I'm leaning towards the right now I actually think this team is special team and one that um is going to have a lot of success going forward\n[noise] well uh\nI get what you're saying I bet the Astros last year to win the world series attendant one as you know because you put to better about it in for you and I in fact the ticket we did we didn't we didn't just take it as\nAre

whether it will be there or not you know uh I I was joking was Mark Warner and I said you know we well we we need them they're just more and more election [laughter] you know but I mean it's you know\nI'm a generally speaking we'd done better [noise] generally speaking when there's been a Republican in the White House have their print exceptions yes\nGenerally speaking the Republicans have done better when the Democrats than in the White House has there been exceptions yes but the trend is there and it was a mistake will try and understand and I\nI I Would be surprised if we didn't know you know get to a Twenty one in the in the election Adam minimum\nYeah I think I I tend to agree you are you still have to defend a couple of states like you got a couple of comments you got one over on the eastern shore that is in play I think Republicans can hold the black sea if they don't have to buy\nI I think that you [noise] far weaker today a in combat than probably anybody else because some personal proclivities and\n... and things that I think that hurts him among some of those voters we have some stronger candidates or black\nOr and I don't know what happens there you got a hundred and fifty thousand in the bank so I didn't sound like he's ready to go way very quickly but I Will just my advice to him and he got nowhere to hold on one of the phone and you want to go out to undefeated non diet if you could do that and they lost before\nAnd then he comes back but I don't think you want to injure career 'cause I I think you beat him starting with some very attractive candidate a you are but you've got some issue ... after the initial matrix where he has not really thinking or his voting record [noise] um [noise] uh to that district and you've got the state house at fifty one forty nine into redistricting\nThat's critical happened many many I mean we have to wait and see but may work and the Democrats have the\nUm [noise] I mean it would appear that the judges are going to wind up drawing matter house district of south Lebanon house districts\nAnd I think that's what whatever formula they come up with that is going to also be what the Senate's going to have to abide by twenty Twenty one and uh it could change or you know uh it to change an awful lot [noise]\nUm you know a whole other districts are unpacked not totally but below the numbers I mean look what Bobby Scott\nI mean his district one from what fifty some fifty six percent down to you know low forties and I'm a you know produced another democratic district so you're gonna have to see how that plays out but it seems to me\nThat uh the judges drawing that district is by far and away their\nTheir best bet and if they do you know Supreme Court I think it ruled before the gerrymandering is is has been constitutionally permissible until spills over into racial discrimination\nAnd therein lies the problem and that's what the Republicans are facing there and it's going to change its going to change the way you know a whole makeup of legislatures around the country\nWhere it's going to court for a five to four court will do this differently because of the other point when they go back if I may be wrong but I think when they sent it back to that lower court it was like seven\nTo two and actually well I I just think one of the thing is you got to understand the Republican base for better for worse is migrated from the country club at the country and in so doing they've taken so out of some competitive districts were these were economic issues Republicans would be very viable [noise]\nSo it's not just the demographics take when artifacts and things have changed the emphasis on issues in ways that help them in South West Virginia robbery but but it hurts them in the growing parts that\nWe talk about the X. men at him and yet also with a very\nPopular governor with very low negative and you look at ... number ... support amongst Democrats was not popular among Republicans was more polarizing in numbers Ralph Northam has incredibly low negative ads\nFor somebody in this environment you look nationally um he has very high positives very low negatives um and in going into these competitive seats [noise] um I remember in ... eleven and Democrats drew the state Senate lines and they lost the majority and who was the the person who was in every Republican ... ad that was split\nAnd that's a big um item that timetable here\nRan these are still nationalize rates I don't care how you slice of the national environment plays\nBaltimore that you have to have a messenger more help right there are special armed and turn it off the Thomas right\nThe the I mean it that that national scene where he's very heavily you know which is why you've had you know the the patterns that you've had\nUntil McCarthy Cuccinelli I mean you know what happened for almost fifty\nEater I'm a I'm In I'm In just about the surveys like let's take for example that started in the ... seat was not driven by national politics and twenty fifth and it was driven by local politics in Chesterfield versus Richmond and\nI'd like to be democratic um and I think that we\nAnd we don't believe we have more aggressive candidate but we don't have we entered its campaigns don't matter I don't think we had to I don't think we had a great and I ... I think if you read right in that same race in twenty Nineteen\nAnd you had Ralph Northam auntie I'm In that district Ralph would not let me just say are they all vote the votes stardom and it's chaos and it's going to create problems for them\nYeah I think that's a greater problem is that he's he's he's not harmonious with the district on some of those hot button issue I just say that like Rob Portman governor I think it's a wonderful man but he gives a fireside chat in the FARC has now you put him on TV it it it's not the same kind of rally the team but he\nAnnounced it to them every week and he didn't even have to use that I don't know if that's the kind of governor you actually need is you know and he picked up not a fiery he picked up Fifteen states I mean I think\nYour caller is fiery and I'm at a carnival Barker one and and he doesn't he doesn't pick up the slave Ralph Northam\nDid well north of good and pick them up Trump picked him up for him yes if Trump would have been president and twenty Fifteen we'd be in the majority they\nLook I I yeah I I decided I wanted to go to Shawn Ralph Northam disagree however I think he's been very much just say the\nChemical or for my three points and rapport with him on by eight and ... pick up zero seats in restaurants and picked up Fifteen five point difference was not a team of friends who are either but it was also a hotel different let me tell you that\nThe White House mistake about it Trump okay I was a driving factor sure last November on top of that\n[noise] um [noise] you had a ... and spilled over into everything [noise]\nAnd keep in mind Gillespie was not troops you know\nI mean he was very polarized [noise] but um I just think people keep underestimating his governor oh I don't think anybody on the rest of the ...\nI don't think anybody under estimate same but make nervous I mean you know what's driving politics in Virginia right now is not a Ralph [noise] ah it's it's what's going on across the Potomac River\nIt's negativity is driving politics on both sides right now in the one thing about reference he doesn't have any negative [noise] doesn't have many many he's a very like about ...\nI'm not you know art now go you know been knocking on doors since may I have not gotten\nYou know it's ... I mean people liked him he's just a likeable person either\nNot not the problem is you know I I agree with that either NAFTA but he's not a fire reader that gets voted off or\nYou know I I think this is not a fire eater they've got to put up for the Republicans for Twenty years\nEvery single Republican Lippi she would have thought the person was married to Tom Davis because the Republican candidate had his picture bigger than their own picture with a quote from him saying like here's why they'd be great for your time sometimes without permission um so I mean having a messenger is important and democratic not had good ... north of me is the first time in a\nNortherners rice I I agree but now he's taken on income but that was not entirely different that\nI don't know I tell you what man I I'm All right Joe Joe is kind of beat or do you guys under estimating or see and I'm telling you what he had a disastrous for us to offer I wasn't there and it was a\nDisaster of all time so he had the disastrous press conference that really hurt him all kinds of underhanded things going on but you know after that\nMorsi's mayor and you know the the thing about Joe is an independent thinker he's got to do with the only way or you know he's not\nNot a hold on to any of the establishment caucuses or anything like that\nI think he's gonna play very well in that district and I think a lot of his friends there that I don't think that he got screwed by what they did to him and and take\nAdd to the gym or she did the smartest thing I've ever seen anyone to in politics when he won the was it I think it was in the agency but he wasn't Mickey chintzy on each and moved up I think\nAnd in that primary people and think he was going to win that primary crowded field any more than a landslide networks people are asking what did he do he went around and after he knocked on doors at you know and I wrote a handwritten notes every voter he spoke to the data that for\nA week and a half before the election in the context that that he had remembered the conversation\n... kept these postcards for six months and send them all out ten days before the election with a handwritten note from him talking about how their conversation and you know I met your dog sham or you're a teacher here and I remember that conversation and do you know hope I can count on your support next Tuesday and people\nCame out in droves I mean for him to go do that though and I see people read postcards but I've never seen one posting them to make it appear as ... months later okay well companies didn't I'm Tom Davis has everything better than anyone in politics but [noise] but he did that to anyone in a landslide and like him\nIt's it's real or not I\nMean there's not going to be four or five people in that\nRace you are going on just to remind that's ... that's the big difference you\nKnow if we'd had you know there's a lot of people have gotten in the journal stomach because we don't have Ronald\n... in this day a hole and you won't have that you'll just have to people in there and she's well why [noise]\nI don't think I if I had the gas and I I can be totally wrong with the weather in that district and I guess that Ross dance has extremely low name id pardon I Would guess that route the answer is extremely low name id and that if you test it they have a gym or sit and they might not the state of ... I'm just ... but like in terms of I'd name id\nRichard Nixon had on a minute [laughter] you know I Know like I don't think rises like the superstar in the Senate\nDrag on you know Joe and I know Joe rather than it's got to get out out work something like Fifteen or twenty to one okay Joe was out there knocking on doors are making phone calls now he'll just\nBetween the basketball primary too in that primary like Dick was in the ... district for Twenty years before he got drawn to attain the basically has a concept of campaigning and knocking on doors and doing the things that you do when you're in a competitive political rates\nFor Seventy percent of the vote in my district against Mondale yeah rock that's never been a personalized sum\nFor yeah but now that makes it better it says she's never been kept out of and then you got to ask you before and she's got to get out work of a joke on our workers he's fighting Joe he's got he's got worker and\nThe other thing there is a human doting cat I'm telling you he was going to get a trip to clear the sympathy vote out there for the fact that the power base in Richmond screwed this guy out of his livelihood\nAnd that's that's real I mean he got screwed I mean what he pulled his long life it was senator Stanley told me that the whole thing is I ... it was blown out what happened there was a total bologna and\nIt was because uh it was it was it was the cards he challenged the Richmond system that's what I that's why they pulled him and so I I don't remember that\nLike you know there are a lot of people in that area that have [noise] and and this is a loyalty to the gym or the the reason he does well there's a lot of people there that he has represented and when families\nHave had a time of need you know the attorney they went through the criminal defense attorney to help out someone in their family name was ... and that created a level of loyalty he has a ...\nI'm not ready to call this one one way or the other yet but um he has a real ... [noise] it's it's across that district the from being an attorney I'm\nIn the same way that Donald McEachin you know when he when he ran rubber on his running you know him as a primary challenger what three times to incumbent uh twice twice as a challenger didn't come in delegates been one for the challenger don't come and senator\nAnd and the teacher was the guy who everyone news on TV it was a lawyer um he had to help so many people in the community\nRight and enjoy more see I mean he had helped a lot of people in those in those communities where they don't know who to turn to Jim Morsi has been the guy who's defending their ... year there's time um you know against major charges not any he's one of the top defense attorneys there so I just\nI I think that it's an interesting race and and and we've got to see you know will rise even run again we don't\nLet me look ahead to twenty Twenty one the governorship or when it comes comes through and a lot of um determine who's in the White House is using that dynamic and so on but when north um goes well the attorney general Montana governor clashes that who else is looking at this at this point in the Democratic party or as I Know\nI mean there is NO NAME pops up now and then very yellow was not out of the picture either I Would I Would imagine if you will of course but I Would I Would hope that herring in Fairfax things worked out for a procedure contest nomination so\nWhen you got a lot of people in the back looking for upward mobility till you get the mayor of Richmond in the bar stony you've got some other ones you know getting her yellow sitting there on you'll have a primary\nAnd you'll get to see if it's um [noise] as a success or it can be dangerous is only I think if only a\n... as long as you don't have a two way race a between Fairfax area and ah I think that uh [noise] them if it's one of them against the whole batch of other people when [noise]\nUh you know the Fairfax\nCounty somebody outside I like you guys are talking about herring and a Fairfax Ron you're not talking about large stony who was absolutely going to do something here's the other person you're not talking about\nWho could pull the upset in a two or three person race and that's Kenny handling Alexander\nMayor of from Norfolk right now who in a three way primary against to progress is trying to ... liberal West Wing each other Kenny Alexander comes in the sky business track record and the mold of hope water businessman McAuliffe\nBusiness card tolerant ridiculous why that's ridiculous first of all just there's Alexander 'cause there's a and if there's a moderate right or the ... democratic primaries anyway for the first piece safety but the fact that we're in a rough in order to be your state\nThey're not going to line up behind cat I liked the counties a good friend but they're going to either line up behind either herring for Fairfax whereabouts stony and I don't even know I don't I don't know the same thing with all of our record guy people liking but they're either going to go with one of those too\n[laughter] [laughter] well how ... going to be a Republican any Lakers Trump's going to be gone and twenty twenty I was going to win again [noise] ...
