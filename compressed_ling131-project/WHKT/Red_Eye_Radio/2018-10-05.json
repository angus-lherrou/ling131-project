and so I mean it's crazy when everyone else\nIs literally the opposition party they the ... the opposition party I mean the media part of the Democratic party wing of the Democratic party that's what they are aren't interested\nIn telling the truth then this whole New York times story on this or taxes when you saw some\nUnremarkable with the demonstrators that President Trump called the ... it's like it or he didn't come up with some crazy thing to break the law on taxes or anything like that big demonstrated they didn't follow the law this whole thing that the media ... it's just another\nOne thing after another after another after another friend gets it's nonstop when they report this stuff about what President Trump is actually gone the economy or anything\nAnd I I I don't think they're going to do that where do they report stuff on the successes edition restrictions happy they are interested in doing that and the reason being is is that they're using\nTheir power their media platforms to push their agenda the difference between them and us though is is that we didn't seem to embrace part\nBy the way regularly because we have a point of view we are very open about it though that's the difference between Russia's CNN or us in the New York times or the Washington Post they were ... they claim that their objective they're not they push a\nCertain point of view and that's fine they have every right to do that okay they're private companies just like we ... we on but we're honest with our audience we tell our audience were would point of view are coming from they know what they're getting when we're talking to them\nAnd I think the fact that he's media companies are\nLying to their people or to their audiences is discussing and despicable and ... and I think it's the biggest why in the last forty years in in the American media\nOr that they claim to be objective because no person in this country can be addressed you you just can't every decision that you make\nIn the media from what had mine to use to who you interviewed or what stories you're covered so which one do you do and so on and so forth\nAll play into a all play into a ... everything had the opportunity for the instruction by like instill a everything every decision you made is in Florence by your beliefs and so\nI think you're making these decisions on a you should be honest with your audience about what it is that you believe is so that they know what they're getting when they get there and then you can still tell the\nTruth you still have the opposite accuracy rate but the point is is that the all of these media outlets claim to be objective they claim that these are the sole truth but they're not they're coming from a perspective where they're all trying to take down Trump and that's their choice if they can they can put forward that point of view as much as they want to you know that's there\nJust tell the people that just be honest with\nHonesty is the best policy twenty three Pepsi owner John perfect radio network were mad boy leads to political editor of Breitbart News don't want to miss Breitbart News just download the app Breitbart News and then you get to go So Matt\nThese midterms coming up if Kavanaugh gets confirmed on ... on a Saturday and I and I think you will uh we've just kind of do generic poll coming out by quarter pack\nAnd it shows that the enthusiasm gap that the Democrats enjoy plus sixteen has been cut to plus for\nWe need that the generic ballot a\nCongressional house ballot was Democrats plus fourteen three weeks ago that's cut in half the plus seven is there a comeback in the making for Republicans\nI think their heads and by the way there is a ... ah from NPR's new PBS out yesterday that I think it was something like back in the summer it was the Democrats had a ... point\nOn it I Am an enthusiasm gap ah\nAdvantage and now that now it's it's statistically tied to the only two point advantage to the point is that we're seeing lots of evidence or and and we're also seeing in particular race is right like so in North Dakota it looks like Heidi Heitkamp isn't coming back to Washington\nOkay there's been now to pause there was one poll the other day or that had are down ten points there's a poll that came out last night that higher down while points to Republican Kevin Cramer we're seeing a in ... in Tennessee Marsha Blackburn is now pulling away the latest poll last night from Fox News\nHad Marsha Blackburn pulling five points I had a we're seeing Senate race Senate race the Republicans regain Louis Josh holidays\nTied up with what our McCaskill in Missouri were seen Mike Braun tied with a Joe Donnelly in Indiana we're seeing Matt Rosendale hybrid darn tester in Montana so if you do it I think what will happen is and there's plenty plenty of other ones across the country as well\nThe printing is is that when judge Kavanaugh is confirmed to the United States Supreme court it's going to buy in a way that we haven't seen even in these this\nLatest energy on the Republican side it's going to electrify the nation so much so that all these guys are going to start turning into five point Republican rates right like I think you're going to start seeing the energy on the G O P side a\nI'm a lecture fine after a after a judge Kavanaugh gets confirmed people or it's going to fire people out and it's going to deflate the Democrat base not agree\nI mean I don't think to get the Trump base fired up which I Am very familiar because that's the case of my listeners there's nothing I could have done and there's nothing that there's no big enough rally the president could have had there's nothing his campaign team could have done\nKavanaugh saying did I mean so many people just watch this an absolute horror and just believe the shenanigans and a clown show that went on in the Democratic district many I think it's far people up and\nYou're right you know there's there's one poll before this started high campers what you were saying that she was like tied down by one and it was like there was\nThat she was only down by like a couple of points and now now it's down ten to twelve\nYes every poll she's down by twelve she's done a she was going to get reelected mansion was way ahead ride was up by twelve Fifteen now is if I pray and more she's going to be them I don't care what mansion dust because Trump voters have been fired up so they're going to win that they're going to win North Carolina\nThey're going to be Donnelly and they're going to be dominated the Indiana to going to beat me chapter ... she's going to lose a the astronaut in the Florida he's going to lose\nI can see the Republicans have Kevin ... wins Matt I can see the pick it up five seats or even six in the Senate five or ... ...\nThe way to map works right now Republicans could come out the other end with anywhere from ... I think you're ... you're starting from the usa depending on how things go they've got a whole four seats so they've got a hold Nevada Arizona Tennessee in Texas and I think they're going to do that\nYet and then I think and and then they have then there's a bunch of others that are on by like a fat Indiana I uh Missouri Montana\nOr West Virginia or Florida or North Dakota are\nAnd and there's several others on the on the map as well in fact even in New Jersey isn't what we've seen a number of calls and then you're going to the Senate race in the week in fact there was one yesterday that had a Menendez a Democrat only up one point I so the fact is is\nThat there's an Ohio is on the map or what a Michigan or Wisconsin\nThere's plenty of opportunities for Republicans are and they could I mean conceivably entered into the high if they want if they play their cards right now\nIf a if I get from Saturday the Republicans can pick up six seats and run the table I'm never can look up from New Jersey I I don't believe in the polls there and then this is going to win the Democrats are always went there\nBut you know maybe I'll be shocked but I think I think they're going to run the table and everything else and it's got to be a fun night but he's got to get tougher because if he's not the the opposite happens if he's not confirmed\nEvery budget I have talked to on my show says there they're going to be really pissed and dampen the Trump voter enthusiasm so there's a lot of states met boil always good to have you man\nAnd get your perspective you can follow Matt or just go to play for news and that's the after you want to download their that for every day just pop that out and get all the top stories there and they have opinion in prospect of Breitbart News or goats\nI got thrown out of a tournament one time as a junior and the first game\nSo I ...

what the you know about the ten minutes so they spent talking on CSPAN yesterday [noise]\nJohn you make some very good point uh as I understand what you said number one you said than that right\nLeft and right have a have a difference is that just can't be solved right now when\nThe I I I also think you're right the confrontation with McConnell and his wife at trying to go to the Arab toward\nA backfired on the left because I think like you said I'm not you're not dealing with Jim and Amy I'm Seventy years old like I'm done with all this stuff and I think the third thing is I think they have\nThem under the they they look at these Trump rallies and they look at the Trump victory and they look at the level of support the president is able to generate because he does it back down and the Republicans have\nDown for so long it's almost second nature because they don't stand for anything except getting themselves reelected\nAnd I think the Lindsey Graham's in the world and the McConnell's are singing that Trump voters want something else and they\nWill abandon them in a heartbeat if they don't stand for something and so I think that's part of it also but you know look there's this is just out John You're welcome to stay on we uh you you you want but this just and now the White House\nHas released a report that they found no corroboration of the allegations of sexual misconduct against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh this after examining interview reports from the FBI the latest probe into the judges background\nIt's unclear whether the White House which for weeks has raised doubts about the allegations\nUh the White House is telling us they're linking that\nThe conclusions from the report aren't definitive at this point and so there's no new

without so much as a buyer leave I don't think he's good with money and I think that should be known about Tim Kaine\nFollowing the race because you've got to win so you know I don't like to spend time on things that I like\nTo think about what people spending our money that makes sense to me yeah she's known\nI mean you know Tim Tim Kaine is it's got to vote with the liberal um [noise] five percent of the time I mean there's a couple of them taking away our\nShow us yes yes yes but\nIt's like you know it's it's like\nA [noise]\nOn the ... the guy that trying to get out of this

that preceded the praying my friend but you're you're doing the work out there getting the message out and the message this week was basically\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd I'm like that thing that that that abomination that they signed in Nineteen Ninety four for NAFTA [noise] um this is actually good for America what a concept [noise] I Know right\nWhere with Peter Navarro hit is I mean I'm telling you you you know this better than I I mean NAFTA was a bad deal for America to China getting into the WTO and two thousand and one which was pushed by by Clinton in Congress bad deal for America twenty\nTwelve south Korean deal I mean we lost over a hundred thousand jobs from Maryland the auto industry that deal for America I mean the president is line in these things up a well like uh the pins in a bowling alley and knock them down and it's beautiful thing to watch\nIt really is where when Peter Navarro he's assistant to president for trade and manufacturing in the west wing he's also a senior economic policy advisor\nTo some of the items in this new deal the U.S and see U.S Mexico Canada that some of the differences some changes if you could go through some of the bigger ones that would be great [noise]\nSure let's start with the easy stuff which is the modernization in agreement back in Nineteen Ninety four there were some things that didn't exist and therefore did eat a provisions are one of them obviously is digital train which is the protection\nOf of copyright Perino actual property to transfer to do within that something as simple as a\nAs an electronic book you might might buy and read\nHave strong provisions or for that there's a there's these things called biologics which is a reference to a gig\nComplicated of pharmaceuticals are that are very\nResearch intensive that are designed a overtime to cure things like cancer rheumatoid arthritis or whatever and uh we got a strong protections for that are up to ten years why is that important is because unless companies have protection\nA so that they can make some money on these things over a period of time or they won't put in the money for the research and development so so that's that's\nAll good uh so so innovators in taking care\nOf a digital trade taking care of now um\nAnother a small but important thing relatives the scope of the whole deal\nUh we were able to resolve some of the dairy issues with Canada and so uh that's good news will have much more market access there as well as for other types of products like chicken and egg things like that so that's good for me as a director of the office of trade manufacturing policy\nOr the the the big white whale here that we actually got was a bringing back the supply chain to North America\nParticularly for the auto industry with NAFTA did in Nineteen Ninety four is create a set of incentives to offshore our auto parts industry in turn or vertically integrated\nAnd that didn't just happen here in the U.S it happened in Canada and Mexico as well so the key provision is Seventy five percent of the of any car that that's a name has to have\nA a a U.S part Seventy five percent and then to ensure that the u._s. gets its fair share\nOf that regional conscious and ah there's a strong provision for labor in their strong provision for the environment so you can't have sweatshops and pollution have in South of our border grabbing that business so that's kind of ... dramatically change\nThe structure and supply chain of the global auto industry in a way where we is as a door just purchaser a vehicles a per capita a will benefit from that so that that's that's that's the big deal it's it's great news for this country and\nThey're also safeguards that were discouraged China for instance from jumping into Canada\nAnd then bringing them into the U.S by a third party which they've been great\nTo be crushing yeah yes there are a and um we were written that you've been enhanced border for a review and

now the Democrats in red states hike camp mansion in a tremendous Fox\nPolls are showing in their states there is overwhelming support for judge Kavanaugh especially now that\nSomehow a beat down on western supporters to the point that they don't vote 'em and then can simultaneously encourage Comstock I'm I'm supporters to vote so it's a real up he'll challenge [noise]\nOkay so let me ask you a few questions I uh looked at the cross tabs in I just have a couple of questions if I may sure um I didn't see him bring down for a range obviously Tom stocks much stronger in western part of the reason I didn't see a regional breakdown\nYeah because we didn't wait on it um [noise] we we we we try to wait as minimal as possible I'm In a survey and so we wait on race um sex and I'm an age\nAnd um we don't wait on\nRegion I I'm simply uncertain about you know how comfortable I Am waiting on rejoining a congressional district survey I'm with a smaller sample size if I had\nFifteen hundred respondents I'd feel more comfortable doing it but\nWe have seven hundred and Ninety correspondence here which is larger than some of the other polling that's coming out um you know it's a respectable sample size but when you start breaking a congressional district down into regions you're talking about moving um or waiting I'm you know thirty and forty voters at a time and\nI'm simply uncomfortable methodological doing that and so we didn't wait a sub regionally which which is how you would characterize his sub originally within the congressional district [noise]\nSo after having said that since no breakdown of region and I understand your reasoning um\nThe wireless meters you polled forty six percent of your correspondents were making over a hundred and fifty thousand dollars obviously if you live in that area that's about what's your bag so I get that\nA sixty four percent were making over a hundred thousand but what that says to me it's a really didn't sample the western part of the district at all which is Barbara stronghold because um [noise] her voters they're\nMake well under a hundred thousand dollars going out into the Winchester area\nSo sure but what am I a quarter\nOf respondents are making under a hundred thousand dollars and um [noise] the the the the larger part of the population in that district is on the east\nYou're saying is the voters are there's more voters in eastern they make more money about twenty five percent\nIf you told us not enough to put a barber in a I'm In a competitive position is that the way I understand\nIt well I mean you generally that's what I'm saying um the the income breakdown looks very similar to what the district looks like so if you look at age if you look\nAt education if you look at all the basic demographics I think we're accurately reflecting the district pretty well I'm recognizing that a Barbara Comstock stronger on the western side of the district in on the eastern side of the district it also is the fact that the west side of the district is population\nIs much smaller much lower than the more urban and suburban eyes the eastern part of the district\nSo what are the question I have is um and I appreciate your coming out because the jury is is this is fun normally you know you just say what you're told as I really tried to spend some time to figure it out [noise]\nUm so according to your poll Barbara Comstock is leading west and buy one where\nEach of four forty five plus right Colorado barbers winning that group forty five an older is it possible you may have over ... sampled a\nYounger vote in the district\nUm now if you look at our cross ... if you look at our demographic breakdown our our age [noise] you know here's the deal we know what the age distribution of the district is because we know that the voting population is with census data and so\nUm you know we're talking to about twenty five percent of voters who are thirty five an under um Seventy five percent of voters or [noise]\nOr a thirty five an older in uh actually eighty percent of voters or thirty five an older so we're not\nOver sampling young voters in disproportionate to their share of the voting age population in the district um you know the district looks the demographics of the survey look look pretty much like what the district looks like um [noise]\nAnd we have we have access to all this sort of data so we we know what the district's gonna look like [noise]\nSo you've also have low approval ratings and the district by President Trump I'm just approved fifty nine percent improved thirty eight percent and along with that\nAlthough you didn't told a Senate race you said that you did ask the question within the district and the king was beating store uh\nIn the district by Twenty one fifty five\nTo thirty four which basically is doomsday for stored I mean you can't I mean what if I mean I've said this over and over and over having\nRun the Trump campaign in Virginia in two thousand sixteen I mean we carried south West Virginia by big numbers but when you lose Fairfax I think we lost Fairfax\nAlexandria in Arlington by a hug\n[laughter] I mean there's not enough people in Radford to make that up you simply can't make it up it's just too many yeah and I\nAnd I think you know you pointed out Trump's approval and you pointed out\nUm the Senate race numbers and we did those uh\nBecause we wanted to test really what we think are\nThe two ... two of the big things that are shaping this election in a tent\nUm what kind of headwinds are coming out of Washington I'm a related to Donald Trump and are there are coat tails or lack of hotels are negative coattails when it relates to the Senate race in both of those situations\nThat Comstock is facing strong headwinds out of Washington are a lot of her constituents aren't happy with the president and what he's doing and what Republicans are doing and Corey Stewart isn't helping in any way in fact he's probably hurting because\nPeople who aren't excited about coming out to\nVote for a Senate race or a half to get excited about their local race and if they're not excited about their local race are likely not to turn out to vote and you know so that means Republicans who would otherwise be excited about Corey Stewart and aren't\nA Barbara Comstock has to work extra hard to attract their attention to say look you need to come out and vote in this congressional race even if you're not happy about Corey Stewart\nSays something\nJust a kid that you can glean from the polling in the days you spend in a sense of history what it's if you could give a figure or I'm a ballpark to what degree is Corey Corey Stewart on the ballot\nTo what degree is he hurting farmers ability to get reelected like if you were put it on a scale of one or two in one being much tending a yeah big time what would it be based on your readers Paul\nWell ... probably somewhere below five I'm probably somewhere between two and five or\nThree and five I mean I think to some extent he's been baked into the to the calculation for\n... to ... you know for some voters but I Do think there is it is the case that turnout is typically higher in the U.S Senate race than it is in a local congressional race and so if you happen to have a U.S Senate race going on in the same near the your local congressional races going on\nAnd you're or Senate candidate is way\nAhead and you need those coat tails that's good for you and Barbara Comstock doesn't have that this year she's got um a Senate candidate who's running behind 'em by anywhere from ... we have I'm Twenty one points behind in this district state why he's running behind anywhere Fifteen or twenty points\nThat's not helpful to Comstock it's hurtful to her um because she has to work her campaign has to work extra hard\nTo reach out to those voters who would otherwise be engaged because they are engaged by the Senate race she's gotta work extra hard to reach out to them and say look I Need you to still be engaged for me and I think that's part of the problems he's having\nSo I think it would be fair to say look you have to have the numbers [noise]\nStrict and the second the other two competitive was uh I Would say so I Would think you're probably gonna gonna see that\nStewart thing a drag on all the Republicans in Virginia ... hoarding competitive races because of the toxicity of of some of the things he's said and done All right I've only got\nHalf a minute are we going to get your back on are you going to do a poll on the second and the seventh also\nWe're in the field we went in there last night on the second I'm sure right after we took this went out we went into the field and the second will come out in about\nEight days with that and then we're going into the field and the seven and will come out um later October on the seven so we're spending our season during congressional polling because the Senate race doesn't look very competitive [noise]\nAll right well we should have a lot of fun that means we'll have you went back to at least two more times with that and then we'll keep our tradition and have your why the day of the elections and make your final pony productions doctor Clinton said thanks for being with Abigail burger coming out Democrats seventh district even writing\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nActually in violation of law and winning outside organization received that document they proceed itchy and pass it on to numbers of media without taking the steps to protect my Social Security number my medical history and [noise]\nWell that was irresponsible no question about it\nSo as far as the information generally do you think it was just in topics by somebody that just didn't know what they were doing or you think there was some kind of a conspiracy\nThere's currently an ongoing conversation and so I I Can't necessarily comment on that topic\nAnd fair enough let's get to debate\nEurope toner Dave Brat\nHas said when we talk with campaign about these debates said that\nThey had not officially committed to the debates beyond the first one in October fifteenth which is going forward\nAnd she put out a very strongly worded statement blasting day for backing out a saying that they were supposed to be three debates of course the third debate was with me which hasn't been set so that date has not been said even though I've I've asked about a hundred times a\nOut for being scheduled debates I mean were they scheduled ...\nYet so you know he's he's talked on your show event about the fact that we've agreed to multiple days we had identified a location we identified a place uh our teams have done independent walked through the\nRehab they've done to walk through these other location we told media partners we had the media lined up a local TV station that was going to [noise]\nTo air it everything was set up the only thing we had set out a press release um and that was something that we had been I'm pushing for and certainly the host and the media partners had been pushing for\nUltimately then after a couple of weeks and you know John I'm not the one taking the primary lead on this but I think about two weeks or so our team the host\nAnd the television station trying to get you know trying to get approval on how to put out the wording on we were told that he would no longer be committed to doing that second debate that we had already detailed\nAnd that he would in fact or his team would in fact confirm it on the sixteenth October whether or not we would attack to move forward with the with the debate scheduled for the twenty fest okay so\nAs far as now the debate on the twenty fifth which is which was the second televised debate is not a done deal even though other team for a walk through they want to wait and see how the debate on the fifteenth and I just know\nI mean I I'm not going to sign on their their reasoning for wanting to wait until the sixteens it it it seems like a plausible reason but they they did not provide us with the reason why they want to wait until the sixteenth denouncing farm I Do know there's been\nStaffing changes on his team that might have been a contributing factor um by it but overall when we set up the parameters of the debate one of the things that\nLarge district um and certainly\nFrom North to south stretches quite quite a long distance that it was important talks to have the ability to have to be\nYou know throughout the district north center of the district middle the district in southern portion of the districts that they were under vigils would be able to attend 'em and\nAnd that was something that was a priority because now are the first one as of right now the only to date is a very northern part of the district which I print played as a pretty significant burden on anyone coming from the southern portion of the district or even the center of the district to\nGet her colpepper particularly given the time in the debate\nWho am I don't know what I'm gonna tickets for that when they sold out within less not\nOn and there's many many individuals who have reached out to our campaign saying that they tried to get tickets but were unable to do so\nWell and uh my debate which was the third debate\nGotten a date from Dave seem\nThe spanberger team I just want to mention had said that um they said that they they have they given me a bunch of ... to go back to the day team\nWith and we've not been able to get that done either hopefully we'll get that done in the next week or so okay let's get the judge Kavanaugh you're on the job from his radio network trucks and truth across America
