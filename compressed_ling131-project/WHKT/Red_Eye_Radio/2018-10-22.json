morning\n[laughter] you'd be both and I go through a pot I'm I'm here I'm no I'm just ... ready to go to Mike what's going on in New Hampshire these guys\nWell I'll tell you what we got a we had a couple of presidential candidates running for twenty twenty already here in the last week so ah things are wrapping up\nSo this is only for the Democratic side no Republicans have gone up there right\nNo well you know this is talk of course about John Kades six aunts or Jeff Flake running against Donald Trump for the Republican nomination\nI actually wrote 'em and op ed for uh the statewide paper here in New Hampshire just last week and it's pretty silly to take on Donald Trump I'm a ... you know can years\nOr ... any time a Republican primary where a sitting president has been challenged it's been on the right in jobs and these guys are be running on the left they really wouldn't have a prayer\nFeeding the presidents and the Republican primary\nRight now right now that's that's right now anything can happen goodness knows when I'm hanging up anything\nCan happen any thing of course and especially you know God Forbid the economy collapses\nRight right that's what it was like no one like that but it's but if what if Mueller drops of big weren't things can change All right let's let's shift to the Democratic\nNomination credit primary where I think we're four hundred and Seventy nine days away something like that from the Democratic primary hamster [laughter] who's counting\nRight now that's why I think it's I think it's smart Chris for you to to be talking about this stop and go because the the the presidential stuff you know there's there's all kinds of things happening behind the scenes right now\nThis is where it happens right the pro life pro frozen them then [laughter]\nAnd come the day after November's election candidates start doing things in a more public way but like I said senator or your brand from New York was up here yesterday campaigning with us\nShe's laying the groundwork she's and and you know she's doing that all across the country and um [noise] ah so she's starting to to put things together I'm Alec Baldwin may seem Shelley I'm sure you've heard about it to the guy he's making rounds he think he made his second\nTrip to New Hampshire just this past week ... real\nTwice in the last six months Alec Baldwin Alec Baldwin and he said he has not ruled out running for president\nHe Mike we are making news this morning this is my comment in my producer the show looking at we're making news this morning the ball like this one\nYoung talent Alec Baldwin has um a spoke at the largest fundraiser for the Democratic party in New Hampshire who um aren't just last week yeah\nWow see the ran his old our Baldwin's Jack Ryan you know it's kinda my God yeah but [laughter]\nThat was back in the Cold War you know hundreds of October [laughter] that's right yeah so who else you've seen up in in New Hampshire and who would you guess to be the front runners in the New Hampshire primary today likely to win the twenty twenty primary in February of next year European\nBernie Sanders run for president he will be the front runner okay Jeff no doubt about it now I'm In New Hampshire no doubt about ... if he doesn't uh Dan Elizabeth Warren will likely be the front runner\nOkay so how about what recently happened was Senator Warren in New Hampshire how does that play with her I mean fumbling of the DNA ancestry ball this week the disaster\nHere now and democratic circles I actually don't think it does much a liberal Democrats are going to be looking for a liberal Democrat regardless of facts\n[laughter] you know they think they serve their choices in in positions primarily on emotion in in a\nJesse Paris from Iowa just going to do if you heard that\nA very a veteran democratic operative in Iowa was describing a I'm a scene but in reality in the in the Democratic voters the primary voters but they also want to win and they might go you know I don't think seniors can win nationally I think you\nKnow I I ... that's the I mean not all I'm a Republican I think it was about the war would have a similar problem\nI don't think she's electable in the in the general election nationally nationally okay yeah I I look for the you know for that using our TNA\nIssue as an example I'm ... and so like the one thing I Will say though it's a I I don't think it affected her here in New Hampshire I Do think it affected the again the behind the scenes operation\nA and then you know uh that's all the maneuvering going on behind the scenes among potential democratic candidates\nFor her to actually take over a news sites all before\nThe election the way she did was uh\nWhy why would I mean if you knew the results of the DNA test and it was counter to your narrative that you're trying to look after you put that thing up midday on Christmas [laughter] have you been married right\nNow I don't understand it so how do you think okay so you got Sanders worn just because of this New Hampshire but the other guys have got to go up there and compete or do they have to they might say just say you\nKnow and I think they do I think that you know because there's always going to be opportunities and that's as you probably yo ... ... um do Clinton made a name for himself by doing well and and coming back\nTo to win at a time when he was losing so you don't have to win the New Hampshire primary to make to make all of waves across the country\nSo especially as Elizabeth Warren's the congressman from Massachusetts neighboring Massachusetts the candidate who comes in second and even third or a kitten get momentum as a result\nYeah because I think Clinton finished third right yeah that's right yeah so\nSo but you have to win pleasure show in New Hampshire to advance do you have to yeah that's right that is correct and I just I don't think people understand about the the democratic nomination process this cycle is that California\nHas moved up yeah and they're going to mess with expensive state and Kamala Harris McConnell Eris is going to have a big lead there\nYes and that's the I think that's going to be an interesting thing I didn't hear if you guys talked about this was on the Iowa\nA conversation but what she does in the early primary states will be interesting given the California moved up will she tried well we'll see try and a ... and pick a state to do well in order to try and do well in all of them and um you know 'cause they're so different to the early primary states ... compared to California\nWell again I think you have to at least try to compete in some of these because\nThe reality is even though you might not win New Hampshire you won't matter and the the\nNomination legitimately so you still have to win it in the in the electoral college that's right you can't you can't just blow past Iowa New Hampshire because those are those who have gone in either direction we especially with Trump winning Iowa last time that's right no doubt about it what issues are dressed in New Hampshire voters these days what's going on up there\nWell it didn't expect uh uh the economy is still the number one issue um the governor here a is a Republican Christian who knew and he's\nAnd uh uh with what Donald Trump's been doing it has and governor Sununu the economy's booming we have the second lowest unemployment rate in the country\nAnd um or the Democrats don't want to talk about that they're trying to talk about anything but the economy with\nA family you know he paid leave issue ... they're just trying to make up an issue that might connect with voters authors in the economy so that's going to continue to be number one the second issue here Chris I I don't know how it worked in other\nStates you've heard Donald Trump even talk about this is the opioid epidemic grew a which is pretty simple pretty severe and New Hampshire so that's the second biggest\nThe upper hand everything we've had we've had the we've had that disease in our family as well and it's a it's a scourge of member people dying as a result of that is the doors anything else that country and you have to say that I was told that will get a handle on it but I don't think that's part of it as I\nSaid it's not a partisan issue Mike a final production as what do you think coming out with got thirty seconds punch it when he got further the Democratic nominee or the Democratic finishers in New Hampshire twenty twenty\nI say it's going to go uh oh was that the war in a moment when a extreme aren't going to win the New Hampshire primary um I think they're going to be I think there's going to be some kind of dark horse like a um a Cory Booker I expect will be somewhere in the top\nThree um Iran and then you know what I I I Would not be surprised at someone like Michael Bloomberg long is it as well because the Democratic state we need to read the paper all of a businessman\nSays All right Mike Denny joining us from the Granite State of New Hampshire four hundred and eighty days plus or minus out of the New Hampshire primary thanks for joining us we'll be back on the John ... filling in that Chris I smoked\nHow how do you know we're not going to let a lot of money I mean the nor nor should you nor should anyone in both but how do you how do you compare the intensity this year to last year when he was the same similar not as intense when he says well\nSimilar but I think we we're we're very proud particularly in Virginia last\nYear when we send a message to the country into the world that you know hated bigotry have no place here and that we were open and welcoming for business with the election of governor north\nHim and his team and then you know that that jumps verse set of a house candidates that got across the finish line that just beautiful tapestry of um of of of our our\nOur candidates that are women and a diverse women and I just it just eat up so that was that was really great but I think\nWhat has happened is people realize we have we can do this we can do this and it's just helped Doubleday I mean we've seen for example the surge in the absentee ballots seeing 'em in Fairfax County and Orange County which our number one and two right now in the state\nOr requests for absentee ballots you know that's good for us that's that's really good movies I think we're just added you know adding more excitement and enthusiasm right\nLike quitting kid was on earlier in the seven o'clock hour he said he's he thinks the turnout is going to be forty to forty five percent that's a large it's a large a range and there but where do you all projecting turn out right now\nWe're just going out there looking for every single vote\nAnd stuff [laughter]\nHard but we have a reason to get out there is a lot at stake and um and ah so what's going to be better than your average near term that I'm you know I'm not in the business of\nOf that we're just gonna we're we're just reaching out or we can you're describing grant yeah we're in a G. O. T. V. now phase and we are just trying to get our our vote and bring over anybody else that wants to come\nUp the been impressed with your with your crop of Kansas this year and last year they they definitely worked hard when when that struck me as a sort of an obvious one is that your the dominance of the male candidates nominees\nRight at it this is definitely the year the woman I like to talk about our women candidates and then I got an Anthony Flaccavento that and the night [laughter] I mean for one thing is is I mean and they're all they have a different kind of experience and diversity but it is also good at all will be a good refreshing\nBrass I'm a for Congress and across the crops up autonomy several states that are in general for West End up there on the chance congressional\nDistrict God we're really excited about what we see up there\nAll the volunteers are just showing up on non stop and the Washington Post endorsed her which is something that I'm a you know at Barbara Comstock got endorsed every other time when they're very disappointed at her stretches go state after Donald Trump and that proved not to be the case so her ...\nGoing to be um a congresswoman and then down and I'll just run through a real quick if you want to you asked me something about him but we will go out on the line at loyal and the second district a retired navy commander in a small business woman and\nOf course Scott Taylor's got he's on his own problems with a ... you know trying to cheat and quite frankly and on\nAnd and and having a staff or put staff fraudulent ah signatures on the ballot I mean that's you know that's ... that's pretty seemingly and I I think the voters are going to reject that but\nBut even that we you know without that we still have a fine you know could credible candidate\nWell I wouldn't have I don't know what I've seen in your in your kid is you have to do that obviously a female when I think it says regardless of the outcomes and we can\nTalk about polling and outcomes in November and you know when kids got the Taylor up and he's got less than a Coburn and ...\nWilliams and Louis in the in the six or when I think it's sending a signal do is move that you're going to see even more women in the future running for office regardless of party and I think it's a very healthy dynamic\nYeah yeah and I wanna I Wanna I Wanna say two things on that real quick we really excited that Leslie covering it just got moved into the red to blue um program for the D triple C but the thing I think you're exactly right about women women have always um um\nWomen have always and studies show yes but you know then the one that would and I know your mom would agree with me on the U.S would have\nBeen built over my heart so farmers getting knocked my time don't go\nAway that raise my kids I got to get my degree\nIf you have to say good outcomes of twenty six change was when I decided well not waiting anymore we step out and bought something to offer and I\nI think that you will just seeing more and more of that because someone sad is that what I'm saying and I don't know who was you know if you're not to table you're on the menu and if you look at what is it state this year with women's health care thought with families ah\nWith health care in general you know women have a lot to add to that and there we just don't think we're going to step back anymore\nNo no no I don't I don't think you should and I think having the frankly it's not just that they're women but they're but they're in a certain age range to relatively speaking to me a couple of you know we're older little younger but for the most part you're you're center cut on mom's right the suburban mom is is it is a strong voting I won't say walk but a market\nThat I I think your party is obviously intentionally trying to attract\n... correct correct and I'm very suburban moms some of them who voted for Donald Trump I think have seen the ramifications of that vote and we are reaching out and talking to them and particularly when you take something like the Kavanaugh's nomination where you know set aside the fact\nOf whether you didn't they didn't believe Dr for just as a man who ... we saw back his temperament that is not fit to be a judge and then add on to it the fact\nOf you know her very compelling test in testimony and um and and they you know Republicans decided not to believe up to ... there's going to be some ramifications from that\nWe've got um let's talk about mostly Coburn moving from into the treat the triple C\nA red to blue program um you're you're making the news here in the John Frederick radio show this morning we've had the other folks make news about nothing on Iowa and Steve bullock is a potential outsider and ... and the hamster wheels so [laughter]\nYou're you're ... I'm three for three but my callers here so this is news was Coburn is moving into this special category of funding from the D triple C talk about that\nWell we just we just got that information ourselves and that just shows you know that's an open seat we've always thought it was very competitive and uh we we are pleased to\nSee that um that the inside the beltway group recognize that as well she splits Seventy two thousand miles on her car you know the ... district has really really dig it goes from up in a faulty accounting all the way down to the north Carolina line it's got a lot of different you know raw but you know it's got Charlottesville area in it too it's got\nYou know then you've got sort of a D.C suburbs last fall here so you got a little bit of everything that she is really a campaign in every part of that district and ah and I think that you know here here here and it towards the end they sound like you know\nSolve the value in investing more in her\nIt also says hey they have the resources to do it right well that's a good point too I think that is and if you've seen the articles that in you know\nActually out raising 'em or the Republican incumbents like can you look at Dave Brat versus Abigail Spanberger I think she outrage Chan three to one maybe a this last um [noise] yes this gets written reports on\nAnd on and and you know that's just what we're

in I Do occasionally I'm I'm a former member of the Virginia house of delegates I surf from two thousand two to two thousand ten and currently I'm the executive director of Virginia free the foundation for research and economic education\nVirginia free is a nonpartisan underlined nonpartisan boldly nonpartisan\nA a visit pro business out of the advocacy organization here in the comic they're not for Thirty years\nI'm not really a pro business we're also very much a working towards responsible pro business government because as we heard in the\nIn the news updates Mike we heard that the China's economy is slowing down its growth and that's a problem they have a significant debt burden and their economy is slowing its growth down there\nYou know you're trying to be be that guy and that has that has devolved to where we are today largely as a result of several factors\nI'm One that the Iraq War out to the collapse of the economy in two thousand and eight and a and that has led to this massive worldwide suspicion of government\nOr what's going on today this unsettled place that we are in this world is not just manifesting itself in the United states we are not alone in this in this in this cultural shift as manifesting itself in politics\nIt's showing up in Hungary in Poland in\nIn Germany over the weekend in ... which is actually I ran into a [laughter]\nGerman political these are the weekend fancy that right you're going to exchange program I didn't want to go to the vet and my wife to like I really don't want to go somewhere much football I Want to chill out Sunday night it was a great game on Bob oh go you'll have fun okay fine subsidies to German teachers\nTrying to have a conversation and thinking I don't know any German right what are you gonna do ... you know you have all the [laughter] house Hitler you know [laughter] you know what do you go with that conversation well it turns out there\nUm and I and I said so who how are the electricity in Bulgaria because they're very they're lectures on Sunday it was a very important election in Germany\nThat's the kind of guy and that's what I follow and well this one teacher was a teacher of politics so then we went down a rabbit hole two hours later at the dinner table we just we just were chewing up politics\nAnd when he was telling me about but very was is that is extremely successful economically it is the richest region of Germany for full employment like\nThree percent unemployment youth unemployment is extremely low\nOr their school system is set up to get people to work straight away um if if you're like a tenth grade and you're not you don't really want to go to university you don't have to fake it to make it you can go right into a a a trade school with a print is program and you're gonna get a job and you get a diploma so they get um really it's a very work intensive area they\nThey pride themselves culturally on work and productivity an organization and good government\nRight there it was like a it's not like a shining example of how you would want to have a state where a region actually be everyone's employed or has a job\nEverything functions ah and it works well they had this major upset in the very intellectual and you know what are you upset about what what could you possibly be that concerned about\nThat you basically blow up this and it was they blow it up but how does major upset in the ruling party that had been has been in control\nFor decades last probably the ... the ruling majority in Bavaria and it was stunning to me to realize that we're not immune from that here and here in America so people say you know the economy republic Israeli economy's going so great vote for us\nPeople don't vote on yesterday's news they don't vote on today's news\nThey vote on the future where are we going where what is going to be happening that's my fear that's my concern because things are going well you know with Donald Trump got elected gasoline was about two twenty five a gallon now it's around two eighty two thousand eight was four dollars a gallon or better but are we getting better are we getting worse\nYou know it's here that China news today about their economy is slowing down its growth rate of growth\nAnd that has a factor on the human psyche about how how's it going to manifest itself in my life you see these commercials they're not all about you know skills and here's my dad says there about\nThis guy's off all she's horrible there ... there but there is no big overriding issue like here's what we're going to do in the future it's just that the other person's really bad therefore they're not going to be good for you um and therefore because you kind of going to say well they're gonna hurt the economy I guess is what the extra Appalachian isn't the subconscious\nBut I'm going what is the big driving issue other then obviously Donald Trump and it's a fascinating time in American politics are what are reasons why do what I did because it is so interesting but also to teach people as I used to tell my my students I really don't care I'm really don't care\n[laughter] what you think I care that you think if I can encourage people to be more interested about what they're talking about to read another\nCreate a better outcome for the rest of us and I tell my students I don't care who you vote for I just care that you vote but if you don't vote understand that's also a vote\nIn itself because you were saying I'm not I'm not doing this I vote none of the above and it's and that's and that's tabulate in it'll aggregate itself just like the vote will and that people do that doesn't make any sense actually it does\nIf you don't show up for something the two political parties going to try to get you to show up next time we're trying to reach out to you in some way shape or form that data point will register\nI told her students are of a family I was at a baseball game with\nAnd they were so upset or you just can't stand going and I did not vote if they haven't earned your vote don't vote and tell them that you don't put it on social media like he would anyone else anything else say I'm not voting you haven't earned\nMy belt you haven't got me off my couch off my dollars to go down and say I'm voting for this person you don't register it'll aggregate data and that raw data collection and is dissected by the political class to determine what they want to do\n'em and they're in an ... swings on the undecided voter right the independent voter in October is like oh we're going to\nStop talking about these issues that you motivate our base to a degree we're going to focus on these\nOh I'm really happy to work with the other side received this now and in certain kinds I work with the president's wife showed up the polling independence and they might not like President Trump but when they agree with them you better work with him to get 'cause that's just you know all politics is personal not just walk anyway this course action and filling in for John FedEx if you tuned in to hear me drawing on\nAbout politics and what was this guy a I'm a former member of the house of delegates I'm filling in for John Brennan as I Am wants to do\nA as John is on vacation with his son down in Florida in a baseball tournament a John as a baseball fan by looking as well but he was a pitcher in college and his son Joe Joe is a picture\nOf you want to call and ask me some questions love to hear from you\nIt eight eight four five six four six eight eight four to five six four six eight eight eight for eight oh five six four six four you can taxidermy straight away five four zero to nine four zero six eight zero five four zero\nTo nine four zero six eight zero I'm going to have some great experts on later today quitting cake CRISPR Newport Jack was simply Republican Party with congressman Rob Wittman\nA doctor Robin McDougal from the Virginia Commonwealth University of Wilder school and Jesse Harris from Iowa who is a political operative and uh as as on the Democratic side in from the Republican side from New Hampshire it we'll hear from identity and Susan slacker or my good friend from the Central Valley\nUh we're I'm known citizen for you know gosh early nineties I think well I certainly aging yourself there's there isn't\nA Democrat a chair a chair of the Democratic party Virginia is from highland county ... county I used to represent\nAnd they've known Susan for for decades and so we have we have a great friendship and I and I'm looking forward to having all these callers calling today and stir up the conversation on our big do a little deeper we're going deeper today in politics we're going to go deeper dive in not just you know the polling the top one numbers but how those posters got\nWhen a university does a polling like CRISPR Newport you'll hear Clinton talk about this they start with a very broad universe um and it keeps coming down to a smaller universe of actual likely voters\nMinutes\nAnd we'll get to that we're getting to the nitty gritty what can be able to get you take you do a deeper dive so when you look at the polls when you go back to real clear politics which which I spend unfortunately way too much time on a bike is is healthier than other websites right [laughter]\nThis this is the healthy Internet\nOr ... or ... you look at these different polls and and you go like to stick to take a look at the uh\nThe polls on um the generic ballot it's insane what a what the what we're looking at here called up its it's fascinating like generic ballot follow this track plus Democrats ... Democrats plus five Democrats plus eleven\nDemocrats possible having democratic plus one what how do you get there\nDid you say the polling is wrong well poems always right it's just data you're collecting other people call what the differences isn't the methodologies who you're going I talked to one leading I'm democratic\nSource\nAnd I said okay what's your polling showing me and he said Democrats are around mid low thirties thirty four thirty three percent thirty two that range Republicans we've never seen self identification for Republicans is while it's around twenty four percent and what used to be you know thirty\nFour thirty four is now thirty four twenty four and independents are up around the lower mid forties because Republicans have never been lower on self identification but we haven't picked up any of those voters they're all self\nIdentifying now as independents that is huge and when you get down to it with people when they understand what's really going on that's when they get more excited more engaged this is Chris X. men selling for John Frederick it eight four five\nHappy birthday I have a beer you know put a picture of his his her brother with this with the Budweiser just reminded me so much to my friendship and I'm a black how blessed I was to have it in my life but also\nA what a what a blessing and it's just to be alive right to be able to ah just to be experience at all and I'm Wondering is I I enjoy coming in during his radio show where they get to hopefully get people excited about politics I'm against it does governor lives it is important\nYou know we can't break down we have to work with each other to get good things that we should have the debate though we should have a vibrant vigorous debate that right moves the country forward um and we shouldn't be afraid to have that debate but we should have in a in a civil manner and I think today we see it or a lack of civility more and more and that's difficult\nIn my professional life I Am the executive director Virginia freed the foundation for research in economic education and uh uh we're probably going to see three see sex and were nonpartisan which is a great lane to be in these days because everyone is\nWell you know aren't you might not really I don't have to be\nActually I'm paid nachos [laughter] even matter right get healthcare so [laughter] what we did was we represent businesses and uh we have membership and what we try to do is educate\nThem on politics and as a former teacher and from a business person my family in a bottle of water business for years old a couple of years ago\nA blessed it like um you know I I like getting people excited about learning about politics seeing it differently and what's that makes me do as aren't even deeper like you know when you when you go to teach a subject you better than other subjects you have to really get engaged in the subject\nSo it's an every day I get to learn more and more about politics it's it's a it's a deep interesting topic because it brings in culture and a economics and history and it was a history major so I I get to bring out altogether because it manifest itself as Andrew Breitbart said the last that last segment\nCulture is down politics is downstream of cultures so if you want to impact culture or the politics impact culture first and foremost Saffir culturally don't\nLeader you'll be you'll be a political leader give us a call it eight four five six for six we got some great guest calling in today are not just constant Rob Wittman but also the leaders of the two major parties here in Virginia posters quaint and kid and Robin McDougal\nAnd then two operatives one from Iowa and one from New Hampshire we're only I hate to say this because you've probably second tier the elections already in the midterms we are four hundred and Seventy two days away from the Iowa caucuses\nFour hundred and Seventy two now it seems like a long time but let's be honest as soon as this election is over you're going to start hearing reports back from Iowa and New Hampshire and we're going to be at the forefront of that we're going to get calls here we're going to shoot up with with uh some operatives their Republican and Democrats\nTo see what's going on the ground I think Trump's got the lock on the nomination you never know you never know you never know goodness knows you never know with Donald Trump because um that that that that's that's who knows is actually does what he says it says you can do but you never know what's going to happen around him and I think that's one of the more interesting parts about politics today is because\nHe's brought that dynamic up ... max and that sort of with if you remember from your days in school or or at work you know when the leader changes and it's like a substitute teacher what's this going to be like\nYou know you get you get a new boss or with the it's a\nIt's there's just the newness and from since June fifteenth of twenty Fifteen and says been a very different political dynamic are not necessarily unhealthy because it has made us think and react differently and respond differently and I don't think that's necessarily on healthy\nAh but we do have to be ever vigilant to make sure it does not become too unhealthy and I think people are recognizing that we have uh some some discourse in this country\nThat can be improved we can get better at that as a people and how we do that is every day one on one with each other you want to impact politics if you want better representation be better people comes down to um they represent us and if you want them to be better it's up to us to be better\nSo we got a call at eight four five six\nThe generic ballot what I pay attention to first and foremost is what I check every day I'm On the real clear politics they give you the um average of all the different polls and then they break down the individual calls\nI'm now hosts should be looking at what are called Elvis likely voters polling companies should have an understanding of who they imagine are going to be showing up on election they should have a pretty good handle on may ... began in Virginia about a month ago so that we should know who's actually voting\nI'm In Virginia in or you can always tell by Arlington because they're the tabulation their uh their absentee ballots uh some friends of mine who are tracking that to see what kind of a who's voting relative to the last round of elections to see what the intensity is\nBut when you look at the uh the averages of the generic ballot them this is why I Do this is why I Do that in twenty Seventeen when governor Ralph Northam defeated Ed Gillespie he won by eight point nine three percent a point nine three points the generic ballot on that day was nine\nPoint one if I'm trying to instruct the class what do you want to\nFollow Fox News Reuters Rasmussen CNBC Emerson Maris Quinnipiac\nWilder pool poll a Christian Newport which one do you follow follow generic ballot right now because that it that is fairly proximate to what happened\nLast year and the year before and twenty sixteen\nIf you look the generic ballot in twenty sixteen\nIt was very close it was like the tide and Republicans over performed on election day by about a point and they won and the generic congressional ballot I'm obviously Trump lost by about three points a nationally three million votes um so that's something to consider when you're saying okay we're just going to go I think\nI think the the objective view here is look at the generic ballot look at the average and you can pretty much extrapolate where it is right now\nIt's election day were held today and because it's on that basis it it takes away the the partisan lines you might have or a would be inclined to if at nine point one percent the dams won by eight point nine nine point one eight or nine that's very close\nAnd they are at seven point six right now it is safe to assume that they will not perform as well as they did in twenty Seventeen but still will win and likely when the house of representatives given the the dynamics in the Senate very different because the individual races\nLikely that Republicans a hold on to the Senate what's the dynamic that if the Democrats have the house and Senate Republicans have the Senate what's going to have the next two years and that's how you can sort of figure out\nWhere this thing is going so that you can understand what you need to do or not to like myself I don't watch cable news so I don't watch broadcast news every papers in the morning to post ... times Wall Street journal and I get mine on information what's going on in the economy and politics and culture and whatnot\nAnd then leave it alone don't listen to\nYou know the the uh the national\nTalk radio shows\nWhat's going on and I think most voters do that if you look at the the aggregate numbers of\nYou know the Fox news of the world and the MSNBC it's a very small subset of the American population but they're the they're they're the most active voters they are the ... they're the activist so those shows are pretty much you're broadcasting to the activists\nAbout what they want to hear about the ... points that they they they they're supposed to repeat so when you're watching when you go to Facebook or Twitter or Snapchat or Instagram or whatever you're very different social media platforms you see\n\nThe replica the repetition of the message and you're like wow I I go to a town hall after I got like a congressional town all my friends you know if there's no Congress the receipt made some I I watch them and take questions from the audience is like where did you get this information\nIt's fundamentally wrong but they're really upset I mean angry not pleasant not understanding but what do they show up for\nWho they show up because they're angry they are concerned but more importantly like anyone else in the world they just want to be hurt right how important is that in a conversation to hear\nWhat the other person is is really feeling it get down to okay what is that what what is what is making you got to say oh 'cause there's no no no\nThat that's the operative subject matter [noise] what is triggering this fear and when you get down into the into the nuts and bolts you you really can understand\nWhy people do what they do and hopefully get them to a better place than station life and it's not easy to do but it's a it's it's what we do it in a democracy in the public and form a democracy which we have\nIn America thank God I'm so we can just live more peacefully amongst each other governors self self governance I think it's really important historical concept and I think we've lost sight of that a little bit it's easy to uh but more importantly it's tougher for folks to point out to be what we can do better\nWe can do better calm down we got this I mean are are you have too many TV channels at night\nDo you have too many options are there are too many restaurants and grocery stores around you is it too good are you afraid you're gonna lose all this I mean

posting polling operations in in the commonwealth a great job as Clinton they're\nAll right hey Clinton how are you man I'm awake after like myself out of bed for this\nRight and that's and that's what that's what campaigns they followed that means they follow you you look at the\nThe cross tabs in the in the polls and they go okay I've got a problem with um women between the ages of twenty five I'm forty five minutes don't go there are on crime what's to say you know and then they structure their messages according to beef up or if they have high positives for for their opposition they'll try to attack the tack to bring down\nThe positives and bring up their negative to have an outcome in the election are you having more difficult\nIt's actually short\nI we're not we're not having any more difficult to time than we had been having 'em in the years leading up to um today so Virginia is about two thirds cell phone mostly or a cell phone only users\nAnd so our sample we we actually draw samples of cell phone numbers and so we do quotas on her cellphone versus landline sample so we basically go into the field for the batter to third one third sell for land line split already\nUm and we haven't found our response rate on cell phones to be any different than it has been which is\nNot great um you know people typically aren't taking any cell phone calls to do surveys like they were landline calls in the seventies to do surveys show\nWe're not finding it any more difficult than we were already um I Do have colleagues around the country who are finding cell phone number is being blocked more um and and it's driven by this um all of this fishing that's been going on with our cell phone numbers lately\nI Can't remember what my phone number and the money's recall from Idaho\nAnd we we do there are two things that we do to try to help us with that we're done it by ourselves as Chris rooting for university so we're not we're not an anonymous number or we're not\nUm unless the number you'll see who we are when we call and then um if you say look put me on your do not call list will put you on our callers and we won't call you back or we don't have to do that because you know according to the federal regulations were doing research academic research we're not working we're not getting\nPaid to you know do this we're not making a profit show were considered um researchers so we don't have to comply with the do not call it but we do keep our own do not call list and if somebody says don't call me I don't want to do surveys\nThen we'll put them on our do not call it so we try to be transparent in that way as well\nWell that's fascinating because most people go ah yeah I'm On a on those do not call me they are because because you are academic nature interesting so your turnout model is showing forty to forty five percent that's interesting because people I talked to the campaigns are they're hoping is going to be around forty eight\nThat's so that's ah so it depends on who you talk to 'em it could be forty eight um it could be higher I mean so here's the real sort of question that I have in my head right so\nIf there is a big blue wave if there are a lot of voters that are engaged right now who didn't even vote in twenty Seventeen\nThen we're missing them in our survey and we're not capturing that right and that some of the pushback I got back\nUm when we went and put out our second district poll showing Taylor leading Luria some Democrats push back and said well you're not even capturing some of the voters that were newly registering in and they're going to vote okay fair enough but we have the luxury in Virginia in in that we had a twenty Seventeen election that we think captured that surge\nPretty well it it ... it brought Ralph Northam into the governor's mansion Ralph Northam on a second district\nThink we twenty Seventeen captured that surge pretty well but it may be even bigger than and also Republicans may have responded 'em by by engaging their base voters already know if they've done that we think we've captured them because they were already voters anyway\nUm but if turnout is higher\nI think it's going to help you um I don't know that it helps one party over the other all the way it might be helpful to Democrats because it might be that extra search that we might that might be a lot of new voters were not capturing\nSo you ... you you saw the search I called the suburban tsunami I'm twenty seven to ... you saw that you saw coming in\nI think you had an aunt yeah we we were we were modeling\n'em in twenty Seventeen like we are likely model this year or what we were doing and twenty Seventeen as we were we were modeling ... the same way but we were also looking for new the registered voters\n'em in twenty Seventeen because of that was that was that search that was the difference between twenty six twenty Seventeen was a lot of the new suburban voters\nUm and so we did see the surgeon twenty Seventeen we all know what it looked like in Virginia and so there's nothing that says to me that that's going to be any less this year than it was in twenty Seventeen and there are things to say to me it might be a little bit bigger than it than it was one twenty Seventeen and by the way\nIn twenty Seventeen the Republicans were as engaged as as you would want them to be it's just the Democrats were a little bit more engaged\nSo you think it might be even bigger this year it very well could\nBe I don't think it can be much bigger but it very well could be um Democrats in particular are trying to register new voters or they they were until the deadline and Republicans I'm work trying to register new voters as much as they were trying to mobilize their their base voters had already there so I mean look if both parties\nNot likely to be because we don't have a really robust statewide race going on 'em and we have ... competitive congressional races\nSome places and not at other places so so that's part of the reason I'm thinking forty five um but if it ends up being\nForty eight it's because there were ... there's massive turnout going on and some of these really competitive congressional races um I don't know if you're a if you're if you're looking for a competitive state wide race to drive a turnout we just don't have that this year and so that's part of the reason I'm hesitant to say it's\nGoing to go as high as forty eight but look I've been wrong many times I'm In the wrong many times in the future\n[laughter] goodness that's a blessing we'll talk about the same ones not close\nClose um it I you know I did what I find interesting about the statewide races that um it's not close yet you see Tim Kaine campaigning\nIn his ... his campaign campaigning as if it were close he's running ads on on every in every television network in in the commonwealth he's campaigning like he's got a a more for a bit of both formidable candidate\nStatement that I've moved beyond twenties sixteen um and and and sort of the difficulties of being the vice presidential candidate on the ticket enjoy sixteen\nBut I think he's also recognizing that in some of these are really close congressional races um if he can pull any coattails um if he can run out any coattails\nIt can be really helpful to the Democratic candidates down ballot and so I think oddly enough Tim Kaine is running a campaign to get re elected to the U.S Senate and running several congressional campaigns to elect Democrats\nUm in in in some of these competitive races at the same time um and he doesn't really have a challenger that has a lot of money but Cory story is all over local talk radio which is where his voters are going to be and so I think Corey Stewart's running\nThe kind of campaign that he needs to run to give voters out given um how difficult situation he hasn't had a little money as\nSo you're you have a state wide pulling that\nWe we pulled the Senate race several times and then decided it wasn't going to be competitive enough to pull it throughout the final\nStretch from Labor Day on instead decided to pull these congressional races because\nReally for the first time in probably decades in Virginia if if if a hundred and some odd years we've got a lot of a lot of really competitive congressional races going on so we decided to pull the congressional races instead of continuing the pole what doesn't appear to be a very competitive Senate race\nBut we are we're wrapping up here in the segment with which you have a final call here on and what that is going to look like in the day\nWell probably somewhere Fifteen Fifteen ashes mine is where my ... I'm at right now it could be a little bit higher could be a little bit lower if it's a little bit lower it's going to some of these congressional races are going to look really good for the Republicans are going to be really tight if it's a if it's higher if it's closer to twenty\nThan some of these democratic congressional candidates are going to have a better night I think\nThe six fifty seven fifty yeah anything moving a libertarian front and they're making an impact at all no\nIn uh in in in we we anticipated they might given that that you know a lot of country club Republicans might not be interested in Corey Stewart but at the end of the day\nWe're in it were a very tribal period of our politics and if there's an hour by your name a lot of Republicans are going to just vote for that are and not actually give 'em the libertarian their their vote so we don't see any uptick I'm I'm among libertarian candidates either state wide or\nIn these congressional races um there's a libertarian and attempt this libertarian seven we're not seeing any up to ... with either one of\nThe Clinton kids Conan looks like an opportunity last a Libertarian Party they had a chance to correct the record marking her a little bit Virginia they might have fallen short this is Chris ... filling in for the vacation and John ... come on back\nThird day this week we've seen each other I Know I think you're stalking me around stalking you haven't figured it out yet let's not go there [laughter] you're the elected got it right now [laughter] dinner just settle well you know if you heard the last second was Clinton kids from Christopher Newport or are you seeing anything different than what Dr kids seeing out there\nWell I heard that the the the back end of his\nUm interview and I you know I I sort of got the sense from a discussion that perhaps he's seeing more of a blue wave that I'm seeing I'm yeah I'm In in regular contact with all our congressional campaigns um throughout the commonwealth and frankly most of them are doing really well um\nAnd I I Will be a surprise if it doesn't really come down to perhaps just two and a congressional districts being really in play when we get to election night to just to which too\nI I see the sadness in the tens clearly are the two battlegrounds right now I think the other ones that perhaps people are looking at are the fast but I think Denver Riggleman is clearly running a far superior campaign there and so I think Denver a\nWill allow will be fine come election night there had been some talk Scott Taylor's race\nScotch really working hard um I mean perhaps we'll be closer than we are otherwise would hope but I think at the end of the day Scott should be fine as well so that's where it comes back down to Barbara Comstock in the tense 'em and Dave Brat in the seventh of the way I see at this point\nTo a doctor kid he didn't mention Nebraska spanberger racing I live in a district and I see it every day at least in western in Rico county and there's a stark difference in what's going on the ground at least but I I pulled back and try and do the object to follow the data if you follow the data that Clinton kids writing falling what you're saying\nUm the Taylor and ... are the ones that are most in place as far as you know changing I'm changing a party right if they're accurate um you've got to tell her up by seven and comes back down by the state or nine times like that\nSo if that's consistent in his polling is accurate\nUm it would probably show up if you if you're going to do on our brand spanberger I Would imagine that he would\nBut what he also pointed out obviously the quality of the candidates important local issues are important but also what he pointed out was he didn't see the big tavern a kicker or\nThat everyone in a is talking about this is going to have this big search for Republicans or if it is it's pretty quiet people make up their mind just going to vote\nAnd as he said Republicans are show up and mentors\nAnd and I sort of see the ladder I mean obviously when I'm looking at is anecdotally um but\nDuring very ah prior to the to the judge now justice Kavanaugh hearings um there was some um perhaps apathy on the part of the Republican base\nUm but that changed almost immediately uh with those hearings and I think the Republican base in Virginia and I think the Republican base around the country saw what a Democrat majority in the United States Senate and the Democrat majority in the house representatives under Speaker Pelosi would look like\nConstant um investigation\nThere is a renewed enthusiasm they're clearly wasn't enthusiasm gap between the Republicans and Democrats prior to the Kavanaugh hearings but I think that gaffes than eliminated so now it's just a matter of turning our folks out\nSo you're seeing the enthusiasm kick if I talked to Morgan Griffith about a week and a half ago and he said the same things and you know it was a if you were doing a scale of one to ten ten being you know absolutely out of their mind showing up no matter what\nA he said you know Democrats are around\nNinety and my folks around thirty said but my folks are now up around the uh so he he he sensed that he felt the underground inclined told me the same thing or so from the anecdotal standpoint I Do think there's a renewed a server\nIn the in the Republican base that quite frankly is getting a lot of what they want it in the last election as part of the hard thing in politics you know\nYou know when you get what you want you show up are you satisfied or you know you're fat and happy new stay home 'cause things are going pretty well what what's the point ah but I think that the cabinet things from the ... Energizer refocused or at least the Republican base on uh wanting to come out and vote but you're seeing that throughout the state\nI Am and I and I think you know again what I think that folks realize you're right I mean are they got what they wanted in twenty sixteen we have the president and acting tax cuts the economy's booming well is there on climate and in that case and so there was a price on complacency in that but then I think now the Republican base seeing\nAll that could get on done very quickly with the Democrats control the house and Senate and so I think Republicans are saying we've got to roll up our sleeves and if we want to keep what we've got we've got to go to the polls and vote for it\nUsually the cycle of politics right so what as the new chairman of the Republican Party of Virginia or what is the next step for RPG worry all going what should Republicans in Virginia Beach got\nBecause when you look at Virginia and Maryland you have to give to a very strange electorate you have a democratic Marilyn's with a Republican governor who looks like he's going to win three Fifteen and twenty points in Virginia which has been a battleground trending now towards the blue states\nTim Kaine couldn't just thinks he's going to win by Fifteen uppers probably maybe twenty points as well you didn't really do have this dichotomy don't you all across the Potomac were where the the the dynamics of politics are changing Massachusetts has a Republican governor\nWho's up pulling a the leading Democrats in the state you know Charlie Baker you have a governor a Republican governor of Illinois\nUm is is is the ... other Republicans in Virginia sit right for the electric\nI I think what you're saying I obviously I don't know that in our current climate in Virginia whether any of the three candidates you mentioned governor Hogan and others who would win secure the Republican nomination in Virginia right now but I\nThink what will recognize it and I and I've sort of sense to perhaps a more pragmatic approach among Republicans I'm again coming out of the Kavanaugh hearings um uh somebody\nYou know six months ago had mentioned you know Susan Collins and Lindsey Graham thinking I'm sort of a stalwarts of the Republican Party people to laugh but now I'm getting request is how can we bring Lindsey Graham in to speak in Virginia for candidates and and have him\nIs that what we need to do is have a broader based in the Republican Party that can bring conservatives to gather around core principles and perhaps uh if we can agree on eighty percent of the issues we can disagree on the other twenty later on after we start winning again\n[laughter] again the cycle because look both parties are having their their uh Internet signed battles right I mean the Democrats have their own battles are Republicans are having their battles were going to have some posters\nNot posters uh some operatives from Iowa New Hampshire calling and the nine o'clock hour should listen to that we have one calling in from a Democrat from Iowa Republican mantra is going to tell us what's going on there are states the national caucuses because that's really what they are really\nOnly I see I don't have time to worry about that I got it got us holding out for now I guess if they set it up for reelection but nothing not worried about twenty twenty after we went in to preserve I bet you're already in the house and Senate next year in Virginia and the\nGenerally push back here because the dominant theme in American politics is what's going on in Washington DC and it's being reflected back in in the states and then the local to the districts because Trump is the issue right now since\nSince June fifteenth of twenty Fifteen\nThat man has driven the conversation every day in American politics and if you know four hundred and Seventy two days away from from the Iowa caucuses people are going to be focusing on those issues\nBut it's going to get very retail very quickly why all the Virginia races are going on and that's the beauty and the dynamic of Virginia politics isn't it because we are we are the polls\nWe take the temperature all the time\n... that's exactly right and I think\nUm for our congressional candidates this year I think last year gave them sort of a wake up call and they could say OK perhaps ramp to roll up our sleeves and work much harder than we thought we were going to have to and so\nUm you're right that this year will sort of perhaps give us a preview of what we can expect in twenty Nineteen but that will be as sort of a pulse of the of the country per se as you say\nBecause we have the entire general assembly up this time next year ... all one hundred and forty members the other districts in the general assembly are going to be up for elections and there's so many issues at play and what Clinton kid was talking about what he's sitting in his polling is that\nQuality candidates matter and local issues matter I got an email last night from a former colleague of mine talking about Corey in northern Virginia and uh basically local development and he was engaged on he also sends out emails on traffic patterns and potholes and I'm like this is not what you're doing the general assembly but if that's what the voters want they want someone talking about it\nRight but I I think that's right people are really looking for results from their elected officials and the things that are impacting most people today\nWith a booming economy and and job I'm strong and wages growing people are looking at\nSome of those other issues that impact them on a daily basis trafficking holds up at northern Virginia as you said it's bottles and and in more rural areas of the country those are things that people are focusing on now because the kitchen table issues are doing great\n[noise]\n[noise]\nThere's this hour from town all dot com I Am Rhonda off\nA scare during the party near Clemson

always just like vitamins or you are you able to maintain that\nYes you know I I uh you know I'm Glad to represent great post and the and the first district you know I get my energy from there\nThey are they're very individual that I did work hard every day and uh do do great work so it's hard not to be motivated by that but it's it's hard not to be motivated to ah by the by the crew on or that it is to represent them\nAnd I appreciate that and I'm having been in that position\nWell you know Chris I mean I think at certain times it it it does it does give you pause as to you know where we are at the country and the divisions that are out there but but I always work everyday to try to find places where we agree I think I think today it takes a little more effort to do\nIs that you have deadlines are constitutionally\nA enacted that hold the line on these things you can go to continuing resolution that's an awful turn off but they also I I Love the single object rules in in legislation ... where do you deal with one subject and that's it so you don't have this big mash up coming back from the other from the Senate or vice versa\nThat just just blows up the whole deal\nNo I agree and and you know the good news is that in the in the U.S house we remember the same rules that you offering their general ... or you and I both know that as you\nSpeak you figure out the rules about how things are happening on the Senate has different rules so many states kind of get combined together and you look at it go and Alice is related in any way shape or form in the ... the the\nThe most highlighted example is an airport about Iraq passed the title of the bill was going to be or or CARE Act they they they took they took a sunny bills stripped all language out of it kept bumper and the title of the survey or the house\nVersion of the Affordable CARE Act so it it it's that kind of procedural stuff that you just said hey why how could that happen\nBut I Would argue that you know sticking with\nThe logic of of systems work you see injustice manuals the way to make sure that you keep debate on track you make sure you don't have a lot of you know darn related or doctor a piece of legislation people go how did that get in there it's kind of like you know throwing everything on the last train leaving the space\nLike you know that stuff doesn't doesn't belong there are not related or six years you know as the way as well as a vehicle to pass things that aren't aren't related so I I agree that that's one of the I think the problem is up here is that it doesn't\nIt doesn't require the necessary debate and transparency when you're using that mechanism when you have like a related or aspects of legislation\nOr language to bill\nOr people just you know look at it and go how how could that happen\nWhat I Hope you're well we'll take a look at some of the rules and get more to wherever a Virginia way of governing up in DC because\nI I one of the things that are when you pull back from politics and and watch sports people get upset when they see rules violations because they know the rules right I mean last night there was a has just been Berliner through as a wider it was a beautiful water\nIn Enron darling he was a pitcher for the Mets in the days and some other teams so that is a pitch it when you are warming up to you put your mid down into the gravitational I'm done that's a perfect pitch and it was and it was called the ball and the next pitch the Boston Red Sox guy hid it for a home run\nAnd as as what I'm saying you go that's outrageous only because the the the teleprompter had on there and the strikes\nAnd what happens when people in in politics people that they don't know the rules to get upset about that's just not cricket you're not doing it the right way guys you know we deserve better and so they pulled back your eyes just the city they they showed their shoulders and throw their hands\nYou know it's just it's just not working I'm On my on my behalf you know I I don't get right into the distance and or anything you can do to to to change that I Would be for the benefit end of my rent let's get back to the absolute let's get back to the national district what what are your voters telling you\nWell\nYou know we're here for state I think\nThat they're that they're very interested in how do we ... a a continual um increase in our economy I think people are are very positive about where the\nHotter now I think they appreciate what's been done by Congress in Lexington regulatory burden and changing the tax\nCode or make it easier for businesses individual but the things that they want to\nSee going forward or what I call a sustaining parts of an economy and first of those cities have an education system that\nAssures that our children students get the officers are educational experience to be watching\nTo feel the jobs are there are seven point one million jobs open and Chris and Seventy five percent of those jobs will not require a four year degree and that means we have to emphasize\nCareer and technical education\nAs much as we do common strike education because that's where the jobs are in those jobs today are skilled jobs that have occurred as far as a career or you go from an apprentice your journey into\nA pastor and have a career there and do well in many instances better than you wrote him a job that requires a college degree so I think people look at that and say that's where we have to go here\nAnd so looking going how it's going to be for my child is soft on like how do we make sure the education system gives them that knowledge skills abilities\nTo compete for the jobs that are available today an English teacher and and I think businesses look at it and say hey the other things and the economy are going really well of course when I talked to was caustic\nDistrict I can tell you the top three things they talk to me about our workforce workforce in workforce or you know they say we could grow up business today if we can just find workers to do the job and it's you know there are more job openings today of our our people to build a job openings so we're going to have the success there must be harboring him\nOne other element to this article\nAnd that is brought in Hillary for both the connection\nIs important are supportive of education so that was a a a family show scolded Heather tablet computers they bring them home and they can't connect it's hard for them to do the assignment said they'd been given all the soap opera you have to\nPut the equal take up one of the library bottles to why fine businesses many talents in areas that don't have high speed can't\nDo the business they need to be successful and third one of the ways to bring on health care costs\nCan connect with patients without going to go to an office really ... miles and miles away and can get care and quality of those things are game change right so we were really caught on that we have to make sure we have education says to the south Korean talking about education as much as a post college truck itch\nAnd these are these are these are tough issues because people don't go broadband workforce\nDevelopment those those don't get the people out to the polls there just like no that makes sense I like that you know because when people get down into the\nThe granular already talked about with other callers today in politics and the government's complex and people don't like complex at like five were bumper stickers because they're pretty busy trying to make their lives working and putting that into the context of their daily lives come out and vote whichever way is a tall order for a lot of politicians right\nSure\nPolicy and [noise] it's complicated and he takes town hall all for anybody in our leadership the social whether\nElectorate law that allegation half of this power stations and you know those booms on projects are really just still on the things I hear from or something it's just something that I come up with some people say hey chronicle\nAnd gas companies soundbites are way help our economy but drill down there is a point we've got the entire aid you can always say only difference once and that's quite a shock of all of us but I think people don't want a team owners elected office or asking for people to set\nThe things I found that is great chocolate\nSet up to an ACC and that's great but what people want to hear to work if I'm going to place and here again what are you going to do in the future how do you understand things get to eat on what are you going to do to accomplish that what do you what you want to come back to us or\nIf you are ... ... s just approached the last ... last things all the leaves her home but I was able to accomplish and you're not going to go one we want you to understand which of course they want you to project issue for the\nFuture about how they're still she got to be addressed so it's not just a lot less to die it's what are you going to connect to restore people's concerns although one of the challenges facing a close\nAs I tell people audiences all them are going to politics is about the future not the past it is and you can be like look what happened to various the economy's great unemployment is historically low and they just threw out the government pretty much there's some there's some there's some\nUndertow currents that you just have to go out there and pound doors\nYou understand and listen to people\nBecause the elections are about tomorrow night yesterday that seems to me right Rob I really appreciate your calling in today we wish you the best out there and the campaign trail you got what Eighteen days left\nEighteen days

Wilder school tell us briefly about the Wilder school when you're doing\nYes so we're we're a school of government and public affairs at me see here I'm raising the top in US News and World Report for schools the public affairs got good undergraduate and graduate program focused on criminal justice homeland security and emergency preparedness\nPublic administration as well\nAs programs and the master's level and urban and regional planning and a PHD program and public policy and then we also have our Center for public policy which I direct which is our consulting and community engagement arm of the work we do in a while for school so you will see a lot of things around economic development\nA leadership in training look one state government outreach and things like public policy polling\nThat we deal with in the center for public policy in the wild her school\n... we're going we're coming up pulling real quick\nBut you guys actually go out and work with uh other local governments and businesses that you helped them it's not just I think people don't understand that about higher education the value that you bring to the community and the state yes\nWe really do I mean we're done\nEverything from looking helping that localities looking at potentially providing incentives for certain business to come into their community and doing a return on investment of what that economic impact would look like on the proposal stage with regard to incentive then come back and provided down that actual economic impact\nIf they went forward with a business and the impact that it had on the community with everything from reading your job creation other aspects and that way out we've done valuations of\nUm you know criminal justice programs so the implementation of a mental health program or a drug treatment program on reducing recidivism for local jail a or\nA communities partner we worked with a non profit from everything from their valuations of the program done projects that they do she also coordinating and combining the\nActual help that they need with regards to our students and our staff\nThe business community are looking at a third party evaluations of\nPrograms in projects for the private sector looking to pitch to the general assembly and need an actual third party non biased evaluation of that work in provide that report or for that company for the general assembly to look at legislative impact so we knew we are a continual partner\nEvery single day with our local and state governments around the commonwealth um and it it really is what we live and breathe in the wild or school specifically um we do it at a much more\nCost that factor race then our private sector counterparts\nYou will because it really is our mission in our vision and it allows us to bring to bear are\nAcademic experts he says well within the Wilder school you know we have over thirty academic faculty in their area of expertise you want to talk about the economic impact I've got four economist in an urban and regional planning program or you want to talk about the impact of an opiate program a treatment program I've got to criminal justice a academically\nThat's their area of expertise and they get asked all around the country to look you know present their research and were able to bring that expertise to bear for our localities in the commonwealth in Virginia\nSo that what are your whole service higher education schools we are we are\nYou know we we provide at all give us your you're going to say we will educate freshman in college\nAnd graduate school in PHD program give us your workers that we will train them in the executive leadership and management preparation I give us your legislators and you're allowed to us and we will train them and policy analysis on the impact\nOf a variety of I'm hanging on legislation and um give us your communities that will help you come up with good solutions and then give you the evaluation of the impact of isolation that we really are um the one stop all encounter the education and consulting an\nAcademic arm for local and state government and our our independence students around the common law\nAnd that's why I brought it up and we'll go to the polling that your that your operations down there because I think it's so important for people to understand the totality of a lot of things in government especially heritage which has a ... back around the country but in Virginia we've got a great higher education system we really need to be proud of it\nUh even though it's you know it's it's appropriate to hold them accountable as tough questions but a lot of things you're talking about are free they are exclusive of of usual operations and they are a complementary to what you are doing and actually facilitate what you were doing in higher education I think it's wonderful I think is misunderstood in mountain understood at all\nBut let's jump into some polling that the Wilder school has done what are you seeing out there and what have you seen what direction are we going\nWhy don't we talk a little bit and then you had written on earlier so let's talk a little bit about poverty and in polling in public policy that we did on this summer we were out in July we'll have another call Roland right here after the election in November but in our in our public policy arena you talked about higher ed so we're talking about\nAround the entire commonwealth so a true representative sample of all five Reagan's um of our commonwealth and when we look at it and ask\nPeople what they think about the value of higher education in Virginia over eighty percent of our responded believed that the community colleges that we had\nA project or work their cost over sixty five percent believes that are public four year institutions are worth the cost and then right under fifty percent believe that our\nPrivate schools in the commonwealth of work the car so it's really important that you said that question around down infringing\nYeah we value higher education and not only did we value it but we're putting out a product that comes around the commonwealth bank is age appropriate return on investment they believe that the cost that we have for higher education and forgive me I think everyone can talk about cost in general for higher\nSay you want to

a I have way too much coffee in the morning\nYou and me both go through a pot I'm I'm Down here and I'm no I'm just ... ready to go Mike what's going on in New Hampshire these days\nWell I'll tell you what we had a we had a couple of presidential candidates running for twenty funny already here in the last week so\nAh things are wrapping up\nSo this is only from the Democratic side no Republicans have gone up there right\nNo well you know this is talk of\nCourse about John Kades sick and or Jeff Flake running against Donald Trump for the Republican nomination I actually wrote 'em and op ed for uh the statewide paper here in New Hampshire just last week I it's pretty silly to take on Donald Trump\nI'm a ... you know king is a it any time a Republican primary where a sitting president has been challenged it's been on the right and uh and these guys are be running on the left they really wouldn't have a prayer feeding the president and the Republican primary\nRight now right now that's that's right now anything can happen goodness knows what\nCan happen anything of course and especially you know God Forbid the economy collapses\nRight right that's what I was like no one like that but if but if what if mother dropped a big one things can change All right let's let's shift for the Democratic nomination credit primary where I think we're four hundred and Seventy nine days away something like that from the Democratic primary hamster [laughter] who's counting\nRight now that's why I think it's I think it's smart crushed for you to to be talking about just stop and because the the presidential I stopped as you well know there's there's all kinds of things happening behind the scenes right now\nThis is where it happens right the person that likes pro frozen them then [laughter]\nAnd then come the day after November's election candidates start doing things in a more public way but like I said senator or Joe a brand new York which op hearing yesterday campaign\nAnd show she's laying the groundwork she's\n... and you know she's doing that all across the country\nAnd I'm a so she's starting to to put things together I'm Alec Baldwin I Know it may seem silly I'm sure you've heard about it to the guys he he's making rounds he think he made his second trip to New Hampshire just this past weekend really twice in the last six months alec\nBaldwin Alec Baldwin and he said he has not ruled out running for president\nHe Mike we're making news this is my comment and my producer the show looking at we're making news this morning Steve ball like this one\nBallot Alec Baldwin has um a spoke at the largest fundraiser for the Democrat Party in New Hampshire to um uh just last week yeah wow\nSee if he ran his old out Goldman is Jack Ryan you know it's kind of my job yet but [laughter] that was back in the Cold War you know a hundred ...\nThat's right yeah so who else do you see in up in in New Hampshire and who would you guess to be the front runners in the New Hampshire primary today likely to win or the twenty twenty primary in February of next year European\nBernie Sanders rockets for president he will be the front runner okay just no doubt about it no New Hampshire no doubt about it right if he doesn't uh down a little bit Warren will likely be the front runner\nOkay so how about what recently happened with Senator Warren in New Hampshire how does that play with her I mean fumbling of the DNA ancestry ball this week the disaster\nYou know and democratic circles I actually don't think it does much a liberal Democrats are going to be looking for a liberal Democrat regardless of facts\n[laughter] you know they think they serve their choices in in possession primarily on emotion and in a\nJesse Harris from Iowa just going to do if you heard that\nThe very a veteran democratic operative in Iowa was describing a seat um cos team but the reality in the in the Democratic voter in the primary butter but they also want to win and they might go you know I don't think Sanders can win nationally I think\nThat's that's not a I'm a Republican I think it was about the war would have a similar problem I don't think she's electable in in the\nGeneral election nationally nationally okay yeah I I like for you know for that using that DNA issue as an example um I think so I thought one thing I Will say though it is a I I don't think it affected her here in New Hampshire I Do think it affected the again the behind\nThe scenes operation a and then you know to\nThat all the maneuvering going on behind the scenes among potential democratic candidates for her to actually take over a news sites all before the election the way she did was uh\nDoes that why why would I mean if you knew the results of the DNA test and it was counter to your narrative that you're trying to ... after you put that thing at midday on Christmas [laughter] have you been married right now you\nKnow I don't understand it so how do you think okay so you got Sanders worn just because this New Hampshire but the other guys have got to go up there and compete or do they have to they might they just say\nYou know I think they do I think they do because there's always going to the opportunities and that's as you probably know pressure that I'm Still Clinton made a name for himself by doing well and and coming back\nTo to win at a time when she was losing so you don't have to win the New Hampshire primary to me to make waves across the country\nSo especially if as Elizabeth Warren is the front runner she's from Massachusetts neighboring Massachusetts took the candidate who comes in second and even third or a kitten get momentum as a result\nYeah because I think Clinton finished third right yeah that's right yeah so so but you have to win place your show in New Hampshire to advance you have to yes that's right that is correct and I just I don't think people understand about the the democratic nomination process this cycle is that California\nHas moved up yeah and they're going to happen that's expensive steak and Kamala Harris Harris is going to have a big lead there\nYes and that's the I think that's going to be the interesting thing I didn't hear you guys talked about that is really on the Iowa\nA conversation but what she does in the early primary states will be interesting given the California moved up we'll see try we'll see we'll see try and a ... and pick a state to do well in order to try and do well in all of them and um you know 'cause they're so different set up so early primary states ... compared to California\nWell again I think you have to at least try to compete in somebody's because\nThe reality is even though you might not win New Hampshire you won't matter and the the uh\nThe nomination legitimately so you still have to win in the in the electoral college that's right because you don't you can't you can't just blew past Iowa New Hampshire because those are those who have gone in either direction especially with Trump winning Iowa that's right no doubt about it what issues are dry and New Hampshire voters is what's going on up there\nWell it would expect uh uh the economy is still the number one issue\nUm the governor here a is a Republican Christian new new and he's\nAnd uh uh with what Donald Trump's been doing it and governor Sununu the economy's booming we have the second lowest unemployment rate in the country and the job or the Democrats don't want to talk about that they're trying to talk about anything but the economy with\nA family you know paid leave issue ... they're just trying to make up an issue that might connect with voters authors and the economy\nSo that's going to continue to be number one the second issue here Chris I I don't know how it how it worked in other states and you've heard Donald Trump even talk about this is the opioid epidemic through a which is pretty ... pretty severe in New Hampshire so that's that's\nIt's affected our number ... we've had the we've had that disease and in our family as well and it's a it's a ... a member of people dying as a result of that is the doors anything else it's going to ask countries have to sit down and said I Will get a handle on it but I don't think that I'm part of it as I\nSaid it's not a partisan issue Mike a final production as what do you think coming out we've got thirty seconds punch it what did you go further the Democratic nominee the Democratic finishers in New Hampshire twenty twenty\nI say it's going to go a little bit Warren a won't win or if she wants to win the New Hampshire primary um I\nThink there's going to be I think there's going to be some kind of dark horse like a um a Cory Booker I expect will be somewhere in the top three um and then and then you know what I I I Would not be surprised if someone like Michael\nBloomberg is in ... as well because the Democratic state we need to read the bank roll of the ...\nAll right Mike that any joining us from the Granite State of New Hampshire four hundred and eighty days plus or minus out of the New Hampshire primary thanks for joining us we'll be back on the John Frederick sure this is Chris document filling in extra back to my\nHow how do you know we're not all that a lot of money you know\nI mean nor nor should University of anyone who's involved in this concept but how do you how do you compare the intensity this year to last year what do you see the same similar not as intense when he said well\nSimilar but I think we we're we're very proud particularly in Virginia last year when we send a message to the country into the world that you know hate\nAnd bigotry have no place here and that we were open and welcoming for business when the election of governor north him and his team and then you know that that just verse set of a house candidates that got across the finish line that just beautiful tapestry of um of of of our our\nOur candidates that are women and a diverse women and I I just eat up so that was that was really great but I think what has happened is people's realize we have we can do this we can do this and it's just helped doubled down and we see for example the surge in the absentee balloting I'm In\nFairfax County and Orange County which our number one and two right now in the state on requests for absentee ballots you know that's good for us that's that's really good at ... I think we're just at you know adding more excitement and enthusiasm right\nLike quitting kid was on earlier and the seven o'clock hour he said he's he thinks the turnout going to be forty to forty five percent and it's a large that's a large range and there but where do you all projecting turn out right now\nWe're just going out there looking for every single vote\nAnd stuff [laughter] I Know\nBut we have a reason to get out there is a lot at stake and um and a sandwich going to be better than your average near term but I you know I'm not in the business of of that we're just gonna we're we're just reaching out or we can\nYou're describing\nGrant yeah we're in a G. O. T. V. now phase and we are just trying to get our our bugs and bring her anybody else that wants to come\nUp the been impressed with your with your proper Kansas this year and last year they they definitely worked hard what struck me as a sort of an obvious one is that the the predominant of female candidates nominees\nRight eye it distance definitely the year the woman I like to talk about our women candidates and then I got Shani any flack of anti ... [laughter]\nI mean Jennifer Wexton is is I mean and they're all they have a different kind of experience and diversity but it is good at all will be a good refreshing brass\nI'm a for Congress and across the crops at the time that some states that are in general for West End up there in the ... congressional district GOP's we're really excited about what we see up there on\nThe volunteers are just showing up on non stop and the Washington Post endorsed her which is something that I'm a you know I Am Barbara Comstock got endorsed every other time when they were very disappointed at her so she's going to start after Donald Trump and that proved not to be the case so ah her ...\nGoing to be um a congresswoman and then down and then I'll just run through a real quick if you want to ask me something about him but we will go ... lawyer and the second district a retired navy commander and a small business woman and\nOf course Scott Taylor studies on his own problems with bombs or you know trying to cheat and quite frankly and on\nAnd and and having a staff are put half fraudulent ah signatures on the ballot I mean that's you know that's unheard of stuff that's\nPretty seemingly and I I think the voters are going to reject that but but even that we you know without that we still have a son you know could credible candidate\nWell I Would have seen in your in your tennis yeah those are the obviously a female would I think it sends regardless of the outcomes and we can talk about polling and outcomes in November and you know according to the Taylor up and\nHe's got less than a than Coburn and and then you Williams influence in the in the six when I think it's sending a signal though is that you're going to see even more women in the future running for office regardless of party and I think it's a very healthy dynamic\nYeah yeah and I wanna I Wanna I Wanna say two things on that real quick we were really excited that Leslie cover and just got moved into a random place a program for the D triple C but the thing I think you're exactly right about women women have always um um\nWomen have always and studies show that yes but you know then the ones that would and I know your mom would agree with me on that she would have\nBeen hard some things you know go\nGo the way that raise my kids I got to get my degree got to pay off my\nSay good outcomes of twenty sixteen was limited decided well not waiting anymore we're going to step up you know a lot money something to offer and I\nI think ... you know we'll just see more and more of that because someone sad is that saying and I don't know who was you know you're not the table you're on the menu and you can look at what is it state this year with women's health care uh with families ah\nWith just health care in general you know women have a lot to add to that and there we just don't think we're going to step back anymore\nNo no no I don't I don't think you should I mean I think having the frankly it's not just that there are women but they're but they're in a certain age range to relatively speaking I'm In a cup or you know what to order a little younger but for the most part\nYou're you're center cut on mom's right the suburban mom is is is a strong voting I wants to block but a market but I I think your party is obviously intentionally trying to attract\nCorrect correct and um those suburban moms some of them who voted for Donald Trump\nI think have seen the ramifications of that vote and we are reaching out and talking to them and particularly when you take something like the Kavanaugh's\nNomination where you know set aside the fact of whether you didn't did or didn't believe Dr Ford this was a man who temperament we saw back his temperament that is not fit to be a judge and then add on to it the fact\nOf you know her very compelling touched her testimony and um and and they you know Republicans decided not to believe that belief are they're going to be some ramifications from that\nOkay um let's talk about was we Coburn moving from into the three\nD. triple C a red to blue program um then you're you're making the news here in the John ... radio show this morning we've had the other folks make news about ethanol in Iowa and Steve bullock is a potential outsider and Alec Baldwin in New Hampshire wheels [laughter]\nYou're you're ... three for three but my colors here so this was news was recovering moving into this special category of\nFunding from the deep triple C talk about that\nWell we just we just got that information ourselves and that just shows you know to open the we've always thought it was very competitive and ah we we are pleased to\nSee that on the inside the beltway group recognize that as well she's Seventy two thousand dollar car you know the ... district has\nReally really dig it goes from up in a faulty accounting all the way down to the north\nCarolina line it's got a lot of different you know Raul but you know Scott Charlottesville area in it too it's got you know then you've got sort of the D.C suburbs with foster care so you got a little bit of everything that she has really a campaign in every part of that district and um\nAnd I think that you know here you're sharing it towards the end they finally saw the value in investing more in her\nWell it also says hey they have the resources to do it\nRight well that's a good point too I think that is and if you've seen the articles that in you know ... ...\nActually out raising 'em a Republican incumbents like you look at they are sick Avondale Stamberg are I think she got raised him\nThree to one maybe this last um [noise] yes this this recent foul language pork and on and and you know that that's what we're seeing all across the board [noise]\nYeah I think from a small donations to which is like really gratifying because you know the small diners are the ones that really invest in even show up and knock on doors since Sunday can and put the shoe leather [noise]\nWell I think that's showing up obviously in the polling generic ballot is a little behind where are you all were last year the other day\nAnd if you just follow the if you just follow those those numbers and the data you probably do\nQuite well election day maybe not as large as soon army that happened in Virginia last year but you know showing up on the ground um I I think the
