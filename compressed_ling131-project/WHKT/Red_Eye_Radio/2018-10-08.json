English I think that all caps fans have\nHave had over ... over that time\nUm and the number of times that we were right on the cusp and just couldn't couldn't make it and um it was a great night and a great ceremony and then seven nothing when and yet the cats can repeat I think that actually going to be better this year I think a cloud\nOf pessimism has been lifted from that team you know John one of the things that I can tell you the season ticket holder that was just so frustrating but you just couldn't break it was in the playoffs you know that that we have a great home ice advantage the or\nThe the entire year and the playoffs they go down one goal\nOver again what are they going to fire right looking in the big game in and and the whole the whole right at the edge media jets\nUm I've never seen an arena just goes to\nWatch your game seven against Pittsburgh and when we when we went out the in in twenty sixteen and um they went down one nothing and it was like you know one nothing that hockey is is nothing nothing and and\nI mean it was like you're at a funeral that we already lost the game and they were they're short haired old against [noise] make a left\nRight and and and and that's and now it's like it's lifted\nAnd and and you could feel the playoffs last year once we got through Pittsburgh it didn't matter if we went down and again people could still\nBelieve in a team in the team to believe in itself I think I think the\n... the caps in their history\nWas Wayne on the players were they were believing when they went down a goal that they the games where you can and how they because the fans flavor 'cause every everyone believes it once Pittsburgh got the last year everything changed you could feel the change their I'm Thomas confused and taken over on a season ticket holder we said\nHow poor sections away from each other sometimes each other in the Dunkin' Donuts line in between factions [noise] um [noise] but um [noise] this is going to be a great Arabs or the caps now I don't think this was the one thing I think that\nYou look at who that's often is young I'm over in his in his you know not in the mid mid thirties I think when you're thirty three thirty two\nUm he's gonna make a run a grassy for the most schools scored of all time the regular season is over six hundred refudiate Ninety four he's going to make a serious run it being the number one goal scorer NHL history and the captain I'm an incredibly bright future um and I'll just end with saying this my dilemma right now\nI put a thousand dollars and the cap flustered when the Stanley Cup in Las Vegas Fifteen the one we want to in Vegas at the cash for tickets Fifteen thousand dollars when I catch the tickets a person that the counter told me the biggest payout she's ever paid at the sports book\nOr when people will take about like that and roll it over for two or three seasons and she said you know the caps three feet and you wrote us money over it'll be two million dollars by the time they have to repeat\nSo I'm Still having this dilemma for the rest of the season I have not done anything with the money yet because it may be that like you know it was just a thousand dollar initial investment I might need to roll it over a couple of times because I think the cats are legitimate threat not only to repeat the sheer potentially the at the repeat I'm the only after all that every year by year so that's my dilemma\nBut I'm leaning towards the right now I actually think this team is national team\nAnd one that um is going to have a lot of success going forward [noise]\nWell uh\nI get what you're saying I bet the Astros last year to win the world series the second one as you know because you put the better I think that in for you and I in fact the ticket we did we didn't just to take it as\nBut uh that are concentration in a high concentration and those two district but also in a several others I mean you know we're not going to spread it all out all over the state [noise] um you\nYou have to know you know you gotta play where you were just through your strength and it would be there I think a Ralph one uh [noise]\nI think we're out one by twelve porn twelve to Fifteen points I got an ear\nA in a blacks district in even more I think in ... district and uh you know the dynamics are changing in this and it's not just so much a matter of of Trump\nOr anything the demographics in the state or changing and they're changing almost daily [noise] and\nAh it's obvious which way you know they're moving are we going to be like Maryland that we're not going to be like Maryland but we um northern Virginia is beginning to look more and more northern Virginia suburbs more and more not totally but more and more like the Maryland suburbs\nNational it's not just reached one right happening nationally in these kinds of various\nRight as I said New Jersey suburb send things going on everywhere Maldonado sites everywhere but you're seeing this you're seeing this an awful lot and um [noise] I think we have an excellent chance\nAnd no question we're getting help from the guy in the White House whether he will be there or not you know uh I I was joking with Mark Warner and I said you know we well we we need them they're just one more election [laughter] you know but I mean it's you know\nUm [noise] generally speaking we've done better [noise] generally speaking when there's been a Republican and the White House have there been exceptions yes\nGenerally speaking the Republicans have done better when the Democrats spending the White House have there been exceptions yes but the trend is there and found was unmistakable trend yeah understand and I\nI Would be surprised if we didn't uh you know get to Twenty one in the end of the election Adam minimum\nYeah I think I I tend to agree you know you still have to defend a couple of states like you got a couple of comments he got one over on the eastern shore that [noise] it didn't play I think Republicans can hold the blacks need if they don't have the black\nI I think that you [noise] far weaker today a it's an incumbent in probably anybody else because he has just some personal proclivities and\nAnd things that I think that hurts him a among some of those voters we have some stronger candidates or black\nOr I don't know what happens there you've got a hundred and fifty thousand in the bank so I didn't sound like he's ready to go away very quickly but I Will do my advice to him and he got no wonder who am I going to fold them and you want to go out to undefeated not indicted if you could do that and I think last before\nIn mountain when he and house delegation and he moved all over the first district to run for Congress and then he comes back but I don't think he\nAre you are but you've got some issue ... after the initial matrix there where he has not really too early voting record 'em to that district and you got the state house at fifty one forty nine into redistricting that's critical happened many many I mean we have to wait and see but maybe working the Democrats Craig's list [noise]\nUm [noise] I mean it would appear that the judges are going to wind up drawing that her house district as hell eleven house districts [noise]\nAnd I think that's what whatever formula when they come up with that is going to a also be what the Senate's going to have to abide by twenty Twenty one\nAnd uh it could change or you know a big change an awful lot [noise] um you know a part of the districts are unpacked not totally but below the numbers I mean look what Bobby Scott\nI mean his district one from what fifty some fifty six percent down to you know low forties\nAnd um [noise] you know produced another democratic district so you're gonna have to see how that plays out but it seems to me\nThat uh the judges drawing that district is by far and away their\nTheir best bet and if they do you know Supreme Court I think it ruled before that gerrymandering is is has been constitutionally permissible until it spills over in racial discrimination\nAnd therein lies the problem and that's what the Republicans are facing there and it's going to change its going to change the way you know a\nWhole makeup of legislatures around the country where the new court fight before a court will do this differently blocks of each other and they got it back if I may be wrong but I think when they send it back to the lower court it was like seven to initially\nWell I just think one of the thing is you can understand the Republican base for better for worse is migrated from your country club in the country and in so doing they're taking their self out of some competitive districts were these were economic issues Republicans it'd be very level\nSo it's not just a demographic stick around the fact that they can change the emphasis on issues in ways that help them in southwest Virginia robbery but but it hurts them in a growing parts that\nCan we talk about the ... and also with a very popular governor with very low negative and you look at ... numbers and ... had a lot of support amongst Democrats\nWas not popular among Republicans was more polarizing in numbers Ralph Northam has incredibly low negatives\nFor somebody in this environment you look nationally um he has very high tide is very low negatives um and in going into these competitive seats [noise] um I remember and twenty a weapon in Democrats drew the state Senate lines and they lost the majority and who was the\nThe person who was in every Republican ... that was flipping seats was Bob McDonnell a popular governor can play a big role nuts and that's a big\nThe national environment plays Baltimore that you have to have a messenger boring to help raise their especially when you're talking to other Thomas writes the the I mean it that that national same ways very heavily you know which is why you've had you know the the patterns that you've had\nUntil McCarthy Cuccinelli I mean you know what happened for almost fifty year I'm gonna I mean I've been here about the surveys like let's take for example that started in the [noise] the sort of been seat was not driven by national politics and twenty fifth and it was driven by local politics in Chesterfield versus Richmond and I'd like to be democratic\nUm and I think that we and we know who you're forty data more rest of Canada but we don't have we had an campaigns don't matter I don't think we had to I don't think we had a great message or that I think if you rerun that same race in twenty Nineteen and you had Ralph Northam on TV\nI'm In that district profit on it I'm going to be as they are they all vote the votes tournament is chaos is going to create problems for them\nYou know I think that's the greater problem is that he's he's he's not harmonious where the district on some of this hot button issue I just say that like Rob working in a good governor like it's a wonderful man but he gives a fireside chat in the FARC has now you put him on TV it it it's it's not the same kind of rally the team\nBut he's an asset to them every week and he didn't have to use that ... I don't know what I did not mean that is that's the kind of governor you actually need this you know and he picked up not a fire already picked up Fifteen states I mean I think in terms of color things it's fiery and I'm at a carnival Barker one end and he doesn't he doesn't pick up seats laid off north of that\nWell north and didn't pick them up Trump picked\nHim up for him yes if Trump would have been president and twenty Fifteen we'd be in the majority\nBut look I don't know I I decided I wanted to go to Shawn Ralph Northam disagree however I think he's been pretty much just stayed\nKevin calling from by three points and rapport with him on by eight and ... pick up your seats across and picked up to five point difference was not a good team if I'm Sorry but there was also a hotel ... let me tell you there\nIn the White House ... strike about Trump okay I was a driving factor sure of last November on top of that um [noise] you had a ... and spilled over into everything [noise]\nAnd keep in mind Gillespie was not troops you know I mean he was very polarizing [noise]\nBut um I just think people keep underestimating governor oh I don't think anybody underestimating\nI don't think anybody under estimates him but they notice I mean you know what's driving politics in Virginia right now is not a Ralph uh it's it's what's going on across the Potomac River\nIt's negativity and driving politics on both sides right now in the one thing about reference and he doesn't have any negative [noise] doesn't have many many he's a very like about ...\nI'm not you know I've now been knocking on doors since may I have not gotten one negative comment about brown non and that's you know it's I mean people liking me\nYeah I agree with that even after that but he's not a fire reader that gets voted out for\nYou you know I I think Tom Davis is not a fire eater they've got to put up for the Republicans but for Twenty years every single Republican or a piece you would have thought the person was married to Tom Davis because the Republican candidate had his picture bigger than their own picture with a quote from him saying like here's why they'd be great for your time sometimes without permission um so I mean having a messenger\nIs important and democratic not had good last letter that led up north I'm In the first time in a sense Mark Warner and we've had a messenger like\nNo I agree I agree but now he's taking our income but that was not entirely different that\nI don't know I tell you what man I I'm All right Joe Joe's kind of Peter ... you can't underestimate or see and I'm telling you\nWhat he had a disastrous pressed to offer I wasn't there and it was a disaster of all time so he had a disastrous press conference it really hurt him to all kinds of underhanded things going on but uh you know after that\nMorsi's ... and and [noise] you know the thing about Joe is he's an independent sector he's got to go is the only way [noise] ah you know he's not\nA he's not a whole bunch of any of the establishment ... officers or anything\nI think he's got to play very well in that district and I think a lot of his uh friends there that I don't think that he got screwed by what they just throw 'em in and take\nConnect the gym or see that the smartest thing I've ever seen anyone doing politics when he when the when I think it was the mceachin see he won Mickey chintzy on each and moved up I think\nAnd in that primary people don't think he was going to win that primary crowded field\nAny more than a landslide networks people are asking what did he went around and after he knocked on doors at night wrote a handwritten note every voter he spoke to the data that for a week and a half before the election in the context of it that he had remembered the conversation\n... kept these postcards for six months and send them all out ten days before the election with a handwritten note from him talking about how their conversation and you know I met your dogs ham or you're a teacher here and I remember that conversation and you know hope I can count on your support next Tuesday and people\nCame out in droves I mean for him to go do that though and I I I've seen people read postcards but I've never seen one posting them to make it appear as a month later okay well Tony Tony with us everything better than anyone in politics later but [noise] but he did that to anyone in a landslide and like\nBeen done before it ... no I don't underestimate Joe I'm just saying taken on in Congress district like that is it it's I feel I'm not\nJust to I'm not an expert on that the big difference you know if we had you know there's a whole lot of people have gotten in the journal suddenly because we don't have runoff provision in the state a whole lot [noise] and they won't have that you'll just have to people in there\nAnd she's well why [noise]\nI don't think I if I had the gas and I I can be totally wrong with it or live in that district and I guess that route dance has extremely low name id pardon I Would guess that route dancers extremely low name id and that if you test it they were more seats aren't they might not descendants piled high\nI'm just in [noise] but like in terms of I'd name id Richard Nixon had our name out\nThere [laughter] every day like I don't think rises like real superstar the\nBack on you know Joe and I know Joe\nAnswers gotta get out out were something like Fifteen or twenty to one okay Joe without their knocking on doors and making phone calls now we'll just say\nBetween the fast law primary too in that primary like Dick was independent district for Twenty years before I got drawn to us it's the product safely has a concept of campaigning and knocking on doors and doing the things that you do when you're in a competitive political rate\nFor Seventy percent of the vote in my district against Mondale yeah rockets has never been a better place their lights on\nFor ever Confederate says she's never been\nAnd you got to ask you before and she's got to get out work I'm a joke on out worker he's fighting Joe he's got to get cut out worker and the other\nIs I don't care I'm telling you he was going to get a trip to clear the sympathy vote out there for the fact\nThat the power base in Richmond screwed this guy\nOut of it the livelihood and that's that's real I mean he got screwed I mean what he did to pull his long life and it looks tentative Stanley told me the whole thing is that ... vote but [noise] it was blown it [laughter] what happened there was a total bologna and\nIt was because uh it was it was because he challenged the Richmond system that's what I that's why they told him and so I I don't remember\nThat like you know there are a lot of people in that area that have and and this is the loyalty the job or see the reason he does well there's a lot of people there that is represented and when families have had a time of need\nYou know the attorney they went through the criminal defense attorney to help out someone in their family than it was Joe Morsi and that created the level of loyalty he had they base I\nNot ready to call this one one way or the other yet but um he has a real ... [noise] it's it's across that district from being an attorney I'm\nIn the same way that Donald McEachin you know when he when he ran rubber on his running you know him as a primary challenger what three times two incumbents are twice twice as the challenger don't come a deli it's been one for the challenger don't come to senator\nAnd and the teacher was the guy who everyone news on TV it was a lawyer um he had to help so many people in the community it didn't matter that even the challenger to incoming um that's how they live much they thought he was income right and and Joe Morsi\nGuy who's defending their nephew there's time um you know against major charges that any he's one of the top defense attorney there so I'm just I I think that it's an interesting race and and and we got to see you know will rise even run again we don't\nLet me look you had the twenty twenty won the governorship or where to come come through and a lot of um determine who's in the White House is using that dynamic is going on\nBut when north um goes well the attorney general Montana governor clashes that who else is looking at this at this point in the Democratic party or as I Know I mean there's a name pops up now and then very oh it was not out of the picture you know I Would imagine if you're on the you know of course but I Would I Would hope that\nHerring terrified [noise] delta or not the senior contest nomination but [noise]\nYou got a lot of people in the back looking for upward mobility till you get the mayor of Richmond stony you've got to smuggle him getting her yellow sitting there on you'll have a primary and you'll just have to see if it [noise] um [noise] access to it can be dangerous and the only I think you've\nOnly a [noise]\nAs long as you don't have a two way right [noise] uh\nBetween Fairfax and marrying a I think that if a if it's if it's one of them against the whole batch of other people they win [noise] uh you know the Fairfax\nYou're carrying somebody out so I like you guys are talking about\nHerring and a Fairfax you're not talking about before stony who was absolutely going to do something because the other person you're talking about\nWho can pull the upset in a two or three person race and that's kind of like Alexander mayor of from Norfolk right now who in a three way primary against to progress is trying to out liberal left wing each other\nKenny Alexander comes in business guy there's a track record and mold of hope water businessman ... college ...\nThat's why it's ridiculous first of all there's always there's as if there's a moderate right or the Democratic primary is any way for the first piece safety but they've got the second line rough in order to be you're going to his state\nThey're not going to line up behind cat I like Kennedy's the good friend but they're going to either line up behind your herring for Fairfax what about stony and I don't even you know I don't I don't know I didn't know that same thing with all of our record guy people like him but they're either going to go with one of those\nToo [laughter] [laughter] well how ... going to be a Republican anyway to Trump's going to be gone and twenty twenty I was going to win again [noise] ... I mean first years of presidents he's really on the same type of campaign that\nGillespie a ... year right Republican won't win that governorship you can't ... I'm telling you you know it's disgraceful\nJak Republican ever win again and Virginia\nHow do you how do they want to end up probably that's absurd how do they yeah\nHow do you account for that you know in in ... in Massachusetts I mean you know\nGovernorships in particular are not parliamentary race and people make and you know you know but but let me tell you something as long as people in the Republican Party is trying to turn a political nickel expensive somebody color or somebody ethnicity or somebody religion\nIt ain't going anywhere I Would agree with you there and in till they get away from that you bet well and they shouldn't be rejected\nOr they gotta I gotta check their from a Senator Bill Stanley he says never bet against fighting Joe so it'll certainly agrees with me\nHe wants a excuse me ... that we know who is Joe ... lawyer huh bill Stanfield Stanley yeah yeah okay what's that going to do a little\nBiased [laughter] speaking of seeking a statewide races I didn't bill family going to be a very dangerous candidate for attorney general I'm very like you have to run 'em and if he runs for attorney general gets the Republican nomination I think he's going to be very dangerous game well if he does run he'll get the nomination but he has to run\nOr what the Republican primaries up here you can't come out of your [noise] say why didn't get the numbers there is no way you can do that you can't make it up you know\nNews this hour from town hall dot com [noise] ...

when I was in high school and I kinda think people in\n... you didn't hear about this project that looked like she but extremely credible yeah very emotional ... and and I do think that I I think that taking that extra week going back and interviewing some of the people more judge and others around it\nI think it was with the right thing I think slam dunk in the ... the day after or would have been

days later route Rob back to where we weren't you may seem to me how fast\nBar mansions blast over mentioned I think had him up Fifteen\nI Want to say now that he's up by five are saying oh boy that's a fascinating poll last week that I'm a fair thing that's that's all the polls you read when they're asking\nYou to do that on our news or he certainly is a production by ... by either under fifty he's well under well under shift and I and I think what you got to remember this is if you go to you know his independence this whole ... I think this is for him this this changes the outcome I think it's right yeah I had a chance\nI and I'm not an expert on West Virginia but it seems meet Joe mansions whole position that I'm an independent God I'm not beholden to either side and uh\nI I think it would be hard for him to get reelected it would seem to me in a what a Trump when the state by like fifty points something like that\nAnd I'm not on also not convinced and Susan Collins is going to run again either\nThat ... that that I think is what if I'm not ... but she says she's never voted against the Supreme Court judge ever you have any group in the state that ... billion dollars up saying unless she votes against million spent\nYeah okay now it's up to a million and a half ago find me but then it looks like a bribe but I'm I mean I think at the end of the day without corroboration she's going to be there\nFor for for which he or she agree with Tom you not only twenty twenty twenty is she going to run again well should make that decision the appropriate time [noise]\nI I think I think time now that I think she is going to vote yes on the one that I have no read on though Tom Davis is I'm Lisa Murkowski of Alaska what about what about you [noise]\nPretty independent I mean just remember this when she lost that primary to Joe Miller the last Republican primary right she run as a write in with the name Murkowski battling it sort\nOf ... and ... and also as you want to laugh but you know make the part about the independents pieces when you guys mentioned when it's because they claim they're they're reelected comes looking out for their state right mhm and Murkowski has a big issue with the Kavanaugh opinion about Alaskan natives I think was something\nThat she died when she ... she she she does on on that issue so no it's not clear cut I haven't seen the polling in Alaska or anything but the I think if you get ... like I think you're going to get flaky booed him out of committee and so I think without some crap ration Jeff Jeff is fundamentally\nVery conserved right you got to be a little more risk to he's also very independent and I think a very principled guy which is why people\nMaking flaky because he doesn't always stay in one box and then you can always protected by this judged if you've got to understand for Republicans this ... this this is a very important vote on the court as it is on the Democrats on the other side a wanting somebody else\nCan I ask you a question has a has a a vice president ... broken a tie on a Supreme Court nominees knocking on where here I think that would be unprecedented out what the [noise]\nBut that can kind of a challenge that but it's still counts how do you know that it just sort of thing it costs you just said inviting consent and there's got to be no Oregon needs to president than any votes but he's not a member\nI can tell you the states like Virginia right not bringing in states that\nThere's already a lawsuit challenging the whole procedure on the other Democrats\nAnd if he's confirmed that they're going to do and they take over the house or the Senate to move to impeach that would\nBe a disaster two thirds of the Senate good luck\nYeah let's just I'm like I had to get\nOf electric map consequences that's what I take away but here's a lot of Republicans in Minnesota stealing Supreme Court [noise]\nWell I I mean all the war on poverty rough one here's the problem you still can't get over the fact that Trump won two years later he's still can't get over got let me bring my\nWhere am I Am married Garland well let me let me talk about America I think might bite every indication is very honorable straightforward would have been a good Supreme Court judge in in the traditional sense with these balanced ... it's not completely a liberal democratic operative before he wanted the bench but but met the criteria for it for a judge\nBut what is better not holding a hearing on them are doing what they've done in this case and that is bringing is putting the sham of of hearing him and then finding a way to trashes reputation and voting no they weren't going to confirm it it was an election year Republican senators were confirmed ... feet and putting on a more liberal members just wasn't going to happen\nIn a presidential politics here not a mixture who knows who knows what the rules are writing about weapons to president it's the president United States who nominate somebody for the frame court out the senator my rights that right so therefore I think McConnell's argument is out\nWhen he says look a that was a presidential election year but a lot of voters decide that stuff\nBut I'm just saying they they stretch it each time I don't know who started it but it keeps getting worse and worse and worse\nAnd once you do it for one year you could do two years you could do it three years I I don't know they're already guard rails long enough I think it was removed from sixty votes to fifty votes for everything but the Supreme Court of course they're going to do it for the Supreme Court has made there are new guard rails anymore and this and that's what's scary\nAre not going to yeah I can text here from a\nDJ Republican operative in Virginia Beach if there is such a thing ... says Joe mansion is only apply for in the latest Fox poll as of a two days ago I applied for not Fifteen so Scott thing is to what check his email was with one of ... said anything for a job\nThey have already gotten another email on now let me check that chefs got another email

I grew up in this world headquarters here in Fairfax city and Scott surveillance state senator from northern Virginia Democrat\nAnd part of democratic leadership I'm\nNot part of the ... I'm fairly well I'm a student there but there isn't room for saying that if you challenged if you ...\nOthers not airing their desks or waiting on him I don't\nThink he's seen a Seventy while\nReal clear politics average on a mess right now is nine points for well that's a far cry from Fifteen oh here's one plus well some are Thirteen or Fifteen minutes and plus when I was\nLooking at here has been consistently had I think he's got I'll give you I'll give you that and I said\nBut I think a no vote here changes of that dynamic there was a poll earlier before all this controversy or that showed that if you voted against the also the numbers change on\nThis because I don't I don't dispute the fact that the numbers would change a but\nFrom from my perspective I think a Kavanaugh's confirmation to is probably the terms of democratic enthusiasm prime that's five to ten feet maybe a Senate seat or two I mean I think it helps in the house and her two because then it's a very red territory North Dakota uh\nMissouri I mean these are pretty solid state West Virginia in the Senate race is Kavanaugh clanking Republican\nOr where we're where we're at a time for a couple of instructed finally our news but one thing I\nThink Tom now they're [noise] this is the only thing I've seen in the sense Trump announced that has unified Republican so I've never seen anything like this we could figure out how to do it we're going to talk about that plus Redskins cats running in fact even [noise]\nI said Fifteen it was it was twelve point for when I went back and actually look at the\nLimits of the cabinet discussion yeah you want to go ahead of what you had that one but then we got to get the fuck for football hockey but go ahead go ahead\nOh it'll all Leon I'm actually last night among the winner and the Senate Judiciary committee the official account of the Senate Judiciary committee is tweeting about Democrats do not understand the definition of blue thing that would be a\nSenate Judiciary account this thing is so off the rails and and and I feel like\nYou know people were completely missing the point with all this process crap\nYou know the reason the Judiciary Committee is tweeting that the Democrats have the definition or on a book it's all process and none of it is actually on where people are on it and where voters are on on this is the Kavanaugh only has the support of the conservative base\nAnd the message that women are getting around the country is that you know people are OK with sexual assault\nNo I think that that is that the reason that the measures they're they're they're getting is you're now a pronounced wrong joining or joining in the room and it's a good message there right I mean this is the same\nDemocratic Party to defend the bill Clinton did attack is accused him of rape especially the one that got raped well\nFirst of all first of all I remember I went to the ... the allegation of rape\nProcess you remember that woman came out a week after on national television that whole process has got so when you say the Democratic party rallied around through whatever that allegation wasn't out there at the time I Will say second thing is\nFear that was why he lied\nAs you're talking about with Jon Weber ... Jones was different than ... then that was not retired after ...\nAfter that was ever catch a ... interview is a week after the centered in the Senate about that you had to sequence Kevin really was the same time it's Paula Jones or that you're thinking of a\nHunter I needed the money to buy a broad term you're the first to where I Am the person if you were not raise allegations anyway the point [laughter]\nThe message that women are getting around the country is that this is okay and Republicans are now into a debate about the definition of ... I mean general trend and double struggle I mean it is a this is on the official Senate you just can't look everybody knows the Butina\nArt or not but you got the first of all I don't know what I'm\nHoping this Butina is inserting drugs in your ... instead of taking them down your throat because you for your body will process it faster fair and he just got a ... million lands are in the eighties right where that everyone\nKnows what that means I didn't know what I Hope they don't want to be a very very interesting out here my very innocent crowd here that have no idea what that word means you're not and then and then you cannot go on national television taking notes and be like oh it's a party joke I mean this is so ridiculous and absurd\nWasn't embarrassing nominee that talks\nAbout the process a Democrat and let me just let me give them the world you're talking about polling going on in the way for\nBowling on this this is very split the ... this is not overwhelming polling against capital this is right down the mental at this point in which is the worst in history but we can Supreme Court justice or never done that or what we have right down the matter because they were just\nTalking about the electoral repercussions when during your kicked the hornet's nest Republican base that was kind of depressed at this point in what you're seeing now in in terms of the energy brings to both parties the enthusiasm gap is close and that's going to cost Democrats a couple of cents\nAt least you know I mean I get when you're like nobody wants to have a feeling that are doing sexual has done sexual assault get off of that\nWe want people to come over here can you tell us when it's okay you have probably for the double standard right she fell into it or or the guy who is the guy the ravens beat up his girlfriend and ... by the hair and they they pay them more money\nJust for whatever it's worth I mean I I totally concur on Keith Ellison I heard that publicly I campaigned for his opponent you know on line when he got into the primary for attorney general I said this is not right the way he's doing it um\nAnd you should you should be that's ... ... not you've been my biggest thing you know but it is it ... and it is bad because a lot of people will look the other way 'cause any should not be the number two person on the Democratic\nNational Committee right but this is the Supreme Court and you have a guy who not\nIt's an extremely credible user but she has nuclear operation that she would understand a lot of your cooperation and what's her core operation her collecting contemporary\nHis his the people she said Bush President at the party he turned over his calendars from the same month and at the same people are lifted on his challenger and as being like a social event at parties\nAnd she didn't go to school so she wouldn't even know those people and that was all his calendars were released after she made down again\nNone of them you know leaving her best friend can remember this like ... but that's not robbery you know what but you know in in\nCommon and in fairness I mean I Am I'm equally my twenty at high school reunion eating next month it's been a long time or not and I'm the youngest person here\nIf I was in a social function in high school and no one told me that a a a traumatic event for someone else had occurred I Would have not remembering the event the next week let alone Twenty years later it came to me now and said oh we're us has plenty of ...

over Thirty years I don't remember a lot\nOf things Thirty years ago or or I remember them differently than they were in his corrected\nLook I don't know who's telling the truth there but I think the mere allegation enough if that's now the standard to take somebody down uh I I think we wanted to\nI don't think this is an allegation I mean I I I think we know it I think that when you look at you know um [noise] people have put a lot of holes in the story of the the third accuser um and I think that you know you obviously have to hear both sides of you know when an accuser comes over to their credibility\nThis this user everything she has that you can cooperate with what she had done with how she has lived her life\nWhich are the notes from her therapy sessions\nWith little or no accurate

even know what's true anymore yeah that's harsh on the line I I\nDon't even know I think her testimony was a compelling testament but I Will give you value everybody watched that but I thought he was too and if my reputation for being trashed I'd be a little emotional ... as as well what happens\nNow everybody's back in the corners and it's a very divided country what it has done is it equalize the enthusiasm gap which was in the Democrats' favor prior to this [noise] I agree with that and and that is the politics of this we can argue\nForever there's got to be a good judge in history will tell that but it's really not a ... this was a certain this was a circus I think it's diminished that both the institution of the Senate\nAnd the and the ... the clown show and I just sort of it's a good will at least they took a week to go back in the interview some of these other people in close that the ... it's never going to be enough if you come back and you don't take this guy out for the Democrats\nAnd on same on the Republican side so we'll have a vote tomorrow I think it passes and and and you move on 'em and we'll go to like ... if he doesn't Patrick probably be the best result for the Republicans in other words yeah\nI agree I I think that the enthusiasm gap um I don't think it's not as much as the Republicans are claiming that has I think that there was some ...\nOr not they're not you know in our internal polling\nSure as you as you know like you know pulling motion noise than it while this is going on there was at and and the reality is rougher and the and the reality is that if you are correct and he's going to get confirmed that there's not going to be a Republican boost from this and the election in fact it will be the opposite it's going to add to this you know I mean I'm\nI'm In the Democratic until he was already at an eleven I mean I\nI don't think that's true and in fact I think that the Democratic intensity and she doesn't Seventeen ... you know you look at Virginia it was only in pockets of neighborhoods there were places where it wasn't a weapon um upper income white neighborhoods were off the charts for Democrats\nBut like the minority communities which have always been a historic democratic base have not been it we're not engage them twenty Seventeen election the same extent and they hadn't been engaged in twenty eight

other than you can certainly uh bring them up without even a claim to Barbara Comstock competitive yes\nBarbara Comstock whites than in the tens or Scottsdale are being challenged by a Elaine laureate and the second an\nIncumbent congressman Dave Brat go against several Abigail Spanberger in the seventh so let's start with a tent that's on everybody's mind\nWestern cops I look for that was that the debate in ... county and a Jeff from Washington was horrific I mean she was just absolutely drained out of food that are just pay property she I mean I\nIf you try to be fair in a debate if if I dressed up as her and did that debate in my goal was to be horrible should get worse than I could have done it in person or try to be there what was that\nThis announcement that the temp district is competitive ... by Barbara Comstock for Congress\nI mean it is going to be a double digit race she's reading from a script because she's trying not to screw up the fact that she's going to end by double digits um shop is fleet is capable of of doing more um than um\nThan that um you know she's been a state senator so I'm Talking on policy side I'm so she's not without shop right but at this point in this race she's being told we just script don't mess up that's what happened in that debate\nI don't disagree with you that like you know did was she a little plane at the debate yes did she make any major errors no and that's what Barbara Comstock so upset about the debate\nThat wants to talk about how she did so poorly barbers limited Jennifer didn't make any errors that allows barber to get back to the nights\nIn a landslide it's been a landslide the tenth district\nHad every single demographic group that is breaking against Trump in this country over represented in it if the Democrats do not take the tent the Republicans will hold Congress at that I agree with I don't think yeah it's it's not and and right now that's not in the realm of possibility\nBut the Republican polling is telling me that she's tired or slightly had\nBarbara is going to lose by double digits Tom when she's over perform for polling every time her whole career she's over ...\nYears the problem is in bend is every demographic group or the Republicans are losing market share right now are collected in for federal employees\nAre high income educated voters gun now she's a woman and she talks with the difficulty they have is the Republicans took away the one weapon Frank Wolf and I had to survive up here and that was your marks\nI was not Tom Davis I was Mr gotten close the prison Mr Woodrow Wilson bridge Mr rail to almost ... Barbara gets none of that uh because the Republicans get away with their constitutional obligation uh on on do you know to to designate projects\nSo this makes it even more difficult race it it's a single digit race\nUntil the closing weeks on a jet for in terms of their operate search or marketing what it is so I think this race quoting since I've seen races close a lot more at this point but this is this is a tough race it's a tough atmosphere and it's been tough district remembers\nThe last five delegates in that state in in right in the house last time in some of them might remind you money and did everything right you bring in a very good campaign and he wants to double digits or a dead Greece and none of his campaign ... but lost badly so right now this is where the anger is at this point and they're using her as a messenger\nTrip in fact what was that ... thing you said again just as she wants to be the next ... [laughter]\nI just I got to treat that out at eight thirty are driven Tom Davis ... Peterson and your guts of the truth you John just rhetoric let's get to the other races um\nLet's get to the seven I just said Barbara I just said ... drama show yesterday in a very complex candidate no doubt but ah I see a little momentum going for Dave I didn't think he was going to win and we can go now I I think he is going to win a\nHow do you see that race so I I had that one a slightly new Republican up until the Kavanaugh hearings at this point I think it's a toss up on because what the Kavanaugh hearings did was really re energized and fire up the one voter block\nThat's the problem for Dave Brat in some district which is suburban women\nUm and I think that the seven districts historically Republican should be Republican voter Republican ... I'm Still trying to my ship 'em but I'm the one path or a Democrat there isn't an right go in Chesterfield with the suburban women\nUm and I think Abigail the match for them and I think that the Republicans are doing everything they can to lose that block naturally right now um and so I haven't it's tough\nThink binge drinking Kool Aid on this Kavanaugh's nomination in terms of I mean I encourage let me just say yeah in in terms of what this is doing politically and I think we all live in our own echo chambers and we all have our own perceptions of how it's done but what this is done in ... in some other polling demonstrate this is the Republican base is now\nActivated enthusiasm gap which is favored the Democrats for the last year and a half is now closed substantially\nAnd I think that works to perhaps favorite ... David bread has two two issues though outside the demographics\nDistrict in the DNA that district is Republican number one he is not close the deal with some of some cancers people and they were just as soon thrown under the bus to rent that seat out for two years\nAnd bring back you know somebody it's more in line with their thinking and and even some scores and secondly Tim Kaine is going to be exceptionally strong in that district he was mayor of Richmond if he has a political he's widely ... he's the same I ... but he's well regarded\nThis jacks up that democratic turnout there so you got a factor that into this thing I still think at the end of the day that the DNA of that district establishes itself and brought wins but the but this was a close race from Democrats have nominated ... she's\nVariable and whatever happens you're talking about uh somebody that's got to be involved in democratic politics for some time I think I think Abigail Spanberger is going to happen to be somebody that has got to be reckoned with a\nAnd a democratic circles for some time to check\nDot die you know I don't I don't know a ton about the district uh uh you know I Will say I was driving down the south side virginity bird event last weekend and going through some of the rural counties and it seems like you're brat can pull margins outta those counties are but obviously the critical mass of the the district is in Chesterfield in right now so\nYou know I I Would probably say you know robotically it's a Republican district but obviously if it's a wave here than it could be one that the Democrats deal than would have to defend a twenty twenty\nOr those gets in the second district Taylor ... whatever happened was Scottsdale or the other day I had my radio show or the ... campaign put my [noise] my name and their team TV ads so I appreciate the PR for that for going on in that race but\nThere is this is my first chance to respond to Scott right after he had his meltdown on your show um that went viral yet I'm Upset about our analysis last time I'm announces has not changed she still is um and\nUm I don't think I don't believe in New York Times poll I think it was you know I ... up to this point I knew some schools are pretty good at the last week they've they've not been um I think there's some noise going on\nUm but I think is going to win and she's gonna win going away [noise] um so I think she's going to win going away I think it's going to be a [noise] a secular up until two months ago I was doing everything right um and he's really blown it\nAnd he's not going to win reelection and so are you saying because of the whole the validation Israeli citizenship issue in the way he's handled it and remember that this district is one of the even the country\nThat not only sits in the ... side a media market but isn't a media market that doesn't really stretch too many other districts\nSo the media has been all over the years on the evening news every night you know it Barbara Comstock at a petition scandal and attempt district it would have made the eating for forty five seconds one night\nOr maybe a week later they quickly re mentioned that you know it goes way you you cannot get away\nWith something like the tide water it's been on the road here so let me let me look I think our New York transport property rights cases is fixed that district very well\nUm you know at the navy seal all that kind of stuff is ... issue matrix and he's chosen I think you're in line with that district he's not a far right kind of guy he understands a suburban Virginia Beach in those areas so we have all that going for him now this petition scandal has at least a little bit\nAre Democrats who were watched as a Republican what scares me about this is the fact that if you look nationally Democrats just a ton of cash and drop it a couple of million dollars on that race in the last week that megaphone just can overwhelm at this point in exaggerate these things I think I\nThink they are trying to ... correct commentators up today a again if are betting I I I think he wins\nBut in this environment with a kind of money Democrats put down a you've got to be nervous about this you're going to watch this on election night if the Democrats win this seat it tells me it's going to be a pretty good year farm in terms of we're talking thirty five forty so yeah I\nThink about [noise] the thing about this district is different than Comstock and it's definitely different than a brat is the turnout model is totally different and I think it's hard for Democrats to win the seat in a non presidential year are just based on who votes democratic and Virginia Beach Norfolk\nIt's you know the the typical democratic voters will be a minority down there and in less you get an outsized performance it's not I think it's tough for the Democrats to win that seat I mean Glenn Nye one or two thousand and he got flushed down the drain and twenty ten\nAnd the reason was democratic vote came out in the presidential year for Brock Obama it wasn't there the next cycle for Glenn Nye 'cause nobody knew when I was [noise]\nUm I think Scott Scott advantages that the turnout I remember back when I was in the house carcass we'd look at the turnout bottles and the numbers and [noise]\nYou know Virginia Beach in Norfolk the numbers are just forty percent of what they are in other parts of the state so it's just it's it's you got a lot of people that live there that are you know enlisted men or women that are registered to vote elsewhere so it's just it's hard you know to have to break people out in that type of environment even though it's bench correct you have one media market and\nYou know they could possible Scott from now till the end of the time but there's going to be a conservative there's going to be a conservative votes that's going to come out\nAnd whether I'm a ... Maria I don't know how to pronounce it Laredo whether or not she can get people out based on her name as opposed to you know Tim Kaine is not as big a magnet there as he is enrichment um so I I still think it's a pill for the Democrats even though I agree it looks like God's kind of watch this one issue\nNinety six and Tommy ... well I'm ... we had a we had a scandal um state wide where John one or put a television ad up against Mark Warner who was John Warner was far ahead and um he photo shop Mark Warner and do a picture\nI remember who's in the ... I Can't remember who we do to stop ... shot but Clinton I think yeah you socialize with Clinton but was it was while her eyes ... there was a racial aspect to it too I Can't remember what they did but they\nDo to Mark Warner into a picture he wasn't in and um ended a television ad and it was a huge went national scandal for John Boehner who had a moderate brand and was a\nGuy that you know everyone looked she likes you know what you're trying to say Scott Taylor is there like had a friend okay and and and that people you know like respected John Warner much higher than Scott Taylor though [noise] and and his numbers collapsed and more wonder was going to win that race because of scandal and I will say that\nAnd and the captain of my ship and I'm responsible for what happened and I apologize and it's got Taylor a done that he would want to be\nSo August I was worse campaign chairman that year and it was a it was a close race Merck more than fourteen million dollars of his own money then here that means is really a much closer race than it might have been otherwise good strong on it was news on ... to ... or so or on the map and kind of heard it after running and close race there but I remember it out I mean they fired\nThe people that were involved in the ad and everything else in your brokered in it it was an issue for a week or two and then jumped accountability you took accountability said or has mishandled this might not be convinced just kind of destruction and having his people take the Fifth Amendment doesn't help it just keeps it in the news\nIs that enough to bring down somebody with a good reputation just done a good job in their first term or not\nUm and also I think the wave turnout are they talking about a new wave I think you're really talking about are pink wage that's really what's happening with the Democrats is the is the suburban female voters have swung radically or to the Democratic party and that's what\nWe're going to take off or get our predictions but when you're back the next segment we have got to get to the rest yet yeah I\nThat was going to expire this year because ... not ... percent again now they're taking Corey Stewart there'll be another five years with libertarian automatic ballot access loud\nThey're great and why does that that is a good point point and the fact water is going to get over five no no question probably seven godfather share some of that year was ... you think do you think Barbara is going to win or lose\nUh [noise] uh what what uh what about\nTaylor Maria [noise]\nGoing on [noise] and ah I see you were [noise]\n\n\nAnd uh [noise] ...

that but not for the reason the Republicans want it to be an amazing stat because people say nothing sticks on Trump\nAnd I think it's the opposite I think everything's on Trump the fact that you have an economy that's as good as it is and he's having a going to have a bad of an election at this point to have everything is sticking to him because you should have with the\nEconomy [noise] one of the first times where the president picks up see if it was an economy election [noise] um the Republicans could actually be gaining ground in the Congress and the area\nNothing sticks to Trump everything sticking to try [noise]\nWell I think he gets credit for the economy and I think [noise] I think he gets credit for the economy and I think that mitigate so against the wall says may take just because of the ... the cycle but\nThese coalitions are basically cultural coalition if they're not economic coalitions and as I said the Democratic enthusiasm in the independents wanting to balance the

evidence or not as well like they have a lot of them think they have reasonable evidence now I don't know what more is going to stay out of it you know what he's going to say um but I just think you look at the base and you look at the fact that the primary elections or what most of these members worry about that it's politics\nOr they're going to do it I'm not arguing where the earth of now\nTakes on Capitol Hill yeah well I I think what happens is it changes the dynamic for twenty Nineteen it was one thing that twenty Seventeen Trump's than Republicans control everything to put a check on him\nOnce the Democrats come in Congress like our clients of Republicans in Nineteen Ninety four it kind of everybody said oh it's the under Clinton played off against the Republican\n... he

when I catch the ticket the person that the counter told me the biggest payout she's ever paid at the sports book or when people will take about like that and rolled over for two or three seasons\nAnd she said you know the caps three feet and he wrote us money over it'll be two million dollars by the time they have three so I'm Still having this dilemma for the rest of the season I have not\nDone anything with the money yet because it may be that like you know it was just a thousand dollar additional investment\nI might need to roll it over a couple of times because I think the caps are legitimate threat not only to repeat this year to potentially do you have to repeat I'm only after all every year by year so that's my dilemma but I'm leaning towards the right now I actually think the steam as a special team and one that um is going to have a lot of success going forward\n[noise] well uh\nI hear what you're saying I bet the Astros last year to win the world series a tenor one

dynamics are changing in this and it's not just so much a matter of Trump or anything the demographics in this state are changing and they're changing almost daily [noise]\nAnd ah it's obvious which way you know they're moving are we going to be like Maryland no we're not going to be like Maryland but we um northern Virginia is beginning to look more and more northern Virginia suburbs more and more not totally but more and more like the Maryland suburbs\nNational it's not just reached one right happening nationally in these kinds of areas\nRight as I said New Jersey suburb send things going

the White House whether it will be there or not you know uh [noise] I I was joking was Mark Warner and I said you know we well we we need them they're just one more election [laughter] you know but I mean it's you know\nI'm a generally speaking we've done better generally speaking when there's been a Republican and the White House have their print exceptions yes\nGenerally speaking the Republicans have done better when the Democrats been in the White House have there been exceptions yes but the trend into there and it was a mistake of all time yeah understand and I\nI Would be surprised if we didn't know you know get to a Twenty one in the end of the election Adam minimum\nI think I I tend to agree you know you still have to defend a couple of dates you got a couple\nOf comments he got one over on the eastern shore that is in play I think Republicans can hold the blacks need if they don't have the black I I think that is far weaker today a it's an incumbent in probably anybody else because he has some personal proclivities and\nAnd and things that I think that hurts him among some of those voters we have some stronger candidates or black or I don't know what happens there you got a hundred and fifty thousand in the bank so I didn't sound like he's ready to go away very quickly but I\nWill do my advice to him and he got nowhere to hold on one of the phone and you want to go out to undefeated not indicted if you could do that and they lost before in mountain when he and house delegation moves over the first district to run for Congress and then he comes back but I don't think you want to injure career I I think\nSome issue ... after the initial matrix there where he has not really thinking or his voting record [noise] um [noise] ah to that district and you've got to state house at fifty one forty nine into redistricting that's critical happened that made many I mean we have to wait and see but may work and the Democrats have that the\nUm [noise] I mean it would appear that the judges are going to wind up drawing that house district has helped the Web and house districts [noise]\nAnd I think that's what whatever formula they come up with that is going to also be what the Senate's going to have to abide by twenty Twenty one and uh it could change or you know a stick to change an awful lot [noise]\nUm you know a hog the districts are unpacked not totally but below the numbers I mean look what Bobby Scott I'm In his district one from what fifty fifty six percent down to\nYou know one forties and I'm a [noise] you know produced another democratic district so you're gonna have to see how that plays out\nBut it seems to me that uh the judges drawing that district is by far and away their their best bet\nAnd if they do you know Supreme Court I think it ruled before the gerrymandering as is\nHas been constitutionally permissible until spills over and racial discrimination\nAnd therein lies the problem and that's what\nThe Republicans are facing there and it's going to change its going to change the way you know a whole makeup of legislatures around the country of course of course it's a five to four work will do this differently blocks of each other when they go back if I may be\nWrong but I think when they send it back to that lower court it was like seven to initially\nBut I I just think one of the thing is you got to understand the Republican base for better for worse is migrated from your country club the country and in so doing they're taking their self out of some competitive districts words were economic issues Republicans would be very viable\nSo it's not just the demographics of the fact that they have changed the emphasis on issues in ways that help them in South West Virginia robbery but but it hurts them in the growing parts of the state\nWe talk about the X. men at the office with a very popular governor with very little negative and you look at ... numbers ... support amongst Democrats\nWas not popular among Republicans was more polarizing in his numbers Ralph Northam has incredibly low negative ads for somebody in this environment you look nationally um he has very high positives very low negatives\nUm and in going into these competitive seats [noise] um I remember in twenty of London and Democrats drew the state Senate lines and they lost the majority and who was the\nThe person who was in every Republican ... that was flipping seats with Bob McDonnell I'm In a popular governor can play a big role now and that's a big um item that timetable\nThat you have to have a messenger boring to celebrate the respect harmony of Thomas writes the the I mean it that that national same ways very heavily you know which is why you've had you know the the patterns that you've had\nUntil McAuliffe beat to Janelle human you know what happened for almost fifty year I'm gonna I'm into I've been here about the surveys like let's take for example that started at the start of and she was not driven by national politics and twenty fifth and it was driven by local politics in Chesterfield versus Richmond and I'd like to be democratic\nUm and I think that we and we don't know if we'd had more aggressive candidate but we don't have we entered its campaigns don't matter yeah yeah I don't think we had a ... I don't think we had a great message or there I think if you rerun that same race and twenty Nineteen and you had Ralph Northam auntie\nI'm In that district Ralph would flip it on it I'm going to be as they are they all vote the votes and stardom and it's chaos is going to create problems for them\nYou know I think that's the greater problem is that he's he's he's not harmonious with the district on some of those hot button issue I just say that like Rob working good governor I think it's a wonderful man but he gives a fireside chat in the FARC has now you put him on TV ... it it's it's not the same kind of rally the tape\nBut he's an asset to them ever make any difference in how to use that ... I don't know if that's the kind of governor you actually need this and he picked up not a fiery a pick up Fifteen ... I think in terms of the\nColor of his fiery and I'm at a carnival Barker one and and he doesn't he doesn't pick up the flavor up north I'm dead\nWell north of it and pick 'em up Trump picked\nHim up for him yes if Trump would have been president and twenty Fifteen we'd be in the majority\nThey look I I yeah I just got an additional Ralph Northam disagree however I think he's been pretty much just said a\nChemical upon by three points and rapport with him on by eight and ... pick up the receipts and picked up by point difference was not fifteenth of friends who are either but it was also a hotel different\nLet me tell you they're white heralded Frank about Trump okay I was a driving factor sure dog last November on top of that [noise] um [noise] you had a ... and spilled over into everything\nAnd keep in mind Gillespie was not create you know I mean he was very polarizing [noise] but um\nI just think people keep underestimating as governor\nOh I don't think anybody on the rest of the ... I don't think anybody underestimate same but they know it was I mean you know what's driving politics in Virginia right now is not a Ralph uh it's it's what's going on across the Potomac River\nIt's negativity is driving politics on both sides right now in the one thing about Robert and he doesn't that many negative [noise] still going to have many many he's a very like about\n... I'm not you know art now go you know been knocking on doors since may I have not gotten one negative comment about brown none and that's you know it's I mean people liked him he's just a likeable person either\nBut he's not a fire reader that gets voted off for you know I I think Tom Davis was not a fire eater they've got to vote for the Republicans but for Twenty years\nEvery single Republican piece you would have thought the person was married to Tom Davis because the Republican candidate had a picture bigger than their own picture with a quote him saying like here's why they'd be great for your time sometimes with Russian um so I mean having a messenger is important and democratic not had\n... I I agree but now he's taken out an incumbent that we are not entirely different that\nI don't know I tell you what man I I that's the joke joke kind of beat or do you guys under estimate Morsi and I'm telling you what he had a disastrous press conference I wasn't there and it was a\nDisaster of all time so he had a disastrous press conference that really hurt them all kinds of underhanded things going on but uh you know after that\nMorsi's mayor and you know the the thing about Joe is he's an independent thinker he's got to do with the only way he's a you know he's not\nA he's not a whole bunch of any of the establishment caucuses or anything like that\nI think he's got to play very well in that district and I think a lot of his uh friends there that I don't think that he got screwed by what they did to him and and take\nCan I jump most of the smartest thing I've ever seen anyone to in politics when he won the ...
