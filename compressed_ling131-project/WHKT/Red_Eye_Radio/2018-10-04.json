Leach on Twitter you know he had a great quote on balance you know balance is not fifty percent Ron it's about fifty percent pass\nIt getting your skill players all five of on the ball and then in a balanced manner and I think we do that and then he acquainted with its own all kinds of doing that and it's true you know in the ... often quarterback or back to back them both receivers\nOf a chance to touch the ball and then an hour walk up and running back and\nForth receivers and of course quarterback I'll get a chance to touch the ball and we got a lot of guys catch the ball making plays and they know the ball become doormen anyplace so they're playing at a faster level and we'd like to play fast\nAnd now the boulevards because [noise] we thought the advantage we have in your mind as we can be mentally and physically better condition than our own it's so pointing to hundred played the game is contagious last fall than\nOkay so in last week's gay and there was another great game and

sounds on the ground so I mean you can see the team's not balance you get tough yards when you need them but I'm\nThe level of sophistication in this offsets um as you as you you run your various schemes is pretty impressive and and\nThat the other thing is you did see is throwing that everybody right I mean you've got like six or seven receivers in involved in this involving assault that's\nCorrect yeah that's the design is to take the defense gives us again it's very similar to her blog some football it's just you're throwing the ball the spots versus reading a dipole back in pitching the ball I think it's more exciting for the fans because they see the ball the whole time and it definitely\nHelps us in recording because\nWe can find a lot of guys that like the running catching a lot of guys like to throw the ball biting running quarterback they can also throwing up\nAnd keep the defense on us because it was very difficult nowadays because everybody's looking for that guy with you know all the R P o teams and those are all ... teams so the guys are the kind of get left out or the guys like read that you know maybe a little bit like maybe there's\nOne or two deep facts that are ... or somebody doesn't want 'em\nBut they're ... and we can find those guys and I think it's playing dividends that season off at school [noise]\nUh there's no question a let's

themselves well it's kind of leak out because\nThe Denver the Senate Democrats did anything negative in there like you had Fifteen beers one day that's that's going to lead [noise]\nI don't think making a file public is a good idea [noise] corn and went\nOn to say that since the accusations have been made public just seems to me the people\nAre not going to be satisfied until some public statement about what the FBI investigation showed it doesn't matter what it shows that the ... the Democrats are going to criticize the good that they're going to interpret it in a different way it doesn't matter the whole this whole thing doesn't matter\nIt doesn't matter what the FBI comes back with us less safe found corroborating evidence beyond doubt and that's something I'm an Asian or what ever they have in that report the Democrats will refuse it it's not long enough that it's not big enough that an interview enough people there's other people to interview the other witnesses they haven't done it\nThe White House managed it it's a sham\nWe need another week it doesn't matter what it comes back with you know with the Democrats are going to say a cabin on\nThe bottom line is this guy that died every single accusations every single one so the question becomes then where do you go from here [noise] so this report is going to come out today or tomorrow\nIt's going to go to the Senate Judiciary committee or they're trying to go to the full Senate because everybody has to see it in order to vote on it and McConnell Ted got to have a vote on Saturday and not about what to to

or not it doesn't matter what evidence we have but he's got to go so uh\nForget to process forget the fact that he got he got a bum rap here forget the fact that uh people jumped on him and that we have no corroborating evidence but he should go because we just think you should go\nAnd we should move onto another Supreme Court nominee like how 'bout Merrick Garland is wrapping up right he says ultimately this is Corey Booker ultimately not whether he is innocent or guilty that's not a trial\nWe have enough questions have been raised we should not we should move to another candidate\nMove onto another candidate okay so now if you just raise questions and make false allegations that's in enough in order to sink candidates and destroyed\nLives that are going on that have been nominated by president to go on the Supreme Court\nUnbelievable that's Cory Booker speaking during a press conference on Capitol Hill you said the partisan rancor\nIs enough to derail the nomination Booker went

who knew the candidate while as a classmate really there was like Fifteen hundred people who came out\nAnd said the guy was absolutely one of the best friends classmates and associates they've ever had and he was above reproach has integrity and work ethic was not in question so you get a handful of people that say the opposite\nAgainst Fifteen hundred who signed letters\n\nAbout his his um temperament into ... work ethic and everything else [noise] but that's a\nApparently for Cory Booker that's all you need a it's this [noise] I got to tell you what I'm telling you if the Republicans do a ...\nFrom heaven on Saturday they don't deserve to have a party and they won't get crushed in the mid term\nBecause Trump voters are going to say you know what\nThey can go to hell and they are not going to come out because they will have stood for nothing\nAnd the problem is they're all gonna get lumped it Jeff life's going to vote now I tell somebody that last night Jeff Flake is going to

leader McConnell saying look we were going to have\nA vote I Believe it's going to be on Saturday and respect the FBI report to be released what either tonight or early tomorrow so\nThose senators will have a chance to look at it there's nothing in it that is a bombshell them some corroborating evidence in their report\nPoint that Republicans mustard their inner fortitude and vote for Brett Kavanaugh thereby ensuring a shift to the right on the Supreme Court which of course what all this mayhem it's about for the for example future this is a very\nImportant Supreme Court\nChoice and the nomination men and confirmation because it will indeed impact\nOur country that liberal progressive agenda that has merrily written along with the Supreme Court for many years it's about ... and and I think that is why you have people really debasing themselves trying to make sure that this nomination doesn't go through it obviously it comes down to fray\nCollins and Murkowski I think both Collins and Murkowski will vote for Kavanaugh if there is nothing in that report\nFlake I have no idea he is so compromise but at the end of the day he portrayed himself and in fact his ratings and voting records show he is a conservative so is he really willing to squander that\nPossibly unique opportunity to put a conservative on the court and guarantee as I say quite a\nFew years of conservative bias on the court\nIs he willing to throw that away because he is so\nEager to people loved by the left I have no idea the man is so full of hatred for Donald\nTrump than it appears he'll go to any lengths whatsoever to confront him but honestly I Would be shocked if he votes against him\n[noise] well where are we differ on that you got to vote\nYeah it would be I think he wants to be lying in the New York times and the Washington Post or some kind of a Republican hero\nOf our time and so you do write a book and the whole thing and and make a lot of money you got to vote no it really comes down to Collins and Murkowski there'll be no it was just this is no secret and um I Would be personally shocked if there's nothing in this report\nAnd columns voted no I I just could not even things are getting on TV and trying to explain it\nBecause she never said anything stupid I mean if you follow suit because like I Do I Love following her because every time she speaks like okay that makes it even if you know what I was I think\nYou're right I don't think she'd have any grounds for doing it and she has kept an open mind from the start right\nAnd she has basically said unless something's surface you know there's no reason not to vote for him what do you think about Murkowski\nI could not\nImagine if college to tell the least she's going to vote yes yeah that Lisa Murkowski all alone in Alaska sinking this nomination and seeking the fate of the last\nTwo years of the Trump Administration up to twenty twenty\nBecause it'll it'll destroy the Republican Party as we know what\nYeah this guy goes down with their weapons that's different\nNo I agree with him at his wedding ring so that it's\nI don't know how you take somebody down where there's no evidence because then\nYou basically warn the Democrats\nYes that I think is almost the most offensive part of that scenario I totally agree ... show boating self\nPromoting a heinous behavior the lack of decorum the lack of decency Dianne Feinstein sitting on its information simply because it made it for a more potent gotcha moment there's that really\nIs happening is that the Republicans are going to condone I sure as heck hope not and I think I agree I think Mitch McConnell and the other a card in this decade metro tunnel has been absolutely\nFerocious about getting judges on the Supreme Court and lower courts he has made it his part he has basically refused to put through a lot of other um senior administration officials who are awaiting confirmation because judges have been\nHis priority and I think he's very smart for doing I think he's ... I mean the Republicans across the country should be applauding us because nothing more than\nThe judicial branch needed to repair it more than that and I so I think it's incredibly important that he's doing that um and I think he will get Murkowski\nAnd Collins in her room and promised them the moon politically or if they go along with this and I don't mean that he should have to because as you point out if there is no evidence to support any of these charges shame on them\nFor even wavering mean\nWhether you've got drunk in high school or not what we know now is Steven briar was arrested for under age drinking that\nDidn't seem to stop his confirmation and yet it's not necessarily equivalent but let's get a grip here folks and look at what we know about this man what we know is it for Thirty years he has been have you with unbelievable dignity intact dirty\nA decorum he has had no charges ever leveled against him like anything like this as an adult so on the other side of that ledger we have hundreds of opinions that people things so highly of that they are frequently used as a reference point in\nA other judgments and other arguments legal arguments this man deserves a place on the Supreme\nCourt I really hope he gets there\nOkay we're we're listening to tribute to\nThe newspaper the hill and also the hill on the line at all so far and she has a new column called Trump's America First scores when the New York also I Love your website I Love the flu\n[laughter] me in a good mood you're\nLike yeah I I have to say it's the kind of thing that you know you put off doing for like years because it's just too much trouble but I appreciate that thank you\nWeird\nThe fact is we're we're friends but I also love the way uh your name is at the top in what is that called when you're writing it might not always the script script yeah not a script and\nIt's very soft and it also matches address you have on that is on your thing it it's the same um like blue so it just works I talked\nTo and I appreciate that why they are now I Would\nHave happened on nine help her who agreed pushes me to do everything that's constructed [laughter] pushed me to get an answer\nFor that yeah whoever does your website tell them that John Frederick [noise]\nLove [laughter] well thank you\nThank you for having me [noise] I gotta run always fun to talk to you pretty\nLet's take thanks for being with us Steve Bannon coming up at\nFive right here on the job for his radio network that's have you with us and also sheriff Clarke will be joining us seven thirty five plus your calls got a couple of texture that I can read a real fast I got about where\nAnd let's get to this uh Germany in Chesapeake says what all of us has shown me is that we have an issue with using the justice system to legislate\nInstead of the legislative branch doing the jobs that might be the point to great cabinet so it was written opinions are not use it's a scorched earth politics\nMight be the plan\nI don't think it matters once you've confirmed it doesn't matter what you think it doesn't matter I mean you saw that with the Clarence Thomas he is he is a storm or George from Newport News you'd never passed out drinking beer because you drink rolling rock it's a cheap beer drinker real clear\nHe says and you will blackout\nBrand Josh records radio network truckers will stay with us [noise]\nFamily but he went to this bird that it shouldn't be about it should be out that it should be about the constitution the American people showing like\nWe were swaying they need to be punished families to come out for other people that have [noise]\nStill for him like that as it goes against which I don't think there will be at least at least you know a lotta merit to it [noise]\nYou know that's a great point Mac\nThe Bush family wears George Bush where's the\nNowhere to be found not one of them\nYou're right [laughter]\nWhere's the Bush family does anybody know yeah there there's there's certainly not shy about criticizing President Trump when they don't like somebody does right they jump right into that ...

Kevin I use that's what it's become you know this man has been put on his family's been posted on this cruel and unusual punishment is I'm as far as I'm concerned that is prohibited by the eighth amendment to the constitution so all these constitutional\nIssues that are involved in this uh you know guilty before a proven\nInnocent or the rule of law due process is trash the rule of law has been thrown out\nWe live in a country where you don't have to prove your innocence but all of a sudden now when it comes to judge Kevlar you gotta ... innocent these charges so this whole thing has been passed or die I'd say enough is enough I was disappointed when Chuck Grassley initially move the date from September twenty fifth\nAnd we'll get to the Thursday and then they moved it again you're all trying to appease the Democrats nothing's going to peacetime you see what they're doing now the Democrats\nCome up with a list of twenty five people they want interviewed their job I don't know if if if I Know Mitch McConnell understands and he said at the ... percent of the other day but you know\nTeaching the Democrats and well why John think about this three senators plenty Murkowski income was reportedly went to the president said hey we need political cover to fold why don't you just do this this ah FBI investigations so we can get by this ruin\nWhy would you need political cover to do the right thing but see that's what politics in the swamp has become the doing\nI think this shit [noise]\n... ah I really appreciate what you're saying and sharing that perspective because I hadn't thought of it\nWay and you're right and what happened here's the problem with being in DC all the time like me is you take that for a grain of salt because it is kind of the way to swap is so I I never\nReally reacted to that but your one hundred percent on target why would you need political cover\nTo vote for somebody who has false allegations against them and I say they're false because they're not proven they're not corroborated there's no witnesses and the witnesses that were um that were identified\nEither denied it or refuted it so you're right sheriff Clarke what political covered you need for that\nBut you know what I mean I think you just need\nLook there's there's no evidence and it's incredible and\nUp I think Jeff Flake is going to vote no he's he's he's got some and I said this earlier today has got some image and his head where he's got to be you know why and I got to be the darling of the New York times it'll be you know featured on CNN has some great free thinker or something\nSo it really comes down to a Collins and Murkowski I mean that's what it comes down to what do you think they're going to do on Saturday sheriff Clarke\nWell I don't know what to think in terms of what they're going to do this people it flip flop around they don't go to concerts it's really hard to say I mean we all thought John McCain may have some rest in peace was going to vote to eliminate\nObamacare and he came in there and cast the deciding vote to keep it alive so it's hard to say these politicians you don't know where they're\nComing from and it's all of them are in the swamp and and really change their mind by the minute so in terms of Collins and Murkowski probably whoever gets to where they're going to\nYou know what that that that might very well but yet so I guess you could say if the FBI Reid for his release we think it will it it it could be this evening early tomorrow\nIf there's nothing in it than they have the whatever it is political cover they needed and you would think this nomination would go through 'em let me just ask you this if it doesn't go through what type of stuff do you think that's going to have sheriff

costs some businesses can grow families can have more money in their pockets\nAnd it's also about making our electricity cleaner so obviously we've been shutting down a lot of coal plants over the last several years because of tighter environmental controls and regulations and we'll replacing that with cleaner burning natural gas solar wind all the things that you talked about before\nSo this this project is all about growing the economy creating thousands of new jobs rebuilding the manufacturing sector um we started construction earlier in the summer and we made a lot of progress in West Virginia North Carolina\nOr haven't started yet and Virginia we're still waiting on one final approval from the state environmental agency\nAre but we expect to get underway\nIn Virginia here I'm pretty short like ah you're right that for about six weeks or we have to stop work uh before circuit court of appeals are ordered a couple of agencies the fish and Wildlife Service the national Park Service to revise some of their permanent\nThe agencies were able to do that relatively quickly and suddenly got back to work\nOnce the permits will re issued a few weeks ago and we're making full steam ahead and in West Virginia North Carolina and I'm hopefully starting in January of pretty soon\nSo the six were holed up what is the barriers and now it's just getting to John in Virginia just put it in layman's terms for listener\nCharles so we need we we we've got all the state and federal permits we need for West Virginia and North Carolina this is a free state project [noise] ah we have one more permit that still outstanding and Virginia and that's the\nIt's a permit for erosion and sediment control basically Virginia Department of environmental quality they regulate construction\nProjects so that you don't create erosion and sediment patients so that you get much water into streams and rivers [noise] um the agency has done an incredibly thorough job of revealing every single parents\nOf the pipelines pass through Virginia all of our roads and in fact my control plans\nUm they'd been reviewing our plans for for more than a year now [noise] um but we expect to get final approval on those plants here I'm In the early fall so we'll we'll be able to get underway in Virginia [noise] and then we'll be working continuously through that\nJack which started early or late in the spring or early in the summer um animal will finish up and up next year and John\nThis is all that you know once this project is built [noise] people are going to see a significant improvement in the economy particularly in the eastern or area in Hampton Roads um they're gonna see lower energy costs you know the problem we got him to a gym yet as we haven't rebuilt our our natural gas infrastructure for decades\nAnd so the infrastructure that we have\nIs in keeping up with consumer demand that we're using more and more natural gas to generate cleaner electricity heat hers power the economy\nBut we haven't built more infrastructure to bring in the additional supplies of natural gas but we need so what's happening is free at last for winners the pipelines were so over strained serve our region that\nBusinesses have their service shut off for several days hundreds of major industrial companies had their their natural gas service cut off and consumers need hundreds of millions of dollars for an energy costs than they would have if we had the Atlanta 'cause ... it's it's simple laws it's supply and demand you have\nMore demand and supply your your prices are going to sky rocket so until we get the Atlantic coast pipeline\nBuilt consumers and businesses are going to pay hundreds of millions more energy costs when they showed 'em and businesses are going to continue to have their their service shut off during the winter and so that that makes it hard to do business far for existing companies\nBut it makes it impossible to attract new industries like manufacturing to help grow the economy so this this infrastructure is really critical to our economy it's important for the environment\nWe're making progress and and we're going to get a Tom\nI Want you Aaron Aaron is she spokes person and a communications strategic communications manager for dominion energy for the Atlantic coast pipeline I Want you to address the concerns of those people that are opposed to the pipeline\nHonored and fire middle ground [noise] um and I\nI don't mean the ground so I just don't like any type of energy except solar and wind that's one set\nA but then there's the other set which is they have real environmental concerns that of course our traditions always been if you're going to transport natural natural gas is only three ways train truck or pipeline trains getting accidents train crash\nThis hour from now on hold on I'm not that it's on the southern final confirmation vote on Brett Kavanaugh\nThis weekend with the FBI supplemental

Alabama where they take on the Sanford bulldogs don't want to miss that's not one minute of it right because you never know me and my eyes and every game now and ...\nShe has her own five yes they have that stream just nail biter one after the other\nLosing by three to ... age to E. T. S. you a couple of weeks ago then the fifty two hundred fifty game Western Carolina then last week Mercer a they were in until the final minutes and then in front of a lot of football for you a lot on the score\nBoard and they're never out of the game and coach walk and I was with us now he's got this often just rocking I mean look if you're in your mind than you'd never see the day which is a very young team where they're putting up fifty and thirty eight points a game and it's these are not\nAt the end of the game right this is there in it to the final minutes\nAnd although there I Want to find they're going to start to uh get some of these W is coming up maybe this week at Sanford and the er Sanford dogs one and for a win for in the conference joining us now coach Scott Walker happened in the MIT debts and coach great county man\n[noise] excuse me on John\nOkay look these scandals manager so exciting\nWait until a Saturday\nTo put my me and my she that's on and\nTo give credit where do I know your own five you know when you're going to give me the speech about winning and all that\nStuff and I get all that but what this is coach this exciting football and just starting all these other class men I mean you've got something going on man\nI think we've done a really good job recruiting we just had a big recruiting a meeting yesterday 'cause we're we're going to buy a week and you know recruiting to BMI very unique and it takes a little bit of time to learn it and I think the staff and I am you know\nTrying to figure it out the best way to go about our business on the road recruiting and we've got some really good young players that are contributing you know out\nOf high level I Do think we're a plane and exciting level up often football or it was definitely my old to do so um I don't know if you follow Mike Leach on Twitter you know he had a great quote on balance you know balance is not ... percent Ron it's not ... percent pass\nIt getting your skill players all five of on the ball and then in a balanced manner and I think we do that and then he equated it to the ... all kinds of doing that and it's true you know in the ... often quarterback pullback to have backed them both receivers of\nA chance to touch the ball and then in ... off and running back\nAnd forth receivers and of course quarterback all get a chance to touch the ball and we got a lot of guys catch the ball making plays and they know the ball becomes the norm in any way so they're playing at a faster level and we like to play fast\nAnd snap the ball a bunch because we thought the advantage we have to be a mind as we can be mentally and physically better condition than our own and spoke quite know how to play the game is\nGame and in another pretty gritty our sense of performance fire team you're young quarterbacks didn't ski\nThrows for another four hundred plus yours four hundred and thirty yards and yet twenty first first thousand this game Nineteen and I'm coming on the parents but\nYou got you got nine first I was on the ground so I mean you can't see the team's not balanced you can get tough yards one you need them but um [noise]\nThe level of sophistication in this offsets um as you as you you run your various schemes is pretty impressive and and\nUh the other thing is you did skiing is throwing everybody right I mean you've got like six or seven receivers involved in is involved is often\n[laughter] yeah that's the design is to take the\nDefense gets that's again it's very similar to her blog from football it's just you're throwing the ball the spots versus reading it died pulled back in pitching the ball but I think it's more exciting for the fans because they see the ball the whole time and it definitely helps us in recording because\nWe can find a lot of guys that like running catching a lot of guys like to throw the ball biting running quarterback that can also growing up and keep the defense on a spin it very difficult nowadays because everybody's looking for that guy with you know all the\nR P o teams and those are all ... teams so the guys that are kind of get left out or the guys like read that you know maybe you're a little bit like maybe there's one or two defects Clemson or somebody doesn't want 'em but they're growers and we can find those guys and the I think it's playing dividends that season off at school [noise]\nUh there's no question a let's get let's get to the game coming coming up this week\nThis is a winnable game no question I mean Sanford's having their good team that they're having some struggles also are there are always pretty tough at home though going Alabama Alabama I'm how are you preparing your team for this game anything different\nBut we got an open week this week John So we're not we're not playing Saturday and we got Sanford and then we've got the citadel the following week so\nEverywhere else I'd been on an open week you take the next two opponents what you're going to play and you kind of divided up the practice time\nSo we get young men on Monday all other than film study and uh lifting weights was very impressed one of our receivers gig on low arrived to plain Ninety five plays having a hundred and fifty yards and the touchdown on ten catches a went in there and set a new PR for squad max on Monday by ten pounds [noise]\nEnjoy more didn't well Austin brats or did we had three guys that we are as you know during in season on on squad which is\nA testament to the job day form in doing it in her weight room but we're taking this week working on the in the best you're getting better have what we need to improve and then putting in a neutral schemes against Stanford and spending bill especially events were against it at all because\nThings will coordinator in it it's very difficult to defend your like ethnic are often it's just difficult to the fans\nAre the big game at home you've got Stanford next week or Saturday I still researching then you come home against the Senate down on the twenty and that's always the big game for you chatter chatter Chattanooga then you go on the road right\nAfter that a let's let's talk about your decent I mean they're little tough or the last couple of weeks if you look at the\nMercer game Mercer gain I think I'm doing this my memory about seven and a half yards of play um that's just unacceptable I mean you can't you can't win that way how are you in dressing that [noise]\nWell defense was ... years where are you most shows you know we lost a running for instance in Allen cracks\nAnd birds your graduation both of them are\nWorking great jobs making over sixty thousand dollars a year a Allen's in in in Richmond and a raw onions in Roanoke are both working seen both young men are very impressed with them but we got to replace them into you know replace him with Eliot Brewster who's you know why we registered sophomore and\nHe gets better each and every week I thought he pointed his best game against a Mercer and then you know ... the older guys each it's been starting and then we had been back to the moslem Liam cough Lynn and Lynn is battling a\nAn injury right now and hadn't played the last two games and then you got hurt the third play of the most are gaining and tried to fight through and and", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Red Eye Radio", "city": "Portsmouth", "day":
