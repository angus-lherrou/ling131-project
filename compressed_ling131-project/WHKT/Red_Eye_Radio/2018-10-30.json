[noise]\n\n\n\n\nThere's one guy do love the truth and that to me it's great to have you with us today what the fake news resulted again with state polls coming at you all over the place they make these pulled up to drive a fake narrative don't believe that it's the same thing they did it two thousand sixteen they're doubling down they wanted the press\nI thought the court I think it was odd today because I was like okay so it's getting out of the news that we get another one right I don't\nKnow I just I don't know that some crazy person is doing it but it just seems awfully odd to me\nHere's the thing is the Democrats\nThe Schumer is the the the whole crowd that whole mob over there they were screaming\nWe must have the FBI investigate before we can vote on Kavanaugh there must be a full investigation before we can vote on him before we can decide whether you should uh be you know we didn't send to the Supreme Court\nThe same the same we must have an FBI investigation before we can let that happen\nThey're not even waiting for the FBI to investigate worthy bombs are coming from before they start blaming President Trump\nDeclared President Trump guilty responsible\nFor the whole thing they're not waiting for the FBI to investigate these are the same\nPeople that three weeks ago\nSaid we cannot do anything until the FBI finishes its investigation so I mean they were total hypocrites it it is absolutely ear responsible or beyond counterproductive it it's absolutely you're responsible for them to be saying this is all about because the President Trump\nOr they're they're trying they're trying to score political points off switch you have to ask who benefits from these bombs that's all I'm not saying who did it it it's\nObviously some crazy person because no sane person sends bombs or fake bombs through the mail we don't know the bombs are real are fake or\nThey emptied out some firecrackers put it in a in a in the toilet paper two and a a attacks the digital watch to it to make it look like a scary thing we don't know it's Halloween time it's easy to scare people what can I tell you\nWe don't know and I'm not going to go down\nThat road where I can say is whoever did it is crazy in one way or another mother gr certify bleed can be committed to an institution crazy or just that they've got a screw loose you don't do that kind of normal people well adjusted people don't do that okay by definition\nPappy Canada has a column today very makes the point that when John Kennedy was assassinated Lee Harvey Oswald who defected to the Soviet Union was pro Cuba\nUh he was found to be the shooter a yet who got blamed for the John birth society and all the conservatives so this is talk of the first time that the guilt by association or let's let's let's slammed the conservative let's blame everything on ...\nSend these packages so it's a everybody's got to calm down take a breath and uh I think Sarah Sanders had it right we should be coming together the president is calling for unity dialing down the rhetoric\nAnd the Democrats are going in the opposite direction they're they're they're blaming the president unequivocal he no question about it taking no responsibility whatsoever\nFor calling the guy look at the sky Brennan said the president is guilty of trees\nOr what the what the penalty for treason that he's basically a former head of the CIA had been out they're calling for the president to be hung by the neck until dead and this is not considered inflammatory rhetoric I it's\nIt it's disgusting the whole thing is just just hypocritical these people will go down to the edge as the all time greatest hypocrites\nJust ask you something a skirt is I think you make a great analogy that pushes as of the Democrats who cried and screamed and whine about\nChavez on getting the FBI and that is that's getting everything I mean why don't we just wait here I mean the FBI seems to be again and southern part of the guys come up with a report for duty so we're going to find out the answer and why not just white\nRight exactly how about everybody say calm down let's we got we we have the FBI on the case unless this guy was a or gal or or or black\nOr whatever [laughter] whatever it was the creator these packages\nAnd less that entity was a very very very sophisticated person or evil or an invite and if they were very sophisticated they were able to cover their tracks\nBut considering the number of packages delivered to these various places coming out of one place\nThere are a lot of clues there and I'm confident that the FBI will be able to figure something out here\nAnd find out who did it for narrow it down and the fact that they use Debbie Wasserman Schultz as a return address that kind of interesting in itself Debbie Wasserman Schultz was the one who was forced to step down from the head of the Democratic National Committee a because\nShe had been reading the system for Hillary against Bernie I don't know what that means but it's sort of an interesting clue you know maybe somebody thought that was funny to use her name out all these bombs I don't know uh but my point is is\nUnless this was a very sophisticated operation that they knew how to cover their tracks\nAt every step of the way you've got twelve packages now that the FBI is investigating it let's wait for the FBI to figure this out to come up with something yeah why not wait before you start a and and why not why are they not waiting because they want to politicize it the Democrats\nWell it's uh it it seems it just seems odd to me that\nThat all this is happening but let's wait I mean that's where everybody's saying let's wait any time let's get to let's get the economy will get to the Taliban invasion after the bottom of the hour a look let's get to the new economic numbers that just came\nOut the gross domestic product GDP growing another three and a half percent now let me just say what this means right this is the first time we have had\nBack to back quarters or in a very long time of of of over three and a half percent growth factor back and consumer confidence uh I'll put it\nAll time high consumer spending was four percent another great a quarter of economic growth this is more bad news for the damage they don't want to talk about this that they don't want to talk about the economy or jobs or the growth so what did they talk about\nAre they talking well they talk about they've got this wonderful thing to talk about it was horrible thing to talk about here with the with the bombs and they talk about the president again they're following and they don't realize they're falling into a trap and and it's their own drop a tropical their own making\nPeople don't want to hear the Democrats talk about\nThe president they want to hear Democrats Republicans the politicians in Washington talk about what they're what the politicians are going to do for them to make their life better write what I\nI I go to work every day I got a family to support I got a job I'd like to get a raise what are you going to do to make that happen how are you gonna make my life better easier to make me rich uh make make make my kids you know healthier talking about President Trump talking about you're\nA Native American DNA doesn't do that [laughter]\nIt's true that John Yoo about\nPresident Trump are causing the bomb scare doesn't do that so going back to the for the last two years old I've been talking about President Trump is a Russian agent and now they're President Trump as a Russian agent who Craig creates bomb scares I mean\nThey're they're they're not doing themselves any St Bart's\nThey paint and on the other side I mean it burns very clear jobs\nNot mobs President Trump and the Trump Administration has created the best economic conditions in this country and in the generation the best we've seen in ten Twenty years and that goes along the way that that\nDancers people's questions what have you done for me lately you've gotten me a job you've gotten me a raise you've gotten my kids all food stamps he got kicked out of the basement there on their own now great thank you very much\nLet me ask you something I'm going to pose this question and then you're going to answer it when it gets back so stay with us for another segment of the

yeah\nIt is there is a feeling of days or move here all of these national generic ballot polls are meaningless national elections\nOther they're all like I mean this whole thing falls I I've been talking all day about the Washington Post poll that came out yesterday that shows that are for whites than they had to Barbara Comstock energy to censor twice Thirteen last question might when she should the favorite no doubt that's a very tough for district Republicans when barb is\nEvery internal poll that the Republicans have\nFrom the White House to the end or CC's too Barbara on down shows the race question does not have any Thirteen points but this is what the Washington Post they get paid or\nThey get a ridiculous methodology to get a fake paws you get a fake analysis of it to do fake news to get a fake inclusion drawn so they can continue on with their fake narrative and like we've already been down this path so now I'm going to start hauling them on how ridiculous that isn't they're doubling down at the same\nHouse that's why the way round the John perfect radio network I understand your Godzilla of the truth in America were eleven things out to the biggest ... election

Harlem but\nThe bombs were there they're going to bomb rushed the border it's a bummer yeah\nThere's a lot to say one more thing about the uh about the election before the [noise] you just said it's about turnout and that's what this is all about you've got the polls you got all this nonsense calls you've got this that it's about identifying voters sometimes pockets of twenty five voters here since the borders they're\nSeventy five voters they're a hundred\nThere distinct pockets of voters that are on our side in identifying them and getting them out to the polls that's what this was going to come down to that's what it's coming\nDown to the Republican National committee and others are doing a great job of that\nAnd uh that's what's going to determine this as much as all that probably more than all the ads and everything else so I encourage everyone to go out and vote and bring your friends and if they're going to vote for the other side don't bring them let them out of their tires\nI don't know you don't do that we don't do that and we don't do that\nBecause you're lucky if you if you have a democratic neighbor and they're going to vote the all the way down and they can't get to the polls you don't have a rise to the polls do the right thing\nNow you are so nice just to get them around as\nYou know what we want every vote to everybody that as an opportunity to go get him out and get them a cup of coffee because at the end of this you're still your\nNeighbor that's right there was a British\nStill Americans were in this together runners together and you know what you can disagree and not just that you have to oh good okay in the caravan now that what the air out of the towers there that's a good idea [laughter] the Caribbean is very different because that's an

once they get to the United\nStates and it's a set foot on American soil and say the words credible fear they qualify for that triggers the whole asylum seeking procedure and then once they're enmeshed in the silent seeking procedure\nAll of the interlocking court cases and rulings and judges by these\nDeep state judges said you can't hold them you can't see paying them you have to release come and give them a date to appear and they never appeared they disappeared they just disappear into the woodwork they get hired by corrupt big business bosses want cheap labor\nThey get sheltered by corrupt sentimental is\nWho think all the let's invite the entire world to live in America that's going to do everybody a great big saver and it just becomes a big mess so the way to stop it it's an outlet them into the United states in the first place to stop them at the border build the wall\nTo wall literally and figuratively President Trump is sending up to a thousand troops deploying the military on the border uh that's what the military is supposed to do defend our country and\nIf we're going to defend the country in Afghanistan of the time of the country in Iraq and defend the country in Djibouti where we have troops how about we defend the country in Tijuana in Mexico the Mexican border and in Texas\nThat's right in San Diego and everything else we need to build his wall and the president determined he says I'm going to stop this because I think the president Curtis understands I'm almost out of time here but I think he understands that it's Fifteen thousand today if they get and smart it's got to be a hundred\nAnd fifty thousand and then one point five million because it is one thing that you said to me a while back\nThat really are was riveting\nAnd then I got to take off you said that you said there was four billion people in the world that all want to come to the United states so you might as well let them all in that you don't have a country\nYou have a

you've got to get out there and vote either party or be like okay so the ah Christopher Newport university releasing a new poll on the seventh district as it is the final we are\nAnd they're likely voter model\nDemocrat Abigail Spanberger and Republican incumbent David ... or in a statistical dead forty five ... forty six spanberger now let me tell you why this is great news for the campaign every scene in your poll ever done every single one sabers a democratic\nState over sampled Democrats because he was part of the fake news network that tries to do the polls in order to get a result and they just only goes so far is that is good news for\nMe was singing you how'd you tie your good good shape a\nThere was a ... they have a sixteen point enthusiast and soon as he hasn't kept for a\nSpanberger Seventy eight percent of Democrats are very enthusiastic about voting versus sixty two percent of Republicans well that's because they have to deal with Corey Stewart on the top of the ballots which is hurting\n\nBecause nobody is excited about Cory stores\nNo one boy let's go off on Corey stores oh let's\nSee if they're cutting the federal why that I can take them why they voted for the\nUnbelievable\nWhile forty seven percent of voters in the seventh district of rules of the job the President Trump is doing fifty one percent disapprove that's not that big of a cap it really really isn't in the Senate contest a\nHeinous up by five that's that thing that kept me either but certainly hurting right\nNow here's the good news for brought in this race he's got yours to pizza goodness number what is not a ... point lead among independents point lead that's not going away that's the only got to get back so\nTheir siblings you have an eight point lead among independents\nAnd you get out the Republican base in the seventh district you win that's why a\nSpan burgers you got to be concerned about this whole but then when you look across the abs I think this is great news reject that would've been better off like that\nClinton said he'll be joining us in about twenty minutes aren't always due to the Democrats do matter what they say they over sample Democrats and you always get Republicans always outperform their poll regardless of where to all this because there was regret\nBut the race has got to be very very close and we've been saying that it's a one or two point raised from the gang here's the other hand there's\nA there's a libertarian in the race Joseph ... who has four percent if you're voting for walks and what the\nHell are you doing eight votes for Walton in this race is a vote for Abigail Spanberger period that if you want to vote for spanberger member if you want to vote for days with ...\nVotes for days is right for a vote for a walk the libertarian at four percent you might as well in the district to the Democrats is that\nIf that's what you want to do and that's what your four percent go for walks I guess you got to get you know sort of threat libertarian boats into grad school districts collapse on election day because at the end of the day\nYou're going in there and you're saying why waste my vote now your standard\nIs a little bit different Matt waters is the libertarian candidate\nThere are simply people when they cannot vote for Cory stores they just can't do it there are Republicans that tend to not vote for Cory sort of course they just don't like the guy so walking is going to get a big role but that's a little bit different you get down to the district\nLevel and\nJoe ... who can't win and so forth present

fault it's rotten spoiled\nThat we we have crazy people it's crazy people\nAnd the only thing that I heard that I saw it made sense about what to do about this is the president said probably she should've been armed guards there or so is that there if somebody was carrying\nThey got to stop this I mean that's that's kind of stopped crazy people started was nuts and he posted all kinds of hate on social media I mean these\nPeople are just I I\nI I I don't know what happens to them but it's a sad state in the United states more than six like we can't go sixty days without with\nOne of these it's really sick\nWe're in a very sick time in our society no question about it John prevents radio network truck the truth across America live in the swamp\n[noise]\n\n\n\n\n[noise] [noise]\nOf the Judy ... center on politics reports university now doing a very extensive polling they hold a ten seconds and now with the seven at the end Dr King's great to have you on that\n\nAre you there I'm Eric\n... or me yes well I don't mean okay we got ya I'm Dr ... okay so you just hold out it's pretty pretty interesting\nYeah I mean we have a ... as you know we when we've been pulling his congressional races around Virginia we've been putting out two models a likely voter law when they're committed voter model and the difference between those two miles as how enthusiastic some are respondents are\nAnd how uh how much they say they're likely to go to vote and so the the likely voter model is people who have a history of voting but they um but they may be very enthusiastic\nAbout it and they may not be not very enthusiastic and then they committed voter model is that same history of voting for people who say they're very committed in their very likely to vote in a likely\nVoter model we habits um in both models we have a statistical tie in this race in a likely voter model we have spanberger at forty six brat at forty five and importantly the libertarian Joseph ... taking four percent of the vote in a committed voter models we have\nA brat at forty five spanberger forty eight and ... you know libertarian taking three percent and so this may be a race where um the third party libertarian candidate actually plays a role as it ends up being you know within\nA point or two at a uh an election night\nFour percent vote for Joe Walsh stunned me as I looked at your whole uh when it first came out of poverty haven't seen it over for us to have stopped them only had half\nHour here and I've been on the air but uh\nWhen you get a libertarian that has no money that nobody's heard of getting four percent in a district that is so hot like this was just so hotly contested knowing that all the majority of those voters are coming from James or not they're not going to vote for Abigail\nUm ... why is why is Joel add four percent\nThere could be there could be a number of reasons um and the most likely reason could be that this was a place where disgruntled Republicans are parking their votes because they're for whatever reason frustrated and Dave Brat um if\nNot be happy with with a brat necessarily but um you know at the end of the game they committed voter model he drops and drops down to three percent on on election night\nUm if it's a close race in Walton is but the site or it will be one of the rare congressional races in Virginia where a third party candidate who is able to swing an election essentially um and so it'll be interesting to see an election night how well long does um if he does as well as four percent\nAnd he's clearly going to have an impact in this race if he doesn't have less of an impact\nWhat normally happens was libertarians and drink rational races is that their votes collapses on election day because people that's going to vote for him because they're mad about something when they actually going to vote there like I don't want\nTo waste my both because it's a low profile race it's another thing when you get to Matt waters and the U.S Senate it's higher profile and there is no question there are people\nOn the Republican side they're not going to vote for Corey Stewart on November ... regardless of the situation was they just can't stand the guy that's just reality thanks so I guess that\nWhat Russia race like that um it's it jumps out to me I Would be jumps out this really if a walk for for ...\nYeah well look I think a lot of conventional norms are being turned on their heads right now during this um during the Trump era I mean one of the conventional norms are would be the incumbent should\nBe about fifty percent right now and if they're not about fifty percent they're in trouble um you know we have for addicts at forty five percent I mean that was by conventional norms I Would say that he's in deep trouble but I'm not convinced that at the end of the day he couldn't pull out a really\nNarrow wins um or you could lose by a really narrow margin down in a district where clearly it's you know there's a lot of energy but there's a lot of there's a lot of disgruntlement also\nWell it's kind of it's what is it comes down to a\nDoctor in when you look at these cross tabs what does this race comes out of your spirits up on the planet if you're the spanberger campaigns and you're looking at your polling right now things are only journals we we all get that but then\nThere's your independence hall and they're looking at it now as we speak what message as a spanberger campaign take from the false you point out\nSo the reason the races where it is\nThere a couple of factors for why the races where it is Democrats have a sixteen points enthusiasm advantage over Republicans in this whole there's massive\nEnthusiasm advantage that is overcoming what is structurally I'm a Republican district um you know at a glass of wine and as you noted\nDonald Trump the Hillary Clinton by six points in twenty sixteen you know it's it's this is a Republican district split up plus sixteen enthusiasm advantage is able to bring it to a statistical straw um there's a massive gender gap advantage on the females\nAnd I'm male advantage spanberger has a plus fourteen female advantage that the twenty nine\nPoint spread on gender um and then there's an age difference a spanberger has a plus nine advantage for voters on forty four and under\nDave Brat as a plot six advantage for older voters and so that's I think that this side I think what's making it so close is at democratic enthusiasm advantage that is being driven that is driving that females that the gender gap in span burgers a favor and the female side\nYou're on the jocks records radio network rely today from your nation's capital to swap eight days before the midterms I got a lot of the truth in America we're chatting with Dr Quinn says she is the director of the uh\nOf the Christopher Newport university Washington Center for public policy he has a new poll out today on the seven in the San Francisco Virginia what other surprising factors or\nTo ask you about is a course Georgia this district only five bigger than that because this is about what Nineteen somewhere in there\nSomewhere between Fifteen and twenty depending upon the given pole and the given day but again I'm Tim Kaine's that is a sort of surprising to me I mean we we put out a poll last week and the second congressional district which shows Scott\nTaylor up in that race and Tim Kaine was leading by five almost six in that district um and in this district indicators leading by five these are two\nDistricts by the way that are that are tough for Democrats the second to the seven to seven is really difficult for Democrats um and so it isn't surprising to me um looks when it came on a random two thousand twelve\nHe lost his district by eleven point um and and and winning you know so this isn't in historically\nDemocratic district so for him to be leading at\nA Republican congressional district by plus five is probably right given that there are other districts in the state where he's leading by bigger and origins and that sort of driving his statewide totals\nYou're on the job and

creators network that Scott Ross and noted national older and you can read headlines Scott Rasmussen dot com Scott let's get you don't want to get to New Jersey a\nCorrupt Political Report just change that trauma like jam which Menendez to toss stopped unless vilified journal I've had people telling me for months that followed them was going to make this a rice I'm from New Jersey so I don't believe any of us all lies as far as I'm concerned but now\nGot you got this thing as a as\nA the cook report saying it's a toss up is this real\nWell you know I I think what the quick report is doing is they have a very broad definition of constantly also consider the Ted Cruz state of war or raise the cost of a\nClearly a Ted Cruz is heavily\nFavored to win that I think look I live in New York City\nEvery time the only thing we watch on our local TV is the local news and every single commercial break tense at least one and a campaign commercials on that Senate race or the Democrats are just court six million dollars more into the race in the last couple of weeks they are concerned\nBut then they had a terrible favorability ratings are but it's still New Jersey I think it would be a maybe not completely shocking outcome but it would certainly be a very big surprise\nIs Menendez loses that race\nI don't think is going to lose I think that's just like those of us from New Jersey area like forget it the thing is it's it's like people like I mean\nI think that's part of the reality of it is if this was a strong Republican years something must be different and I suspect that race will be closer than most other contest in New Jersey but at the end of the day I think the Mendez goes back\nOkay so you mentioned something interesting Scott you said that seven uh\nIt it in your most recent polling that the generic ballot difference between Republicans and Democrats had narrowed to seven of them and you said seven is enough to give in this environment the Democrats control the house\nUh obviously the math is easy to go is harder than seven they have a better chance of what\nIs that what I mean I can do something\nRepublicans didn't actually hanging on\nBy one or two or maybe three to five is up for what is\nIt it's a crime to be comfortable with the Republicans could you know and again this is what he's talking about a national pointless doesn't translate directly race to race but I I think most people I certainly would say if the Republicans holes or four points that are favored to take the house it's five points are six points then you're trying to even toss up territory and then\nAs you move up to seven points to hire a the the the crabs or are clearly favorites and lost I should point out you know we're talking\nAbout it being close right now with all of these races by Republican turnout is at the higher they have a chance to hang on to the house\nBut the other side of it is if the Democratic turnout is higher than project in the Republican stay at home the Democrats forget twenty three seats there you have a chance to get something like forty seats or forty five seats on\nA very good turnout nights so this hung out with this idea of how close races are is something very important to the south Cal\nRight because uh when you said what I'm going\nHat on here is twelve or God right we all know that you're so that that just look look let's just do the mess over God so that means I eat a little things\nThat they need a lemon more to win control right and they were just over thirty races that are too close to call right now and go they're highly competitive and if the Democrats when liberals for the one they take control some clearly they\nHave the edge and I should also point out says if the Democrats don't win control is they'll still pick up significant gains obese thirty one competitive racer is twenty nine of them are held by Republicans\nRight so they they have ... and ... and if they run the run the table right that that's where they get that's where they get the forty forty five seems a little ways to pick up right and a\nWet so if you do the math for those listening to us right now how tough it is for Republicans hold the house\nIs uh they can only lose eleven of the thirty seats that are right that are tied right now\nActually test they can only lose ten of the thirties after one of the thirty um three of them right here in Virginia one is tied one of the Republican is slightly ahead of the second district Scottsdale or a day brat Abigail Spanberger tried and then watch than it had\nCop stock in northern Virginia so in a blue wave days every the damage to pick up all those as a Republican several good evening or they can and when she was a three year old three let's get the final word in from\nElaine Elaine ah it's all of hoarding it Scott it's all about Republicans turning out right that's that's really nice days it's all about them turning out and what what's your message\nWe we we have a couple of races in Virginia specifically where the libertarian\nIs taking votes away from the Republican that gets wing it what was your message to those voters\n[noise] [noise] [noise]

information America First policies dot org this message pay for an authorized by American first policies incorporated joining us now um to talk about\nOf topics we're going to start with the horrific anti Semitic hate crime as a synagogue and Pittsburgh just one of the most disgusting things I've ever I don't know what this country is\nComing to put these crazy people just go into what people are playing\nAnd they just get massacred on a Saturday morning unbelievable joining us now for that and many other things was from New York you could follow Liz that was being she's also a contributor to the hill lizard great to have him\nMorning thanks for having me on\nWas eight days to the midterms um a lot at stake here all of us were just shocked and dismayed and sadness sickened by another massacre in another place of worship Liz ... what is going\nOn in the United states I don't know I think that that really has been a hardening of attitude [noise] um I think there is anger everywhere and I think you know look I don't think it's a newly Donald Trump or anything\nBoils off against what people refer to as the ruling elites or however you want to describe it um and I do think that's true to some degree I think that there's a real feeling amongst a lot of people in this country that they have been ignored brushed aside a as\nPeople who are running the business sense and big institutions have benefited from\nGlobalization and a and I'm really not stop to think about what that meant for some other people in the country\nBut you know it it is alarming because we're about as you point out uh ought to have another election and I'm afraid that you know there's a good chance that the Democrats are going to retake the house of representatives and\nThe progress that has been made under President Trump and writing some of the wrongs that have prevailed a you know it's going to be rolled back I mean I I really think that there's an incredibly\nDangerous situation and by the way for anyone who thinks that the Democrats might\nBe modified by taking back the house that the firestorm of political activism and hate speech and everything like calmed down forget it because we're going to have an see close his speaker one of the most dishonest politicians out\nThere and one of the most ruthless competitors are you know we have people like Maxine Waters going to be taking over the house financial\nServices Committee and Adam Schiff taking over the intelligence committee I'm not making these things are those\nAre the ranking members and from all of a appearances those are the people who are going to be running these committees and what we're in for John is two years at least of endless investigation subpoenas into every aspect\nOf Donald Trump's life and finances and business organization it's going to be an incredible mess but I think honestly I think people are just going to get angrier and angrier as that goes on\nTo situations it is to just things of a shift and the Democrats\nOn the heels of the ... of this horrific crime\nMean I I just never saw myself with whatever because it's for example believe we're so hobbies is which I think it out the next day and they go on TV and they blame the president I mean where does it matter what these people\nI I saw more blamed throwing after\nAll the bombs that were sent to Democrats favorites um light light

be a full investigation before we can vote on him before we can decide\nWhether he should uh be you know the sense of a Supreme Court right\nThe same the same we must have an FBI investigation before we can let that happen\nThey're not even waiting for the FBI to investigate where the bombs are coming from before they start blaming President Trump's they declared President Trump guilty responsible\nFor the whole thing they're not waiting for the FBI to investigate these are the same people just three weeks ago said we cannot do anything until the FBI finishes its investigation so I mean they were total hypocrites it it is absolutely\nThe responsible or beyond counterproductive it's it's absolutely irresponsible for them to be saying\nThis is all about because the President Trump\nOr they're they're trying they're trying to score political points at which you have to ask who benefits\nFrom these bombs that's all I'm not saying who did it it it's obviously some crazy person because no sane person sends bombs or fake bombs through the mail we don't know if the bombs are real fake or\nThey emptied out some firecrackers put it in a in a in the toilet paper two and a a attacks the digital watch to it to make it look like a scary thing we do know Tyler wean time it's easier to scare people what can I tell you\nWe don't know and I'm not going to go down that road what I can say is whoever did it is crazy in one way or another whether gr certify a bleed can be committed to an institution crazy or just that they've got a screw loose\nYou don't do that kind of normal people well adjusted people don't do that okay by definition\nHappy Canada has a column today Barry makes the point that when John Kennedy was assassinated Lee Harvey Oswald who defected to the Soviet Union was pro Cuba\nOr he was found to be the shooter or yet who got blamed for the John birth society and all the conservative so this is not the first time that the guilt by association or let's let's let's slammed the can\nBefore we even know who actually sent these packages so it's a everybody's got to calm down take a breath and ah I think Sarah Sanders had it right we should be coming together the president is calling for unity dialing down the rhetoric\nOf and the Democrats are going in the opposite direction they're they're they're blaming the president unequivocally no question about it taking no responsibility whatsoever\nFor calling the guy look at the sky Brennan the president's guilty of trees that what's the what's the penalty for treason that\nHe's basically a former head of the CIA had been out they're calling for the president to be hung by the neck until dead and this is not considered inflammatory rhetoric I it's it it's disgusting the whole thing is just just\nHypocritical these people will go down to the as the all time greatest hypocrites\nJust ask you something a tortoise I think you make a great analogy the depletion of the Democrats who cried and screamed and whine about Chavez on getting the FBI not investigating everything I mean why don't we just wait here I mean the FBI seems to be holding again in\nSouthern Florida that come up with a report for duty so we're we're going to find out the answer and why not just wait\nExactly how about everybody say calm down let's we got we we have the FBI on the case unless this guy was a or gal or or or bought\nOr whatever you know whatever it was they created these packages\nAnd less that energy was a very very very sophisticated person a table and buy it and if they were very sophisticated they were able to cover their tracks\nBut considering the number of packages delivered to these various places coming out of one place\nThere are a lot of clues there and I'm confident that the FBI will be able to figure something out here and find out who did it for narrow it down and the fact that they use Debbie Wasserman Schultz as a return address\nThat's kind of interesting in itself Debbie Wasserman Schultz is the one who was forced to step down from head of the\nDemocratic National committee a because she had been reading the system for Hillary against Bernie I don't know what that means but it sort of an interesting clue you know maybe somebody that was funny to use her name on all these bombs I don't\nKnow uh but my point is that\nUnless and this was a very sophisticated operation that they knew a how to cover their tracks at every step of the way\nYou've got twelve packages now that the FBI is investigating it let's wait for the FBI to figure this out to come up with something yeah why not wait before you start a in why not\nWhy are they not waiting because they want to politicize it\nFor political points on this well it's uh it seems that it it just seems odd to me that\nThat all this is happening but luckily I mean that's what everybody saying let's wait time let's get to let's get the the economy will get to the Taliban invasion after the bottom of the hour or so let's get to the new economic numbers that just came\nOut the gross domestic product GDP growing another three and a half percent now let me just say what this means right this is the first time that we have had\nBack to back quarters or in a very long time of of of over three and a half percent growth back to back and consumer confidence uh I'll put it all the time I can see we're spending was four percent another great a\nQuarter of economic growth this is more bad news for the dance they don't want to talk about this as they don't want to talk about this economy or jobs or the growth so what do they talk about\nAre they talking well they talk about they've got this wonderful thing to talk about this horrible thing to talk about here with the with the bombs and they talk about\nThe president teach again they're following in they don't realize they're falling into a trap and and it's their own trap a trap of their own making\nPeople don't want to hear the Democrats talk about the president they want to hear Democrats Republicans the politicians in Washington talk about what they're what the politicians are going to do for them to\nMake their life better write what I I I go to work every day I got a family to support I got a job I'd like to get a raise what are you going to do to make that happen how are you gonna make my life better easier make me rich uh make make make my kids you know healthier\nTalking about President Trump talking about you're\nA Native American DNA doesn't do that [laughter]\nTo do that about President Trump are causing the bomb scare\nDoesn't do that so and they are going back to the for the last two years old I've been talking about is President Trump is a Russian agent and now they're President Trump as a Russian agent who Craig creates bomb scares I mean they're they're they're not doing themselves any favors\nAre they on the other side I mean it's very very clear jobs not mom's President Trump\nAnd the Trump Administration have created the best economic conditions in this country in in the generation the best we've seen in its ten Twenty years and that\nGoes along the way that that\nDancers people's questions or what have you done for me lately you've gotten me a job you've gotten me a raise you've gotten my kids all food stamp gotten my kids out of the basement you're on their own now great thank you very much\nLet me ask you something [noise] uh I'm going to pose this question and then you're going to answer it when it gets back so stay with us\n\n[noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise]\n[noise] [noise]\n[noise] [noise]\nPeople coming out of the woodwork coming out of the hills coming out of a bally's\nComing out of the towns coming out of harm's coming to vote for Trump that have never voted before and uh so yeah it is there is a feeling that things are moving here all of these national generic valid polls are meaningless national election\nOther girls like this whole thing falls over talking all day about the Washington Post poll that came out yesterday that shows Jennifer ... and they had to Barbara Comstock\nTend to just sort of seen locking watched in my way and she should she used to play written no doubt that's a very tough right now for Republicans barbers every internal poll that the Republicans have\nFrom the White House to the end our ceasing to Barbara down shows the race question does not have a Thirteen points but this is what the Washington Post dogs they get a uh\nThey get a ridiculous methodology to get to the polls get a fake analysis of it fake news to get a bank inclusion drawn so they can take narrative and like we've already been down this path so now I'm going to start hauling them on how ridiculous it isn't there now it's the same\nWay round the John triggers radio network I stand your Godzilla of the truth in America were eleven days out to the biggest ... election ever Curtis\nEllis is with us She's a senior policy

that the voters they're Seventy five voters day or a hundred\nThere distinct pockets of voters that are on our side\nIn identifying them and getting them out to the polls that's what this was going to come down to that's what it's coming down to\nThe Republican National committee and others are doing a great job of that\nAnd uh that's what's going to determine this as much as old as probably more than all the ads and everything else so I encourage everyone to go out and vote and bring your friends and if they're going to vote for the other side's don't bring them okay\nPretty much out of their tires I don't know you don't do that we don't do that and the\nMain character look if you're if you have a democratic neighbor and they're going to vote the all the way down to the polls they don't have a rise to the falls to the right thing around\nHere so nice just to get them or ... you know what we want every vote six out everybody that as an opportunity to go get him out and get a cup of coffee because at the end of this you're still your neighbor\nThat's right there's you lose your neighbors are still Americans were in this together folks like we're in this together\nAnd you know

once they're enmeshed in the silent seeking procedure\nAll of the interlocking court cases and ruins and judges by these\nDeep state judges say you can't hold them you can't see paying them you have to release them and give them a date to appear and they never appear they disappear they just disappear into the woodwork they get hired by corrupt big business bosses that want cheap labor\nThey get sheltered by a corrupt sentimental is who think oh the let's invite the entire world to live in America that's going to do everybody a great big favor and it just becomes a big mess so the way to stop\nIt as an outlet them into the United states in the first place to stop them at the border build the wall to wall literally and figuratively president\nTrump the sending up to a thousand troops deploying the military on the border that's what the military is supposed to do defend our country and\nWe're going to defend the country in Afghanistan and defend the country in Iraq and defend the country and ... where we have troops how about we defend the country in Tijuana in Mexico the Mexican\nBorder and in Texas\nThat's right and in San Diego and everything else we need to build his wall and the president's determined he says I'm going to stop this because I think the president understands I'm almost out of time here but I think he understood understands that it's Fifteen thousand\nToday and tomorrow it's got to be a hundred and fifty thousand and then what twenty five million because it is one thing that you said to me a while back that uh was riveting\nAnd then I got
