[noise]\nYes and I changed my position based on the clown show the Democrats put on\nYesterday that was so appalling as so pathetic it's so disgusting and so gross and turned off so many people and their their black soul for what it is that changed everything so I really care what Jeff Flake does I don't care what books he's got a writer\nWhat is the future if I could care less I don't care so if you vote snow then\nOr he's not recommended by the Judiciary Committee two days ago I thought that was a big deal after yesterday's Barnum Bailey\nClown act\nIt doesn't matter what you have to like that because anyway McConnell is going forward bringing a vote to the floor\nOr by starting the procedural maneuvers on Saturday we're going to have a vote on Tuesday\nSo you would assume it's linked folks know today which I don't know who cares you know actually I don't care what he does\nBut said now it's eleven tend not recommended fine he'll vote no again\nOn Tuesday now the Democrats to stop Kavanaugh need another vote because that is fifty fifty Susan Collins is not going to vote no I'm convinced that beyond doubt that I talked to her now do you have any inside information now what am I going on with your political\nUm instinct and I'm seldom wrong on this stuff calling will not vote no college it's going to vote for capital I'm convinced of it as those comments as goes Murkowski\nNow even if Murkowski broke and votes now now you're Joe mansion oh you're really in a box rights\nBecause you're damned if you do and you're damned if you don't you got to a five point lead in a state that Trump won by forty points and you know the\nUh the act\nThat went on a Thursday you know the Trump voters in West Virginia are going to turn out in record numbers they are going to the polls\nAnd if you vote no wire tapping on your toast so now you're Joe mansion you're now with a box twenty four hours go all the Republicans want to block the Democrats have you here was so pitiful so desperate so disgusting the whole thing slips\nNot ... that they displayed a TV to the world yesterday and disturbing it was at that I mean he he he was the\nClown up the clown show so I don't care what Jeff Flake does I Hope it does the right thing and most for Kavanaugh but\nEven if he does not cause it's going to vote yes and matching if he wants to get reelected it's going to have to vote yes and that leaves Murkowski from Alaska\nAnd I don't know how she tells her constituents in Alaska I voted no\nBased on no evidence based on well no what I mean not even a ... like doesn't know what the house was doesn't know what time it was that what that was how she got there doesn't know how she got home just a real was there over witnesses to corroborate anything\nCan happen in ... he was there in fact the ovary cured it\nSo I'm voting no based on what nothing ... based on\nWell she looks credible well what about the airplane maybe all of a sudden get over flying and then that it it it didn't even though she's got you know she's a million miles or you know delta whatever I don't know how ... ... votes now I really don't\nBut even if she does you're going to get mansion so that's why I'm a hunter can I'm Ninety nine percent to ... he's got to be confirmed\nOkay so that the breakdown like we can only get from you and that's why everybody keeps coming back a lot of people that I watched it with\nUm you know [noise]\nTo admit it that was quite the testimony by having even Dr Ford with good um [noise] I tell these people that are in a lot of hope because when we get to vote on a potentially [noise]\nJohn primary [noise] Ninety nine percent convinced\nThat our God what a guy and what are what ... what is it playing he put on there will be confirmed and Ninety nine percent [noise]\nYes I mean and look there's gonna be another thing that's going to come out this weekend right\nAvid out somebody just you know just being prepared for and it's going to come out till five three other women in second grade or fifth grade or eighth grade or some bar or a baseball game or\nThey'll find somebody [noise] they'll dredge another three people because now they're really desperate I mean now it's now it's beyond camera see if the Democrats now now you're now has scripture your are Christians here today because you have screwed this thing up so bad and there's no way out the only way out is to defeat the guy\nAnd then it can all go away but if he's confirmed thinks fired up the truck things like say just lit up match by gasoline and slow\nAnd it was like the gasoline with just a dare\nPull over the speaker they sold the gas and they said hey who is kind of a wider\nLet's blow it up [laughter] it's incredible what they did to themselves and is it that this is going to go down in history remember the old as a kid growing up to the ads for uh the wide wide world of us ports on Sunday night on ABC ... I think it was after definitely has a wide world of sports and they\nWould have somebody's skiing and there were any snatch defeat from the TV snatched victory from the jaws of defeat well the Democrats are doing the exact opposite and so you can bet your bottom dollar Joe that tomorrow or\nAfter the vote today and on Saturday just to talk for the Sunday talk shows there'll be three more women to come out\nIt guarantee none of them will be cut off all worried about it but but\nBut but the thing is that they even [noise] they were going to be any way they have an [noise] that's\nRight um and that's what's going to ruin them in their opinion they needed to pull out just like in their face because they look now than ever but if they [noise] whether they would have been well other than the term so I agree with you on that um\nIf they did nothing if they just play by the rules Kavanaugh gets confirmed and they wouldn't have been terms now they've tripled down on a very bad head this was a lousy than they had\nAnd they tripled down on it because it responsive to their face and they think if Kavanaugh it gets in the world will ... will come to an end so they tripled down on a lousy they put all their chips on the table\nKavanaugh call their bluff he's got a full house\nAnd they've got shot by they get killed he takes all their money\nAnd now they're going to lose the midterms as a result of it that's a stupid this lots and it seems to be on that because it was for all of the world just said I remember a long time ago there was a long time ago I was a very junior executive\nAnd that was at a meeting with senior executives and one of my other junior executives had said something\nThat really indicated he didn't know is numbers and I remember my boss who was a senior vice president I was a junior executive\nSaying to me she we just did he just hammered himself because he said something you didn't know what the numbers so if you don't know the answer or the numbers were you don't know something shut up because then they don't know you don't know\nWhat if you if you apply\nAnd now it's for all the world to see it hurts your career so if you don't have the answer don't answer them question John traffic's radio network ... truck the truth will be right back Senate voting nine thirty thanks ...

Ninety nine point nine percent now the Democrats are going to have to find\nOther they're going to have to hold everybody in their camp including mansion Donnelly highly hide camp all at risk of the loop of losing they have to hold them\nWhich is fifty fifty and then they have to flip both Collins and Murkowski and that just is not going to happen because college is not going to vote now now\nThe

they're not a subpoena him and the Democrats don't have the votes\nThat's why that's why they killed himself because look they don't have the votes because the American people don't trust what they're seeing right now and this insurance they're never\nTo have the votes I mean if they just played the strain\nThey wouldn't have won average Americans looking at this again right now are saying well

just splitting the sort of come out of this you have to look here's one thing I learned about Brett Kavanaugh and I'm not a judicial scholar like the people on the federalist society\nBut here's one thing I learned about Trump nominated a fighter trumps the fighter\nTrump supporters are fighters Trump nominated a fire fighter fought back that'll vote was uplifting to me he sat there and he fought back now he got\nEmotional and you have to fight back tears and especially when he talked about his father who was sitting there\nThat he wanted to emulate and its upbringing and his parents and his wife ... it was emotional for him this guy's been through hell his family has been [noise] just dragged through the mud\nIt's unconscionable [noise]\nWhat has happened sorry for the call [noise] unconscionable what is happening and yet he stood up to it and they grilled them those Democrats\nAnd then I'll my goodness Dick Durban [noise] I mean it was that an embarrassment they want an FBI investigation bank\nThree months and did nothing the whole thing is a sham\nAnd Lindsey Graham is right investigate why there is nothing to investigate all they want to do installed and\nNailed it he said you want an investigation so you could stole another thirty days or Fifteen days and then those Fifteen thank you weren't going to try out\nAnother one woman a day with some false allegation because the last two or joke so\nHere's the outcome of that we have three of them number one I Believe unequivocally\nKavanaugh was going to get to confirm [noise] [noise] so I don't think as a Republican now you could vote against him\nBased on yesterday\nYou could not get any search warrant\nFor this crime\nAlleged assault because you don't know one house it was in whose house it was in where the house was what the date was what the time was how you got to the house\nHow you got home we couldn't drive [noise] how you got to the house I got home from the house who you were there with who else was there you can't provide a single you can't fill in what box so therefore there's zero evidence and zero cooperation and\nNot only is there no cooperation the people who were identified two corroborated refuted so not only do you have no evidence\n[noise] you have people targeted as witnesses buddy alleged victim who all refuted the allegations so you\nSo therefore I don't know as a Republican except Jeff Place I don't know how you go to Republican constituents or just go to Wendy constituents are just going to your family\nAnd say I voted against Kavanaugh because a lot because [noise] um [noise]\nBecause of what I feel sorry for Dr Ford Kevin a confirmation has nothing to do now is Dr Ford something happened to Dr ... for no question I don't know why it's bad\nAnd she seems like a really nice person\nAnd I I really wish her well something happened to her it was not him I don't even think the guy was there [noise] so does she believe it does she not believe it looked I don't know but I Want to move beyond that she's a very nice lady and I wish her well\nOutcome of yesterday number one confirmation\n[noise]\nOutcome of yesterday number two [noise]\n\nTremendous gangs meant by the American people this thing was watched and paid attention to buy a lot of people yesterday [noise]\n\nOutcome number two is the legacy media yesterday took a huge hit again [noise] and what Trump talks about fake news now people get it the second outcome of this is that what ever little credibility\nThe legacy media had it just went the toilet because their coverage of this was absolutely horrific and the principal at a lot at stake [noise] all the way through from wanting fake stories\nTo know corroboration\nTo nothing they wanted this man to go down\nAgenda [noise] that's all it matter if they had an agenda ruined the guy's life ruined his reputation they didn't care get the facts they didn't care\nThat sort of August raided his job that could happen to anybody not that anybody's going to get nominated for Supreme Court but basically if they don't like you they will destroy you this is the federal government does the media [noise]\nOutcome number three and here's the big one [noise] this clown show yesterday that the Democrats put on backfired to such a degree if Kavanaugh gets confirmed\nThe Republicans are going to hold a house and the good again five or six states\nIn the U.S Senate they overplay their hand\nThey made asses of themselves one many down the line they turn this into a spectacle and then it's going to blow up in their face\nThe Democrats yesterday snatched certain defeat now from the jaws of victory and\nI said this three months ago all Nancy Pelosi has to do was take everyone hurt and Schumer take everybody to Hawaii every white the Democratic official for Ninety Days on a vacation paid for by George Soros and Tom style\nStay out of the media for Nike they don't even campaign and she's thinker and he's majority leader so they have to do but they can't help themselves\nThe Democrats have political correct It's like a thick they cannot help himself and they imploded yesterday right in front of a middle America who watch this with hardware\nAnd grabbed now that you guys want power so where did you do anything\nIf you're a voter out there do you really want to put these people in power are you kidding me [noise] Republicans are going to hold the house and the gonna gain six seats in the Senate\nRight here suffer through every single day with no jeopardy and no nonsense or on the job triggers radio network

vote will be today the the a vote in the Judiciary Committee will be today at nine thirty that's already been cold and confirmed by\nChairman Chuck Grassley from Iowa so we're going to see what happens today the only swing vote now Jeff Flake so it's either going to go eleven ten for Kavanaugh\nEleven ten against cabinet\nOr ten ten tie in Flint vote for president those are the only outcomes that it could possibly have the other senator\nOn the uh the edge a little bit Bob Corker from Tennessee who's resigning he said he was voting for cabinet or\nAfter the hearing yesterday both Susan Collins and Lisa Murkowski the two Republican senators who are considered to be swing target votes Collins from Maine Murkowski from Alaska a cult that that make a statement yesterday\nI have no doubt in my mind that tall and just going to vote for Kevin I Would be shocked if she didn't causes too she's too smart and I must say that Murkowski is not but you know colleges looking at this thing\nI I Am absolutely and I'm a ... fan so I'm absolutely convinced she is going to vote in favor of cabinet what's really only leaves Murkowski I dunno what leases or Senator McCaskill is going to do I have no earthly idea I needed to you\nBut we'll see but Graham Lindsey Graham is centered Olympic ... Lindsey Graham of South Carolina laid it\nWhen he said if you're a Republican and you vote against Kavanaugh you are basically legitimizing this entire circus for ever\nBecause that means the process

majority of what the legacy media says any more it's a real problem and it's going to continue and the third thing is the Democrats this backfired on them and uh\nIt is this there is nothing that Trump could have done or any\nRepublican could have done or anybody in Trump twenty twenty campaign like me there is nothing any of us could have done to motivate Trump voters to come out and vote on November sex like\nThat\nCloud show did yesterday [noise] this is going to motivate Trump voters they are going to come out of the woodwork to vote for Republicans after being appalled by what they

I'll be right back\nOther jokers on that committee did in order to inspire Republican turnout [noise]\nThe Democrats [noise]\nYesterday snatched certain\nVictory [noise] snatched certain victory [noise] and turned it into defeat because of the gamesmanship they played\nAnd Dianne Feinstein is done\nI have defended her on the air for years [noise]\nAnd this was appalling and it's all political I mean ... years old ... something years old you know what I'm sixty first of all when I'm eighty I Would never even be working forget it you can work with your if you do what you what\nI Hope I have grandchildren go fishing and play golf\nAnd maybe if I'm Still around coach basketball maybe or even\nTake my grandchildren or don't want to do something I Want to spend time with my son I'm certainly that's because my wife I certainly be in the U.S Senate but if I'm that\nThirsty for power and I have nothing else in my wife but to have my staff running around in half\nIt all away you give all your statesmanship away for power because you're getting challenged by the left in your own party in your own state and your petrified of losing and so you go through these shenanigans and destroy this man's family and\nIn order to do what stolen another week so up and down the kids find three other people that there's no facts are ... ... from it put those on CNN I mean is that what\nYour life now is about Dianne Feinstein is this is now you're like I said you've done this to yourself you at Seventy days to do something with it and I get back to what I said a month ago when this first came out\nShe met with Brett Kavanaugh for two hours\nAnd never even brought it up she couldn't rejected the name out and said I Want to know about this what do you know about the sugar you're burning up because it was meant to be a head shop and the Democrats Baird they bared their sole yesterday and their soul is\nThat's what happened that's why yesterday the think term in twenty four hours the Democrats bears themselves in such a manner\nThey have right and you talk about Dr Ford was frightened\nThey have frightened middle America it's like oh my God\nIs this what the Democrats do is is this fair game I'm going to put them in charge of the country that's going so great right now I'm going to give them the power did did you watch that every day that's why this is such a catastrophe for that\nAnd that's why the media has melted down\nThis yet there is nothing\nTrump twenty twenty could have done to get a better result on November sexed then those jokers on the Judiciary Committee I looked at the phone lines\nYou're on the judge records radio network eight eight eight for NATO John any date for you know five six four six eight eight eight forty five six or six or you can text us seven five seven six nine to Seventeen ten let's get to John in Hampton John you're on the air\nDuring this morning John [noise] great by\nWay science eighty five percent of the turtle term until she was the one perspective [noise]\nAs we're hearing she took to me [laughter] geez if we care about what they're saying [noise] aren't you look for\nSomething to look for anything [laughter] is it for someone that's not entirely sure [noise] I really think the church\nAnd so on and so on nothing was nothing was brought up that was a ... anything against the story but I really noticed several things that Dr Ford said that I thought were completely inconsistent\nFor example she has the for people that she would cooperate her story well those poor people weren't car operators they became a rough filters\nSaid it didn't happen or they knew nothing about one didn't even know judge Kavanaugh to me if you're looking for well is is is there anything that looks a little funny I think that looks kind of funny yeah secondly we know that she gave us feel details as possible she says she can't remember where she can't remember when\nWhen one of the advantages of not giving any details John did you give the other side nothing to check and\nShe said it was on June fourteenth and he showed that he's done can show there while he was in Cleveland at a basketball camp case closed the whole thing goes out the window so I think that the fact that she had absolutely no details maybe she really couldn't remember him but it certainly is something that's a problem\nBut John I was very worried and I heard it on TV so many times this isn't important don't worry about that I thought the whole thing about flying\nWas a real a real question mark for many women should could calm to testify

mark Warner's office yesterday the D.C office\nAnd you wouldn't believe the response I got um uh what are you going what first I called Mitch McConnell's office 'cause I was trying to weigh in on you

to see what would happen and the staffer I said you know I\nI Am a cop appalled at how a judge Kaplan off being traded and she said that the Democrat Senator or standing up for women's rights\nI said I don't believe that Mark Warner says if he was in judge Kavanaugh shoes to be thinking along the lines right there and she said it doesn't matter we're going to vote against anybody that Trump puts forward I said well thanks for the representation and I you know\nIn today's times and I heard you talking about more with Mark Warner the other day\nIf I wasn't on a desert island and all the way I could get rescued his vote for Democrats I wouldn't do it\nSo [laughter] I've met with his that's quite a diamond will like now\nHere's the good news here's the good news honesty is the best policy and at least Mark Warner staffer was honest with you and saying that it really doesn't matter\nOne is going to vote no uh most of that is driven by politics you have to appease his base blue Virginia Virginia progress and also he still toying with the idea at some point of running for\nPresident or maybe being a vice presidential pick and in order to do that he's got to burnish his left wing fringe group\nPress credentials that's why I'm a college is now saying things terrible calls that are crazy that he never said before because he's scared to death of the\nOr the joker Texas in the Bernie Sanders and so he has to say crazy things are which are not represent that's why\nGerman Calif has zero chance at the Democratic nomination because they can't bring themselves if you could think of self you'd have a shot because he was pretty damn good governor\nAnd a great job and it could be quite different but he can't get the nomination by being himself so he has to be somebody who's not and when you try to do that in politics you fail so he has zero chance of being the nominee and it's too bad because it's probably better than\nAnybody else out there but that's the way now of the Democratic party\nAnd they have gone so far to the\nTo the to the left it's a whole that they have to react to they're a very left wing base and it's putting them in a pod no question but at least one of his office was on a stick out to vote against whoever puts puts up like why even bother me with the Trump put them up no right\nNext right All right thank you for sharing that for me\nUm [noise] you know then the case of what I've been thinking all along so I thought you find that you know a little tidbit of information where [noise]\nI ... I might not see what it is a friend and that's a good question because I mean I think you're thinking about what John said it costs marks on his office staff person says senator\nWarner is going to vote against anybody that drop nominate let me think about it I think it was a staff person saying that it's not well senator order has evaluated Brett Kavanaugh his credentials met with them and decided that this that or the other thing he's\nGoing to vote now okay well that's ... that's legit instead you get Trump nominated him center one of the voting no doesn't matter if he nominated Jesus Christ\nYou know it was interesting what are the things that Trump said yesterday at the press conference are they forgot\nTo mention he said you know if you set a fight nominated George Washington the Democrats would vote now aren't let's get to Virginia Beach let's get to bill in Virginia Beach hey bill you're on the air\nOn how you doing [noise] never\nAbout the arts network a miracle CNN [noise] you know is there any way because people never heard any candidate coal whatsoever [noise] is there any way to get to their benefactors the people who who\n[noise] well I'm never in favor of going after a company's advertisers regardless of their positions um I've never been exposed to that\nThat's what the left I I don't think that should be looked two wrongs don't make a\nIf companies want to advertise on CNN they are going to advertise and CNN there's those companies should not be targeted because your advertising that's what the far left or it's intimidating its meaning and they go after a lot of different company\nA media outlets and people in that way and I'm just not a favor doing that just because somebody else does something that's Maine and wrong doesn't mean that I after we have to retaliate that way I mean here's the bottom line\nIf you if you don't like CNN don't watch it I mean it's it's so simple and if you don't watch it you're not seeing the ads and so then if you're not you're not trying to ... I'm not\nI'm not watching it but the thing of it is what we're not really fighting this like they fight it we're not fighting like for instance you know the gay movement now through their corporate America and if they don't get to the point where\nIf you don't support the gay lifestyle than we can't send our products to you all we can't do this or you don't support you know whatever the Democratic party stands for but we're all for it that way so therefore we're losing that battle\nAnd they keep their people on the air constantly over and over again saying the same stupid things over with no strings back it up like the crowd and all you know testimonies of things that they put\nOut with nope no facts whatsoever but they keep putting it out there and we never do anything to stop\n[noise] well uh\nI don't think you're going to see conservatives or Trump supporters or Tea Party members or\nOther people that might be associated with the America First movement going to a restaurant where Cory Booker is having dinner with his wife harassing them and then a threatening them and not letting them\nBelieve so that's what they do have a\nI don't think that you're going to do we feel and maybe I don't think something like that now you'll be all upset\nBecause look what America is turning into but they're the ones that are doing it in a little medicine sometimes people's attitude [noise] people get tired of this stuff [noise] you know I've known\nPeople going into restaurants and because\nThey don't support the lifestyle or whatever but in the reporting dance for they won't they won't tell you know take their order or just sort of say well I'm going to care blah blah\nYou know that may be that kind of ironic that the company right out of the store if you are close to get when you because\nThere's always people get older and they will call and then they'll come to me\nActually the American people as a whole see through this you know when you looked at the videos when you looked at those videos\nAnd ... I'm not a Ted Cruz man obviously a you know we battled them in the with Trump and the primaries and so um and when he was in Cleveland we were not nice to him we voted off the stage where voters hype hiding coming down the aisle\nSo no love lost but I think with the American people see that as a Senator Cruz and his wife being harassed at a restaurant\nOn video it's just not it's it's not something that really fits the U.S culture and I think it's backfired all this stuff is going to backfire so look two wrongs don't I Hope so I I Would not encourage anybody\nWho is a Trump supporter to do anything like walk to the left is doing to intimidate people\nBecause that's just kind of come back and fights in the ... do the right thing be respectful things will always work out at the end when you just do\nTrump twenty twenty reelect runner Romney jak will send you you can bring 'em all in to one big meaning there is nothing they could have done to motivate Republicans they just get out and vote in the midterms on November six\nLike those ten Democrats on the Judiciary Committee did yesterday in harpoon ing this man judge Kavanaugh and his family in such a spectacle they just picked up both disgusting spectacle\nWhat they did yesterday or the deer park that drinking games you know what's ... what's devil's triangle what do you live under a rock it's a borders beer game I mean\nWhat if it's like saying well it says you're you played a says here that uh you\nYou played a part cheesy what uh what what do you read into that moving the pieces\nPeople off the board and knocking I also see you played soccer here\nDo you like to get a sorry card and knock the other person off this is that aggressive behavior and as you drink more beer and get more sorry cards do not call the pizzas off and put back into play what this is what this is what they had yesterday\nIt was an embarrassment beyond belief the Democrats embarrass themselves and I'm you know I for Trump but it's not like I mean I'm a Republican\nI don't like the republic\nSpectacle the Democrats put on yesterday [noise]\n[noise] it is the most energizing thing they could have ever done to bring up opposition against them they're going to live this will caught them for for\nAt least two cycles this will the Democrats it will cost them and they're going to look back and how they handled this when they lose [noise] and the Republicans are going to pick six seats up hold on now it's gonna be you're talking about the blue wave forget forget that\nAbd yesterday they did it themselves I talked to so many Democrats last night at a several events that I was on a who are just privately and these are these are high powered\nDemocrats you know not that crazy partisans are just watch Kavanaugh stop because they think it's going to be the end of the world\nI'm going to tell you I talked to five of them yesterday high powered at various events in New York City and of course you know most Democrats are there and they were actually there are a cast of this I mean they were just\nThey were white over it because they know what I was saying to them last night there were like shaking their head yes we're going to we we have\nThere's nothing you may Trump people there's nothing you could have done to help yourself like we just did for you in the past nine hours oh let's\nGo to the phone lines for a no John for you know five six for six months to get to Robert inland actually you've been so patient Robert thank you for waiting so long you're on the air sir\nYes sir [noise] you know I'm Donna we might be missing the point on all there are I truly believe that you're not going to do with a judge Kavanaugh often though there is a is an effort to stop anyone from\nBeing a Korean court justice who would be a grant abortion I truly believe that this is one of the main reason\nThat all this is happening and I think if that was not accusations of their nature\nIt would have been stopped and now they're desperate that that's why the actors are way they did yesterday there are so desperate to keep somebody off the Supreme Court that might overturn roe versus Wade because that's a\nThat's a big moneymaker for them that they get a lot of vote because of that and uh I I just think a deeper than than maybe we thank [noise]\nWell you know one of the questions ah yesterday and I don't I I was watching it for so long I don't remember who asked um or who brought it up or maybe it was in it was in ...\nWell you know this didn't happen to this didn't happen to Judge Gorsuch it didn't happen to him and they said it didn't happen to them because there were no allegations of sexual assault\nAnd I'm thinking to myself it didn't happen to him because Neil Gorsuch was chosen to replace\nJustice Scalia who was a very conservative justice\nSo justice Gorsuch made no difference to the makeup of the\nSupreme Court in how they vote it was one serving of replacing another conservative the difference here with Kavanaugh\nIs Kavanaugh is replacing Justice Kennedy who was the swing vote\nSo that's really what the differences that's exactly what you're saying I think the difference here his cabinet all becomes the swing vote gone conservative their champion Kennedy who they could rely on all the time but some of the time now they don't think they can roller we're like the the\nOr the left on Kavanaugh ever so the court swings right and they go crazy and they think it's the end of the world\nI think your odds of something and thank you Robert thank you for the call thank you so much phone lines open for John ate and ate for five six or six we also want to thank\nRobert inland extra for his patients he was on hold about twenty minutes and I really appreciate that we don't like to uh we try not to uh make uh people on that long so we apologize for that let's get to um show is he\nIn Richmond Josie you're on the air\nWell good morning to you have a few points to make that others may try to add to it if you're on by the way I had\nA similar experience [noise] by the boy next door to attend Georgetown perhaps school you know decades prior and he didn't know how to handle it was a motion he was sixteen I was fourteen and we were just\nComing out of our time where we were like the whole gang that was in the neighborhood we [noise] played horse play with each other we wrestle each other you know I was kind of girl the only girl in this\nCase the boys but now that was it can ruin my life but this boy over combined is a motion so we got from the grammar school was time to face and whatever\nAnd then when I came over to their house um my parents weren't around\nGrabs hole in the ... wouldn't let it go you know what to do it just was so overcome must have been a full moon night [noise]\nAnd I had to call my little brother age twelve I was fourteen [laughter]\nRestaurants around the garage floor to link finally we got him off of me [laughter] I didn't ruin my life forever but this woman is for the woman [noise] but when it hurts\nLittle girl and this was like I'm not rich them and I thought my God what did they do call in central casting while they were waiting for it and then of course to try to wait until\nThe closest possible before so that they would maybe get the vote after the um [noise] November elections in the mid term elections I think that was just so obvious and I really I don't I don't think that this woman is really\nSomething to really believe and that's why I wanted to call in and just make that point I think the other points were also correct to and the fact of\nNot till Feinstein holding no matter the whole thing was [noise] you know [laughter] it's like another little point is Herman Cain was running for president did the same thing to him and it was horrible\nI mean they don't mind the false witness by the way they should read the ten commandments again maybe it might help I think\nIt's sickening it's probably thinking how how long do they have come in this in this highest a jobs and the land here but anyway that was also of course we know about it neither he's made a lot of money [noise] she's\nShe's very well for her book maybe for it's going to make a book too and that's another little point\nI'm sure she'll make a book and I'm sure she'll make a lot of money and that seems to be

prepared for an FBI investigate don't reach conclusions you've reached a conclusion they do investigate questions on the middle of a boat for instance you can't say you're at the beginning I wanted to hear all my\nLife any kind of investigation this thing was in the long arm it is if there is no\nTruth church orange is the FBI investigation will show\nAre you afraid that they might not margarine sugar\nFBI does not reach ... you know you know this is you know that's a funny question because the FBI doesn't reach cook lose ... like just provide the Rio choose why would you recess I kind of investigation\nI welcome I wanted the hearing last week I'm asking about the FBI and the committee figure\nOut how the questions I'll do whatever I turn on the phone multiple times with many cats all talk\nTo judge Kavanaugh will you support an FBI investigation right now\nThe committee wants to\nPersonally do you think that's the best thing for us to do\n\nYou want to answer your luck sir\nI said I wanted a cheering and I said I was welcome anything I'm innocent drinking is one thing and there's much more in what kept a redacted port portion of what I start don't want to repeat All right in the public can't well I can I just ask one more question Dr information about\nOkay drinking is one thing but the concern is about truthfulness and in your written testimony you said sometimes he had too many drinks\nEver a time when you drink so much that you couldn't remember\nThe night before I\nKnow I remember what happened and I think you've probably had beer center and\nYou're saying there's never been a case where you drink so much that you didn't remember what happened the night before are part\nThat you're asking about yeah blackout I don't know have you [noise]\nCould you went to the question catch and just tell you that's not happening is that your answer\nJohn I'm curious if you have\nHave no drinking toppled nor do I okay thank you [noise]\nThe middle of the road moderate Bill Clinton ... ... is that the longer exists\nLet's get to Joe in Virginia Beach Joe at the beach on the air\n[noise] morning gone [noise]\n\nWaco six AM here this morning to get your take on everything [noise] Gallagher on worrying about what [noise] [noise] yes and then I'm hearing this morning [noise] you know what he does [noise]\nIt was him whether it is not that important [noise] if you're going to go to the floor and you think they have an aunt is going to be confirmed\nYes and I changed my position based on the clown show the Democrats put on\nYesterday that was so appalling at so pathetic it's so disgusting and so gross and turned off so many people and their their black soul for what it is\nThat changed everything so I really care what Jeff Flake tennis I don't care what books he's got a writer\nWhat is the future is I could care less I don't care so\nIf you vote snow then or he's not recommended by the Judiciary Committee two days ago I thought that was a big deal after yesterday's Barnum Bailey clown act it doesn't matter what Jeff like that\nBecause anyway McConnell is going forward to bringing a vote to the floor or by starting the procedural maneuvers on Saturday we're going to vote on Tuesday\nSo you would assume if Flynn folks know today\nWhich I don't know who cares you know actually I don't care what he does\nWhat saved up now it's eleven tend not recommended fine to vote no again\nOn Tuesday [noise] now the Democrats to stop Kavanaugh need another vote because it's fifty fifty Susan Collins is not going to vote no I'm convinced that beyond doubt that I talked to her now do you have any inside information now what am I going on with your political\nUm instinct seldom wrong on this stuff comments will not vote no college it's going to vote for capital I'm convinced of it as those comments as goes Murkowski\nNow even if Murkowski broke and votes now now you're Joe mansion out here really in a box right\nBecause you're damned if you do and you're damned if you don't you got a five point lead in a state that Trump won by forty points and you know\nThe uh the fact that went on a Thursday you know the Trump voters in West Virginia are going to turn out in record numbers they are going to the polls and if you vote no Kavanaugh you're toast\nWe're in a box the Democrats have you here was so beautiful so desperate so disgusting\nThe whole thing slip in a day and they did that to themselves with nonsense that they displayed a tease each of the world yesterday and disturbing was at that I mean he ... he was\nHanded clown up to climb show so I don't care what Jeff Flake does heal because the right thing and votes for Kavanaugh\nBut even if he does not cause it's going to vote yes an mansion if he wants to get reelected it's kind of have to vote yes and that leaves Murkowski from Alaska\nAnd I don't know how she tells her constituents in Alaska I voted no\nBased on no evidence based on well you know what I mean not even that it's like doesn't know what the house was doesn't know what time it was the was it was the how she got there doesn't know how she got home just nowhere else was there over witnesses didn't corroborate\nAnything that happened in ... he was there in fact the only cure it\nSo I'm voting no based on what nothing but based on well\nShe looks credible well what about the airplane well maybe we see all of a sudden get over flying and then it ... it it it didn't\nEven though she's got you know she's the million mile or you know shelter whatever I don't know how Murkowski votes now I really don't but even if she does you're going to get match so that's why I'm a hundred ... ... um Ninety nine percent convinced he's got to be confirmed\nOkay that's a breakdown like we could only get from you and that's why everybody keeps coming back to you know a lot of people that watch with\nUm you know\nNot to admit it was quite the money I have an even doctors or with good [noise] um [noise] so we tell these people that come out or in a lot of hope because when we get into a potentially [noise]\nYonkers now in Ninety nine percent convinced\nThat are good and what a guy and what are what what is the way he put on there will be confirmed and Ninety nine percent\nYes I mean and look they're going to be another thing that's going to come out this weekend right a\nAvid out rate [noise] somebody just you know just being prepared for it is going to come out till five three other women in second grade or fifth grade or eighth graders some bar or the baseball game or\nFind somebody they'll dredge another three people off because now they're really desperate I mean now it's now it's the cat to see if the Democrats now now you're now fear had scripts you you are cryptic here today because you have screwed this thing up so bad and there's no way out the only way out to Sturgis\nAnd they fired up the truck face like they just lit up match gasoline and slow\nLike the gasoline with just a dare right all they had to do was walk over it\nWill pull Lucy speaker they show the gas and they said hey\nWho's got wider let's blow it up [laughter] it's incredible what they did to themselves it is it to this is going to go down in history remember\nThe old as a kid growing up to the ads for uh the wide wide world of sports on Sunday night on NBC I think it was after death thing it was a wide world of sports and they\nWould have somebody's skiing and they would be any snatch defeat from the team he snatched victory from the jaws of defeat well the Democrats are doing the exact opposite and so you can bet your bottom dollar Joe that tomorrow or\nAfter the vote today and on Saturday just in time for the Sunday talk shows there'll be three more women to come out\nIt guarantee none of them will be cut off all worried about it but but\nBut but the thing is that they [noise] they were going to lose any weight because I have an arm and that's what they're afraid of it that's going to ruin in their opinion they needed to pull out just like you\nKnow in their face because they look worse now than ever but [laughter]\nIt wasn't going to be anywhere 'cause it would have been the same outcome well other than the term so I agree with you on that I'm\nIf they did nothing if they just played by the rules Kavanaugh gets confirmed and they wouldn't have insurance now they've tripled down on a very bad hand\nThis was a lousy than they had\nAnd they tripled down on it because they're responsive to their base and they think if Kavanaugh gets in the world will work will come to an end so they tripled down on a lousy they put all their ships on the table\nKavanaugh call their bluff he's got a full house\nAnd they've got shot by they get killed he takes all their money\nAnd now they're going to lose the midterms as a result of it that's so stupid just watch and see I think on that because it was for all of the world to think I remember a long time ago there was a long time ago I was a very junior executive\nAnd that was at a meeting with senior executives and one of my other junior executives\nHad said something that really indicated he didn't notice numbers and I remember my boss who's a senior vice president I was a junior executive\nSaying to me she was just he just hammered himself because he said something he didn't know was numbers so if you don't know the answer or the numbers we don't know something shut up because then they don't know you don't know what what if you if you're a black lab\nAnd now it's for all the world to sing it hurts your career so if you don't have the answer don't answer them\nSenate voting nine thirty thanks ... factor [noise]\nA nomination will come out of the Judiciary Committee within eleven to ten recommendation assuming of course all other Democrats vote now which they will show Jeff Flake finally doing the right thing flake voting yes for\nCabinet we don't have a statement from him and uh the hearing is he going on right now that we're going to get ready for\nA vote Chuck Grassley the chairman there are getting a things started in a few moments and we're going to have this vote hopefully we'll have the answer when the time we get off the air meantime phone lines open eight eight eight for eight of John ... a day for you know five six four six eight eight eight for eight oh\nFive six five or six don't forget you can also text us Seventy five seven six Nineteen Seventeen ten I'd love to get your text and it's been a great day\nAnd culminating with good news and the good news is Jeff Flake will vote in favor of Brett Kavanaugh [noise] that's great\nSo that really leaves as I said this was Ninety nine percent now it is Ninety nine point nine percent now the Democrats are going to have to find\nOther they're going to have to hold everybody in their camp including mansion Donnelly highly hide camp all at risk of the loop of losing they have to hold them\nWhich is fifty fifty and then they have to flip both Collins and Murkowski and that just is not going to happen because there's not going to vote now\nNow the Democrats are now stalling trying to or you know ask for another FBI investigation uh they're calling to subpoena mark judge that we're going to go through this again they're all going to try to solve this thing\nAnd a Chuck Grassley wants a vote and so they're they're simply going to vote nobody's going to be subpoenaed it's got to be no investigations you got to be no delays but then a fasten your seatbelts because new allegations will definitely surfaced this week that\nThey will surface up to and they will keep servicing up until the vote on Tuesday\nNone of them will be corroborated doesn't have any evidence Michael I have an audio will be running around on CNN with Don Lemon or whatever\nTo them and the second grade that's all covered because now that the Democrats have nowhere to go with it they have nowhere to go there to box and they're going to let us they're going to lose everything so they have nowhere to go they have to they they doubled down and triple down\nNow they have to put the house right I mean the ... the car they lost that\nThey put their savings they lost that they've got their money in the pocket they lost that they hope their jewelry they lost that they sell the furniture they lost that\nNow the sleeping on the floor of the house and now they're going to put their house up and they're gonna lose that too\nThey're going to be in the minority again on November seventh [noise] here they\nStonewalling again according to subpoena mark judge they don't have the votes to subpoena mark judge\n... marches already made a statement he's not testify he doesn't want to do and they're not going to subpoena him and the Democrats don't have the votes\nThat's why that's why they kill themselves because they don't have the votes because the American people don't trust what they're seeing right now and this insurance they're never going\nThe votes [noise] I mean if they just played the strain they wouldn't have one [noise]\n\nAverage Americans looking at this again right now are saying well where's the vote while the ... the ... the Democrats are just obstruct obstructing\nMaking long speeches calling for ... which is not going to be forthcoming because they don't have the majority and they don't have the power to do that\nSo what would you put these people in charge why why on earth would anybody in middle America put these people in charge of the country\n[noise]\nUnbelievable [noise] All right let's see a Senator Jeff flake will vote yes to confirm Supreme Court nominee judge Kevin up he was considered a Republican swing vote among the Twenty one member panel so now a will also get\nJeff Flake who has been the darling of the liberals the darling they love him they caught him all the time they love him\nNow they'll turn out now they'll turn on them at that now they go after college [noise] cause a tougher that I mean first of all look to talk to ... a lot of wind\nAnd Susan Collins she doesn't take flak from anybody and she's you know she's not running for president and she's not what she says she was in college he just tried to do the right thing and she's you know very main\nShe's very may ask 'em she really cares about me and I don't agree with her and she drives me nuts sometimes like they all do\nBut she's tougher than she talks all yeah she's tough see nobody intimidates her\nShe's not the whole the donors she got all the all the money she needs\n\nCouple of the factors are fine lady um\nThese people and Tom ... columns that doesn't play the political game columns does what she does and she's got a vote to confirm Kavanaugh himself [noise] of course you'll have to deal with the stuff that comes out this weekend\nBut um it's gonna be interesting so the vote soon Senate Judiciary committee to vote on Kavanaugh Supreme Court nomination a chairman Grassley rejecting\nOh Blumenthal senator Blumenthal call first opinion and now they're asking for more FBI investigations\nAnd um basically crap you're going to make them vote [noise] I mean I never thought in my lifetime I Would see actually Senate Republicans stand up to anything [noise]\nI mean Chuck Grassley he's he's fighting John Cornyn all the people that drives me absolutely to drink talk about\nThe beer drinking game I mean you don't get a beer drinking games I've had when Jeff Flake Ben Sasse\nChuck Grassley Mitch McConnell and these guys drive me nuts took by the devil's triangle it's like oh my goodness every time you get on TV I have to have a shot the miners now they're all fighting back\nSee I've been telling you it's the party of Trump it's become the party of Trump without a moment too soon now it's becoming the story all of a Trump this is what\nThis is why I'm so proud of this president not only has reshaped the Republican Party into somebody that actually stands for stuff now like jobs for American workers actually stand for something and not Wall Street donors in lower Manhattan\nCan't say actually stand for something with a novel I think\nKnow the other thing the president has done is they've taken on his personality they want to fight back isn't it better fighting back don't you feel better when you fight back against false accusations don't you just feel better when you don't cave don't you get a Boulder don't you get energized [noise]\n\nI mean when you caved in king the king even cower like the Republicans have done for years with you know sixty votes culture rules and hide behind my friend and fellow everybody out and talk about repealing place in that line to get money and\nYou know how to the big banks and the big donors and sing nonsensical things that stand for nothing and selling you walk on a daily basis include with the liberals in the Denver crust because they're scared\nBecause they don't stand for anything all of a sudden now they're standing for something jobs for Americans\nThey're standing up for China they're standing up to bad trade deals they stood up to Canada remember something about\nOh my God parents are or how can we\nI don't like that that's what he said but I don't like Canada\nI don't like to negotiate there's I don't like to do the asked me for a meeting I said\nI told my negotiating team to cut off all discussions let's let things cool down for a month or so I'm going to go ahead with Mexico\nAnd I don't want to talk to them 'cause I don't like the way they're negotiating I don't like to negotiate is I don't like what the ... when I started getting screwed up telling them you know maybe a couple\nMonths I'll take another look it up but right now I got other priorities until I'm ...\nAnd so they're not part of my deal and uh they're not part of NAFTA and I'm done with that because that state and I'm going to keep protecting American Jobs this is what he said it in front of international and domestic media [noise] nobody even talked about it\nBecause they want to talk about [noise] a doctor for it or something [noise]\nStanding up for American we finally have a president was to find a party that was back us up any conviction making them stand for something his America First agenda which is clear concise it also ties back to Israel people
