be both go through a pot I'm I'm not here not no I'm just ready to go Mike what's going on in New Hampshire these days\nWell I'll tell you what we got we had a couple of presidential candidates running for twenty twenty already here in the last week so things are ramping up\nSo this is only the Democratic side no Republicans you know growing up in a rice\nNo well you know\nThis is talk of course the John Cage sick and or Jeff Flake running against Donald Trump for the Republican nomination\nI actually wrote I'm a bad for uh the statewide paper here in New Hampshire just last week and it's pretty silly to take on Donald Trump I'm a ... you know he is\nA it any time a Republican primary where a sitting president has been challenged it's been on the right same job and these guys are running on the last they really wouldn't have a prayer\nFeeding the presidents and the Republican primary\nRight now right now that's that's right now anything can happen goodness knows anything\nCan happen any thing of course and especially you know that God Forbid the economy collapses\nRight right that's what it's like no one's going to like that but if you drop the big one thing's insurance All right let's let's shift in the Democratic nomination credit primary where I think we're four hundred and Seventy nine days away something like that from the Democratic hamster [laughter] it was kinda like\nRight now that's why I think it's I think it's smart press for you to be talking about this ... and ... because they're the presidential I stopped as you well know there's there's all kinds of things happening behind the scenes right now\nThis is where it happens right the pro pro life pro pros\nAnd cons of the day after November's election candidates start doing things in a more public way but like I said senator or Joe a brand new York which off here yesterday campaigning with the Democrats\nCan't pay a candidate for governor in New Hampshire and show she's laying the groundwork she's ... and you know she's not all across the country and ah so she's starting to support thing\nSure you've heard about it to the guys he he's making around here that he made his second trip to New Hampshire just this past weekend real twice in the last six months Alex Vogel Alec Baldwin and he said he has not ruled out running for credit\nMike we're making news this morning it was my comment and my producer of the show looking at we're making news this morning Steve ball like\nThis one is Alex Alex ... jobs a spoke at the largest fundraiser for the Democratic\nIn New Hampshire I'm a just last week that wow\nSee if he ran his old our Goldman's Jack Ryan you know it's kind of my job yet but [laughter] that was back in the Cold War you know a hundred October [laughter] I tried\nSo who else do you see in up in in New Hampshire and who would you guess to be the front runners you know the New Hampshire primary today likely to win the twenty twenty primary in\nFebruary of next year European Bernie Sanders run for president he will be the front runner okay yes no doubt about it now I'm In New Hampshire no doubt about Fifteen thousand or Dan Elizabeth Warren will likely be the front runner\nOkay so how about what recently happened was senator ward in New Hampshire how does that play with her I mean ... of the DNA ancestry ball this week the disaster you know\nAny democratic circles I actually don't think it does much a liberal Democrats are going to be looking for a liberal Democrats regardless of [laughter]\nYou know they think they they their their choices in and took ... primarily on emotion and uh just the parents from Iowa which is called the dope you heard that it's a very a veteran democratic operative in Iowa was describing\nYou see 'em a so called scene but in reality in the in the Democratic voter in the primary motor but they also want to win and they might go you know I don't think it's interesting when national I think you\nKnow that's not a\nI'm a Republican I think that's why I Would have a similar problem I don't think she's electable in a in a general election national national okay yeah I Would hope for that using on\nCNN issue as an example\nUm I think so I talked to one thing I Will say though it's a I I don't think it affected her here in New Hampshire I Do think it affected that again the behind the scenes operations ah and and you know the ... all the maneuvering going on behind the scenes among potential democratic candidates\nFor her to actually take\nOver a news cycle but\nFor the election the way she did was outrageously self serving\nWe can do [laughter] who does that why ... why would I mean if if you knew the results of the DNA test and it was counter to your narrative that you're trying to go after you put that thing I miss\n[laughter] no I don't understand it so how do you think okay she got Sanders warns just because this New Hampshire but the other guys have got to go up there and compete or do they have to they might they just said\nYou know I think they do I think that you know because there's always going to be opportunities and that's as you probably know Chris ... says I'm Joe Clinton made a name for himself by doing well and and coming back\nTo route to winning at a time when she was losing\nSo you don't have to win the New Hampshire primary some they make and sell waves across the country so especially as Elizabeth Warren is the proper she's from Massachusetts neighboring Massachusetts took good care of you who comes in second and even third or a kitten get momentum as a result\nYeah 'cause I think Clinton finished third right yeah that's\nRight so so but you have to win pleasure show in New Hampshire to advance you have to yeah that's right that is correct and I ended up just ... what I don't think people understand about the Democratic nomination process this\nCycle is that California has moved up yeah and they're going to have and that's the way Spencer snakes and Kamala Harris McConnell Eris is going to have a big lead there\nYes and that's the I think that's going to be the interesting thing I didn't hear you guys talked about sexual but on the Iowa a conversation but what\nShe does in the early primary states will be interesting given the California who will see try we'll ... we'll see try and a ... and you have to do was to try and do well in all of them and um you know kept their so different set up so early primary states compared California\nWell again I think you have to get at least try to compete and some of these because the reality is even though you might not win New Hampshire you won't matter in the the nomination legitimately so you still have to win in the electoral college that practice at all you can't you can't just blew past Iowa New Hampshire because those are those who have gone in either\nDirection especially with Trump when he decided to try and no doubt about it what issues are driving a New Hampshire voters these days what's going on as\nWell and they would expect a or the economy is still\nThe number one issue I'm looking good governor here is a Republican Christian new new and he's and uh with\nWhat Donald Trump's been doing as governor Sununu the economy's booming where you have the second lowest unemployment rate in the country and I'm On the Democrats don't want to talk about that they're trying to talk about anything but the economy\nWith a family and he paid leanings issue ... they're just trying to make up an issue that might connect with voters authors in the economy so that's\nGoing to continue to be number one the second issue here Chris I I don't know how it worked in other states you've heard Donald Trump even talk about that since the opioid epidemic to a which is pretty pretty severe in New Hampshire so that's the second biggest issue really\nThat's that's just yeah after a number of it's just not going to number ... ... a retired that disease in our family as well and so it's a scourge of member of people dying as a result of that as their doors or anything else is great country\nSo it's not a person is like a final predictions what do you think coming out with thirty seconds punch it what do you got for the Democratic nominee ministers and when I\nGot a month when a New Hampshire primary I\nThink there's going to be kind of course like Cory Booker somewhere in the eye and then someone Michael Bloomberg\nMan\nAll right Mike joining us from the Granite State of New Hampshire four hundred and eighty days plus or minus out of the New Hampshire primary thanks for joining us we'll be back on the John Frederick so this is ... million acres\nOff it's just it's great it's great out there on the\nTrail how how do you know we're not all that does not\nMean work nor should you should anyone in politics it's constant but how do you how do you compare the intensity this year to last year when he was the same similar not as intense reasons well\nSimilar but I think we we're we're very proud\nParticularly in Virginia last year when we send a message to the country into the world\nThat you know hate and bigotry have no place here and that we were open and welcoming for business with the election of governor north on there and his team and then you know that that just verse set of a house candidates that got across the finish line that just beautiful tapestry of um of of of our our\nWomen and a diverse women and I just eat up so that was that was really great but I think what has happened is people realize we hey we can do this we can't do this and it's just help dump all day long and we said for\nExample the search and the absentee ballot ... I'm In Fairfax County in Prince William county\nWhich are a number one in the right now in the state or requests for absentee ballots you know that's good for us that's that's really good point I think we're just asked you know adding more excitement and enthusiasm right\nLike Clinton did was on earlier to seven o'clock hour and he said he's he thinks the turnout going to be forty to forty five percent that's a large a large range and there but we're projecting turn out right now\nWe're just going out there looking for every single\nTime [laughter] I Know where do you think the term is kind of getting\nMid term elections which normally a hard but we have a reason to get out there is a lot at stake and um and uh so we're going to be better than your average and it turned out you know I'm not in the business of of that we're just going to we're we're just reaching can you're describing\nAnd we are just trying to get advice and bring that were\nAnybody else that wants to count like\nI've been impressed with your with your cropper attendance this year in Russia they they definitely worked hard what struck me as a sort of an obvious one is that the predominant a female candidates nominees\nRight I it just is definitely the year the woman I like to talk about our women candidates and then I got an Anthony\nFlaccavento man not [laughter] I mean for one\nThing is is I mean and they're all they have\nA different kind of experience and diversity but it is good and it will be a good refreshing brass on a for Congress and across the process at the time it's a state senator general for West End up there on the tenth congressional district that we're really excited about what we see up there\nOn the volunteers are just showing up on non stop and the Washington Post endorsed her which is something that I'm a you know I Am Barbara Comstock got endorsed every at a time when they were very disappointed at her since she goes down after Donald Trump and that proved not to be the case so ah her\nCheerful west so it's going to be on a congresswoman and then down and I'll just run through a real quick if you want to ask me something about him but we will go on the line at lower yeah and the second district a retired navy commander in the small businesswoman and of course Scott Taylor's got he's on his own problems with a\nOr you know trying to cheat and quite frankly and on and and and having a staff or\nPut half fraudulent drop signatures on the ballot I mean that's you know that's unheard of Scott that's pretty St Louis and I think are writers are going to reject that that but even that we you know without that we still have a fine you know could credible candidate\nWell I Wonder if I don't know what I've seen in your in your PIN is yeah this is obviously a female when I think it's been regardless of the outcomes that we can talk about polling and they'll come November and you know according to Dr Taylor up there and\nHe's got ... up in Coburn and then maybe you Williams was six when I think it's sending a signal though is that you're going to see even more women in the future running for office regardless of party and I think it's a very healthy dynamic\nYeah yeah and I want to I Want to I Want\nTo say two things on that real quick when it really excited that Leslie covered just got me into a red to blue is a program for the D triple safe but the\nThing I think you're exactly right and that women women have always um um women has always and studies show yes but you know then the ones that would and I know your mom would agree as long as it would've been\nThey don't go over my heart so don't go\nAway that raise my kids I got to get my degree got to pay off my lines you know I mean you can do it better and I think really one of the\nI guess if you have to say good outcomes of twenty sixteen limit decided we're not waiting anymore we're going to step up there and watch something to offer and I I don't I think that you just see more and more of that because someone said that\nState this year with women's health care thought with families with just health care in general you know women have a lot to add to that on there and we just don't think we're going to step back anymore\nNo no no I don't I don't think he should but I think having the frankly it's not just women but they're but they're in a certain age range to relatively speaking to me a couple of her you know a bit older a little bit younger but for the most part you're you're sent a record\nOn mom's right the suburban mom is is is a strong boating I Want to say walk but a market that I think your party is obviously intentionally trying to attract\n... correct correct and on those suburban moms some of them who voted for Donald Trump\nI think kept seeing the ramifications of that vote and we are reaching out and talking to them and particularly when you take something like the Kavanaugh's nomination where you know set aside the fact of whether you didn't did or didn't relate doctor for just as a man who temperament\nWe saw back his temperament that is not fit to be a judge and then add on to it the fact\nOf you know her very compelling tested and tested money and arms and and they you know Republicans decided not to believe I Believe there's going to be some ramifications from that\nUm let's talk about mostly Coburn moving from into the three D. triple C a red to blue program\nUh you're you're making a new zoo and the drugs burgers radio show this morning with the other folks who make news about effort on Iowa and Steve bullock is a potential outsider and now we're all been in New Hampshire we always [laughter]\nYou're you're I'm three for three callers here so this is news luckily Coburn is moving into this special category of funding from the D triple C talk about that\nWell we just we just got that information ourselves and that just shows you know that's an open seat we've always thought it was very competitive and uh we we are pleased to see that on the inside the beltway grapes recognize that as well she's Seventy two thousand dollar car\nYou know the fifth district has really really dig it goes from up in a faulty accounting all the way down to the north Carolina line it's got a lot of different you know raw but you know it's got Charlottesville area in it to you it's got you know then you've got sort of the D.C suburbs with\nAll care so you got a little bit of everything that she is really a campaign in every part of that district and ah I think that you know here here here and it towards the end they sound like you know solve the value in investing more in her\nWell it also says hey we have the resources to do it right\nWell that's a good point too I think that is and if you've seen the articles that in you know our candidates\nAre actually out raising our candidates not even the committees are actually out raising 'em\nA Republican incumbents like you look at Dave Brat versus Abigail Spanberger I think she got raised him three to one maybe August last um [noise] I guess this this recent filing report spam and\nYeah I think I'm a small guy actually care which is like really gratifying because he had a small donors are the ones that really skinny and I show up and knock on doors tense times in a ...\nWell I think that's showing up obviously in the polling generic ballot is a little behind where are you all were last year at the end of the day or if you just follow up if you just follow those those numbers and the data you're probably do quite well election day maybe not as large as the nominee that happened in Virginia last year but you know showing up on the ground um\nI I think the Democrats are going to have another a happy\nDay here again

in I Do is is\nOccasionally I'm I'm a former member of the Virginia house of delegates I served in two thousand two to two thousand ten and currently I'm the executive director of Virginia free the foundation for research and economic education Virginia free is a nonpartisan underlined nonpartisan boldly nonpartisan a\nPro business out of the advocacy organization here in the comics in\nFor Thirty years I'm not only a pro business we're also very much a working towards responsible pro business govern because as we heard me\nIn the news updates Mike we heard that China's economy\nIs slowing down its growth and that's a\nProblem we have a significant debt burden and their economy is slowing its growth down there there you see the track line going from like eight percent seven percent now they're in the six percent raises\nGuy and that has that has devolved to where we are today largely as a result of several factors I'm Wondering the Iraq War to the collapse of the economy\nAnd two thousand and eight and a and that has led to this massive worldwide suspicion of government or what's going on to that it's unsettled place that we are in this world is not just manifesting itself in the United states we are not alone in this and this is in this\nCultural shift is manifesting itself in politics\nIt's showing up in Hungary in Poland and in Germany over the weekend in Bavaria which is actually I ran into a [laughter]\nGerman political future of the weekend fancy that writes he's on the exchange program I didn't want to go back and kind of like am I why something like like I really don't want to go and watch football I Want to chill out Sunday nights it's a great game on Fox\nOh go you'll have fun okay fine subject with these two German teachers trying to have a conversation and thinking I don't know any German right what are you gonna do you avoid [laughter]\nHow's that lurks you know [laughter] you know where do you go with that conversation well it turns out especially\nBeautiful English and he probably better than than we do structurally and um and I and I said ooh how\nAre the electricity in Bulgaria because they're very has a lot of their lectures on Sunday it was a very important election in Germany that's the kind of guy and that's what I followed and well this one teacher was up or a teacher of politics so then we went down a rabbit hole two hours later at the dinner table we just we're just we're\nExtremely successful economically\nAnd is the richest region of Germany\nFor folding pointing like three percent unemployment youth unemployment is extremely low uh their school system is set up to get people to work straight away um if if you're like a tenth grade and you're not you don't really want to go to university you don't have to take it to make it you could go right into\nA a a trade school apprentice program and you're making a job and you wanna get um really man said it's a very works intensive area they they pride themselves culturally\nOn work and productivity an organization that good government right there there was like a it's not like a shining example of how you would want to have a state where a region actually be everyone's employee there was a jobs everything\nFunctions ah and it works well they had this major upset in the very elections and you go what are you upset about what what could you possibly\nBe that concerned about that you basically blow up this I don't know if they blow it up but how does major upset in the ruling party that had been has been in control for decades watched probably the most the ruling majority in Bavaria and\nIt was stunning to me to realize that we're not immune from that here here in America it's the people say you know the economy Republicans are the economy's\nGoing so great vote for us people don't vote on yesterday's news they don't vote on today's news they vote on the future where are we going where what is going to be happening that's my that's my concern is well things are going well you know what Donald Trump got elected gasoline was about two twenty five\nA gallon now it's around two eighty a two thousand eight was four dollars now or better but are we getting better are we getting worse you know we see here that China news today about their economy is slowing down its growth rate of growth and that has a factor on the human psyche about how\nHow's it going to manifest itself in my life you see these commercials they're not all about you know skills and here's my dad says there are about this guy's off all she's horrible there ... there but there's no big overriding issue like here's what we're going to do in the future\nIt's just that the other person's really bad therefore they're not going to be good for you um and therefore because he was going so well they can hurt the economy I guess this is what they strap elation isn't the subconscious\nBut I'm going what is the big driving issue other then obviously Donald Trump and it's a fascinating\nTime in American politics are reasons why do what I Do because it is so interesting but also to teach people as I used to tell my students I really don't care I really don't care [laughter]\nWhat you think I hear that you think if I can encourage people to be more interested about what they're talking about to read another article to dig deeper to challenge themselves they will in turn create a better outcome for the rest of us and I just tell my students I don't care who you vote for\nI just care that you vote but if you don't vote I understand that's also a boat in itself because you were saying I'm not I'm not doing this I vote none of the above and it's and that's and that's fabulous in aggregate itself just like the boat will and that people do that doesn't make any sense actually it does\nOr try to reach out to you in some way shape or form that data point will register I told the story of a family I was at a baseball game and they were so upset are\nWe just can't stand going and I can jump out if they haven't earned your vote dumped both and tell them that you don't put it on social media like you would anyone else anything else so I'm not voting you haven't earned\nMy vote you haven't got me off my couch off my dollars to go down and say I'm voting\nFor this person you don't register ill aggregate data and that raw data that collects and is dissected by the political class to determine what they want to do um and there and that's an ... swings on the undecided voter right the independent voter in October is like oh we're going to\nStop talking about these issues that motivate our base to integrate we're going to focus on these oh I'm really happy to work with the other side you see this now and then certain counts I work with the president's wife shows up the polling\nIndependence they may not like President Trump but when they agree with something you'd better work with them they get and that's the thing is you know all politics is personal not just walk anyway this course\nActually I'm filling in for John credit should be tending to hear me drawing on about politicians who is this guy\nI'm a former member of the house of delegates I'm filling in for John products as I Am wants to do a as John\nIs on vacation with his son down in Florida in a baseball tournament a John is a baseball fan\nProbably like in his words but he was a pitcher in college and his son Joe Joes a picture of you want to call and ask me some questions love to hear from is it eight eight four five six four six eight eight eight four five six four six eight eight for eight oh five six four six four you can taxidermy\nStraight away five four zero\nOn four zero six six eight zero five four zero to nine four zero six zero I'm gonna have some great experts on later today Clinton kicked Christopher Newport Jack will suffer the Republican Party with congressman\nRob Wittman a doctor Robin McDougal from the Virginia Commonwealth University Wilder school and Jesse Harris from Iowa was like what a co operative and uh as as on the Democratic side in from the Republican side from New Hampshire will hear from identity and Susan slacker or my good friend\nFrom the Shenandoah Valley uh we're a citizen for you know gosh early nineties I think [laughter] I started dating yourself there's there isn't a Democrat\nA chair a chair of the Democratic party Virginia is from highland county ... county I used to represent you know they've noticed there was in for for decades and so we have we have a great friendship and I am looking forward to having all these costs calling today stir up the conversation will will they go a little deeper we're going deeper today in politics we're going to go\nDeeper dive in not just you know the public polling atop while numbers but how\nThose posters has got to those numbers who are they listening to who are they calling well why are they calling because it's a very different when a university does a polling like CRISPR Newport you'll hear quitting should talk about this they start with a very broad universe um and it keeps coming\nDown to a smaller University of actual likely voters\nMinutes\nWe'll get to that will get into the nitty gritty yet you take you do a deeper dive so when you look at the polls when he got like a real clear politics which which I spend unfortunately way\n[laughter] this is helping Internet\nOr a ... you look at these different polls and you're gonna like it was just it just take a look at the uh the polls on a generic ballot it's insane but\nWhat we're looking at here although it's it's fascinating like generic ballot\nAll this ... plus Democrats plus a grasp of five Democrats ... Democrats plus the lab Democrats plus one what how do you get there you say the polling is wrong well pose always right it's just data\nYou're collecting other people call what the differences in the methodologies who your goal or talk to one leading I'm democratic source\nAnd I said okay what's your polling showing he said\nDemocrats are around ... low thirties thirty or thirty three percent or two that range Republicans we'd never seen self identification for Republicans is while it's around twenty four percent and what used to be you know thirty four thirty four is now thirty four twenty four and independents\nAre up around the world in the forties because Republicans have never been lower on self identification but we haven't\nPicked up any of those voters they're all self identifying now is independent that\nHuge it when you get down to it with people when they understand what's really going on that's when they get more excited mortgage this is\nIt in my life but also a what a what a blessing and it's just to be alive right to be able to ah just to be experienced at all and I'm Wondering is I I enjoy coming in during his radio show as I get to hopefully get people excited about politics a good to talk to govern their lives is important you know\nWe can't break down we have to work with each other to get good things that we should have the debate though we should have a vibrant vigorous debate that threatened moves the\nCountry forward um and we shouldn't be afraid to have a debate but we should have in a in a civil manner and I think\nToday we see it or a lack of civility more and more and that's difficult in my professional life I\nAm the executive director Virginia free the foundation\nFor research and economic education and I'm a Republican seats racy sex and were nonpartisan which is a great lane to be in these days because everyone is you know red or blue and I'm like okay good for you well you know aren't you might not really I don't have to be actually I'm paid macho\n[laughter] even right oh healthcare so [laughter]\nBut what we did was we represent businesses and uh we have membership and what we tried to do is educate them on politics and as a former teacher and from a business person to my family out of bottled water business for years old a couple of years ago a blessed with like um you know I I like getting people excited about learning about politics seeing it differently and what's\nOther subjects you have to really get engaged in the subject\nSo it's an every day I get to learn more and more about politics it's\nIt's a it's an interesting topic because it brings in culture and\nEconomics and history and I was a history major and so I I get to bring down altogether because it manifest itself as Andrew Breitbart said in the last ... last segment you know culture is down politics is downstream of culture so if you want to impact culture or the politics impact\nCulture first and foremost up your culturally don't leader you'll be you'll be a political year give us a call it in a four five six for six we got some great just calling into that are not just women\nBut also the leaders of the two of measure parties here Virginia posters Clinton kid and Robin McDougal and then to operate in this one from Iowa and one from New Hampshire we're only I hate to say this\nBecause you're probably second hardly elections already in the midterms\nWe are four hundred and Seventy two days away from the Iowa caucuses\nFour hundred\nAnd Seventy two now it seems like a long time but let's be honest as soon as this election is over you're going to start hearing reports back from Iowa and New Hampshire and we're going to be at the forefront of that we're going to get calls they were going to shoot up with with us of operatives that Republicans and Democrats to see what's going on the ground I think\nTrump's got the lock on the nomination you never know you never know you never know goodness knows you never know with Donald Trump because I'm ... ... that's that's that's\nWho knows this actually does what he says it says you can do but you never know what's gonna happen around them and I think that's one of the more interesting\nParts about politics today is because he's brought that dynamic up ... max and that sort of with if you remember from your uh ... days in school or or worse\nWhen the leader changes and it's like a substitute teacher what is going to be like you know you get you get a new boss oh what's it it's just there's just this pen from since June fifteenth of twenty Fifteen this has been a very different political dynamics are not necessarily unhealthy\nBecause it has made us think and react differently and respond differently and I don't think that's necessarily on healthy ah but we do have you ever vigilant to make sure it does not become\nToo unhealthy and I think people are recognizing that we have ah some some discourse in this country or that can be improved we can get better at that as a people and how we do that is every day one on one with each other you want to impact politics if you want better representation be better people\nSort of comes down to um they represent us and if you want them to be better it's up to wants to be a better so it was called an eight four to five six for six we'll talk about polls goodness knows there's more calls and I don't know what to do with these days\nThe generic ballot is what I pay attention to the first and foremost that's what I check every day I'm On the real clear politics they give you the um average of all the different polls and they break down the individual polls\nI'm now told should be looking at what are called Elvie is likely voters holding company should have an understanding of who they imagine are going to be showing up on election and she had a pretty good handle on may ... began in Virginia about a month ago so that we should know who's actually voting I'm In Virginia and ah you know what\nFriends of mine that are tracking them to see what kind of um who's voting relative to the last round of elections to see what the intensity is but when you look at the er the averages\nOf the generic ballot them this is why I Do this is why I Do that in twenty Seventeen when governor Ralph Northam defeated at the last week he won by eight point nine\nThree percent they point nine three points the generic ballot on that day was nine point one hit bottom trying to instruct the class\nWhere do you want to follow Fox News Reuters Rasmussen CNBC Emerson Maris Quinnipiac Wilder pool all a Christmas Newport which one do you follow all the generic ballot right now\nBecause that is that is fairly proximate\nTo what happened last year and the year before and twenty sixteen if you look the generic ballot in twenty sixteen it was very close it was like\nTodd and Republicans over performed on election day by about a point and they want and the generic congressional ballot I'm obviously Trump lost by about three points a nationally three million votes\nUm so that's something to consider when you're saying okay we're just going to go I think I think the the objective view here is look at the generic ballot look at the average and you can pretty much extrapolate where it is right now is election day were held today because\nOn that basis it it takes away the the partisan lines you might have or a would be inclined to it at nine point one percent the dams one by one point nine nine point one point nine that's very close and they are at seven\nPoint six right now it is safe to assume that they will not perform as well as they did in twenty Seventeen but still will win and likely when the house of representatives given the the dynamics\nIn the Senate very different because the individual races likely that Republicans a hold on to the Senate what's the dynamic that if the Democrats have the\nHouse and the scientists that Republicans have the Senate was going to have the next two years and that's how you can sort of figure out where this thing is going so you can understand what you need to do for not to like myself I don't watch cable news I don't watch broadcast news every papers in the morning ... times\nWall Street journal and I get mine on information what's going on in the economy and politics and culture and whatnot and early ... don't listen to you know the the uh the national\nTalk radio shows I go to work right yeah I Do with my eyes\nI see what's going on and I think most voters do that if you look at the the aggregate numbers of you know the Fox news or the world and the MSNBC it's a very small subset of the American population but they're the they're the most active\nVoters they are the their the activists\nSo those shows are pretty much you're broadcasting to the activists about what they want to hear about all the points that they they they're they're supposed to repeat so when you watch when you go to Facebook or Twitter or Snapchat or Instagram or whatever they're very different social media platforms you see\nDirectly is that right\nCongressional panel was from my friends get up there now in Congress or ... I watch them and take questions from the audience is like where did people get information fundamentally wrong but they're really upset\nI mean angry not pleasant not understanding but what do they show up for that show up because they're angry\nThey are concerned but more importantly like anyone else in the world they just wanted to hurt right how important is that in a conversation to hear what the other person is is really feeling it get down to okay what is what what is what is making your data says\nOh 'cause there's no no no that's that's the operative subject matter what is triggering this fear and when you get down\nInto the ins and outs of groceries you really can you understand why people do what they do and hopefully get them to a better place than station like and it's not easy to do but it's a it's it's what we do it in a democracy in public and form a democracy which we have\nIn America thank God I'm so we can just live more peacefully amongst each other governors self self governance I think it's really important historical and concepts and I think we've lost sight of that a little bit it's easy to 'em but more importantly suffered\nFor folks to pour out to like what we can do better you can do better calm down we got this I mean are are you have too many TV channels like do you have too many options are they are too many restaurants and grocery stores around\nYou is it too good are you afraid you're gonna lose all this I mean it's it's crazy\nHow good life isn't suburban America um rural America has a lot of challenges\n\n[noise]\nDoes this hour from Tom tom Tom Patrick caused fires traveling at last caravan birther of water bottles border fence\nOn stream to five thousand toward Mexican territory friday\nIf I'm actually going authorities attorneys for an orderly crossing of President Trump's Russia retaliation a campaign rally for Arizona southern Canada after drops are Democrats would welcome in any immigrant while he is blocking the caravan of migrants from Honduras tried to reach the U.S I think they're\nPeople are known straps you got your feet for those gross and I'll tell you what this country don't want them\nResident told the crowd he will build a border wall Saudi Arabians especially dollar to the ...\nState run media is reporting the prosecutors in the kingdom believe Saudi writer Jamal to show you was killed in the Saudi consulate in Istanbul, Turkey you know moral state media also quotes prosecutors saying Eighteen Saudi nationals are being held on suspicion of being involved in the Washington Post columnist yeah\nSaudi state TV and the state runs Saudi press carry that statement early Saturday morning Saudi Arabia time correspond\nA George Pataki Texas Governor Greg Abbott says he's expanding an Eighteen county disaster declaration slugging worse than stay\nBecause of the magnitude of what has happened already and\nThirty six additional counties or to be added to my state disaster declarations\nConditions in worse in some areas with another round of rain forecast to move up with the state next week\nInto federal Alaska Governor Bill Walker has dropped his reelection bid with less than three weeks before the election Walker's decision at his campaign came three days after the sudden resignation to lieutenant governor Byron mounted over what Walker described as an inappropriate overture toward a woman as his town hall dotcom\n\n... so there's this guy didn't Jordan either healthy guy either data of six and he works as a guide in Alaska and he goes to the doctor a true story goes to the doctor diagnosed with cancer\nStage four and here's the thing he had switched earlier from medical insurance to manage sheer where Christians share each other's medical bills so the question for Jordan and his wife Jenny was is this actually going to work\nOur medical fails exceeded a hundred and sixty thousand dollar Medicare members shared all our town\nAnd it was about more than just the money to this is a real community\nMedicare is is a family they group of people that stick with you to the hardest times of your life I just don't know how I could have done it without them at a sure\nIt's worth looking into there's a reason this is growing so fast so if you want to find out more hearing is a number of for you have for for forty one\nBible that aid for for for one B.
