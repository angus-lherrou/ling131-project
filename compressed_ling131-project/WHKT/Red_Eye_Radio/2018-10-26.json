and then you go from there or what your times responded every\nSingle time they scored what's that's\nAbout the character of these boys\nYou bring up a great point John because I'm actually a year ago

about uh having a statement to turn that around and it didn't work last season and you know this season I think what\nReally is changed it is that our young man got together in the off season and came up with their own culture and core values and one of the core\nValues is great and great means resilience it means ... percent spins it means never say die and BMI words and because our kids came up with the court\nThen on that and uh I think also we had some success in the season coming back waiting games or or players know that we don't matter what\nThe score matter how much time on the clock

got\nDemocratic operatives out there on CNN and other networks trying to leverage this event this potential assassination this violence for\nTheir own political gain now if you listen to me right now you tell me that's not to say this is a second party the Democrats are sick the people that do this are nuts\nIsn't just a horrible event and I'm pretty convinced that ah\nIt was the same person because all the advertisements saying is they're all the same so this is the same person or persons\nPerson or persons probably percent crazy person\nBut then then there's the question of you know who did it and what was the motivation\n\nAnd until we get the facts and we don't know we don't know who did this we don't know if this was politically motivated by a Trump supporter we don't know if this was a democratic supporter trying to influence the election\n\nIn the back of your belly and wait we have no idea we didn't know what the facts are with the same thing that I told you about Saudi Arabia and to show you killing and the president did the right way he his position evolved as the fax came it let's let the facts to come in\n\nBut I'm I'm I'm not even going to speculate until we get more information more information you can test me seven five seven six by two seventeenth ... from from Norfolk says if in\nFact the pipe bombs or for from a real anti Democrat loon I hundred percent condemning them if we find out they were sent by a democratic operative to make Republicans look bad I Will not be the least bit surprised but it's a sad state of affairs for the\nFake news and the mob rule Democrats when I suspect everything that happens to them to be some sort of political move on their part here's what Jennifer sang same thing I I don't know the fact she doesn't know the facts\nBut here's what she says she's saying if it was a democratic operative that did this and the bombs were never intended to go off and it was to influence the midterms she's saying I wouldn't be surprised\n\nThat Jennifer from Norfolk I Would either and probably you probably would anyway\nOf the venture all of this election and I mean the Democrats President Trump and his right west I started

for eight oh five six for sex this or\nThis or act a potential acts here of domestic terror I really want to get your thoughts on this what you make of it where do you think it came from\nWe can do a little speculating today but uh the FBI all over this and they're saying in various news reports that they're going to get the bottom of it and the president at the same thing\nWashington's a little bit on the edge as the FBI now would investigate a string of attempted male bombings address to top Democrats or\nWhich was very odd because here's who they pick the bomber Clint didn't holder John Brennan Soros\nMaxine Waters and Debbie Wasserman Schultz ... it's just it's just very odd to me that are like half\nOf these people aren't even argument involved now I just found that odd I just find it I just uh the whole thing is a odd to me let me leave it at that it's just odd happening or eleven days before the midterms the FBI now investigating\nThe potentially destructive to devices because we don't know if they were actually set to go off either we have pictures of\nThem but um none of their devices thank God discovered\nThis week exploded and no one was harmed so thank the lord for that these six inch long package Bob's you said a battery containing powders and broken glass\nWere constructed from a PVC pipe and covered with black tape this is what we learn from a law enforcement official who saw the bombs at the X ray images of it and told her so she had to press\nThe\nPowder in the package that the CNN was tested and determined to be basically baby powder harmless so the white powder was harmless they um it's not really determined right now if these farms could've actually got off a\nThe FBI intercepted the packages for Obama Clinton in ... before they were received now anybody that does one of these would be odd that they didn't know that you can't get to bomb or Clinton or Trump or anybody of this nature because uh\nThey have Secret Service protection and everything is screen before it ever reaches them so that seems to me the package\nIn Florida package for bread and that was that the CNN resulted in the evacuation of cable Josh headquarters in New York City leading to the surreal scene of actors and journalists reporting on the breaking news event from the street\nAnd uh\nThe FBI says it's possible that other packages were mailed to other locations that are still in the mail strip the makeshift bombs are going under going tested inspection at the FBI Laboratory in Quantico, Virginia the associated\nPress has reported that the trail of clues are are eventually going to lead to the would be bomber and a course of the time and get that's not good now speaking in the East Room yesterday President Trump condemned the actors or threats or political\nViolence and called for unity as his audience to to applaud\n\nHe said that in these times we have to unify we have to come together and said one very clear very strong unmistakable message that acts of threats of political violence of any kind of no place in the United states of America that coming from President Trump\n\nThat was immediately condemned by Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer who then turned around and I said it was an insufficient response [noise] let me read it again in these times we have to unify of course Hillary Clinton said you can't unify until the Democrats win\nThat's what you said a week ago\nBut apparently the Democrats thought that the president's message of unification and coming together to send a very clear strong unmistakable message that acts or threats or political violence of any kind have no place in the in the United states obviously they are\n... statement it said it was insufficient and that he was part of the problem you had another democratic operative coming on TV last evening who said that uh\nAll of that people targeted by the pipe bomber in the mail he said you could uh\nBasically get the list by following the president's Twitter feed\n\nSee this is the Democrats are trying to take advantage of what could have been a horrible situation or maybe not because of the\nTerminator bombs could actually have gone off we don't know like the powder scent to CNN was baby powder so until we actually know that the bombs had the potential to go off and they could have harm someone\nCourts out we don't know we don't know anything\nKnow is what we know so let's wait until the FBI if they're being honest about it I mean we're we're now questioning the FBI but if they're being honest about it let's wait until they give their reports\nThere's this our town all died Tom I'm Rhonda roster\nInvestigators from around the country continue looking for the person\nOr persons behind the mailings of a number of

really excited today a because when you get through these pipe bombs and you just heard the president this is no time for violence we have to have a conversation in this country at dialogue respectful of people's views\nI don't know the nature of this I don't know the facts or not and I'm no one else but I have full confidence that uh\nThe Federal Bureau of investigation it's got a very quickly\nGet to the bottom of this Mike Pence saying yesterday whoever this person is it's going to be brought to justice now a new pipe bomb or potentially\nA is a the Associated Press the saying has potentially been to ... to\nLive or to a New York apartment complex where Robert Deniro lives\nSo all those facts are going to come out until we get to the bottom of it we don't know it's all conjecture and conjecture is fine\nBut let's let the facts about let's see what the nature of this is what all violets must be contempt whether it is chasing a people out of the restaurants are chasing him down subways or a fight\nI Walk in this country these midterms are only eleven days away and there's a lot at stake these are the biggest ever and folks you know what I Know this is the biggest mid term election ever this segment brought you by our friends at the job creators network your tax savings or on the ballot along with\nAnd that if we if we print those types of policies were going to go backwards\nYou're on the John feathers radio network trucking the truth across America with Elaine Parker a lane is that you can be achieved communications officer for the job creators network she has gone the\nThe country on a tax cuts plus chore for months talking to a small business owners or just regular people trying to figure out what is going on and there is definitely a right on your show going on here Elaine ah\nYou've talked to a lot of people kept Republican is there a chance that Republicans could actually hold the house forty seconds\nYou know I'm I'm pretty optimistic and and talking directly to the small business owners and to their employees and people who showed up at the at the rallies that we handle I I'm not going to think that we can that people are benefiting listeners emailing it or um you know consumer price\nOr I'm optimistic enough to think that we can\n\nAnd what were the other thing that we're saying is when you look at the generic ballot numbers that they favor the Democrats\nBut there's a lot of fake polls out there the other thing that we're\nSeeing internally is in the fifty\nOr so races that are going to determine who controls the house to remember the Democrats really have to pick up twenty six seats that link that twenty three twenty six because there's three seats now that the\nDemocrats hold that um my sources are telling me are leaning very strong every Republican those are going to flip\nSo the Democrats are going to have to pick up twenty six seats what I've heard right now\nBecause of the twenty six seats they need 'em that are toss ups that all of them are now trending towards Republican now in the last\n... forty eight hours part of it is you know people are looking at the economy and they're saying do we really want to go backwards do we really want to go back to be a bomb a regime do we really want to go back to getting rid of the tax cuts a half\nA percent growth savings are down nobody has any money family comes home father comes over mom and dad come home on a Friday nights or they can't take your family to a movie they don't have any money there is fear of their jobs the other thing is a way that you have to look at is not only our jobs up a an unemployment\nIs at the lowest it's been since Nineteen sixty nine Nineteen sixty nine wasn't land that was one of the New York miracle Mets won the world series Nineteen sixty nine I mean I was a kid back then I was uh\nTwelve years old or something like that so far but the number\nOf people you lay that have enter the job market\nAnd at one or two thousand two thousand and eight recession dropped out of the job market are now coming back and let me give me some other steps away the number\nOf former felons that have been released out of prison getting jobs is at a record high you know how great\nThat is for people that made a mistake and now they're getting a second chance let me get you in the other stuff the hiring of handicapped people in the Trump McConaughey Elaine it's up to thirty five percent handicapped people getting jobs\nI mean this is an American economic renaissance that Trump has done that is it's stunning and of course nobody wants to talk about it so how do you get the message out a way\nI like I said I charge every person at every single stops with hearing these stories and take that information and I'm not surprised that we're seeing that linked to come out of a incarceration India able to find jobs and that's it\nSo we can we can help them to acclimate back into society from the reality is we have seven point one million jobs out there and we don't have enough people to silver hill I think it's fantastic to get nice that's the training that they need to get\nInto jobs will keep them out of trouble and keep them from the hunting repeat offenders that's the best credit grant for this program we could ever get any jobs nothing bad happens when you have a job and you're making money and you're contributing to society\nAnd the thing is that line or a job for a family or raise 'em a better pay raise more take home pay\nA job is not read and it's not blow your your your you know what it is is great and so when you get a job you're right and when uh when when men and women feel better about\nTheir ability to support and take care of their family six look out for people and\nUh this really this is the jobs economy I mean that is incredible the number of people the other thing the other ... Parker with is a Trump economy and the resurgence we're having is the number of people now that in in uh\nIn middle income jobs or um lower to middle income jobs who\nNow feel comfortable in changing jobs because there's a better opportunity for that you know before\nThis when you looked at the numbers nobody would leave a job they were in because they were scared like the next job would be there will walk now that's changing so people that are have a better opportunity at another employer they're now moving to benefit\nThemselves that's another untold story of this economy do you agree\nThat's deliberately and and we're seeing people to have those kinds of choices and employers are competing school where I'm Korean leader for employees and because of that we're seeing wages rise and people are making changes and\nTax plan it took effect is here we're going to be um it wasn't your family feel that he's two thousand dollars more each year I had as their earnings and in one of the thing that that kind of an untold story and it doesn't get a lot of\nA life press on and that's the new uh deception for small business owners past the small business owners\nPartnerships sole proprietorship as corporations they're able to actually feel twenty percent of their business or any from taxes which is what you were talking about your small business as well and they're able to reinvest that money on it now they have to reinvest it more into ah\nInto higher wages because they're competing for scarce labor out there for a job\nAnd so in Queens you feel good about their choices out there and and that's that's a great thing to me to pick me he's coming in more and more and more and what we keep reminding people out in the road is that if we want to keep that this progress\nGoing this prosperity than we do have to get those for each types of policies and for the Republican\nCongress that his ... in place I've actually never seen a party run on raising taxes that essentially what the Democrats are doing and the public needs to open their ears and listening to science if they are wedding on raising taxes\nIt's amazing raising taxes open\nBorders lower wages unfettered immigration sanctuary cities\nIt's it's it's their platform is insane and I don't even know what their platform is other than sanctuary cities open borders jet rid of tax cuts I mean I have no idea and basically their their their whole policy is Trump\nSucks I mean that's their platform unbelievable never see anything like it but here's the thing you got to vote and land because if you don't vote you don't matter but the other thing is you got eleven days you got to get involved because the other side they're working really hard you got to get involved and here's the best way to get involved\nWith the tax cuts work dot com I mean I don't know how we can make it easier for people you don't have the people say I\nDon't want to join a party I don't want to go to meetings you have to wonder if any of that I don't know where to go go to the tax cuts worked are Thomas all there you can do whatever you want you can handle literature you can make phone calls you can send us an email and helped take people to\nPolls do whatever you want tax cuts works out Tom go they're going out you love the days get involved and cheap this American economic when Assad which is better than anything else we've ever had cheaper going for yourself\nYour family your grandchildren you link Parker thank you for being with us always an honor to have you and thanks for your hard work in in going around the country I mean it's a little bit easier for me 'cause uh you know I go on the radio with a couple\nOf different places you up and down the road nonstop for months I've seen it myself on the buses and a great job of laying that you've made a real difference thank you and thanks on tax cuts works dot com Hey Ryan McAdams is coming up he thinks he can win why not\nThe Republicans bears\nYou're Godzilla in America and that's\n\nN.

incumbent Democrats aren't we teach and that will be determined on November six they keep running for a second term Ryan good to have you with us Matt\nJohn good morning it's great to be with you congratulations on your your radio show being expanded into the acquisition appreciate everything that you said I I Love the elite in and um thank you so much to begin with being with you this morning\n[laughter] look I think you're you're turning this into a fun race I'm not saying that you're going to win but you're turning it into a competitive race and you're working hard also a couple of things let's start with these pipe bombs what are you are making us yeah\nWell you you said well I was listening to you and you know there is no place for some politics I think that that we've gone too far maybe on all sides demonize demonizing one another and I think we need to get back to\nTalking about ideas and solutions and and what's best for the American people\nAnd stop trying to paint each other you know as a you know and then it means and you know we are competitors and races but we need to get back to uh what is American and matters or not this type of activity that we're seeing a right now with bombing or with the just the hyped up rhetoric um\nUh that we see a in politics today so I'm definitely for a more moderate tone and and focusing on the things that really matter to Americans and that solutions\n... tell me a little bit about um\nYour position on this caravan right we've got ten thousand people that's basically going to bomb Russia border the United states and write\nAs you know even though the president said he's trying to put the military there or or um or or the or the national guard it's a it's likely that he closes the border because that would close off trade and\nOur laws are such it's very odd Ryan because what you just kept one foot over the border without your documents you've broken a U.S immigration law right you're here illegally soon as you step foot\nThat Ryan as soon as you step the other foot in you got three laws protecting you basically the floors law so there's nothing we can do it we can't so it was catch and release\nYou have to process it and you can only what you can only detain them\nFor twenty days and the asylum processing the backlog now Ryan two years so basically you get a piece of paper and you get released into the interior of the country if you were in Congress what do you do about this ... how do you deal with it\nYeah well there's two different issues there but let's talk about the care care of an ... number one as we got to stop on I think the president's going to stop 'em there's no doubt in my mind that he's going to follow through with what he said that he's not allow them to come in and\nI mean I I think that continuing to put pressure on Mexico\nUm I I Love what he's he's done with on earth and brought them all and said look if if you can't stop them them there and we're going to start taking our money away and our funds that we've given you\nOr whatever that look like but I agree there's got to be consequences countries is a allowing this type of thing this caravan lawlessness that to happen across their borders coming up our away so I think continuing to push ... number one\nPut pressure on Mexico\nTo stop this caravan I don't know if they'll be able to do that you know if it's Fifteen thousand strong now or whatever it is um but we're going to stop them at the border and then the second issue is what you're saying is I think that we need to change\nThose asylum laws that when someone comes in and and and I know you know this but eighty percent or ability to claim asylum well forget it I'm In no go through the process and then most of them eighty percent of them will get turned away by the courts and so there's there's this\nTheir lives you know this connection between those claiming asylum and then does actually\nGoing before the court and then and then being deemed that it's completely erroneous and so uh I think but but like you said the problem is is that once they they've gotten that that status\nPer se then they never show up for court and then they're running amok in our country and so we've got to change that so that uh and I don't know exactly what the solution will be but we've got to change that to to wear that you know there has to be a more stringent policy for people seeking asylum wants to cross the border\nRoy McAdams you're right we have to close loopholes and uh if you just read some of the facts here in two thousand or one half of one percent of the illegals that cross the border claimed asylum now fifty percent claim asylum\nBy two thousand Nineteen it'll be eighty percent I mean they they just they just figured it out you companies the in the United states you get up or look if you come in and get don't get apprehended then you don't get apprehended and only fifty percent are apprehended eighty five percent just come in from the Fifteen Percent that actually get apprehended eight fifty\nPercent of them claim asylum and then uh even though eighty percent don't qualify\nIt doesn't matter because they're already God I mean they're ... they're handed a piece of paper and they have a hearing in two years they just\nGet on the porch [laughter] I mean it's it's a shame that it's it's Saturday\nWhat is going on that the president said this and she can't get that\nBig wall street donors and Goldman Sachs that they don't care about their they just want cheap labor to drive shareholder value so they can make a higher bonus and screw the U.S worker they could care less I think on holy alliance going on right we have to talk about a lot of other issues I got to get a quick route from\nThere's this hour from
