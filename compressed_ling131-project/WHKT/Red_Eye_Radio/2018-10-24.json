in this or do you see it in a different way governor\nTrying to think Congress certainly has a role to play in American foreign policy we we'll talk about a lot so commentators said that they really don't get\nThat it's all up to the president and the executive branch I don't think that's the way the constitution works I think our foreign policy is conducted by the by the president but certainly broadly made an influence very Congress also [noise] so uh the point is it legitimate to go to the Congress and have that conversation but they have limited power\nTo do that so many things but frankly the they can set a standard Congress can set a standard if they choose to want to say goodbye to Yemen kitchen put everybody on this list they pull you max out take a look at ... am and really is\nAnd it's called the southern part of the Arabian Peninsula so if you have Iran to the north and they are so many English a revolution and the civil war down in Yemen you get is Saudi Arabia

country and that that's really what's going on so the point is they give up a conflict is more complicated first appears on the fresh\nI Want to get to an article that you had written just the other day and one of the things that you said in the piece a you talked about the relationship we have with the Chinese and of course a lot of people and not me but a lot of people were predicting that\nChina will eventually overcome the United states as an economic power will be indebted to them cetera uh you have a a little bit of a different take on that you want to share that with our audience governor\nYeah yeah I'm just not pessimistic everybody the conventional wisdom in America these days is a bad goes on declining China's [noise] and I just reject that I just don't don't agree with that at all I think the United states has the absolute advantage for the future we're the ones at least so far they have a free economy\nWhere the much they'll have a free country that everybody looks to watch uh we're the ones that actually bring material benefits there are system\nThe Chinese have got a real problem on their hands and their problem is you know modern society and the twenty first century they cannot continue to run an authoritarian government and yet that's their vision for the world that's their vision for China\nThat they're going to control the east in the western Pacific in eastern East Asia I got to control it\nAnd they're going to start tearing methods to do that in fact she concentration camps now in western China set up against minorities this kind of brutality cannot blasted the twenty first century with the Internet modern media monitor communication and ah and frankly are rising middle class in China\nThat their problem is they're building their middle class which is a good thing but the middle class was not going to stay under communist dictatorship forever I Believe that the future belongs to the United states I Believe we're\nThe ones who have all the advantages going forward the twenty first century not going to be a Chinese Century it's going to be an American century\nOr what about our debt a lot of people not getting concerned about the debt on the tax cuts of the president which I Know you both you and I are very much in favor of it I think they feel this economy of tried to tell\nOur listeners if you look historically at tax cuts and the effect of having the economy in growth right in gross than the main thing is is there's a lag between when the tax cuts take effect\nWhen revenue increases to actually out what it was prior to the tax cuts so there's a lag\nThe president also calling in his cabinet out of the blue and saying time to get out your ... I Want to five percent cut from everybody across the board you can find it have a good day ... what do you think of that\nWell first of all what your listeners to from time to time go on my Web page by non profit organization called American opportunity\nYears we've written about economic growth than we've written about foreign policy you alluded to a recent article that I wrote on foreign policy of extra rich six and we also have some people writing all some Chinese issues about other issues like that they're on our Web page American opportunity to work\nBut one of our oldest for positions that we've done in our organization\nThat's the gross code which has decided at the time that\nThey left was in charge of the country and the wages were not growing it people were not working on it was higher growth slowed down and we propose that there'd be a policy of tax cuts for economic growth\nWell that's now been done and you know the whole point is this how you're going to get out of the debt you're either going to have to raise taxes in order to finance the debt or you're going to have to grow in order to create more revenue build a bigger pot\nBut at the end of the day ... good good increase revenues to just spend the same revenue right again if you\nIf you raise a gross by the million dollars each than spend a billion and a half you're still on the show at the end of the day we have some major decisions in this country or about how we're going to spend our money right now we're basically a moving in the left is trying to move us in the direction of socialism which is a transfer money from one pockets\nOf the other but at the end of the day there's no limits or that and that increases the debt and furthermore dries out money that's going to be absolutely essential to the coming conflicts of the twenty first century in our military spending that's got to be absolutely necessary I research are aren't developed\nLike a science uh these things are also after we push for it so we have a lot of priorities and good governance and good executive leadership going to be just a good congressional leadership they're going to be necessary to help the time that spending\nSo um we can't censor tournaments because the president has made that promise on multiple times that was part of his\nEconomic platform he said I have a deal the deal uh you've paid into Social Security you're paying these different things and the money's going to be there I'm not going to cut that\nThat represents what over fifty percent of the budget right right right they're\nNot going to cut military spending you know so when you when you look at a five percent cut across everything else discretionary spending\nYou know you're not talking about trillions of dollars are you\nWilling Joel desire to the American conservative here say actually doing human tore and\nAnd now so so where we are spending money and then have a policy discussion are real political discussion\nOf the committee either in campaigns are get elections or otherwise taste of what we're spending our money on and what we have to spend their money at all but one thing is real sure and that is if you increase taxes you reduce economic activity if you increase taxes you reduce economic activity\nHit me and that's the rest of the whole procedure the left their goal is to simply go for the bucks and grab the money from anybody they can get his law and they usually make its quote they're rich unquote but I can promise you John based upon all the numbers I've ever seen in order\nMhm\nIt would have been between countries\nBut now he is a tarnished reputation as family simply guilt by association and I personally believe a scientist comes to deliver a very strong actually [noise]\nAnd a slap on the rich this is a kind of message where the Saudis have to basically learn\nThat what they're doing harms not only their reputation harms harms their own countries and also harms the interest of the United states of America or I Would start very much for me to make it clear to the Saudis simply\nThe piano when the war is over they have to wrap it up so I\nWould certainly I Try and take whatever actually caught it against the people directly involved all the way up to\nThis sort of like seeing the real world we're not going to take personal actually his Mohammed Vince Martin I Believe but certainly I'm not supposed to be plenty of inner circle that this or that hurts\nThe commentaries that are read by somebody from us that we needed them family is not a good now that the real narrative is the Saudis are much more than ... than\nA it's not in a\n\nWhat's the word I'm looking for it's not a one way streets and Sally dependent suddenly had his state's is really quite considerable they can't go to somebody\nElse to buy weapons because obviously can but it means that they may break with their own military comes to a screeching halt within within days because we provide all this part is we provide\nAmerican companies in American technicians\nProvide most of the maintenance of supervision and the maintenance skills I mean as I say I don't leave the certainly the military could stream functional beyond a few weeks maybe a month or two without direct American support\nSo we have the upper hand there's no doubt on my mind we have the upper hand and also look like the Europeans are going to stop selling a luxury equipment the salaries\nAre so that leaves them with the Russians the only other viable place to go and I'll tell you I Want to be in countries like Saudi Arabia and the other one is from the French it will take five years to basically stand out the American equipment and by Russia you know\nSome mountains reaction to a very simple quick you know what my interest salt from the Canadian foreign minister\nVery minor break relations like can we may not have totally rational actor on that level\nOr the other great problem of course it's best if he is you know he has done so much damage too\nBut at the same time he has made so many enemies [noise] domestically but also on the street [noise] [noise]\n\nSo um is your best or by the wayside everyone knows you're on the John first run your network we are when former cutter United States ambassador Patrick hero he is now the president of the u._s. cutter business council\nSo you mentioned the word Mr Ambassador\nIncompetent or you the first one that said that and ah I've got it written down because I think that really sums up\nYou know a lot of the things that NBS has gotten involved in um have not been successful whether it be the wings conduct in the ... civil war which I think\nAh even supporters of that would say it's been a disaster on every possible level\nThe um the blocking he did with Egypt Bahrain and the Emirates against a guitar has been a total colossal failure it's almost a comedy show because uh the country of cutting state of\nCutter is much better off economically and otherwise then they were before the blockade\nAnd older men is that the Saudis aren't getting any of their business I mean it was really a completes its atrophy and if you if you went to Harvard Mr bastard taught a business class on international relations how to do a blockade inhabit blow up in your face that would be your classmates after\nSo every day the guy gets involved in a blows up at what point did during their fathers saying you know maybe he's just not equipped\nOh well that's true but there may not in a situation where you call the shots when are we the embassy to Jerusalem and this was too much [noise] but\n[noise] that you know they can stand up to his son [noise]\nI think that would be the farther to step in and remove most of the fact that so many people know\nExposed and [noise] [noise]\n[noise] mhm [noise]\n[laughter] [noise] that's complicating factor the\n\nMissing him Mr investment how was this kind of effect\nThe Iranians are\nYou reading ends must be absolutely speechless if they're good luck on this one I have to you know I imagine what the Iranians are going to let this one play out personally further undermining the position of Saudi Arabia a\nSunni is ah the Iranians position now are they able to say you shouldn't have done away with the nuclear agreement the Jaycee the lady I Know what are you doing favoring somebody was much more than anything we've done\nA that's an arguable question but right now the Saudis are made the headlines not them [noise] I think it all the negative headlines\nA show for them is really a question of [noise] a sitting it out I think they know they should be able to play the propaganda part of the war with Yemen work really well\nAnd the amount of um any residuals support there might have been with the Saudis in Yemen War are just going to see\nIt going to just go away or the other thing is for the first ... years knowledge of the region of the ... comes with the salaries for ah what's the word I'm looking for for [noise]\nGoing to a mastery of that part of the world and they are not going to be physicians\nAre just stand up to him so all in all its oh this\nIs Lewis Lewis for the salaries all around and it's unless we really forcefully and it's a lose lose for us as well we do need to put the Saudis place to make sure the scientists understand who they really are not countries are called to shop for the United states of America\n\nIt pay your either either were calling the shots or know calling the shots but they're not the ones calling for us [noise] so I I feel very strongly\n\nThat we need to\nDate on his stand up and said you know there's not you know this is simply intolerable conduct it affects our interests and certainly try is the president's\nBrand or no matter how you slice it I think it's now embarrass him and his family and they done it all the time so\nI'm going to get out of this what do you get out of this is by making it very clear\n\nOr make it clear that this is not acceptable course of action\nNow how does this mean for the ruling just now back to the other things in the Gulf hobbies

once again or the Muslim Brotherhood once again Qatar\nQatar which is supporting terrorism all across the middle east or do we want the Muslim Brotherhood the profit from that saps my bottom line and

good\nMeantime Democrats are eager to keep the focus on health care in the final two weeks until election day but the president has spent the past twenty\nFour hours on the loading on this migrant caravan which began its travels\nAs a group of now eight thousand um the caravan reached temperature will in Mexico on Monday about eleven hundred miles from a gallon Texas and it continues to strike north towards the southern border\nBut the Democrats they want to keep the focus on health care because uh the polling shows that as the number one issue on people's mind and joining us now to try to understand why health care is such an important issue and is on so many people's minds during the upcoming election and beyond\nIs my good friend del balance to is the\nExecutive director and founder of liberty health share now ah my self and my family have been proud members of liberty health share forget this seven years\nIt is the best thing we have ever done you know all the healthcare debate we have to debate it and we talked about it and ah we analyze it for you on the air but I'm not personally involved in it because my family got out of this a long time ago we got out of the whole\nObamacare healthcare rat race and we went to liberty health share which the services phenomena oh this is a great organization where it's different because everybody shares in their own cost of health\nThose members and it is growing every day is the best kept secret in America and I urge all of my listeners now if you worked for the federal or state or county government\nCo pay that's fine but if you're an independent contractor where you worked in the gig economy are you on a ten Ninety nine or you work for small companies like we have and we can't we can't buy the insurance we can't even put aside of businesses do expensive or you're a business owner any of those things\nThen liberty health share in the nominal opportunity for you and as I said my family of three and I've got a fourteen year old he not only was seven\nAnd it's just it's the greatest players like paying cash\nIt's easy to do the services great uh everything gets done they need to do shit everything on your behalf you're not there is no paperwork there's no paper work it just pick up the phone I mean you send them to stop you send them to bill that's it\nAnd you get all the pre emptive a chair and all that\nBut uh you you got to check it out to go to liberty how's your dad or check it out ask for a quotation that's all it you got to be shocked by it because you're going to say now this too good to be true there's gotta be catch there's no catch joining us now to help understand what is going on today in health care with this debate\nExecutive director founder of Libya he'll share their bill is hey do\nSuch a pleasure to be with you John thank you for the invitation\nYou because I'm a true believer Dale when you believe in something it's really easy to talk about it because I'm not only a believer I'm a customer and\nI have been for a very long time\nAnd we wouldn't [noise] three different you know the other day if if I get some readers came to me and said hey ah showing or whatever it is you know organize care you man or something like two hundred that's out there because it's a hassle LA's\nAddition to that we band together as you've just said to paint each other's medical bills on the basis of our shared values and beliefs but we also stimulate one another to leave to lead healthy lives\nBut the reason why there's such satisfaction in America about health care today that's why it's at the top of people's discussion western concern lists as we come into this mid term election that is because we don't have a health care system in America John we should\nCare system the only time a doctor is when you're sick and we got to change that and we stimulate one another encourage each other we welcome folks\nWith conditions of that by just simply add exercise diet or control their wives who were you versus diabetes and heart disease and high blood pressure certainly obesity\nWe help people stop smoking we're focused\nOn taking care of our health and that's what we've got to get back to focus on the stand\nThat health care is really about the care of our house and that's what we're ...\nGood [laughter] that's right\nAnd so I'm pulling this can be drawn because we do we welcome folks with those conditions\nThey just have to come to change their lifestyle at a recent survey came out from the two days ago and the New York times just indicated that the city is as bad or if not worse than smoking\nAnd if people would simply engaging simple\nExercise every day it would change their lives reduced their weight and certainly reduced their skin profile for the future and that's what we're doing we're just simply saying look let's let's\nTake care of our bodies these are precious gifts one better could we invested in folks set aside money for retirement plan their entire lives let's make some plans to preserve her health or into the future or ... and and that's the\nInteresting because I mean the whole objective joining liberty hill share and you know you have to do is get a quotation is going to liberty how's your dot org liberty house or a guard or it's over there or you can call eight five five five eight by quoting three seven\nEight five five five five four to three Seventy get yet on the whole government thing\nBut the best thing about it is it is it's a plan to stay healthy it's not a plan to go there when you say now obviously you become sick have problems you know we've we've all had them I've certainly had them over the Indian for months and I've been with\nA with the with LA just but uh the object is to stay healthier and it permeates your whole family I mean it's held my wife even my fourteen year old\nRight is on a regimen of eating better and you know we you know jump to get it all works out every day plays baseball all that stuff and so you find out if you do these things you're frequency of visiting doctors goes way down and that's the object of it right\n[noise]\n... is our from town hall dot com hot Patrick boss

your price to show\n'em but we should also understand that this would not be surprising to many people are this is something that I you know [noise] well I don't travel to Saudi Arabia or other parts

that's done and then they flipped five seats Montana\nNorth Dakota Missouri Florida and Indiana so there's plus five if you win Wisconsin that could be plus six\nCord the rally last night the

your point\nMy point is do we really need to believe anything that the president because he told us actually going to do so now what do I need to believe what\nWas the only way to go he didn't say that he didn't say that\nMexico would build a wall he said that he would build a wall and Mexico would pay for it and the way they would pay for it is by the tariffs and renegotiating NAFTA which would bring more money\nCongress to give them the funding you need the money is there and being ... by renegotiating the disastrous NAFTA deal which has hampered us ... workers manufacturers and

those taxes will start to get paid biting growing tax base in two thousand Nineteen there's about a one year lack so I'm not worried at all about it\nUh-huh okay\nWell I mean I guess if you would ever whenever you take your time I guess you're probably not worried about it because I don't believe anything\nWell I'm certainly not worrying about the thing that's a matter of fact\nThat's a mess that that that is an absolute mess that was a slap in the face a bike NBS to President Trump and to the administration that is shown him tremendous good will they look the other way I'm of a lot of the

understand they want to crash the border and just to mention that do the United states\nAnd governor has you know the loopholes are such that once they stepped foot in one of those what all over the border or hands are tied and we can't hold them for over twenty days and they have to be really so what happens\nAnd the Emirates and Yemen's civil war a and yet the senators yet my colleagues to come down on this one way or the other support it or not is is that\nBeing in a different way governor\nSo I think Congress certainly has a role to play in American foreign policy we we don't talk about a lot so commentators have said that they they really don't get\nThat it's all up to the president and the executive branch I don't think that's the way the constitution works I think our foreign policy is conducted by the by the president but certainly broadly made an influence through Congress also so uh the point is it's a legitimate to go to the Congress and have that conversation but they have a limit the power\nTo do that so many things but frankly the they can set a standard that Congress can set a standard if they choose to want to say goodbye to Yemen but kitchen but everybody is listening ... take a look at ... really is and it said on the southern part of the Arabian Peninsula\nSo if you have Iran to the north and they are so many English a revolution and the civil war down in Yemen\nYou get is Saudi Arabia flanked on more snow than south or they can't put up with that and that's why they're trying to defend themselves\nA war is always horrible particularly third world country the humanitarian impact is awful [noise] uh but they make the decision about how they think that they have to protect the country and that that's really what's going on so the point is they give me a conflict is more complicated first appears on depression\nI Want to get to in order to the un written just the other day and one of the things that you said in the piece you talked about the relationship we have with the Chinese and of course a lot of people and not need a lot of people are predicting that\nChina will eventually over the United states and economic power will be indebted to them they send you a little bit of a different take on that you want to share that with the audience governor\nYeah I'm just not pessimistic everybody the conventional wisdom in America these days is a bad goes on declining China's off\nAnd I just reject that I just don't agree with that at all I think the United states has the absolute advantage for the future we're the ones at least so far they have a three autonomy we're the ones who still have a free country that everybody looks to watch\nA little one is there and actually bring material benefits there are system\nThe Chinese have got a real problem on their hands and their problem is a modern society and the twenty first century they cannot continue to run an authoritarian government and yet that's their vision for the world that's their vision for China\nThat they're going to control the east in the western Pacific in eastern East Asia I got to control it and they're going to start carrying methods to do that\nIn fact just the concentration camps now in western China set up\nAgainst minorities this kind of brutality cannot blasted the twenty first century with the Internet modern the modern communication\nAnd ah and frankly are rising middle class in China they their problem is they're building their middle class which is a good thing but the middle class was not going to stay under communist dictatorship forever I Believe that the future belongs to the United states I Believe we're the ones who have\nAmerican Century or get\nA what about our debt a lot of people not getting concerned about the debt\nThe tax cuts of the president which I Know both you and I are very much in favor of it I think they feel this economy I've tried to tell\nOur listeners if you look historically a tax cuts and the effect they have in the economy in gross writing growth\nThan the main thing is is there was a lag between when the tax cuts take effect when revenue increases to actually out things\nWhy that was prior to the tax cuts so there's a lag the president also calling in his cabinet out of the blue and saying time to get out\nYour ... I Want to five percent cut from everybody across the board you can find it have a good day ... what do you think of that\nWell first of all what you're listening to from time to time go on my Web pages by non profit policy organization called American opportunity dot org American opportunity dot org and you'll see that over the years we've written about economic growth than we've written about foreign policy you alluded to\nA recent article that I wrote on foreign policy of extra rich six\nAnd we also have some people writing all some Chinese issues about other issues like that they're on our Web page American opportunity dot org\nBut one of our oldest position that we've done in our organization the growth code which is decide at the time that that the last was in charge of the country and the wages were not growing it people were not working on a wire it was\nGross love and we proposed if there'd be a policy of tax cuts for economic growth well that's been done\nAnd you know the whole point is this how do you get a get out of here you are going to have to raise taxes in order to finance the debt or you're going to have to grow in order to create more revenue to build a bigger pot but at the end of the day ... good good increase revenue if you just spend the same revenue again if you if\nYou're a is a gross by the million dollars each than spend a billion and a half you're still on the show at the end of the day we have some major just she was talking about how we're going to spend our money right now we're basically a moving in the left is trying to move us in the direction of socialism which is a transfer of money from one pockets\nOf the other but at the end of the day there's no limit to that and that increases the dead\nAnd furthermore drives out money that's going to be absolutely essential for the coming conflicts of the twenty first century in our military spending is going to be absolutely necessary I research are are developed like a science or these things and also have to be pushed quote shall we have a lot of priorities and good governance and good executive leadership there will be just\nA good irrational leadership they're going to be necessary to help the time that spending\nSo um we can't tournaments because the president has made that promise on multiple times that was part of his economic platform he said I have a deal the deal is a you've paid into Social Security\nThat represents what over fifty percent of the budget right right right there ah he's not going to cut military spending you know now so when you when you look at a five percent cut across everything else discretionary spending you know you're not talking about trillions of dollars are you\nWilling Joel desire the American conservative is they actually do an inventory\nOf a show where we're spending money and then have a policy discussion are real political discussion committed there and campaign for elections or otherwise as to what we're spending our money on and what we have to spend their money [noise]\nBut once they get real sure and that is if you increase taxes you reduce economic activity each year increase taxes\nYou reduce economic activity it me and that's the approach to the left their goal is to simply go for the bucks and grab the money for anybody they can get up and they use in their cage quote they're rich quick but I can promise you your job based upon all the numbers I've ever seen\nIn order to pay this debt into paying for this government if\nIt's going to be a socialist you're\nGotta go into the middle class and get that money you just have\nTwo and a conservative don't believe in that we believe people keep it as much of their own money as they can that's why I ran for governor I pushed the car tax cut and that's what the goal is the goal is to give people more control over their keep more of their own money back to the Republican conservative my truck\nAnd that's where we have to try to do for the future\nGovernor Jim Gilmore that is a great analysis of where we are today that's why I Love having gone\nSo refreshing thanks for your time sir paper more information you can go to the governor's website American opportunity dot org American opportunity dot org that Jim Gilmore website and where you're going to get a sober salient cogent analysis\nOf world affairs how's that Governor coach they're gonna sail you ought to be a little more flamboyant\nNext up stakes radical stuff\nYou ever get on the John Ritter he's written a number and\nWe're on the same page on the to show you you got to be something that\nThe fact that this was done in a conflict it it is an embassy look you either have international world order or you don't\nAnd for all mine Trump listeners out there we all screaming about sovereignty writes you ... you know what a one world government you know one one world order you want sovereignty well if their sovereignty that means is countries and if there's countries\nThere has to be an international order otherwise there's world chaos\nAnd one of the international lawyers are if you walk into an ever see it's supposed to be safe\nAnd sacrosanct not you get your head chopped off and put in a barrel in the garden right that just doesn't that just doesn't work and a and B. and B. S. it's got to theirs\nJoin you behaving this way and it's coming quicker rather than later in my judgment surround the same page on that it's actually governor\nOr any you know what I'm Talking about this word as any other\nCountry this would have been between countries\nBut now he has tarnished the reputation of the president's family simply guilt by association I personally believe the time has come to deliver a very strong actually\n[noise] and a lot a slap on the rich this are the kinds of say where the Saudis have to basically learn\nThat what they're doing it harms not only their reputation harms harms their own country that also harms the interest of the United states of America or I wouldn't start very much fighting made it clear the Saudis think war is over they have to wrap it up\nSo I Would certainly but trying to take whatever actually put it against the people directly involved\nAll went up to the similar to stay on the real world we're not going to take personal actually against Mohammed bin Laden I Believe but certainly enough for people in his inner circle that this or that hurts\nNot even the commentary that they buy so much from us that we need them badly on is not a good narrative the real narrative is the subtleties need much more than we used to have\nA it's not a\nWhat's the word I'm looking for it's not a one way streets and the Saudis have been some of the United states is really quite considerable they can't go to somebody else\nTo buy weapons because I think they can\nBut it means that makes me break with us their own military comes to a screeching halt within within days because we provide all the square parts we provide American companies in American technicians provide most of the maintenance of supervision\nAnd the skills and it's I mean as I said I don't believe the selling the military could stay functional beyond a few weeks maybe a month or two without a direct American support so\nWe have the upper hand there's no doubt in my mind we have the upper hand ah it also looks like the Europeans are going to start selling a luxury equipment for the salaries\nAre so that leaves them with the Russians are the only other viable place to go and I'll tell you I wouldn't want to be in countries like Saudi Arabia these tend to on the Russians from I think it would take five years to basically stand\nSo it's reaction to a very simple we saw from the Canadian foreign minister very minor\nRelations between the rational actor on that's\nThe other great of course is that if\nYou know so much damage to the ruling family is jails or their wealth and so forth was justified made him popular but at the same time he has made so many enemies [noise]\nDomestically but on the street [noise] [noise]\nSo um is your bathroom by the way so everyone knows you're on the John Stewart is radio network we are when former cutter United States ambassador petri heroes he is now the president of the U.S cut her business council\nSo you mentioned the word Mr Ambassador incompetent or the first one that said that I've got it written down because I think that\nReally sum this up you know a lot of the things that NBS it's gotten involved in um have not been successful whether the the way he's conducting ... Yemeni civil war which I think\nAh even supporters of that would say it's been a disaster on every possible level\nThe um the blockade he did with Egypt Bahrain and the Emirates against a guitar has been a total colossal failure it's almost a comedy show\nBecause uh the country of cutting the state of\nCutter is much better off economically and otherwise and they were before the blockade and all the men is that the Saudis aren't getting any of their business I mean it was really a complete catastrophe\nI mean if you if you went to Harvard Mr bathroom toilet a business class on the international relations how to do a blockade inhabit blow up in your face that would be your classmates Lester\nSo every day the guy gets involved in a blows up at what point does bother saying you know maybe he's just not equipped\nWell [noise] there may not be in a situation where you actually call the shots when we moved the embassy\nTo Jerusalem and this was too much [noise]\nBut that may be important [noise] she was no longer period you could actually stand [noise]\nBut I just sort of a sense of all the other thing would be or the foreign minister\nThe fact that so many people now his son and we were the exploding in retaliation personal retaliation and like I said he couldn't very well get married [noise] have the power\n[noise] [noise] [noise]\n[laughter] that's kinda the complicating factor the fathers are\n\nCalculations\nMisery not sure how it was just going to affect the balance of power in the middle east especially you know the Iranian\nIranians must be absolutely speechless after good luck\nOn this one or not you know I imagine what the Iranians are going to let this one playing out personally further undermining the physician of Saudi Arabia\nAre these are the Iranians position now are they able to say you shouldn't have done away with the nuclear agreement to the gym see the lake and you know what he's doing favoring somebody was much more than anything we've done\nI mean that's an arguable question but right now the Saudis are made the headline stuff yeah [noise]\nI played on the negative headlines\nOr so for example in really a question of sending it out I think they should be able to play the propaganda part of the war would [noise] probably began to work really well\nAnd the mountains of any residual support there might have been put the Saudis in Yemen War are just going to you're\nGonna just go away or the other big winner on this with the Turks is now going to be able to show that comes with the salaries for what what's the word I'm looking for a for [noise]\nIn the mastery of that part of the world and they are not going to the disposition\nProud to stand up to him so all in all in oh\nHere's a lose lose for the Saudis all around and it's unless we really forcefully and it's a lose lose for us as well we do need to put the Saudis place can make sure the Saudis understand who they really are they are not the country the calling the shots for the United states\nOf America or if you're either either were calling the shots or no one's calling the shots but they're not the ones calling for us [noise] and so I I feel very strongly\nThat we need to\nYou know there's some stand up and say this is not you know this is simply intolerable conduct it affects our interests certainly try to assist the president's brand\nOr no matter how you slice it right now in\nSo how did you get out of this the way you can get out of this is by making it clear\nTo\nMe is very clear that this is not acceptable of course of action\nOr how does this tell the court ruling just now back to the other things in the Gulf harbors if Congress position and the blocking\nAnd the position that the administration has taken on that would be any change in that will be looking at it differently than the biggest military base that we have in their right but I don't know how", "show_name": "Red Eye Radio", "year": "2018", "city": "Portsmouth", "day": "24"}
