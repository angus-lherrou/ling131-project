they've announced starter yet you know a show for it for the Yankees but it's probably going to end up [noise] ah either um I I'm thinking maybe there it's going to be to knock I actually find out [noise]\nAnd uh [noise] look I think he's all end up winning but what it is we've got more pressing style frankly in sports right now with the cabinet nominations part of the\nSame tactic humongous ... what they reorient access to the U.S [noise] I guess you'd call the U. S. M. C. A. now Rachel I'm lucky but here's another guy came in every one last\nBut um do you think she made this up do you think this was like an actress type thing or is it something happened to her but not tough enough\nI don't know what happened to her but I have no idea if something happened to her in the courts have already what she willing to do this on our city of trying to take a man and destroy your life based on [noise]\nSome incident like this where she did not have any core operating\n[noise] and willing to do this and be politicized upon the also when you look at the lawyers she hired coordinated with Diane Feinstein you look\nAttractive she scrubbed all her social for social media I think the liar I didn't feel I don't want to get into it didn't it didn't and I don't think apple cabin there but I I Believe our cabin out over there\nWhy she's like well yeah if that's the definition of it I Believe it to you you brought something up that we never really talked about on my show we talked about not knowing how she got there how she got home what the house was in ... consistency\nBut you know the lie detector tests that was kind of garbled or because you didn't know where she took it how it was done what the results were who paid for it\nI mean that didn't check out either that that whole thing seemed I'm a little odd to me\nUm I also want to expand on who's in college you said earlier that Susan Collins is the kind of in this whole debate here is kind of an unsung hero I'm a fan of Susan Collins I'm a big fan of hers everybody knows that don't always agree with her\nI didn't know yeah I'm a big fan of you know yeah and I and and\nI don't always agree with her uh she's she's a moderate but I've always found her to be a very honest and very honest politician I mean she tells you the truth and she's she also happens if you bump into in the hallway or something and she is super nice but\nUh you you said she's kind of the the the young son champion here why you know when did that in some detail\nBecause from my understanding from two Senate staffers wondering ... Sherry committee\nOne of the senator's office not hers and also from one of the leaders [noise] one of them are one of the groups that snowing most powerful and important work on the nomination\nTotally get clemency board allegations are like oh why came out she was approached by Murkowski I don't know anything about like oh I Know it worked out [noise]\nOne more cows initially wanted this nomination poll\nShe would have gone far too for the laying of spaghetti and you even saw Murkowski [noise]\nWhen she was in the calls the price it out or what are what why don't we have an FBI identifications cause or she was I don't know why [noise] Suzanne Collins said to them calls from the very beginning when I go along with that said that one\nShe wants to confirm break\nInto she didn't agree with the way this process of these allegations were coming out she had argued ... Murkowski [noise] about it and that should also show you what profile in\nCourage when what we use all Murkowski is when it comes to when she felt so strongly about that\nCollins had gone out with her as well because they're both females and wants to\nTake a call in show in here and I found a lot of problems with her um although I you know maybe in hindsight I don't anymore because of the day he died she didn't want to play the genitalia cars and she white tapping look she look here's the other thing that Merkel here's the other thing and they keep saying well\nDetroit won't get that power will and get him from the president would have only one choice if he polls if he polls cabin now it would be a dominant power\nAimed right\nFor because people like me who are calling for power from the beginning because [noise] the way she Feinstein had already attacked her\nAnd her life\nI Would say you know you you gave us ... you know what I mean we would have said I we heard from the smartest people in the room with her from the road [noise] although I Know Don McGahn really pushed cabin up through we've heard from everyone\nYou know and you have to be this book she no no no no you're giving us what we want now and he would have been amenable to that the president [noise] so I think she was also sang to Murkowski that she was confident wait what year Scots are Calvin now in terms of roe v Wade even with the job so\nShe wanted to look at the Robie ways\nYou telling me when the state is going to make calls over abortion illegal and Robie way would be overturned and then we'll say can you know that that was never\nBeen out for them to see him that one so I'm really looking for whether you're taxing that will never happen\nAnd it's it's really a strong argument but I agree with you a hundred percent on Kavanaugh as it relates to even kill me I was also in favor of made me ... that was my first choice and just like be careful what you wish for right\nBecause if something happens that when the Kavanaugh nomination goes down\nDon't you agree with me now President Trump will nominate Coney Barrett the following day\nI Would hope so I think we should nominate or even during the next day you could see that you have hopefully the next\nVacancy comes that steer yeah but she she should be under what just happened now is what's you're talking about though he is a very good nominee yeah he's very young and the president will have nominated with him I Believe right now in sixty three and I believe course of course just like ... I I forget the job of course it\nMakes me want on the list that you want to you like fifty\nThe one okay so you know better than me and then you can get our economy must do you have just eat already remake the bench for Thirty years so I so I think that but I think that you should be the next nominee I think that [noise]\nBut I think that lucky I'm I think the president has really played this well I like the fact that the president look I'll be the first one to tell everyone that sometimes Donald Trump believe it or not play three dimensional chess\nSometimes sometimes when you hear people on like on a on a certain networks day you understand you clean playing chess you're just playing checkers I'll walk because I've been there\nFour or five days [noise] materialize out [noise] and then he started it started attacking the process [noise] profit sorry about that that was smart in some states are very good about\nThis I'm sure\nWe Saturdays off to the cabinet [noise] old dishes to where we don't get it out through\nAfter all this we will lose the Senate the one thing is it is showing up in all polling Republican [noise] becoming more engaged now and they are furious about this [noise]\nWell I think it's going to backfire on the Democrats because\nWell ah there's nothing that you and I for Steve Bannon or Corey Lewandowski or anybody else that's part of the Trump now for camping or political action committees or anything else nothing we could have done\nTo motivate Trump voters more than the Democrats have done with this tavern a clown shall I mean people and I talked to are coming out of the woodwork they're pissed off\nAnd they're going to turn out\nOn November six and I think as a result of that\nThe Republicans are going to win and when Nancy Pelosi wakes up on November seventh and she's not speaker you know she sent a Jew blame Dianne Feinstein for this whole mess that's what's going to happen\nSam I've only got a couple of seconds make your prediction\nWill the cabin no vote be delayed for a week or more\n[laughter] I think it's going to be really for the seven days I think that's so whatever that comes hopefully by the [noise] the what was sort of I think I think that what makes you think that also the reason why because it's been a because of the Republican so upset about it and file\nAll right so it's going to be a week and that would be a this coming friday and then again next\nWeek me on that we got out of it we have our justice kind of an on the bench for the Yankees Astros playoff\nNo well I have to talk about that first they have to get by Oakland though in the front was Oakland is if you're traveling in the fifth inning they get like Nineteen closures on [laughter] that's the problem\nAll right Sam Nunberg thanks for being with us by the way semi seemed wiser for check this out citizens for the American republic this is Steve Bannon's brand new pack and uh he's got salmon they're making some hey so Sam\nThanks for being with us men thank you sir and my best to your puppy [laughter]\nSeems dog Winston John springs radio network group your rights\nText hardcore All right\nSo I don't know what's going to happen the next week here or what we do know is that the FBI is going to do another background check and it's like kind of like a rock till exam and puts scope up there see what's going on and so is that six of these nominees number seven I don't know what they're going to find out\nThe FBI understand ABC News re ports that they're talking to a different room here because we don't know if that's true because the fake news are so that might be true it might not\nYou know you used to get a news report from ABC NBC CBS or Washington Post you make your tops or whatever you know some major outlet Chicago Tribune things like that\nMiami Herald you'd get a news report\nAnd you don't know whether to believe it or not now except for the Associated Press a pie that's probably the last thing and probably if you're in if you're traveling international algae era right other than that if you're in the U.S Eighteen\nI trust the people to come into the AP wire abide anything else I don't know some ABC says\nThe FBI is meeting with Debbie Ramirez than [noise] five of her friends [noise] I don't know if that's true if they made it up do you have any idea they make all the stuff I\nMean I just put up an interview I did with Lara Trump and uh it's a pretty good piece but\nI'll tell you what I remember during the campaign\nThe Trump campaign NBC News reported that the Trump campaign pulled out of Virginia you remember that that they pulled out of Virginia fake net and it was fake nobody called me I was the chairman when he called her being out he was the\nDirector and nobody called the Trump campaign they just\nYou know Corey Stewart leaked the whole story after he got fired and NBC just went with it because of their narrative that the Trump campaign was falling apart\nAnd they were pulling out of the battle cry on stage and I went on thirty seven interviews and five days and still could stop it I remember my son in Reno\nCollege professor jak at the University of Nevada calling me up three days later and saying hey what happened to campaign in Virginia I heard you guys pulled out did they fire you that's what my sunset I'm like I don't know tell you're talking about\nOh I just saw him over the Las Vegas NBC News scroll on the bottom of my TV screen it's unbelievable fake news so you don't know what's lying what's truth ... you don't know that's the problem [noise]\nEight eight eight for eight oh John and I had just gotten off the phone with Eric Trump who committed to several million dollars when he needed in Virginia\nThey committed to the vice president coming to northern Virginia on Saturday the president coming on Sunday doesn't sound like you're pulling out of a ...\nOf course not\nPlus we got to to help me into the Dallas Robert Johnson\nWas all on\nThe phone lines for you know John ... sounds like you're on the air\nHey Johnny hey did you watch ... debate between them story and [noise]\n\nUm I did not know\nOkay a reason why I saw it on Facebook or they got a little clip on store a Facebook\nPage I assume that he asked a he said you know walk to release the names of of the senators and congressmen who who paid off their shoes or ...\n... yeah\nAnd so he says that and then they cut it off our response to that\nAnd I wish they would have kept it out because that that would tell you a lot\nAbout it off it's dumb it's a dumb question because uh you can't do that is illegal\nSo that can only be that can that that can't get done that can only be done by the that committee so that can't be done like like teen can't release those right\nNow that that can only by law right that can only be released by the full congressional committee so they wouldn't have to vote on to tend to have anything to do with it so that's a that's a dumb question\nBut couldn't even say that he wants he writes that released\nSure but he's not on the community I can say I want to release also but that's about all the way up north ... that\nCame out here in ... that that would put some pressure on the\nToday show I guess you know so there may be Cory yet [noise] thirty nine percent to thirty six percent I mean [laughter] who cares\nYou know I I just I don't care about that later response\nThat's good to know that you know that he couldn't do nothing but I still think that if it's if we started putting some pressure I mean if if it started getting out and everybody started demanding man I think there will be forced to or\n... and let the chips fall where they may just hear me some Republicans in there too but just let the chips fall where they may let's let's bring out the hope that was our morning\nI agree I agree\n'cause there's no one else up under ... were you thinking about what they're what\nDo you think about the terminal here waiting about like\nOh man who doesn't you know they got some garbage and that guy [noise]\n\nYou'd think and the one the one beer threw me off to that came out of nowhere she only had one beer like hey look man I've watched so many cops shows where\nWhere they pulled it got out a poet guy over and say how many peers stuff I don't have water and he gets on the stump hundred bar never say one beer because when you say one beer to me having five or six\n[noise] I mean\nThis and that or whatever the the one thing got me I\nI mean you're going to go back [noise] thirty seven years to a party that you can't remember how you got there I got home where it was what housing was one of the house who had the party wire at the party who you are but you can remember going in the party thirty seven years ago and that you have exactly one beer\nLike the question should have been well what type of beer was michelob Miller PBR I mean can you tell me that like what was it in the bottle or can\nWas it in a glass of a draft like what white beard where was the beer was it a let's see where were you can advocate\nWasn't any wind gold or a Schaffer [noise] did you go into shape for the shape for circle was it about time goes you're older beers in New Jersey New York and Connecticut that are now probably out of business when I grew up\nWas it a Valentine within ...\nOnce said or what they are and how hard it was\nOkay who gave me that wind who get up here like did you take it out of a cooler or did somebody handed to you I mean if you give if he can remember that you only had one beer\nI Would think you could remember all the details of that here was a beer warm or cold water or back not thirty seven years ago and I don't even think they had a light beer\nSo what what type of deal with it I mean\nIt was quite a shock to go to get out of a quiet exactly or you know I I'd probably\nRemember Thirty years not going to a party where I didn't have any [noise]\nI I mean if you ask anybody in America go back thirty seven years to a party tell me how many beers you track like why one\nDoor gr got me I mean there's somebody could do that I don't know how many ... why I didn't know if it had beer maybe you had you know apple cider Spicer south the hell knows I mean it's the whole thing but that's our\nBut up until then under the impression that she was drunk she was a Fitzgerald drawn this party [noise] you know that's what ever happened after that happened after that that was a question that everybody you're also with us here one beer that's yeah\nSo so I mean that right there I think we should do there should be a Las Vegas should get on a what type of beer was and probably the top five with the I guess blood wiser hops because you didn't remember\nYou're in Connecticut but you kind of federal Ritchie place but they don't know what place it was so maybe the kids got it and they probably what the cheaper so it could be\nAny of these five plug wiser tops

Republicans in the ...\nAnd you don't like you have any ... they can keep doing that but let me give it to you straight\nAbusive\nAnd so beyond the pale of what regular Americans believe is the right thing to do at the end of the day when you get rid of the partisans on both sides and you look at middle America the people who elected Trump they have a\nSense of fairness and they think what this man has been through all the polls are showing this is beyond\nThe scope and they were horrified by it\nSo I'm telling you that this controversy I Believe had woken Trump supporters and conservatives up that would have otherwise stay at home they don't like the Republican Party they don't like ... you know like any of the Republicans there are Trump supporters they believe in the sky\nBut they were not going to come out in the mid term they just they don't even know they don't care but you have little match under Trump voters like and I said just say that again there's nothing the Trump campaign could have done\nTo get these people out like the mistreatment that people are saying I'm Brett Kavanaugh and Josh homes to is the cheapest staff or Mitch McConnell said\nLooking at some point in it he tweeted out\nLooking at some poll numbers this morning it's impossible to overstate how important\nThe cabinet or hearings have been to voters it's like dropping a grenade into the electorate genes in red states are not gonna like these numbers they're all going down you know Americans have a sense of fairness and it cuts\nBoth ways it's not partisan if everything was flipped and the Republicans were doing this they would get punished by the electorate Americans have a deep sense of fairness that's why they reacted to the kids being separated from their families and\nAll that they don't like that Americans don't like unfairness they don't like people not treated well I mean it's it's the American way they don't like it and so just before the midterms they're experiencing that you cannot get away from the Kavanaugh\nHarry I Am snake has been our major topic the last three three weeks\nI don't even remember when I talked about something else so everybody is talking about that even people that are not involved in politics and there's a sense of fairness in this thing is going to blow up and the Democrats face like you've never seen it\nAnd there's going to be a predicted there's going to be a massive turnout of Trump supporters and Republicans and in the country\nOn the ... you're going to get the biggest percentage of voters turnout in these midterms than you ever had in that favors the Republicans are certainly going to keep the house and they're going to getting five or six seats\nSo they're going to keep doing it it's got to go on to the next week again\nAll next week\nAnd they have little match it's like there's a gasoline can that over somebody overturned and the Democrats took Amy Brooklyn matches with the book on fire and talk

for reelection for a third term that will be decided on them on November ...\nFor six his Democratic opponent Abigail Spanberger she will be joining us thirty on Thursday whatever that day he is the third or whatever anyway joining us now without further ado congressman\nDave Brat towns been good to have your tank at the galley good morning John oh I tell us about your big town hall meeting the other day\nYeah well that's good news right it's that makes the the personnel and small business taxes than you know a lot of other nice features permanent passed it in the house I go to the Senate the Senate slow moving so I don't know whether they get through it before the election\nUh but all the Democrats including Bernie were critical of our initial package and they you know went on the press and said hey you got to ... your favorite in the big corporations it's not fair you got to make this permanent for everybody and so we did and now they're nowhere can be found right so they they're just politic the\nDemocrats are just political always never policy and so now we did what they said they wanted and uh I don't think they're on board but we'll see we'll see we'll keep our fingers crossed that they want to see some economic growth for the country where we're getting a lot of new folks independence or and even some Democrats to take a look at the Republican\nParty not because they're feeling\nIt in their business than their family income in their pocket books the average family getting over two thousand dollars back in the kids are getting jobs and there's more job openings than there are people thinking right now I mean it's just amazing that time that should be the story of two thousand Eighteen\nOr with the mainstream media of course has other objectives been reporting the news\nAnd die instead they're just attacking one party instead of the other\nWell certainly the a cabinet fiasco has dominated the news congressman now you're not in the Senate obviously so you're not a decision maker on that you were in the house but look everybody is watching it everybody has some thoughts on it\nOr you want to share your thoughts on that uh where the processes now\nYeah we'll just go in and the last few days I mean like kind\nOf threw a curve ball when he said you were going to move on and have the boat and so now the Democrats were asking to delay and have the FBI look at it and the FBI can't form conclusions and so that you know the most troubling part is the\nSenate is tasked by the constitution with doing\nThe oversight and the advice and consent ... not the FBI the Senate job to do that\nAnd they had all these documents for six weeks and the senators didn't do their duty not advise and consent and so at the very end of the new documents come out\nMissing there you know I Wish they would ask them why did you ask any you could ask any of these questions you call the documents for the last six weeks and instead they're just you know trying to push a past election for Strategic advantage\nI mean look whenever they whenever the FBI comes out next week I Know the Democrats going to ask for another delay\nA but it'll be interesting to see if the FBI she finds anything um you know they've investigated him his background six times let me let me ask you something you've been criticized congressman by the Democrats\nAre on the VA saying that you voted no I I Want you to respond to this that you actually voted in opposition to the VA into military spending when you voted against one of the budget and you've been criticized by that by the spanberger team\nSaying look you're saying you are back in the VA you're backing the military but when push came to shove you voted no on that how do you respond to that congressman\nYeah well I mean that's just you know simple politics that most of the people don't follow this stuff to do just that they could be anyone wants to go look I've always voted for the military plus up that's all we want\nTo write the Democrats won't do that and in order to get the budget last year we plug up the military and nothing else that's the house budget that I voted for and at the end of the year in order to get a budget the Democrats insisted that\nWe plus ... government spending on the social side by four hundred billion dollars the military blocked up was Seventy\nBillion and social science plants up and everything else in the in the mix was four hundred billion dollars the tax cuts also for example where a hundred and fifty billion dollars they're paid for it now if you're growing it three and a half they're totally paid for and the four hundred billion the Democrats wanted and guy and that we should\nNot have allowed to happen I just goes on to the kids\nRight there that debt is Twenty one trillion and so we're trying to preserve a principal a bunch of states ... plus except plugging up the military [noise] certain democratic\nCritique is exactly wrong as always right they're trying to say I vote against the military you know the whole point is if you keep plugging up the social spending you won't have any money for the military [noise] and so it's very clever trick that's what the Democrats do because they cannot\nTell the truth I'm piloting mhm and you know get the spanberger campaigns they the curiosity there's no one knows what she's running on I I I seriously don't know what she's running out she came all went on health care and then when she\nFound out the price tag would you know thirty two trillion and would double our tax rate and she backed off of health care and then you know I I don't know what else I mean\nShe's against the tax cuts she said they were dangerous and so what is she for an immigration she won't name an upper bound\nSo it just an open door to seven billion people open borders I Know she's for sanctuary cities\nI don't get it I I don't I don't know what she's running and so if you ever have around after you know we everybody would love to know and she won't even put a full biography and on the on the campaign website it's fairly shocking [noise]\nWell I'll I'll ever on a thirty AM on Thursday and\nI Will ask her just that also or were trying to get the debate date worked out the debate that we're sponsoring and between yourself and Abigail I'm Still trying to get that day that I should get that in the next couple of days I'm told by a both of your campaign managers\nDave I Want to ask you about something you put up the other day you said that and they are in the mail or that is a promoting the spanberger campaign that\nYour kids found something in your mailbox for somebody had written on a on the mail or Dane a rod in hell and you turn it over to\nThe authorities and your kids founded it says right in the hell Dave I'm\nWhat it was turning over I mean did you actually feel at risk or did you think that something might comment that\nWell we we don't know if someone puts rotten how on your door ... I'm ... years later it's not a good\nNatured bank right so if you have kids at home and you get some are putting palm card from the right on your door yes everybody has turned concerns these days that whether it's you know heated political rhetoric\nAnd that and so of course\n... in hell yeah that I wouldn't I wouldn't think that would be a fun thing to find on your door so um\nIt's it's it's not\nI mean look I don't know why the spanberger campaign people keep doing this kind of stuff just just run his campaign\nRun on the issues you have your debates and one of the parties and it's going to win I don't know why there's [noise] you know you don't find that from the other side you know friend is from\nThe Davis campaign and I'm just pointing this out if you're spanberger supporter out there this is not helpful it's not helpful to your candidate is not helpful to anything it's just it's just horrible just run your campaign for their\nTheir their folks are stripping date brown bumper sign when we're giving big signs out they had people come in steel big science they say I I'm I signed up to put these up for days they stole sign\nThey take stickers off people's cars I mean just stay under science placed illegally all over the place we found this is a law enforcement candidate and\nShe doesn't follow the law and so that's a little striking right and so we do we follow the rules I always tell the the the kittens are folks at the door to always be on your back behavior always be positive to everybody you know negativity at all and\nIn your campaign would go to Abigail's home where she's got children and put Abigail rotten hell I just don't think they would do that and if they did they should get a minus for that\nBecause it's not it's not sending the right tone\nAnd I would just tell the spanberger people that are listening to me now just knock it off just run your campaign right I mean there's just not helpful all the stuff is not doing anybody any good whatsoever\nAnd it's really dumped so just stop it just write your campaign and if you will you're weird and that's again too but I Will go on right nobody's going to die\nSo just knock it off and run your campaign\nDave thanks for being with us he more information go to ... dot com Dave Brat dot com ... will be with us Thursday and thirty am hopefully this week we'll have a date or debate Dave

but almost\nEverybody I talk to him about infrastructure so I had one town I I Can't remember payment down there to me so but um [noise] or Victoria [noise] and I think it was a Victoria or one of the city managers you know come up to Maine and goes in Denver and say hey what's your biggest issue and\nHe sort of looked at me and he said sewer lines not replace since Nineteen oh wait I'm like you gotta be kidding me\nHe goes yeah it's not good [laughter] I said sewer lines that break 'em up I'm like oh my gosh that's crappy but [laughter] it's amazing to me the things that people are dealing

Canada they've open that up and for the district I mean that's just amazing [noise] um and I think that's what what I've been standing on the trail you may John is that\nThe farmers weren't screaming they should we believe that there has to be some short term pain for long term game [noise] um they they have supported Trump they should've at some point it's probably going to be too much to bear but they understood that they had been in her system for so long\nAnd they want free trade but they don't want subsidies they want to trade and I think free and fair trade as what we're looking at right now and I'm a military guy guy so I call it an F to tea right fear free and fair trade what we I think you're seeing\nThese promises being kept by the by the president [noise]\nAre at the ...
