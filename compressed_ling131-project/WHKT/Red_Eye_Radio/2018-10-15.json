I\nForget the name of the book I'll look it up in a minute I read the book I Can't\nI Can't remember the title of it but a whole big you know multi hundred page book about the incredible data operation of the Obama campaign right they went out there and they were using Facebook and they were using digital technology and they had you know all kinds of cool bells and whistles\nThat they were able to target voters right down to the individual level of course when Donald J Trump to sit became a huge scandal oh my God they ripped off on a private information but when Obama did it it was it's\nHuge great leap forward that that would assure the Democrats elect total superiority forever for the rest of the end of history [noise] um I expected a similar book and a similar investigation after the polling fiasco were all the polls got it so wrong\nLike well why don't you are not a word not a peep these posters that got it wrong and twenty sixteen you never seen a single word from them explaining how they got it wrong if they haven't explained how they got it wrong how\nCould they fix it answer they didn't [laughter] it is [laughter] what would you if you went into the supermarket\nAnd you bought a brand of ground hamburger meat and took it home and found the original rap and would you go back and buy more hamburger meat\nFrom that same store now I don't think so\nBut you're you're going on the you're going under presumption that holding companies in the pollsters\nAre trying to do with the gym in the poll and they just had bad or they had a near methodology was wrong that's that's your purpose of this conversation uh that's what we believed basically in two thousand sixteen right in December I changed my position now because we know better you know too much\nThat they do the methodology is wrong\nThey they do it wrong on purpose\nSo they can drive the narrative\nI mean look I saw it in Virginia with the Christopher Newport university poll that came out like a month before the Virginia election\nSaying that Trump was it thirty five percent would be probably Eighteen by Clinton there's no way we're going to lose by a team like the poll was done in a way to just spirit Trump\nPush poll narrative there's right then it was false methodology in order to in order to the spirit my entire Trump team of volunteers in Virginia you can't get people to knock on\nDoors on Sunday in a Saturday when they got other things to do when you see when critical Newport university is putting a poll out\nSaying that we're now Johnny read things that that's what they do know what\nThey're doing the doing it wrong they're taking these are junk polls polling with a purpose the purpose is to spirit the spirit stirs feared our side and suppress the boat suppress the enthusiasm suppress the vote suppress turnout\nAnd that's exactly what they're doing they that's why the articles they rather than being in the correct methodology they found the methodology the day before they conducted the polls [laughter] certainly go to suppress search results make it harder to find information about\nThe Trump the candidates [noise] Google is becoming useless I Do searches on Google I get the same story for three four five six\nPages [noise] used to be you'd get a whole bunch of different stories on a given topic or a given subject [noise] get a whole bunch of different search results I get the same same darn thing and it's all from the Washington Post in every newspaper that repeats the Washington Post service gives you the same story it's just ridiculous\nIt's fake news and it's now the polls and the state polls working in conjunction of the state polls put out a fake poll to driving a propaganda narrative and then the fake news picks it up and then propagate the fake pose with a fake news\nAnd all and they coordinated effort to drive down Republican enthusiasm and tell Trump voters hey look you're really too stupid to have a job anyway so stay home and have a beer\nI mean that's the purpose of these Curtis I talked to John McLaughlin and this all came clear to me maybe it was three days ago I what's today Thursday or friday Thursday\nI talked to John McLaughlin Sunday night right you and I go back with John I Know I go back within thirty five years I went to college within a in in in in in in New Jersey I ... I go back with the guys thirty five he shares\nI suggest I got your poll and you're ... you're saying that the generic spread between Republicans and Democrats right now is four percent\nCNN poll scattered at Thirteen percent I mean that's a that's a three hundred percent difference right that's what I make any sense to me tell me what is the difference between your poll and they're just explained to me John I call them and I'm certainly not layman's terms explaining\nHe said it's very simple I Do polling methodology based on likely voter turnout model based on two thousand sixty based on region right it's not ... waded in Los Angeles it's it's it's an authentic hole to getting from it\nAnybody that answered the phone\nDoesn't matter waited not waited and if you do your poll that way it's always going to skew democratic big\nAnd he said so they're pulling basically and an agenda narrative in mind as you said we're down by four or five [noise] and then he walked me through the court steps so I I mean I Believe the house right now is a toss up\nAnd the Democratic operatives that I talked to a week ago told me that the Republicans were going to win two hundred and three the Democrats were going to win two hundred and two there were thirty seats up for grabs\nAnd uh without attribution he said we need to win sixteen states and pillows he will be speaker on those thirty now that makes sense to me and I said to them what are the odds on it and he said fifty fifty so how do you do for me to sing at CNN saying\nThe Democrats are going to win sixties think how do you how do you do that\nWell\nWhat they're doing is uh is lying to the people again this is another [noise] I I always say that President Trump has exposed to\nSafety standards for the vehicles\nI Am

Warren\nNone of that could have happened without being shaped your act that set that up and you're the one that said you keep covering ... giving government this\nBut that's exactly what happened\nBut I had the same very strained conversation yesterday with the FBI because I can point quiet [noise] argue gathering information including suppressing some calls and of course he's butters market and that's without the setting\nAnd the answer for a second answer is yes there was an article about two or three years ago saying that they recorded Fifteen hundred of President Obama's don't call and then they minimize here which means next door to mark his name now but I order is it to tell when President Obama or President Trump is talking to a foreign leader your they're out\nOf their voices [noise] even if you minimize or you know a marked out the names that you can't tell her the voices are but we shouldn't be doing that we're listening to members of Congress his conversations were listening to journalist conversations there's this new women conversation and they record it\nAnd then they're out there and then the FBI can search this database without a jacket is Warren\nAnd my point him was in I think he didn't understand it or didn't understand it is [noise] if you're recording things on potential terrorists from overseas the cost of government role in your car\nBut if they're talking to Americans who are just random people are talking to America and we do get constitutional protections because many of the phone call our discussions with terrorists in fact the vast majority are innocent international phone calls\nAnd so we have had this discussion written down and uh it should be protected by the costumes [noise] some say the Fourth Amendment John Adams says the

wanted to say the government and never come into your house or take in private conversations are belonging without talking to a drug stores\nWell and that's a that's why you were so adamantly opposed to when you were a predictor of the future when this whole thing senator\nYou've also been a very strong placed on the disappearance of\n... to show the there's a lot of talk about what should be done and we want more information and like I get that but as a member of the Foreign Relations committee you're the only senator that has proposed action which isn't to get answers on his disappearance

the\nFragments of the bombs are saying you know America and so we have to realize that reaction there's action\nAnd that's a blowback from us being involved in some ... gotten the civil war or is one that we actually create more terrorists but here's the other possible thing that's going to\nHappen again or what happened in Libya when we toppled Gadhafi we got chaos in more terrorism it became a breeding ground for terrorism my fear is that there is some remnants fairly fairly strong remnants of alligator India I mean we're not fighting them that were mistook his stricter\nCivil war between the ... and the Saudis and also with um rainy and influence as well but my fear is they're going to sense into chaos\nAnd that you get the rise of al ... the same thing happened in Syria that civil

America\nCenter pull the president has invested a lot of political capital in the Saudis that was the first place that he went in his first foreign visit a NBS came to the United states he did as a
