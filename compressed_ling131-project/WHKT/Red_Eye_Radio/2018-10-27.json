important [noise]\n\nThere's one Godzilla the truth and that to me it's great to have you with us today with a fake news regarded again with state polls coming at you all over the place they make these polls up to drive a fake narrative don't believe that it's the same thing they did it two thousand sixteen they're doubling down there one of the press\nKnow I just I I don't know if there's some crazy person is doing it but it just seems awfully odd to me\nHere's the thing is the Democrats the Schumer is the the whole crowd that whole mob over there there were screaming\nWe must have the FBI investigate before we can vote on Kavanaugh there must be a full investigation before we can vote on him before we can decide whether he should uh be you know didn't send to the Supreme Court right\nThe same mob they're saying we must have an FBI investigation before we can let that happen\nThey're not even waiting for the FBI to investigate were these bombs are coming from before they start blaming President Trump declared President Trump guilty responsible for the whole thing they're not waiting for the FBI to investigate the same people the three weeks ago said we cannot do anything until the FBI finishes its investigation\nSo I mean they were total hypocrites it is absolutely irresponsible or beyond counterproductive it's it's absolutely you're responsible for them to be saying this is all about because of President Trump or they're they're trying they're trying to score political points off this which\nYou have to ask who benefits from these bombs that's all I'm not saying who did it it it's obviously some crazy person because no sane person insane as bombs or fake bombs through the mail we don't know the bombs are real are fake or\nThey emptied out some firecrackers put it in a in a in a toilet paper two and a a attached to a digital watch to it to make it look like a scary thing we don't all the time when we in time it's easy to scare people what can I tell you\nWe don't know and I'm not going to go down that road what I can say is whoever did it is crazy in one way or another whether they're sort of fire bleed can be committed to ending\nAnd the normal people well adjusted people don't do that okay by definition\nPat Buchanan has a column today Barry makes the point that when John Kennedy was assassinated Lee Harvey Oswald who defected to the Soviet Union was pro Cuba\nOr he was found to be the shooter or yet who got blamed for the John birth society and all the conservatives so\nThis is not the first time that the guilt by association or let's let let's slammed the conservative let's blame everything on conservatives not the first time it's been done before we even know who actually sent these packages so\nIt's a everybody's got to calm down take a breath and ah I think Sarah Sanders had it right we should be coming together the president is calling for unity dialing down the rhetoric\nOf and the Democrats are going in the opposite direction they're they're they're blaming the president unequivocally no question about it taking no responsibility whatsoever\nFor calling the guy look at this guy Brennan\nSaid the president's guilty of trees or what the what the penalty for treason death he's basically a former head of the CIA had been out they're calling for the president to being hung by the neck until dead and this\nIs not considered inflammatory rhetoric I it's it it's disgusting the whole thing is just just hypocritical these people will go down in the ... as\nThe all time greatest hypocrites\nJust ask you something a ... I I think you make a great analogy um places this of the Democrats who cried and screens and whine about having\nOn getting the FBI not investigating everything I mean why don't we just wait here I mean the FBI seems to be holding again in southern Florida they're going to come up with a report pretty so we're we're we're going to find out the answer why not just wait\nExactly how about everybody say calm down let's we got we we have the FBI on the case unless this guy was a or gal or or or ... or whatever [laughter] whatever entity it was\nThat created these packages and less that entity was a very very very sophisticated person\nOr a boat or by it and if they were very sophisticated they were able to cover their tracks but considering the number of packages delivered to the various places coming out at one place\nThere are a lot of clues there and I'm confident that the FBI will be able to figure something out here and find out who did it or narrow it down and the fact that they use Debbie Wasserman Schultz as a return address\nThat kind of interesting in itself that'd be Wasserman Schultz is the one who was forced to step down from head of the Democratic National Committee a big cause she had the\nWhat that means but it's sort of an interesting clue you know maybe somebody thought that was funny to use her name out all these bombs I don't know uh but my point is that unless this was a very sophisticated operations that they knew\nA how to cover their tracks at every step of the way you've got twelve packages now that the FBI is investigating it let's wait for the FBI to figure this out to come up with something yeah why not wait before you start\nA ... and why not why are they not waiting because they want to politicize it the Democrats are missing no opportunity to score political points on this\nWell it's uh it seems that it it just seems odd to me that that all this is happening but let's wait I mean that's what everybody saying let's wait time let's get to get the the economy will get to the Taliban invasion after the bottom of the hour a\nLook let's get to the new economic numbers that just came out the gross domestic product GDP growing another three and a half percent now let me just say what this means right this is the first time that we have had\nBack to back quarters or in a very long time of of of over three and a half percent growth back to back and consumer confidence uh up at an all time high consumer spending was four percent another great a\nQuarter of economic growth and this is more bad news for the damn thing I Want to talk about this that they don't want\nAbout the economy or jobs or the gross so what did they talk about\nAh they talk about all they talk about they've got this wonderful thing to talk about this horrible thing you're talking about here with the with the bombs and they talk about the president's seat again they're falling in they don't realize they're falling into a trap and and it's their own tropic crop of their own making\nPeople don't want to hear for Democrats talk about the president they want to hear Democrats Republicans the politicians in Washington talk about what they're what the politicians are going to do for them to make their life better write what I I I go to work every day\nI got a family to support I got a job I'd like to get a raise what are you going to do to make that happen how are we going to make my life better easier make me rich uh make make make my kids you know healthier talking about President Trump talking about you're\nA Native American DNA\nDoesn't do that [laughter]\nI wouldn't do that talking about\nPresident Trump are causing the bomb scare doesn't do that so they are going back to the for the last two years only been talking about as President Trump is is a Russian agent and now they're President Trump as a Russian agent who Craig creates bomb scares I mean\nThey're they're they're not doing themselves any favors\nAre they and and on the other side I mean it burns very clear jobs not mine\nEconomic conditions in this country in a generation the best we've seen in ten Twenty years\nAnd that is the way that\nAnswers peoples' questions for me lately you've gotten gotten gotten my soul food stamp out of the basement there on their own great thank you very much\nPower\nOver again I mean I\nGo back and the same thing when it was all whatever was going through at the time it was no way\n\nComing out of the towns coming out of the farms\nComing to vote for Trump never voted before and uh so yeah it is there is a feeling of deja vu here all of these national generic ballot polls are meaningless there's not a national election\nOther they're all like I mean it's all the calls I I've been talking all day about the Washington Post poll that came out\nLike yesterday that shows Jennifer ... and they had a barber cops are genius tens district like Thirteen\nLocking whites than might when she should she is the favorite no doubt that's a very tough for a district that with Republicans to win barbecue\nEvery internal poll that the Republicans have from the White House to the end or seen seen to Barbara down shows the race does not have any Thirteen point link but this is what the Washington Post jobs they get a uh\nThey get a ridiculous methodology to get a fake polls get a fake analysis of it to do fake news to get a fake inclusion drawn so they can continue on with their fake narrative and like we've already been down this path so now I'm going to start calling them on how ridiculous that isn't

running the country everything he touches turns to crap whether it's the Yemeni civil war that's a disaster the gang of four embargo against the state of Qatar that backfired and blow up in their face guitars better off today than they were\nNow he's got this thing where they changed their story nine times what are we do here\n\nOr John as you point out it's clear that a show was brutally murdered it's clear that it was premeditated it's clear that uh that I think the crown prince knew about that a NBS Mohammed bin Salman\nDay I think have a lot to answer for and I think they have to be held accountable so I Do think that there has to be significant a penalties if they stop her I Do think to the question has to be asked is does the United states believes that\nIt can carry on a continued relationship with Saudi Arabia which I Do think we need to what can be with the crown prince I think that's a pretty compelling question I think many striking is going to have to ask that I think Congress will eventually\nAddressed that an asset to you know what will be the penalties are to uh to Saudi Arabia I Wish I understand the impact of those of those contracts for what we're doing to supply a military\nEquipment to Saudi Arabia I think Saudi Arabia I can be a like a a force on that\nI don't think that it can it can be that type of allergies that we want it to me if this is how they're going to operate I mean we asked you know we have principles in the United states that we that we stand by\nAnd our allies have to have to abide by those and I just am see Saudi Arabia doing that you know you you point out the issue with Yemen too and you and I have talked about that before a those are all questions I think that come up and how we see Saudi Arabia\nOperating in the region policies being played out and these are are they are they doing this thing's mass hysteria in that region or that create stability and bad and that are working in the in the best\nInterest of all involved not just Saudi Arabia but ah other allies in the middle east and listen I I\nI understand what they're doing that to push back against the Iranians but are\nAre they doing things that are in the long term of moving the middle east in the right direction I think those are questions that we have to smoke or foreign policy standpoint and I think that us\nPolicy toward Saudi Arabia you know needs to needs to be directed by those I think very a very sobering issues that we have to for us\nSo it seems like congressman Whitman or were thrown agreement and it seems like what you're saying is the best way to solve this is a four crown prince MPs will hammered than solving to maybe a step aside for someone else has gone up for somebody else in their final question I\nOnly have half a minute and I've got to get your when I was laid out some very quickly um is there going to be a vote in Congress on our involvement in the Yemeni civil war and backing the Saudi amorous coalition yes or no\nI'm a John I I I Can't can't predict that because I don't know where the discussion is going to go over all rapes but I Would say that it won't it won't be hard to get paid in Congress about what our policy is I Wish I out of your abs and conflict there in Yemen\nOr they got to go more information Rob Wittman dot com Rob Wittman duck out early voting and started in Virginia you get out and get involved with Robert\nCom ... thanks for being with us I got to go\n\nWith Maine keeping up on the topics because no fake news here just the truth great to have you with me John triggers radio network your Godzilla\nOf the truth in America boy that nonsense going on up there every day\nGot um people like to be with host like if he were they just get up every day they read the paper\nYou got the fake news you've got big posing as we get a big poll yesterday for the Washington Post is unbelievable I mean the Washington Post like when did they get to learn like they want to learn people say well what are they going to change a pony methodology to get it right never because they don't want to get right because it's not about\nIt accurate poll it's about big pole driving fake news to get a fake narrative to draw the conclusion that show it is it's all why the Washington Post actually putting out a poll yesterday actually putting out a\nIn the ... district by Thirteen points now there is no way\nThat Washington has a third team point lead over Barbara ... every internal poll that I have seen in our top stock every internal polling his pay four and a lot of money shows this race a dead heat or cops\nAre slightly ahead in the Washington Post has got top start down by Thirteen this is a complete and utter lie\nAnd it's beyond fake news it is and it's beyond the argument it's beyond the national Enquirer what they tried or do they hate tops not so much they want that seat so bad\nThey want the liberal do not think Jennifer watched it in there so bad they can taste it they want their\nLeft us in that seat so much that they will actually conducted poll make things up June in such a way to get results that they want\nSo they can put it out there and say the races over don't gamble Tom start to any money and don't work for her it's a lost cause so they do a fake poll\nIn order to do think it's unbelievable nobody in that district is going to look you in the eye and say that they think that Jennifer Washington as a starting point lead this racist tied and I think Comstock is gonna win\nFor the Washington Post doesn't care do not own up to any of this uh neither will the New York times or ABC News or NBC or MSNBC or any of the\nPolling companies that are includes with a fake news and that's what they are it's it's ... it's the fake news network and it's designed to drive\nA conclusion to make you not want to do anything to help\nIf you're in an attempt district go volunteer for cops like she is going to win this race if you get\nOut and help her but they lie to you on a daily basis and that's why the president says it's fake news and then he said there is an enemy of the people when you widen the people and masquerading as a legitimate news network with a legitimate poll is that not\nAn enemy how would you define that this whole for the post the astronaut\nThat even what most staunchest supporters\nThink it's a joke because they know it's not true so what are we just let me just ask your question if they're putting out purposely\nPutting out think information driving it so that the snake is that not an enemy of the people it's certainly and hey it's an enemy is a truce maybe the president needs to change would work\nIt's an enemy of the truth it's certainly an enemy of fact it is\nUnbelievable they're doing it again they did it in two thousand six days and they're doing it again things were not think do you deal with the Democrats have learned nothing\nBut what they're doing now is they can't believe they were wrong and so they're doubling down and here's the thing if the Republicans don't relinquish the house\nThe legacy media after two elections in a row going all in for the Democrats and losing them both on a federal level will become irrelevant this one of the states for them are so high there'll be relevant\nI'm\nAre good I simply tell you the truth 'cause the rug we\nDon't become a relevant they are doubling and tripling down on war lies\nOn more fake polls and more fake news again judge drive to result they want on election day again and it's going to backfire\nOn them again\n\nI mean they actually think that somebody semi pipe problems or don't go off at like at a change the trajectory the election\nI think general life we're going to get an economic report coming\nForty five minutes that it's going to show another over four percent GDP Growth\n\nAnd their banking on hatred of Trump and somebody setting pipe bomb that don't go wash targeted that Democrats had already been influencing anything right now it's very bizarre it's very the whole thing is very suspicious and it's very bizarre\n\nRight now if you're a national Democrat here's what you have to deal with\nMobs and caravans and you're running against Republicans who are poor jobs country mom versus jobs and country versus caravan\n\nAnd if they really think the caravans crossing the United states a bum rushing the border at a clip of Fifteen thousand are just coming in and getting food clothing shelter education hospital care and well let's just open up if they really think that\nHaving tens of thousands of illegal storming the country it's going to help them get elected you know see what they were hoping for is a couple of thousand\nWhich kids and babies and they'd be separated and it would be chaos and a drop of beer meaning and he put troops there and they'd have bayonets and everybody will be outrage and he's got to go\nIn standard has backfired they can't control it a thousand people they could troll

and you know me John I have a good time so if they\nIt's just it's amazing that last week she pretty much apologizes for marginalizing veterans says she's going to stick to issues then she puts out a commercial or calling me an extremist and trying to make fabricated things up again this is what the left does their own hands it's desperate poised by desperate candidates and\nThat's why common sensors back that's why conservatism is back and that's why I'm going to win the steps\nComic back in your commander of commonsense Dennis ... without running for Congress fifth district Virginia let's get to the caravan I'm the president with my later today saying he's going to deploy a\nThousand troops he's got to do a series of executive orders that would stop the caravan from coming into the United states the problem is as soon as they have fought and say the word asylum we can't do anything our laws and the loopholes in Denver are written in such a way that all they have\nTo do was get a toe in get their\nHand grab and say asylum and then we can't do anything they could not go back what are you seen the president's proposed action here if you were in\nCongress now what would Denver Riggleman the proposing on this survey\nWhen you were a rule of law and uh we're we're we're a nation of laws and we believe in the rule of law and the way the law was written written right now you're exactly right John I don't know you know how we we don't honor\nThat based on what we believe us conservatives in rural and and people who follow the rule of law however I think Congress needs to start fixing these immigration laws as soon as possible and I also believe once that happens\nAre vetting process for any of these people that are coming through has to be extreme vetting uh we do have some of the technology in place now but we don't put time limits on this if there's that many people that\nAre headed towards the border or we don't know what is it better than those in John my biggest fear um it's easy you know it's like a Trojan Horse right listen Ninety five percent Ninety nine percent of those people could actually be seeking asylum um though is that\nYou know our hearts sort of go out to ... with compassion however\nIf you have people inside there that are bad actors and they're able to hide you know within this caravan we have to a fair amount and my guess is this going to be sending some pretty healthy intelligence assets down\nRange I think we're going to be monitoring and my guess is I can only speculate right now my guess is why joint operations but Mexico on monitoring this caravan of seeing any type of missions that are coming out of there talking about radio emissions or any kind of into that we can blame this is not\nA good situation this is not good and at some point I think we have to fix or immigration laws in a way that again are\nAre much more common sense than the sort of sort of ridiculous since we have now are going on on the border\nUm\nIs that okay there's twelve or Thirteen or fourteen thousand people we have to deal with it and uh everybody wants to be concerned everybody's concerned about the humanitarian aspect but a lot of my color here's what their concern was okay if they get in\nIf it's Fifteen thousand to get then the next one is going to be a hundred and fifty thousand and you're not going to be able to stop that either because we'll never get a wall up in time\nAnd even if you have a wall you got a hundred and fifty thousand people and this is a lot of people so um are you in favor of\nThe president taking action now to stop these uh this a mob caravan from bomb rushing the border and come and get are you in favor of stopping them from coming here now\nYes yes I mean it's it's I mean this is a matter of national security or it is a matter of precedent um and again this comes back to that list as a normal American\nWill say hey you know we understand people want to come to the United states but there is a legal process [noise] um and we're gonna have to we're going to have to follow that legal process you know we we think that legal process used to be applied all immigrants and you and you're exactly right John this would set a precedent that could really be damaging\nTo the United states' security for our policies and to our\nRule of law uh you're right if the if we just allow everybody in we're actually sort of acknowledging that open borders as what we want if we don't follow the rule of law and we don't stop and he's\nHe's a migrant sadly we we have to stop them from coming in and set a precedent\nDenver at about a in\nAbout five or ten minutes the U.S government is going to release the new economic numbers or GDP expected to grow again this quarter at so\nOver four percent could be four point one four points to four points rate a bomb is kind of was trucking along in about a half percent growth growth unprecedented where do you look for in that report in ... which can close in ... I think you might throw out\nIt on the economy general recover\nWell the thing on first I'm going to look for [laughter]\nAnd it's just because I'm a geek out on the stuff is I'm going to look at the specific whatever report that I have I'm going to look at the number of jobs a base that are open right now\nAnd I look at Virginia but I also see what we're going as far as employment but GDP gross I'm going to look at manufacturing I'm look at agriculture I Love looking into the numbers to see where that growth is and if we're continuing on the line John\nEver continuing with the lowest unemployment claims in forty nine years of her continuing Los minority unemployment for continuing with GDP Growth four percent of every quarter which you know is amazing a it's a new normal was too I mean is pretty incredible or if you're looking at all these numbers I think right now what you're saying is that the tax cuts work\nAll the jobs are format worse opportunities zones can be LeBron's here in the in the commonwealth a ... and opportunities\nOn investment all the things that we look at to encourage opt entrepreneurship to encourage people keeping their own money is working and that's what I'm gonna look at it this report is is this just a continuation of this I'm aging ... amazing surge or are we seeing\nLots of Virginia I think we are I think you're just seeing the beginning of this economic boom and um I I'm really just really excited to see what those numbers say based on my job growth on what sectors are growing right now\nWhat kind of interesting to see these are coming up momentarily we expect that that we're going to get over four percent growth and it's really really tough for a Democrat right now to talk about economics the economy or any of the issues that pertain to jobs and prosperity in America so they'd rather talk about something else that's why your opponent\nLovely Coburn is talking about your Halloween costumes because she doesn't want to talk about the economy\nShe doesn't want to talk about job she doesn't want to talk about growth doesn't want to talk about kids moving out of the basement she doesn't want to talk about the boom and small businesses just want to talk about the deregulation she doesn't want to talk about the number of investments that are going on because of the tax\nCuts especially as it relates to one hundred percent deduction of capital investments you Rob doesn't even understand it and so she doesn't want any any of that she'd rather talk about your Halloween costume in two thousand five\nYeah and I mean which I Will not take down off the net by the way so here's what you would rather talk about you'd rather talk about forty million dollars in spending\nNot only for Medicare for all but also for forgetting student debt right which is one point for a trillion dollars right now free community college for all are free college for all everything she's got an even a debate she's like I Want to give away this\nShe doesn't understand the taxpayer money is what you're using I get so limited based on what I fought for you know in government overreach she says she loves government I fear government I think government should be limited I think government should be a fish and he was also for the taxpayer money for the middle class is nothing more than confetti she's compared\nEyes to the Nazis I mean I I find the stunning John ... anybody would vote for Leslie\nHer views are great for San Francisco and maybe a three square mile area there or somewhere up in Georgetown right in DC

rat's\nWith the chattering class is saying on CNN or MSNBC or any of these other foreign left and they are now they're just they're just propaganda machines\nAnd I think at some point that's going to break through that you have comments you have this coalition of common sense against progressive ... and I think that's what's happening in the ... district and we're going to win this John because I represent American values I represent conservative values but I represent what the fifth wants to do right now\nAnd that's why we're going to win the\nDenver Riggleman I Want to thank you for being

[laughter] certainly\nCan we shouldn't have said this political season and I don't know if that's because\nUm what's the solution to that because we disagree\nIn the last one of the country and what what\n[laughter]\nYeah he is part\nBiggest thing is what we're going to\nThen we can control\nThe Senate [noise]\nCome you didn't hear\nThe American people if you really\nGet people really care about the American people you [noise]\nOn the John triggers radio network directly\nThere's one Godzilla the truth and asked me it's great to have you with us today was a fake news regarded again with state polls coming at you all over the place they make these pulled up to drive a fake narrative don't believe that it's the same thing they did it two thousand sixteen they're doubling down they wanted to press the Republican volunteer base that's\nThe the the whole crowd that whole mob over there they were screening we must have the FBI investigate before we can vote on Kavanaugh there must be a full investigation before we can vote on him before we can decide whether he should uh be you know the certain to the Supreme Court by\nThe same as saying we must have an FBI investigation before we can let that happen\nThey're not even waiting for the FBI to investigate where the bombs are coming from before they start blaming President Trump declared President Trump guilty responsible for the whole thing they're not waiting for the FBI to investigate these are the same people that three weeks ago\nSaid we cannot do anything until the FBI finishes its investigation so I mean they were total hypocrites it it is absolutely irresponsible or beyond counterproductive it's it's absolutely irresponsible for them to be saying this is all about because of the President Trump\nOr they're they're trying they're trying to score political points on this which\nYou have to ask who benefits from these bombs that's all I'm not saying who did it it it's obviously some crazy person because no sane person sends bombs or fake bombs through the mail we don't know the bombs are real are fake or\nThey emptied out some firecrackers put it in a in a in the toilet paper two and a a attached a digital watch to it to make it look like a scary thing we don't know it's Halloween time it's easy to scare people what can I tell you\nWe don't know and I'm not going to go down that road what I can say is whoever did it is crazy in one way or another whether they're certify bleed can be committed to an institution crazy or just that they've got a screw loose\nYou don't do that kind of normal people well adjusted people don't do that okay by definition\nPappy Canada has a column today very makes the point that when John Kennedy was assassinated Lee Harvey Oswald who defected to the Soviet Union was pro Cuba\nOr he was found to be the shooter a yet who got blamed for the John birth society and all the conservatives so\nThis is not the first time that the guilt by association or let's let let's slammed the conservative let's blame everything on conservatives not the first time it's been done before we even know who actually sent these packages so\nIt's a everybody's got to calm down take a breath and uh I think Sarah Sanders had it right we should be coming together the president is calling for unity dialing down the rhetoric\nAnd the Democrats are going in the opposite direction they're they're they're blaming the president unequivocally no question about it take responsibility whatsoever\nFor calling the guy look at this guy Brennan said the president's guilty of treason what's the what's the penalty for treason death he's basically a former head of the CIA had been out they're calling for the president to be\nRick I it's it it's disgusting the whole thing it's just just hypocritical if people will go down as the all time great is hypocrites\nLet me ask you something a ... I I think you make a great analogy um there are places that of the Democrats who cried and screens and whine about having\nGetting the FBI and not getting everything I mean why don't we just wait here I mean the FBI seems to be home and again in southern part of the guy to come up with a report pretty so we're we're we're going to find out the answer I mean why not just white\nRight exactly how about everybody say calm down let's we got we we have the FBI on the case unless this guy was a guy or gal or or or bought\nOr whatever [laughter] whatever it was\nThey created these packages and less that entered the was a very very very sophisticated person or a boat and by it and if they were very sophisticated they were able to cover their tracks\nBut considering the number of packages delivered to these various places coming out of one place\nIs there a lot of clues there and I'm confident that the FBI will be able to figure something out here\nAnd find out who did it for narrow it down and the fact that they use Debbie Wasserman Schultz as a return address\nThat's kind of interesting in itself Debbie Wasserman Schultz or the one who was forced to step down from head of the\nDemocratic National committee a because she had been reading the system for Hillary against Bernie I don't know what that means\nBut it's sort of an interesting clue you know maybe somebody thought that was funny to use her name out all of these bombs I don't know uh but my point is this\nUnless this was a very sophisticated operations that they knew a how to cover their tracks at every step of the way you've got twelve packages now that the FBI is investigating it let's wait for the FBI to figure this out to come up with something yeah why not wait before you start\nA and and why not why are they not waiting because they want to politicize the Democrats are missing no opportunity to score political points on this\nWell it's uh it seems it just seems odd to me that that all this is happening but let's wait I mean that's what everybody's saying let's wait time let's get to let's get the the economy will get to the Taliban invasion after the bottom of the hour a\nLook let's get to the new economic numbers that just came out the gross domestic product GDP growing another three and a half percent now let me just say what this means right this is the first time that we have had\nBack to back quarters or in a very long time of of of over three and a half percent growth back to back and consumers\nAnother great a quarter of\nGrowth and this is more bad news for the damn thing I Want to talk about that that they don't want to talk about the economy or jobs or the gross so what did they talk about\nAh they talk about all they talk about they've got this wonderful thing to talk about this horrible thing you're talking about here with the with the bombs and they talk about the president's again they're falling in they don't realize they're falling into a trap and and it's their own trap cropping to their own making\nPeople don't want to hear the Democrats talk about the president they want to hear the Democrats Republicans the politicians in Washington talk about what they're what the politicians are going to do for them to make their life better write what I I I go to work every day\nI got a family to support I got a job I'd like to get a raise what are you going to do to make that happen how are we going to make my life better easier make me rich uh make make make my kids you know healthier talking about President Trump talking about you're\nA Native American DNA doesn't do that [laughter]\nDo that talking about President Trump are causing the bomb scare doesn't do that so they are going back to the for the last two years all I've been talking about as President Trump is a Russian agent and now they're President Trump as a Russian agent who Craig creates bomb scares I mean\nThey're they're they're not doing themselves any savers [noise]\nAh they stand on the other side I made it very very clear jobs now mobs President Trump and the Trump Administration have created the best economic conditions in this country in in the generation the best we've seen in ten Twenty years\nAnd that is does along the way that that\nAnswers peoples' questions what have you done for me lately you've gotten me a job you've gotten me a raise you've gotten my kids are food stamp she got my kids out of the basement there on their own now great thank you very much\nLet me ask you something I'm going to pose this question and then you've got to answer it when it gets back so stay with us for another segment you got to get the bottom of the hour but I'm here\nTo ask you when you get back you know you and\nI were in Trump Tower for the last two weeks of the campaign don't you feel the same it's almost like deja vu all over again I mean [laughter]\nI mean I could shut my eyes and go back to two thousand sixteen and it's the same thing we're only think told everybody telling us from couldn't when it was all it was all you know whatever it was that he was going through at the time with the Access Hollywood stay with us John radio network I'll be right back I'll go way\n[noise]\nComing out of the towns coming out of the farms\nSo yeah there is a feeling if they hear all of these national generic ballot polls are meaningless national election\nThey're all like I mean it's all cycles I I've been talking all day about the Washington Post poll that came out yesterday that shows Jennifer ... than\nIt had a Barbara Comstock genius tens district by Thirteen look\nLike that might when she should she is a favorite no doubt that's a very tough for district\nFor the Republicans can win barb is [noise] but every internal poll that the Republicans have from the White House to the end or see seemed to Barbara on down shows the race ... ... does not have any Thirteen points but this is what the Washington Post jobs they get a uh they get a ridiculous methodology to get a fake\nPoll to get a fake analysis of it to do fake news to get a fake conclusion drawn so they can continue on with their fake narrative and like we've already been down this path so now I'm going to start calling them on how\nRidiculous it isn't they're doubling down it's the same\nNow that's why the way you're on the John triggers
