Nunberg coming up with a few months but first let's get Andrew enrich Vegas Andrew you're on the line\nAndrew go ahead\nAndrew is not there All right Andrew you're not there a while maybe or their their address I go ahead\nYeah I'm here I'm a quick question for you this Simon I'm\nAbigail Stamberg there's out pacing ours are getting out there and an advertisement and everything else and it looks like it's a significant level off from what I can see from from what I'm seeing on TV to come to my son's computer to everything I just got kind of concerned about what's your take on that\nHe's in trouble and it's a close race I think there's there's strategy\nIs people know what I'm so Abigail Spanberger I have to spend a lot more money on social media and Jean the earlier to get her name out there people in the district has a very high name id\nSo I think they're going to wait here until the final Eighteen days so I Know a lot of ads are have been a purchased by their campaign\nAnd I would think that you start seeing them but look it's a very very close race and it's really going to depend on turnout\nThe saving grace year for the day ... campaign is in the biggest blue wave in the history of all blue waves nominees ever in Virginia\nIn two thousand Seventeen Gillespie carried that district by three that's the saving grace and um of course there's a big debate tonight on TV that's televised that's basically right now the only debate scheduled day or two more tentative debates one with me\nThat has not been confirmed nobody's going to make a decision until after tonight but it's a very close race\nI still get save the advantage or because of what I said in two thousand Seventeen that because I Know for a fact that there are going to come late but we'll see what happens also\nThe other thing it's got on the side is a a pie in Virginia has put all of their resources in the seventh district that's a lot of people banging outdoors dreams like doing what they do so but it's like it's going to be close uh I think\nYou're just sort of see in the Christopher Newport university poll\nPredicted and of course I'm the only one in the United states predicting a Barbara Comstock I'm Upset victory over Jennifer Wexton and in fact I'm going to probably do my show from her headquarters we're going to order a case of\nRolling rock beer and when Comstock being watched in you're going to have to pick me up off the floor to make me stop laughing\n[laughter] All right thank you for your time John Hope I've answered that Andrew\n... very well thank you\nWell let's get the Sam Nunberg Sam Nunberg on the line Sam a long time political associate an operative of Donald J trumped the now with the uh growing Steve Bannon political action committee citizens of for the Republican\nAnd a ban it's got like twenty twenty five people in his name he's got a polling going all over the place he's involved in the district and Sam is joining us now Sam great to have you\nOn your very optimistic Republican seats in Virginia [laughter]\n[noise] yeah I think uh I think Scott kind of when I I think he's any any doubt the Christmas Newport university poll that came out that they had them up by seven and that whole always a is biased the other way and I think David gonna win by ... by tiny\nA mouse and uh I Know barbers going to win so\nYeah I'm pretty optimistic I also wanted to thank Sam Nunberg for sending me a text last night talking me off the ledge after the answer has got to say hey go to bed they're going to win this series so I thank you for that Sam you know why\nYou're upset what they had to do the first of all they do is get one of those [noise] they get one although I wouldn't want in Boston I don't know what do I know I thought that they were going to be in me too [noise]\nBut I mean I'm going to integrate team I think will come out of the national league stack Milwaukee [noise] I don't I don't really know if it's an upset but I think Milwaukee may beat the Dodgers\nI well I think they are also so a ... ... ... agreement with that but you know what I see the the proper thing a natural thing is you're paranoid right because we were losers for so long that even though we did win the championship last season is just my whole family is annoyed\nOlder they don't want to they need the older pollsters they don't understand your demographic what I also think in the following the reason I think that they were worse when you were talking about John it's because they're basing it on the [noise]\nOn the ... the worst of the words right out of his life that is like I mean it didn't work in in ... if she could ones of let's say\nThe worst political you can think of that just thinks that the you know Democrats are always writing and Republicans are always wrong buys\n'em they base it on the model where they're looking at people that typically do vote frankly are even registered some car voting this time and they said on the fact of the woman smarts on TALK not only pay something millennials are coming out to vote the way they these Democrats\nAll sorts of putting it in millennials are not coming out of those who are a democratic candidates that's one issue in the second issue is unless you show me a poll on them that they don't tell you if you're a too real polls on John how you look at the CBS you got a call\nWith that poll start forget his name he released a book in his book I'm giving it to three ways here best case scenario running now for the Democrats undermined polling you had the Democrats to protect the sea majority worst case scenario undermine polling\nHe only had two Democrats were against the Republicans keeping out by one seat\nI still think under national circumstances the reason he says that it's because what they do is they do they're generic that way I can remember doing these Grasso race in the way they do it for congressional as opposed to the Senate races\nThey it's just not fair for accurate way to do it because of the gerrymandering the way these districts are the way they polled people let's say in the state of California the state of New York or even in the state of Virginia and then they push that into their poll a composite\nIt's just not accurate it doesn't represent for what\nThey don't waiting accurately for what it has to come out to flick Republicans see the Democratic party they took what I Want to say it's part of it is just simple laziness by them laziness or an sophisticated ways of doing their part of it is that it's very expensive looked at\nIt and if you wanted to do what we did citizens and the American republic Steve Bannon's group we spent two\nHundred thousand dollars I'm polling and what we did was we saw in the region the polling in the state as well we didn't even do state\nWe said we want to see what New York right we want to see southwest California we want to see me we want to see um [noise] we will look at the state of Washington right where we\nWere we have washing today and we said we want to see the\nNorthern and western column of Washington right that's the way you got to do with that look I'm two or three thousand dollars but you know\nIt was a lot more expensive to do it the right way to do with the state of the season\nJob that one person can do right right and some of the losers and things like that you would think they actually would want to spend money on ... but they do\nI let me shift over I got a couple of months ago to two minutes then what led shipped over to some policy and I want to get your thoughts Mike Pompeo\nJustice masses Saudi Arabia or to a ... by the president\nWho spoke with a who spoke with a moot Mohammed bin Salman ... today king Salman denying it anything to do with your show he that's hard to believe for the average person but he is denying it you have to I guess I think that [noise] then the print turning around and telling compare to go there\nOr the president saying on Saturday was that if it was proven that he was murdered in the conflict it then it would be severe punishment for the Saudis the Saudis then\nTurned around under and B. and B. S. and said we will retaliate in what do you make this whole thing Sam\nWhile I think retaliate that's ridiculous or they're retaliating comment coming from Saudi Arabia was upstate brother he it was probably someone equivalent of life\nYou know the equivalent of a radio host or something right for you know what I pay tax and there was no way the Saudis they\nLowered Halloween and they'll go over and they'll start aligning themselves with Russia you want to align yourself to Russia [noise] you weren't aligned you're told the roster you'll end up in the Shia\nIranian crashed and so that's not realistic when I came to the following this reporter was killed by the Saudi Arabians not only with people just barely a killed any barbaric\nBarbaric manner it was something that went wrong I don't know why this gentleman went into that consulates out what it's\nObviously not responsible for what happened\nBut considering considering the decency redrawing knowing about every ... anything\nHe Donald Trump is correct about NBS for the following reason\nRemember George W. Bush took us into Iraq not only find you want to remove Saddam but then he said look at how the vote and they're going to select the democracy is going to end up having Starbucks stare at a movie theater okay that's the way it worked out ... I had no problem\nWith our readers in supporting monsters there are monsters but they are are monsters\nThey need to realize that they can act like monsters in their own the gum [noise]\nWe're not going to judge them on that you can't do that to American\nRight man is an American citizen that American right there I don't think that's the way they shouldn't should go to Saudi Arabia agrees there has to be some kind of consequences for them and and and I will say from east so quick to point of view one of the credit cards on the right thing by something called pay those number two\nWe can't speak for Democrats\nA lot of political correct so I'm guessing to handle it I also agree though when we got there there is no reason why we should not seldom farms that can be used against Iranian or Iranian proxies\nOtherwise the Chinese will solve it because I'm sure that's what I that's where we are\nI think the part of the interesting thing is um I\n...

you can bet your bottom dollar they got to be severe punishment\nOf uh intel for the Saudis that he was involved with the um uh with uh al ... when they were fighting the Russians ... uh but none of

a lot to talk about where this economy is booming Trump's economy unbelievable tell you my neighbor right we're right next door to me is a Democrat\nAnd um [noise] she's African American single I'm

look great one of those big uh uh one of the one of those big su SUVs and she got the sticker on it she's you know shining up their looks great and I'm like wow brand new vehicle\nAnd so she said yeah

like well you know unlike you guys I don't like [noise] ... I don't like any does [noise]\nAh but she says I Do have to admit this economy he's got this really great\nSo then uh the my wife says well what are you going to do on November six\nAnd she's like a well I'm certainly not going to do anything to jeopardize this economy and that was her comment\nAnd I'm telling you there are so many Democrats like that out there that they might say they don't like Trump and they might say that there isn't a poll or whatever but they don't want to and they don't want to do anything to screw this economy up and certainly putting Nancy Pelosi in charge\nIs a prescription for disaster joining us now is Elaine Parker she's the chief operating officer\nOf job creators network ... great to have you with us\nCan morning\nElaine these are economic numbers continue to just stunned people\nThe or the the level of growth that we're having the newest unemployment report coming out to about ten days ago three point seven percent unemployment Elaine this is the lowest recorded on unemployment in the United states we've had since Nineteen sixty nine\nWhere's the county where it's just phenomenal Trump autonomy rang\nNumbers like Scott whereas it\nWell the health care and the economy just about all over the country are the top issue national security is important to many and in some states like Arizona immigration is a critical issue so economy everywhere it's one of the top two\nIssues [noise] ah but I think we're you're framing of the question is a little bit of oil you know I talked about this a lot [noise] um [noise] the economy is great there is not as much of an awareness there was not a lot of voters are giving credit to the Trump\nAnd Republican policies then that's creating a bit of a disconnect [noise]\nWow that's a I mean it's it's it's unfortunate and to me every day that goes by where the Republicans are not talking about this economy and jobs and\nPromotions and raises and you know the other thing I Want to give you a Elaine back involves the Ohio I'm from chief operating officer of the job creators network\nElaine another thing that is not readily talked about in the number of people now that are comfortable changing jobs Elaine ah\nWhich is another number that is off the uh CNN polling radar screen if you will but the number of people that were in jobs have been a particularly want to be in or didn't like her one happy but in the Obama economy one percent one percent growth\nThey were afraid to move now you're getting movement from one level to the other people changing companies feel more comfortable that they can make that move can you\nExpand on that way\nAbsolutely not just all part of what I was talking earlier with having more got rid of all people died about six and a half million jobs\nAnd we only stick Iranian people out there and I mean there's always the skills now on the jobs\nThat are available on every overseeing wages rise um ... the mark and how is how the poster work and people are feeling comfortable and looking at other opportunities that are there\nOpportunities for people here were taking their first step and we're going to start their own company\nAnd the parents aren't they starting Shannon had taken that snake on health insurance more affordable around for a small business since ... three to help clean and people are able to take that lease tax time maybe in the car they weren't able to just because of the cost of health insurance\nAnd not let that jak actually how can translate actually acquire\nA weekly survey last week when we found that ... percent of people are willing to give up their doctor\nMhm on or their current plan around for a federal court and around the fact\nThat people want access to health insurance they want access to affordable insurance in either the government has a role and sharing is that setting off providing it\nSo uh\n[noise] that that issue going to show up on November six and I notice that\nThe Democrats would come on my show now ah one of their major talking points are well Republican X Y or Z voted against a extending preexisting conditions when they voted to replace repeal Obamacare where's that going up\nAnd that there is a fear and that gets total ranger said that people want to make sure that everyone has access to quality health care and to the degree either the church like that is believed to this person is going to lead to ending coverage for those with preexisting conditions\nThat so that's just pouring\nI'm obviously you're just something that Republicans would say is not true in a certain misrepresentation of the vote to misrepresentation of legal actions that have been taking 'em sock clarify what happens there is is\nKey because again Americans do want everybody to have access to health insurance to want to make sure it's horrible the they're not aware again or some of the activities lenders mentioned some of the policies that have made less expensive plans\nLabel which increases actual um but probably of ending thing on the health care she ... the flashpoint a scary thought is in the ocean that somebody in any condition and let me play she will be unable to get access to health care\nAnd so that's the reading that that's driving some some people um yes to vote the other way thinking well if the if if the Democrats get in and they're not going to end the bombing here\nI mean it's just as a side and it was amazing because um two thousand ten and the Tea Party and all that we covered all all that and getting rid of Obamacare was like everybody is number one issue\nAnd now the polling numbers show that you know people have accepted it they're comfortable with it and they they don't want to change it\nSo um how how do you reconcile that\nIt's very simple the healthcare system was broken the whole volunteer it was not by Obamacare people still believe the system is broken um\nButter to no longer need the shoulder\nFinding part of the health care discussion because um it's been in place now for several years people aren't quite sure what period in civil law they like or don't like 'em had anything to do with Obamacare what we know is if you want to have more choice in their own and making their own decisions\nThat health insurance [noise] we know that they are ... very wary of having the federal government take over the healthcare system um there are a number of things that you would say would be opposed to what Obamacare are put into place\nLook people are you know President Obama has now been out of office for a few years his policy was past eight years ago people want to deal with the system as it is and make it better um and they don't see either side really having a solution to that at this\n\nOn November six knowing what twenty two days remaining how\nHow do you get maximum exposure to get Republicans out on November six how do we do is\nI think we have to keep talking about the economy and connecting the economy to the policies that the administration like the tax cut things out that the cutting of regulations on we did a poll a couple of weeks ago\nOn asking how many Americans knew that there is an attack and about a third of them said they didn't even know that they have their taxes I mean that's\nThat's just the angel we should be talking about um let the fact that five million Americans out of wage increase that it's been done is is that the result of the tax cuts in that\nAnd that's just the people the companies that put out press releases\nWe got numbers just small main street\nSmall businesses to get rain has been giving raises and and hiring people and expanding their businesses you just don't put out press releases about it so we know that things are happening for employees you know people are getting money back in our paycheck and small businesses hiring on you know the economy's doing well but we have to be talking about it and educating Americans about that\n[noise] so what what is the advice that you have for Republicans that are running in tight races or how would you change their or encourage them to change their message in order to take advantage of this tremendous economy we are doing\nWell I mean I think it it's very clear that choice it's a choice between two painting the on the very hot economy as a result of these policies\nOr going back to um you know wage stagnation going back to a high unemployment and make the better choice\nAnd and that's why people have to educate themselves on on the benefits that these policies coming out of the nation\nI don't want to thank God willing for being with us John Ross Mazen the number one pollster and the history of American Jen and you're right Scott you've got a

second I forgot whatever okay I didn't know you put it on the air [laughter]\nRyan uh Ryan I'm not a fan of that Ryan let me just ask you this straight up\nSo you're going to I'm Republican\nAnd African American churches and other things obviously you have to get Democrats crowds to consider voting for you in order to win\nAs you're talking to Democrats Ryan what did they say\nWell we have a program news back up a little bit one of the things I think that makes me unique is that I'm a pastor must have been a social worker I care about a lot of things that I Believe the African American typically the urban area's really care about like we've already talked about welfare public housing I care about criminal justice reform I've seen that close and\nSo those are things we're talking about the economy is just as you believe in I Believe in [noise]\nGoing through the roof it's booming and that's good for all Americans really been good for African Americans actually the unemployment is you know as long as it's ever been so we talk about the economy\nAnd as you know a lot of African Americans particularly the the conservative African Americans in the church are very conservative socially so we talk about her life and will do what are they saying what they're saying well yes you\nWere telling them but when you go to a Democrat who voted for McCain and voted for Clinton there a democratic voter and you go in a rich man or Petersburg and you say I'm Ryan McAdams I'm a Republican running for Congress blah blah blah what did they say what\nAre they what they said to me is you're right because I'll tell them you know what the Democratic Party has done anything for you they made a lot of promises but they really haven't produced anything and they say you're right and then I say you know what and Republicans haven't come and talk to you and message to you and ask for your vote and they've taken for granted in that sense\nAnd they say you're right and I say well I'm here and I said I to me I'm not about Republican or Democrat about solutions that I have solutions for you I've conservative solutions for you I've got different solutions in the Democratic party has\nBut I've got solutions for you and I believe that the work I Believe that's going to give you\nThe jobs that you need in this community I Believe it's going to give you the redevelopment that you need opportunity Jones and\nWe talk about that I Believe it's going to give you the for double housing that you need I mean we were not going to solve all their problems but I Believe that hey compared to what the Democrats have given you which is nothing I mean we are a huge step up and I'm actually here I'm president you know that's the one thing that they say you know what you're here and I appreciate that\nAnd then when I tell them I'm a pastor when I told ... been a social worker their eyebrows go up you know they're like oh really and they want to know more they want to know they want to know why I'm In this race they want to know well how do you feel about the president and I tell them I said you know what I Love the president I Love his policies but I'm not the president on my own person\nI have a different tone or you know I have a more moderate tone I'm One that wants to be a bridge builder I Want to reach out I Want to bring us together on our divisive voice and say whatever you think about the Democratic party or your current congressman it's easy to devise a voice all he has to do is tear down tear down the president I said I'm here to build up I'm not here to to talk\nEven the tear down the Democratic party for the most part I'm here to tell you the solutions that I have for your community and you know what it resonates with people because you know what people see me and then I'm often it just like the president and she loved that about the president I Love that about the president that he's an authentic guy and what he says is really what are you\nI'm just going to tell you straight amok and try to paint it you know just to tell you what you want to hear ah but I I Am solution I really believe that we and I believe the public in parties should be going into these areas with solution and that's what we haven't done the past and that's what I'm doing I Need to do it but you know what I'm a unique candidate because\nI have a hard to do it and I'm I'm Nicky qualified to do it as a pastor of worked with the African American community really my whole career\nAnd a social worker I worked in public housing works or without risk youth a mentor to African American kids we\nWe rented taekwondo program with the police department so I've credibility it's not like I've just come lately you know I've been there I've done it and they see that and they know that and we're going in African American churches same thing and I'm Still it resonates because you know what\nI think African Americans are very sensitive they they can they can read people and uh I think they they I think most of them can read where I'm coming from and my heart and so uh to me we're getting traction what's your website Ryan McAdams for Congress\nDot com rhyme exams for Congress dark comedy the Mike Pence coming in for a rally seven forty five PM or at sun trust building enrichment on Saturday October twenty and Saturday October

paid\nFor an authorized by America First policies in corporate joining us now Denver Riggleman [noise] you know when you started wouldn't get worse after big foot Leslie Coburn his Democratic opponent in the fifth district\nWhen it crazy campaign assisted because um I guess when you're down so but you gotta like throw\nHell marriage or something but must recovering on that debate Monday Night a week ago she went after Denver's military service on the ground zero three thousand miles away from Afghanistan at naval support facility\nDiego Garcia while he works on plans as you know for bombing missions um apparently applying that they didn't play a big role which of course we know we did and I'm Mr ... mostly the coauthor\nHusband are dangerous liaison said that uh he was snorkeling I mean this is a really crazy campaign and co burns or running [laughter] I mean now we're going to like say Denver like didn't serve okay ah what else are they going to make up joining us now though again is the truth\nIs Denver Riggleman he is the Republican candidate for the fifth district in Virginia that's the Lynchburg area through rowing\nDenver Riggleman great to have you good hey good morning John how are you\nOkay so uh luckily ... minutes said no you didn't put any bombing missions or after the nine eleven attack in Afghanistan that you were snorkeling in ... Garcia\n\nYeah I mean I'm you know maybe I think um I think the co burns have a problem with tweeting and they seem to they seem to to get angry and lash out\nOn Twitter but that's how they run their whole campaign as they they say disparaging things that make up things whether it's big foot or radical or white supremacy and you're making fun of military service or saying I don't care about women are taking things out of context and then they rushed to Twitter to the Hollywood friends\nAnd I try to make it national news because you know they have such extreme\nPolicies um and I think they're true believers but they're just so out of touch and for a Andrew co burned to get involved to talk about my military service for somebody who's biggest service has been you know making a fantasy books I tell you almost get to the point you just start shaking\nYour head it's hard to take them seriously I'll tell you that and and you know they they just as parents a lot of veterans to and by the way John Diego's not the only place I've van and that's the other thing I just I don't have to defend my military service to the likes them\nWell uh it was certainly a desperate attempt I mean you've got a very very well documented military service and you were the one who was head of the group that was the other learning\nYeah the thirty fourth esque expeditionary bomb squad during the amount of Diego which you know I mean you've talked about many times before and you know like I always told you you know there\nI've been in situations el harm's way there you know I wasn't I was supporting a bunch of just um awesome individuals on that we're going into battle when when you talk\nTo some of the people in other guys who objected over the Indian Ocean or I was trying to keep them safe but the threats in Afghanistan and they're going after the caves and also all kinds of other things that I Can't talk about honestly then yet um\nYou know it's just funny because I they don't understand anything about military service everything they've always done has been about themselves and now they don't understand they enjoy the war against the war fighter and they thought this would be a walk over\nWhen I came as a new candidate and they're finding out right now that I'm an alley fighter and plus you know I mean I I've had a gun stuck in my chest so you know with a covert I'm Sorry I don't know if they do understand\nThe gravity of what they've done and they made this personal level I never thought somebody would\nWell they're desperate or do you what are some of her you you mentioned at the beginning of the segment Denver Riggleman you mentioned that some of their positions were extreme liberal or can you just name several several of them for\nSure I mean there I mean everything there are extreme you know with the Medicare for all you know I'm forgiving no spouse student you know there's one point for a trillion and stood in line to a debt\nFree community college um the fact that they she called 'em I stick to stop 'em there's other things that we have that we're going to roll out I'm open borders um my goodness um you just go down the line and everything\nAnd that's what's scary about this is that she can't come across as moderate now she's trying to run into the middle ah she knows her positions are extreme so that's why she stays in Charlotte you know she doesn't really go outside the district much anymore she likes to enter into her town and I think it really comes down to she's a true believer and I and I know what I got to respect that I\nMean she's a true believer in east causes but I'm I'm a true believer unconstitutional\nYou know policies but also and individual liberty so it is truly a war of ideas now and uh I just hope that the Republicans get out and vote because she is dangerous for the district\nWhere were the Denver Riggleman Republican candidate for Congress in the fifth district he's running against his Democratic opponent Leslie Coburn she's an author and has a lot of friends in Hollywood\nAnd a Denver running for the seat of the retire of retiring Tom Garrett Denver let's get to uh some of the pressing issues on the world scene today that I Want to get your\nOpinion on a let's start with ... ... the a so called a\nJournalist if you were living in the United states living\nIn Virginia doing a column for the Washington Post very critical of the Saudi Government goes to the consulate in this than both for routine paperwork to get married and it's like the older Roach Motel he went in but he'd ever came out a hurricane up\nNever came out so it's like the Saturday Roach Motel\nNow the states get elevated because President Trump said over the weekend um if he gets clear evidence that the Saudis were involved in this cold blooded murder within their conflict and he's in this than ball\nHe said there would be severe punishment then a prince Mohammed bin Salman MPs\nThirty three years old turns around on Sunday fires back and if there's any ah\nSanctions against announcer any retaliation\nAh we're going to double down and we're going to affect the economy's in world markets and pull our sovereign fond and raise the price of oil and a ex cetera I we bought this arms deal with them a hundred and ten billion dollars but they've only spent Fifteen billion\nWe've also were backing their war their civil war I'm with the Emirates in Yemen where we go with it\nNumber one I think I'm Sorry you sat in Saudi Arabia to have a lot more leverage\nUh but now that the United states is the number one oil and gas producer in the world um it's very difficult for them to I think it's a you know sort of exert that kind of leverage on us as far as President Trump's concern I think he's very serious I mean if it's found out that the Saudi Government sanctioned um this type of behavior I don't\nI don't think she I don't think they're just to spend hours pay much I think he'll talk about pulling any type of support I'm against the Houthis are in Yemen and I you know and that is that's that is\nI'm just really interested to see because it as a\nTo try to extract Iran from what they're doing a state sponsor terrorism is a very important goal the United states government but on the other hand um if the Saudis are doing this type of behavior now you're talking about are things that we just can't get done and and I think President Trump would go all the way I think he would not only sanction them in and\nTake away their arms sales I think you would ignore the threat on oil and I think he would start to extract support when you kind of military stuff that they're doing over in the middle east in each other military exercises or or any type of operation so it's it is serious\nDenver the other side of it is that uh some people are saying that well look or the president and the Trump Administration has invested a lot in the Saudi\nRelationship and the Nineteen months he's been there and we do have this hundred and ten billion dollar arm so but I I Want to keep pointing out that it's on paper it's a memorandum of understanding for hundreds of dollars but they've only spend your whole you yeah it's an ammo you only spend Fifteen minutes\nSo it it's not I mean there's and there's no sign deals or anything it's just an understanding right right so it's not really funny\nSo uh so somebody was saying you know why maybe we just we just under under the rug and move on\nBusiness as usual but a Marco Rubio the other day said that whatever action we took could not be symbolic what is your take on that\nHe's he's right I mean if again if the Saudi Government\nParticipated in killing somebody was sanctioned and we have the proof is my guest says it's going to be much more than symbolic um I guess there's probably remember little support on multiple Bronx and I would say that\nThat is going to happen is if we if we find that's been proven and you know I don't actually on that line I don't have all the classified information All right and I couldn't answer to it anyway but if something were found out my guess is that with a much more than symbolic I think I think Rubio's right and

ours the average uh getting out there\nAn advertisement and everything else and it looks like it's a significant problem ah from what I can see from from what I've seen on TV to come to my computer to everything I just got kind of concerned about what's your take on that\nHe's in trouble and\nIt's a close race I think their ... their strategy is people know what I'm so Abigail Spanberger I had to spend a lot more money on social media and Jean the earlier to get her name out there\nPeople in the district has a very high name id\nSo I think they're going to wait here until the final Eighteen days so I Know a lot of ads are have been a purchased by their campaign\nAnd I would think that you start seeing them but look it's a very very close race and it's really going to depend on turnout\nThe saving grace cheer for the day ... campaign is in the biggest blue wave in the history of all blue waves to nominees ever in Virginia\nIn two thousand Seventeen\nGillespie carry the district by three that's the saving grace and um of course there's a big debate tonight on TV that's televised that basically right now the only debate scheduled they up to more tentative debates one with me that has not been confirmed\nNobody's going to make a decision until after tonight but it's a very close race I still get have the advantage or because of what I said in two thousand Seventeen that because I Know for a fact that there are going to come late\nBut we'll see what happens also the other thing is kinda on his side is a a pie in Virginia has put all of their resources in the seventh district that's a lot of people\nUh I think you're just sort of see in the Christopher Newport university poll out it out earlier Scottsdale is now a bite tribe and he's going to win that as we predicted\nAnd of course I'm the only one of you in the United states predicting a Barbara Comstock I'm Upset victory over Jennifer Wexton and in fact I'm going to probably do my show from her headquarters we're going to order a taste of\nRolling rock beer and when Comstock big waxed and you're gonna have to pick me up off the floor to make me stop laughing\n[laughter] All right thank you for your time John Hope I've answered that Andrew\n... very well thank you\nWell let's get the Sam Nunberg Sam Nunberg on the line Sam\nA long time political associate an operative of Donald J Trump these now with the uh growing Steve Bannon political action committees citizens of for the republic and a battle got like twenty twenty five people in this thing he's got a polling going all over the place\nHe's involved in the district and Sam is joining us now Sam great to have you\nFigured very optimistic Republicans are going to Virginia [noise] [noise]\nYeah I think uh I think Scott is going to win I I think he's any any doubt the Christopher Newport university poll that came out today has him up by seven in that poll always a is biased the other way and I think David gotta win by ... by tiny\nA mouse and uh I Know barbers going to win so yeah I'm pretty optimistic I also want to thank Sam Nunberg for sending me a text last night talking me off the ledge after the after we got to\nSay hey go to bed the good of women series so I thank you for that Samuel it's you know why\nYou're upset what they do the first of all they do we get one get one although when in Boston\nI expect the ... what do I know I thought you were going to [noise] me too [noise] but I mean it's going to be a great team like the issue is will come out of\nTheir naturally I expect Milwaukee [noise] I don't I don't really know what I think walking the dog\nI well I think they are also so a winning ... agreement with that but you know what I see that the problem with being a natural thing is you're paranoid right because we were losers for so long that even though we did win a championship last season is just my whole family is paranoid so\nLook to impeach President Trump by um by their narrative they're not just the older they don't they need the older pollsters they don't understand the demographic\nThey were worse when you were talking about John is because they're basing it on the [noise]\nThey're basing it on the voting model or let's say the ABC Washington Post tax on the ... the worst of the worst stuff like that in his life\nDining slaves I mean it didn't work in the sea crippling up let's say the worst political you can think of it I just think you know Democrats are always writing and Republicans are always wrong by [noise]\nUm [noise] they base it on the model where they are looking at people that typically do vote\nFrankly are even registered some tolerance rolling this time and they base it on the fact of the woman smart Fox News talk not only pay somebody millennials are coming up to vote the way they did is democratic pollsters are putting in millennials are not coming out of those who are a democratic candidates\nThat's one issue and the second issue is a less you show me a whole um that I don't tell you if you were to real polls are drawn I suppose it's TBS you got all we've got closer I forget his name he released a bomb in his book\nI'm giving it to you freeways here best case scenario right now for the Democrats undermined polling he had the Democrats the tendency majority worst case scenario undermined polling he only had two Democrats were against the Republican House by one seat\nI still think under an optional circumstances the reason he says because what they do is they do they're generic that way I remember doing these congressional race in the way they do it for congressional as opposed to the Senate races\nThey should not have been there for accurate way to do it because\nOf the Jerry ... and during the ... district or the way they polled people let's say the state of California the state of New York\nFor even the state of Virginia and then they put that into their poll composite it's just not accurate it doesn't represent for me they don't waiting accurately for what it has to come out to\nWest Republican pizza Democrats part of it so important to stay part of it it's just simple laziness\nBy them laziness or to the case in a way of doing their part of it is that it's very expensive looking expensive if you wanted to do what we did citizens and the American republic see parents group we spent two hundred thousand dollars on polling\nAnd what we did was we saw the regions the polling in the state as well we didn't even do state we say we want to see like say why New York right we want to see the\nSouthwest California we want to see me we want to see um [noise] we will look at the state of Washington right where we had about where we have lost it ain't we said we want to see the um northern and western column of Washington right\nSo it's a lot more expensive to do with the right way to do with\nThe public is David these networks they don't spend the money they have to start [laughter] seeing people doing jobs that one person can do right right some of the things like that you would think they actually would want to spend money on we're going to pull it off\nAnd let me shift over I got a couple of minutes I got two ... two minutes then shipped over to some policy and I want to get your thoughts Mike Pompeo justice match the Saudi Arabia\nOr to a ... by the president who spoke a who spoke with a ...\nMohammed bin Salman ... today to Selma denying it anything to do with his show he that's hard to believe for the average person but he is denying it you have to I guess I think that [noise] then the print turning around and telling pump able to go there\nOr the president saying on Saturday he was that if it was proven that she was murdered in the conflict that there would be severe punishment for the Saudis Saudi then\nTurned around under M. B. and B. S. instead\nWe will retaliate what do you make this whole thing down\nWhile I think retaliate that's ridiculous retaliate in common and coming from Saudi Arabia was on state run TV [noise] it was probably someone equivalent of like a\nYou know the equivalent of\nA radio host or something for\nYou know so let's not take that and there was no way the Saudis they fix it but we're going to go over and they'll ... themselves were rushing you on the line or soldier Russia [noise] you wanna lawyers told the Russian you'll end up being a Shia\nIranian crashed and so that's not realistic when I came to the following it is a reporter was killed by the Saudi Arabians not only with the old people early or killed any barbaric\nBarbaric manner [noise] it was something that went wrong I don't know why this gentleman went into that conflict I was\nSo obviously you're not responsible for what happened but considering considering that piece of the writing a novel about empty I look at the end\nHe Donald Trump is correct about NBS for reasons remember George W. Bush took us into Iraq [noise] not only by and you want to remove\nSaddam but then he said we're going to have the votes are going to select a democracy is going to end up having Starbucks there will be theater okay that's the way it worked out ... I had no problem\nWith in in regions\nSupporting monsters there are monsters but they are are monsters they need to realize\nThat they can act like monsters and start their own fiefdom we're not going to judge them on but you can't do that to American right man is an American citizen that American residents there I Do think that the nation should go to Saudi Arabia agreed\nHas to be some kind of conflicts\nBut it's so low right thing by sending Paul ... of their number two um we kind of what the speaker democratic October surprise the sudden the election may not be nice to say that it is what it is like a lot politically correct so\nI just think we need to handle it I also agree though um we got there there is no reason why we cannot sell them arms that can be used against Iranian\nOr Iranian proxies otherwise so the Chinese will solve them because I'm so that's what I that's where we are but I think the president you say this I thought I Would\nStart issuing an adult [noise] because I have another piece of news to me was the everything from apple wash right so now I mean I were an apple watch that we know that even when you're out of watching it [noise]\nYou know the government like turkey\nCan get all your audio so he clearly clearly [noise] from all public reporting murdered this guy I ... I don't carry this journalist was Muslim Brotherhood I don't care who is allies for I don't care what they say a lot and\nIt's a relevant [noise] right [noise] he cannot conduct himself if he wants to watch during the war in Saudi Arabia modernizing frankly MPs one Saudi Arabia to modernize economically young so he can stay in power\nThe same way that Trump is trying to make a deal with Kim Jong un Kim Jong il gave up new to Kim Jong un power right now\nI think that there has to be some consequences for the price that I think will lay down on them to\nSam we're in complete agreement green analysis thanks for being with us Sam Nunberg\nOr we're not going to be sharing them with Steve Bannon's political action committee citizens for the American republic cars the acronym for the American
