I don't think you're going to see any action between now and after election day but I'm crown prince Mohammed bin Solomon um if you really look at the fact it's inconceivable that he was not behind it I just it's just inconceivable that justice\nIs Thirteen role did tell people when doctors whatsoever\nFood there on without authorization so I think it's I think that he was not\nThe topic and if he is a and he's behind this thing um how does this\nPlay out because the Trump Administration has put\nThe Saudis at at the centerpiece of their Middle Eastern policies they also want to leverage the Saudis and seeing the Palestinians and the table with Israel um is this a shark I'm kind of the unraveling or want here what do you think\nWell there are many people that would like\nTo unravel this money will be anti Trump Bruce and many people that are on the Democratic side of the aisle because the relationship that Donald Trump parents with the Saudis as\nHas always been was always on all our president but their relationship was corking his foreign policy or he wants to use them as a a lot for a partner against the expansion\nOf Iranian terror and I'm I'm there are many people that would like to see that failed they would like to see president\nTrump fail and there's foreign policy as well as a domestic policy I also don't think it's smart we have a very good uh or a prospect\nSchools are providing weapons and other defense equipment to them which is a world billions and billions hundreds of billions of dollars and they're very American Jobs that are dependent upon that real people\nReal families will lead real livings now I have a whole different take on this thing that went back to this but this was might say this\nWas not simply the silencing of a journalist he wasn't the journalists to begin with and then go to journalism school it wasn't on official columnist I Know what that is to be a columnist it was just a commentator or will columnist for the call them once or twice a week coming our high\nWater he was a ... a commentator this is not an issue about a commentator who the Saudis didn't like his opinion was being put to death this is your cloak and dagger stuff that is by counter\nSpite wrote spot is nothing to do with the killing of journalists because the Saudis didn't like what they were saying what he was saying this fellow at one time was very close to the Saudis he knew all the secret service or he was he was part of their network he went rogue\nThey found out that certain things that turkey and Qatar for enemies of the Saudi Arabians they were they now have certain secret 'cause I kept wondering where they find out this stuff this was a guy who at one time was close to the Saudis part of their inner circle eat went wrong and what you have\nHere is your own actions cloak and dagger spy counter spy double agents happens with countries all the time when you're a ... in your country finds out that you're revealing certain information to enemies you're gone\nI Am sure this happens in the long haul for eight times\nA month they discovered some world major it's not just do what the silencing of journalists that I have to do with getting rid of an agent that was providing information Saudi Arabia's enemies and um it's cloak and dagger stuff\nBut you have the rabbi spirit when it was done in a very stupid way to do it in in a in a car\nYou know in a neutral ground he went in there to get a marriage license I mean that's why\nI get back to this I just think NBS isn't confident I think he's arrogant I think he's incompetent and\nI think it's going to be tougher to do business with because everything the guys touched rap like everything everything is such that his father\nPut him in charge has blown up in his face the Yemeni civil war complete\nDisaster he kidnapped the or Lebanon prime minister two weeks after the guy was in the White House or the like Katy did a tour with the gang of or blow up at his face that's a total disaster now visiting\nHer up I mean that everything that I did I mean sometimes you just have to say hey you think he's confident and\nConfidence and and and the arrogance bad combo I mean if they wanted to get rid of this guy I Would think that they could have been done other way let me ask you this wide thing intense interest here by the\nPresident's fertile fertile one which is what does this play here rabbi\nWell here's some competition right now with Saudi Arabia he wants to be the head of the Islamic\nWorld you know at one time for turkey is at one time that was the Ottoman Empire and the Ottoman Empire um was the leader of the Arab Muslim world or working hunger is all about World War one and he'd like to restore that to to turkey as competition to Saudi Arabia\nIn a way it's also Iran right now Iran has is Frank ... because of President Trump economically waning there's still about terrorism\nOr their their their power is waning so this was a competition between American who wants to be king of the hill as opposed to Saudi Arabia Saudi regular shows that are the leaders of the Arab world because my ... and Saudi Arabia\nSo that's what that's about so whatever arrogant and could do to them parents\nOut of the soldiers worldwide whatever he can do to recruit the relationship between Saudi Arabia the United states is in his ambition zoom citizens are of interest that's what's happening\n[noise] All right without hurting\nAnd cut power versus Saudi Arabia for who's going to lead the Arab world\nWell we're we're going to see how it plays out um\nI don't think crown prince Mohammed bin solving a\nI think eventually his father king Solomon is going to have\nTo make a decision here I'll probably be a positive one because um you just can't fix them confidence and he's embarrassing administration and he's embarrassed to Jared Kushner and the wealth of a handle this thing is just it's it's really dumb I mean I Can't what you're saying\nAbout this happens all the time but it doesn't happen in an embassy and there was a cover up and then it goes on for two weeks and then they change the story ten times and now it's a you know it's an international crisis and they did that take themselves I mean\nYou're exactly correct on that it happens was surprised but that doesn't happen to have an embassy and the way they did it and they're

Bush is stupid or that somebody actually would tell him what's going on between the conversation between Bush Bush senior it's ludicrous\n... and I think that's where I Want to it's just ludicrous that\nIt is and uh but it it seems to be whatever you're doing something up on these people and it gets back to anti Israel anti Semite Nancy or anti should\nAlways assumed that it only got a factor you know that always\nAlways you're always it always rolls back around that wherever you did it was really the question you know about you know what's in it that's what he wanted to go back to was Israel and and to me that\nThat was the whole basis of what he wanted to get to not just that George W. Bush you know had a issues with wanting knowing what a new car was or not the fact that they had a source that he can't obviously talked about which seems to be what happens when all the way back to this\nAnti Israel thing and and just you get to the point you're just you shake your head and you had enough and I think most people most people realize what's going on there\nAre a\nI'm going to run a couple of hundred clubs here from Culver and I want to get your reaction to here's one she did a radio show obviously they will not do mine [laughter] but they get a radio show and they are much Berg area right in Murray where\nUh they they after Brian asked her about her negative comments on making fun of your military service reps run that I Want to get your reaction to this like a military service cuts to\nThe to your husband Andrew posted on Twitter somebody might be talking about Mr ... risking my snorkeling all Hugo Garcia better but she started his service in the air force I mean do you do not come in\nYou know I I got it there I think that that we all do are back in certain thing that's kind of I think I served in the journal and so on having spent nights out a lot of finding out\nBut I think you know bring your marriage where people actually caring about in the threat\nWell so if it's way off in a while with her husband tweak that out and bring into question your military service and I mean I don't think being a journalist is the same thing is trying to plan invasions of what is up for this lady\n[laughter] it's so funny you ask the question is going to hurt idiotic or commercial came on where I was joking about being in that job extremist hip hop each [laughter] and has by a Halloween costume on there and has marchers you know going through Charlottesville um they're just so out\nOf touch and they're so absolutely have no idea what to do that because they actually don't live here I mean this is this is really what we get down to the root of this\nIs that okay let's let's just demeans somebody like they just did with George W.

to be part of\nThe sea comforting process for those families who are impacted by this in the nation as a whole we can never tolerate this but this is where the president is his strongest when he sees something that is\nWrong he doesn't look at Republican or Democrats and independents black white yellow green it doesn't matter he just wants to fix it and what took place in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania was horrific display of\nAtrocity is anti Semitism which will never\nBe tolerated by anyone in this country should never be tolerated by anyone in this country and this president going to go there and

unfortunately I don't think the president has the legal authority um to to amend the constitution the United states and what will happen\nIs a gas and go with what took place when he issued other executive orders is\nA sort of a ... a court is going to step in and they're going to put a stay on it immediately will ensure the White House has already thought through what the legal challenges are going to be this and ultimately this is going to end up being litigated at the Supreme Court is the highest levels of the land and they're going to make a decision but that decision will not be reached\nIn the next seven days are probably won't be reaching the next three months but the president and his team a White House counsel et cetera believe that there is a cork in the amendment that says that\nThey are they going to be born here are subjected to the laws of uh the country that they're in and there was a cork there that says these people here illegally so they're not\nGiven

work itself out just as we started every Fifteen Years in this country\nAbsolutely I think that is a set a spot on rabbi for awhile heavy on I'm going to take advantage of your chime in and get to the to get to the middle east and the international scene and I want to start if you may now because I Know your comment on anything they could show here we have been women coming that index and I'm\nRight now the president's I don't think you're going to see any action between now and after election day but I'm crown prince Mohammed bin Solomon um if you really look at the back it's inconceivable that he was not behind it I just it's just inconceivable that\nSearch gene role did tell people when doctors what's on their on without authorization so I think it's I just think that he was not a part of it\nAnd if he is a nice behind this thing um how does this play out because the Trump\nAdministration has put the Saudis at at the centerpiece of their Middle East policy they also want to wherever the Saudis and getting the Palestinians to the table with Israel um is this the start of kind of the unraveling or want to hear what do you think\nWell there are many people would like to unravel this many of the anti Trump present many people that are on the Democratic\nSide of the aisle because\nThe relationships that Donald Trump has with the Saudis as has always been with the oh is that all of our president but the relationship is corking his foreign policy or he wants to use them as a buffer a product or against the expansion of Iranians here and I'm\nA there are many people that would like to see that\nFail they would like to see President Trump bail\nAnd his foreign policy as well as his domestic policy I also don't think of smart\nWe have a very good uh or a prospect schools are providing weapons and other defense equipment to them which is a word billions\nAnd billions hundreds of billions of dollars in there I mean American Jobs that are dependent upon that real people real families will lead real livings now I have a whole different take on this thing melons mentioned this but this is my take this was not simply the silencing\nOf a journalist it wasn't a journalist to begin with you didn't go to journalism school wasn't an official columnist I Know what\nThat is to be a columnist he was just a commentator\nA real sense of what I call them once or twice a week a metal or high\nWater it was a ... a commentator is not an issue about a commentator who the Saudis didn't like as a thing as being put to death that says your cloak and dagger stuff this is\nBy counter spite ropes by has nothing to do with the killing of journalists because of the soldiers didn't like what they were saying what he was saying this fellow at one time was very close to the Saudis you own the secret service or he was he was part of their networks\nYou went broke they found out that certain things that turkey and Qatar or enemies\nOf the Saudi Arabians they were they now have certain secrets I kept wondering worried that they find out this stuff this was a guy who at one time was close to the Saudis are they're going to circle eat went wrong and what you have here is your own fashion cloak and dagger spy counter strike double agents happens\nWith countries all the time when you're a ... in your country finds out that you're revealing certain information to enemies you're gone I Am sure if this happens in the world forty times a month they discover\nSome world gauge it it's not going to do with the silencing of a journalist that I have to deal with getting rid of an agent who was providing information Saudi Arabia's and that means and I'm just ...\nYeah but you have the rabbi spirit when it was done in a very different way I mean to do it in in a in a conflict and the guy who lived in\nNeutral ground he went in there to get a marriage license I mean that's why I get back to this I just think NBS isn't confident I think he's our gets I think he's a confidence and\nI think he's going to be tougher to do business with because everything that guy is touched rap like everything everything is touch since his father put\nThem in charge has blown up in his face the Yemeni civil war complete disaster\nHe kidnapped the Lebanese prime minister two weeks after the guy was in the White House or the Katy did on tour with the gang of four blow up a district that's a total disaster now this number\nUp I mean that everything that guy just I mean sometimes you just have to say hey you think he's confident and a\nConfidence and and and the arrogance bad combo I mean if they wanted to get rid of this guy\nI Would think that they could have been done in other ways let me ask you this wide thing it tends to interest here by the president fertile fertile want what's his what's this play here rabbi\nWell here's the competition right now the Saudi Arabia he wants to be the head\nOf the Islamic world yell at one time\nFor turkey lives at one time that was the Ottoman Empire and the Ottoman Empire um was the leader of the Arab Muslim world for fourteen hundred about World War one\nAnd he'd like to restore that to to turkey this competition to Saudi Arabia in a way of sauce or Iran right now Iran is thank God because our President Trump economically they're ... they're still involved in terrorism such\nA their their their power is waning so this is a competition between ... wants to be came to the health field as opposed to Saudi Arabia Saudi Arabia is a lot\nOf the leaders of the Arab world because America is in Saudi Arabia so that's what that's about so whatever is going to do to them very much of the Saudis worldwide whatever you can do to rupture\nOf the relationship between the Saudi Arabia tonight estates and his ambition and as soon as his ambition interest that's what's happening\n[noise] All right well turkey\nAnd Qatar versus Saudi Arabia for who's going to lead the Arab world\nWell we're we're going to see how it plays out\nI don't think crown prince Mohammed bin Salman ah I think eventually his father king Solomon is gonna have to make a decision here probably easier to be a positive one because I'm\n[laughter] you just can't take some confidence and he's embarrass the administration and he's embarrassed Jared Kushner and or the will handle this thing is just it's it's really tough I mean I get what you're saying\nAbout this happens all the time but it doesn't happen in an embassy and then with the cover up and then it goes on for two weeks and then they change the story ten times and now it's a you know it's an international crisis and they did that they're themselves I\nYou're exactly correct combat it happens we'll spies but it doesn't represent them embassies under way they did
