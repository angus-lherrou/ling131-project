about and uh she has a written on this uh extensively and she is with us now are just returning from Brazil where we were following her work their Vanessa Newman asymmetric ... great great to have you with us for that\nTo me again John thank you so much always a pleasure to be with you\nKnow I don't think there's anyone\nThat the media that is more knowledgeable about what is going on in the Brazilian elections than you are saying you know hoarding and sent over view and you were there for months you just got back to what's going on yeah\n[noise] so on the southern Conan wind Brazil and Argentina are a lot and I've been to spend a lot of comment Brazil this year [noise]\nAnd I was so basically what's going on is when the ultra right wing ultra conservative swept through the first round of elections should have waited a Brazilian electoral system works\n[noise] any party can run you know you know it's a different system from the American system and you have to have two rounds of elections right so they had Thirteen candidates running and you can do to an end to Thirteen part [laughter] and if any one candidate wins fifty one percent in the first round\nReduced consumption but as you do you do have people protesting that these are extrajudicial killings playing you know without due process of law\nThat a lot of innocent people\n[noise] [laughter] I'm not saying that you often not the right person down\nSo that you know that it can stay in town even back then it gets pretty quickly right I\nAm and why can't I don't know because\nI think Mexico but seems to be\nBasically became an arms race in Mexico the cartels world reading so well armed they already have military grade weaponry or that they could out quite a ... the military now\nThe question is what got six feet in Brazil because they're already using the military in Brazil in the U.S which is the slums of Rio right which into\nIt you know doctors were required presidential order [noise] they don't always win you know when they fight the drug cartels they're often out gun shadow he's saying that they'll do more of the same and the rest of the country ah let's see what the weather you know they have the Philippine ...\nYou know so called six hours\nOr the fan on Mexico but I think they left it too late or and you have too much corruption you know the problem is all said you have the local police and the local governors\nOr how to much corruption now you have a similar political system in Brazil where it's what you'd call it or a chip system which is the local governors like in the U.S write the local governors have a lot of power or it's not\nIt's not old rule from the ... it's a lot of local governments and a lot of local enforcement and that didn't work in Mexico and let's see whether it works in Brazil\n[noise] well I think that there is a difference and you pointed out and all the experts that have studied that it said that the the Mexican military was way behind it arms that were out gone and the biggest problem they had and you just nailed it\nIf they would go in pursuit in areas and the local authorities were being paid off by the cartels so they were tipping off the cartel just about\nAll of the military operations where they were where they were going to hit\nA where their movements were and they had they had they had better better weapons\nAnd they did and they had the intel are being sent to them by basically despise that were part of the local law enforcement apparatus that we're all in the tank so let's put the Mexican military which is not that bad it's not like they were confident I mean the the way they're rated it is about in the middle\nOf the military in the world I mean they're pretty well rain but it's one\nOf the significant amount of training and intelligence also for the you know what I meant right you don't hear about it but there's been a great deal of collaboration between the U.S and Mexico\nBecause this is a common problem for both countries so you know there's you know and it's very complicated in Latin America and you don't want to broadcast [noise] you're working with the Yankees you know too much because it looks a little bit like you can't run your own affairs monitoring taking orders from the Americans\nAnd they share intelligence because of that shouldn't have done they they have done it a good job but as you say the sponsors and the people working for the call Charles I mean those guys there's an entire drug cartel basically\nFound from former special forces right so these are former military special courses that splintered off got paid more by the cartels they seek audio switches East Africa and spring different cartel and then they said hey we can do to turn around\nAnd establish their own cartel so these guys really know what they're doing you know\nReally unbelievable so uh it seems like Boston arrows chapter and to do what you say the the desire for changing the status quo for Brazilians and you know where it looks like you're looking to people people forget one in four\nOut of every Brazilians voter is an evangelical and uh yeah I understand I think I I read eighty five or Ninety percent of federal lawmakers or even a joke or this or this is a very Christian nation and I think they're just your heart of this I\nI don't see how the workers' party candidate overcome a overcomes the deficit I mean that would be shocking to me when when you get forty six percent of your closest rival is twenty nine percent\nI mean all of that of that of the other people that voted for the other candidates there's at least five percent of their who just don't [noise] I ... and they're not voting for a show like if a\nFalse narratives his people are beginning to get away\nYou can get a very interesting point there because there's another changing dynamic in American politics right to the two issues across the region I mean I don't want to paint every every\nCountry with the same brush but if\nTo generalize there are some things you can generalize on corruption and security right so those are the two issues so aside from that you hear on the other recording issue which is\nRhonda the evangelical voter set up a lot of these countries most of them are in fact I I'm I'm hard pressed to think of one another in Cuba or are mainly very complex but\nNow we're seeing something else which is more evangelical it's a form of Catholicism\nA but it's very much about spreading the word of God it's quite probably right it's it's even John Paul I'm you know adults being baptized in rivers and all of that\nAnd that's a new dynamic that we're seeing in Latin America you'll always kind of harm box and it has been the sort of smaller local villagers\nAnd you'll see it and you're even seeing them parts of the last if you go into very neighborhoods you'll have evangelical churches and they called themselves getting scandals as opposed to that do the call right so they can Christian rather than ... like [noise]\nUm but it's kind of next door to Catholicism [noise] we're seeing that in in in Brazil was the biggest example because it's the biggest country so it stands out the most and as I said we had a hundred and forty seven million voters on Sunday [noise] um [noise] but\n... is a presidential run that just you know the summer so little they're changing around a chair and they're viewing and that's part of what's driving this shift to the right is the rise of evangelical a\nPractice is also driving the anti left eye and the and the return to very conservative values but it's also another way of spreading the same type of a political ideology shouldn't have getting very intertwined the politics and religion and these new themselves as\nBeing on a mission you know a on a mission trip purify the political system by blocking the system they're going they're becoming a force to themselves [noise] and um and it it it it it's gonna be interesting to watch um I'm not sure exactly how this\nYou know how this plays out but of Latin America I think she just anything that's what the pendulum always sweating [noise]\nWell swinging now we're going to see how this turns out when is the run off and that's what is the day [noise] up to about twenty in October twenty October twenty something that will so in a couple of weeks so we're going to work quickly\nYeah so and every country when you have like a first round when the second round election the second round there's about three weeks later said 'cause we want to bring it to a resolution that gives them because of parties enough time to do a better you know\nA messaging and made a vice support that sort of not that one and to form a coalition but it you know you want it resolved quickly so\nI think that by the end of October we're going to have a most of them out or an office and he was going to take the hard line now he's also going to take a hard long ago Cuba against going to swallow um they also have a problem with this violence on migration coming across\nA you know and and they got refugee camps in the jungles in the Amazon jungle there I'm I'm most when I was going to\nLet me just kinda wanna crushed that problem\nUm I mean he was literally that's stuck to the terms of what she speaks show you know the U.S is going to have an eye on that front but he was going to need to\nGet a lot of advice and she you know maybe there's a possibility to see it is to make a friend out of hand if it's possible we're gonna we're gonna see let me see where we stand since he doesn't have a crime policy when can be as an opportunity [noise]\nGoing to be very interesting we're going to have you back the next week and the rejected that she's following this this is a fascinating election and certainly in terms of changing in Brazil and as you as you said or across South America and that's if people want to follow you are and get more

they all profit off of Donald Trump wants to\nStay in the book world stories\nAbout Donald Trump we've seen\nIt now is fire and fury in Woodward and all the other you know tabloids that have been out there and published but my guess is exactly what Rod Rosenstein is going to do he will use his purge the number two person at the department of justice too when he finally released whether he's firing quit doing write a book and just you know be skating\nAgainst this president because that's how these guys stay alive and Mr how these guys you know in the public arena and it really it's a terrible terrible thing to be honest with you\nAgree with the new allegations out now that\nThe Russians dean\nComments that he was going to attempt to wire get wired to the president and then do with the tape set 'em up and then go to the cabinet to invoke the twenty cents and then get them out I got to ask me I had to be a senior official saying they believe them and they thought he was dead serious\nThey reported that too now to James Baker he thought it was seriously thought it was the origins of the planets away now this new information or oh that's awful me why doesn't the smartest guy now\nLook I think I think you're exactly right I think the president wants to get through this election cycle doesn't want anything to distract the Republicans have momentum on their side but I Do think you have to look long term the ability of Rod Rosenstein to stay in that position looked it wants to leave that position he can do that anytime\nHe can resign if he wants to but I think you have to call into question do you have the ability to continue in his capacity and forget the attorney general based on the information that we're hearing\nFrom other members other senior members that served with him in official capacity in the department of justice or the FBI and if they're saying that their accounting for\nWhat McCain said to be true\nThat she was very troubling to everybody and we do know quickly that robbers were seen signed one of the fires an application renewable which allowed them to continue\nTo spy on Americans to find you sort of partition ever been made available to the president's not redacted that we need that we need to see that we need to\nSee the thrill to choose which are the FBI's milk after they talk to Bruce or at the department of justice to see what's in there and we have to understand what the insurance policy was to keep Donald Trump from being elected to the FBI was\nTalking about and what role is missing in that because as a deputy attorney general he had the right to sign that fire protection from what I understand and what is becoming widely known now and that's my application was riddled with mistakes and\nAnd it was based on the false premise about faith\nWas the sitting president of the United states and the American people deserve the rights to see what was in that renewal applications that Rod Rosenstein\nSo would you recommend to the president's Robin does November's\nAmok I Would I Would recommend to the president is declassified documents let the American people decide and see what actually transpired the FBI credibility because of what Jim Comey and McCain and now James Baker and Peter shock and lead the kind of done that organization\nIs just devastating it will take decades to recover from what they have done that organization\nTrying to use their positions people with authority people were badges going after American citizens\nSpying on American citizens because we do like the political affiliation of their opponents because everything that our country has been against Stanford inception and giants like Peter Straub cooler the head of the counterterrorism\nUnit had more ability than anybody he\nWas the one who boxing the Clinton email investigation he's the one who led the team that it was called cross by Hurricane Sandy hey there's nothing just seen these extra six\nHundred thousand including the email they were all part of the winners laptop and he's the one who said hey let's go after Donald Trump he's the one that led that investigations we've\nSeen it now with the text messages between at least a page and Peter Struck and they work at least minimum complete with what Jim Comey and McCain and Jim Baker and ten surely Rosen steam want it done and the question is John and this is a very very big question\nHow did this go in the U.S government we know that the director of the CIA and the director of national intelligence and others were aware of this spying going on on domestic soil against us but exactly how high gear to go to the biggest untold story\nOf the last two years you get this could lead right up to the very top of the government\nNeeds to be which leads to Jeff Sessions what happened to just I mean he's not doing anything he's certainly not launching these special counsel to investigate it would you alleged to be the biggest scandal in the United states history ever\nUm spying on people for political gain all the way up to do everything else where Jeff Sessions\nWill look this whole investigation has been by and large turned over to the IT the inspector general of the department of justice to find out if there's been any wrongdoing and we've seen some of that report already because it's been released publically the report that recommended\nThe number two person at the FBI and they're only be fired but charged criminally we're waiting for that to occur\nWe're waiting to see what happens to appear struck at least a page and and and Jim Baker the general counsel from the FBI we're waiting to find out what happened to Jim Comey because it is very possible that Jim Comey was brought up on charges\nI think it was classified that's not an excuse we know that he did his notes his work product\nWhich was not allowed to do is\nA law professor to make sure that could lead to the media there's been no accountability body level of government for what they've done which was try try to influence\nThe outcome of the election because [noise] or Clinton supported by and large they did not want to see Trump become President Trump and I don't understand what kind of doing and why it hasn't come out yet\nNovember seventh are we going to clean house or not\nBut I Hope so John I really hope so and I and I hope for the president and take on\nThat as a team focused on helping him achieve all of which have been able to do by and large almost singlehandedly if you look at what the president's been able to accomplish what three point seven percent unemployment the unemployment rate\nFor African American and Hispanic [noise] down a little down quite candidly and we've seen in the Woodward book toward the staff tried on multiple occasions to stop him from doing things and stopping trying to stop him from being successful\nBut he's persevered gone around and done things that story level\nJust for a second if you get a\nSurrounding actually wanted him to be successful\nFor how much more he could accomplish so much already but there are still people who don't want to see him be successful there are still people who serve in the government or whether they're bureaucrats elected officials or people who have taken conventions and support him\nIn a campaign and they're still trying to stop is agenda at\nEvery turn and all of the success that he has had\nIn the first two years of history can I can only wonder how much more he could have had had the white team around him supporting him every step of the way\nIn the administration working uh supposedly on behalf\nAnd various positions who's goal is to undermine\nPresidents jak and if it if you think this is not real\nThank you get this has got to be the blockbuster buckets one of the\nBooks when the when the excerpt come on if it's got to be absolutely stunning Washington because all the other stuff was here say this is gonna be here's a list of the people that are undermining the president who put on a badge everyday and do any of the west wing\nAnd they're basically a ruse guys they're spy if you will and they're working for the opposition and they're never truckers and they were put there by previous that's what's going to happen if if the Republicans can somehow managed to hang on to these midterms and it's fascinating\nActually believe that it's America first agenda that will work tirelessly in order to pursue his goal and you ain't seen nothing yet\nIf you look at the if you if you look at President Trump's accomplishments in the last twenty months in the stunning especially in the face of opposition within his own staff I mean forget the other party\nForget policy and Schumer forget the Democrats forget the never Trump present Congress forget them\nI'm Talking about people in the government and people in his own staff\nHis team that come in their everyday in council had entered taking things on the desk\nAnd manipulating information and fighting him\nAnd a slow walking things installing things\nIncluding his treasury secretary my notion it's another one\nFrom Goldman Sachs who tried to undermine every single trade deal that the president made by a is a free trader and the trends on Wall street and Goldman Sachs they want they want cheap goods and higher profits they don't care if you have a job and I went to\nLA care they haven't cared about you in thirty or forty years all they care about is how big their bonuses and how much profit can they drive in the business school now teach that they teach equity for ownership workers are commodity he had Gary Cohn in their fight him and it goes on and\nSo I look forward to that and I look forward to finally the president being able to get in a position where we can actually get some things done\nEven though we have gotten things done but imagine how much more effective even if we can get to a point where the people surrounding him\nActually believe that his agenda and I for one hope that a court goes in there and some senior capacity because I think it'd be great John triggers radio network truck to the truth across America [noise]\nSo we have a a resignation UN ambassador resides Nikki Haley now I'm not a Nikki Haley fan I don't like her I never did\nSorry she was the never Trump her we for running campaigns embarrass herself by a\nJoy one of those uh uh ... what do you call it response speeches to Obama and trashing Trump instead of using it to respond to the president's used for half a speech trashing Trump She was never Trump or from the beginning okay Trump Pence unique ability of being able to pick enemies\nThat things are confident she has been a top of that\nA U.S ambassador and she's had to embrace Trump's policies but she's also publicly different with the president on a number of issues and deep down she doesn't believe any of this stuff and so I don't know why she left I mean she said uh she's tired or she needs to make more money I Know her family's in debt\nI mean you think about it I\nI don't know I think your husband was military but she's got two children\nSeventy nine thousand dollars at the UN ambassador and you've got to live in New York City oh good ... good luck with that\nYou have to find all that I mean it's a lot of money and so she's been governor [laughter]\nAnd so she broke and I I guess that\nI get her leaving to make more money in the private sector and why not leave now where you can make millions of dollars and get rich because that's what everybody does go serve the government get out\nGet rich become a millionaire and then go they go back then serve again then get out\nMake more millions produced nothing but make millions the\nWashington government swap way and everybody's involved in both both sides of the out you know you only have to do is get a get appointed to a government position and you're guaranteed to have it make a mansion in northern Virginia or a\nProtest in Maryland You're guaranteed you gotta make millions of dollars by doing nothing\nExcept serving the government writing a book going on TV and\nA funny one and I'm sure that you know Nikki Haley will write a tell all book about\nTrump's sucks 'cause that's what they do that is what's up I don't like it I never did and uh she was certainly a competent UN ambassador but I have no interest and why don't you leave at this time\nWhat ... have been better if she could have hung out for another twenty nine days twenty eight days now\nUntil November seventh and then decided to leave sure because it's another day\nNot talking about the tremendous economy all the accomplishments that Trump was having Kavanaugh\nIt's another day we're not talking about the success of the America First agenda it's another day we're just changing the subject talking about something else and it plays right into the Democrat's hand that don't want to talk about anything that has anything to do an economy period [noise] you know now\nBig push is Obamacare now they're running I'm On that health care or they can't run on Medicaid for all because they're Twenty one trillion dollars [noise] excuse me so they can't one on on that so what do they what are they running\nPreexisting conditions that stern anything they found in some polls someplace that people are concerned about getting rid of Obamacare because that would get rid of pre existing conditions so if you voted for a\nEvery place whatever that monstrosity what Paul Ryan had\n'em that still had preexisting conditions\nBut insurance companies could raise your rates so that's the one issue now\nThat it's come full circle preexisting conditions and a Trump sucks that's their that's their that's their campaign platform so who can replace Mitt Nikki Haley went all the front runner\nAnd there's two front runners and then there was a two choices I've got\nThe front runner right now is dean of how she was um in the national\nUm and it never proper but\nLike her and the family likes her and she was just on vacation last week in South Carolina\nWhere the Haley's are Dina pollen her husband so she is the front runner\nI Would say right now I Would suppose that's certainly the establishment pick to replace Nikki Haley my two choices don't include Dana ... I'm sure she'd be fine\nAh but I think better choices or Rick right now the ambassador to Germany also happens to be gay who have the experience who's been in the state department has been at the un\nWho shares Trump's America First a genuine all with a lot of enthusiasm especially at ruled as\nIt relates to foreign policy or that will be choices number two my choice number one would be his daughter Ivanka Trump hands down she would be the best choice no doubt I don't think he's going to choose their he's afraid of being used of nepotism especially before the midterms I don't\nSee it happening but she's in my mind she'd be the best choice [noise] but if I can put a statement out yesterday saying that she's not interested in in the position that doesn't mean that can happen\nBut if you got to walk in there at least you have someone actually believes in the president's agenda I'm sure Dina power will be fine I think a\nRecord that would be a better choice I mean at some point you have to start to reward the people who are with you from the beginning like record now you know he was a high profile\nGay Republican who came out for Trump very early Nikki Haley for Trump the hallway so at some point in this administration you have to start to reward\nThe people who believes in the beginning who stuck by you went to beginning who never wavered like Rick for now and actually believe in the things that you're that you're saying and don't have to retrofit their own policies to tell me a lot now there's no sense of urgency here\nJohn vote was in charge of it he was there he was UN ambassador he knows what he's doing so it's not like to have to get to sell tomorrow we've gone through the uh annual United Nations general assembly meeting so that's over but those are the my choices\nI had to select someone if I had to protect now I predict just got to be a power and the and the problem is also\nVery much liked\n[noise] [noise]\nPublic and candidates Wednesday

about fake news CNN is beyond fake news now they're just a propaganda machine it's a joke CNN into complete joke gym do you know the people in my industry that talk to you off the\nRecord I think that CNN is like a clown show it it you know they've had to complete shows a with Stormy Daniels talking about the presidents\nHow far this network has foreign I mean this was the original\nBrainchild of Ted Turner in Atlanta and all news all the time of news network and I remember when it first started I first got cable and I mean I had on all the time and the way they covered the first Iraq War and\nBernard called was there and the bombs were going off and it was like nothing I'd ever seen and it is now granted itself down to a comic book seeing that as a comic book it's really a joke why people spend a dime advertising on them I don't\nKnow they've got the Democrats are by Thirteen I talked to John McLaughlin\nLast night of McLachlan online McLaughlin polling on line and he's got the generic ballot and the Democrats are priced sick well I'd said to them what's the difference fix the Thirteen I mean that's a huge spread\nHow can CNN said Thirteen and you stay sick he said it's very simple we use a likely voters model so we look at likely voters CNN\nJust cause people up they don't call likely voters they call voters [noise] so what do they voted or not there in the mix\nAnd that always skewed towards the Democrats and he said it also they they manipulate the question [noise] so he said seeing that doesn't do a poll they do a push poll the push pull means we want to get a certain result so we can spread that\nIn the news and depressed Republican voters so they won't make phone calls work et cetera nobody wants to put time and for a lost cause and so when he was telling me is the CNN polling is not fake news it's a push\nFault it's designed to set a narrative in order to influence a result that's why the network at the complete and utter joke that's why I don't want it anymore and I hung in there a long time I saw it eventually you know there's gotta be some modesty here but it is\nReally a ringleader brothers Barnum Bailey everyone\nYou you've spent two prime

saying that you know if you stood on one foot lean to the left in the heavy wind might not Korea I mean it's just not accurate the\nPre existing conditions are there I was in Johnson City when the president gave his speech last week and he said we're going to protect preexisting conditions and I think that's what you respond with his you know a lot of it is smoke and mirrors\nThat the Democrats are just playing politics with just like they did with the Gavin situation 'cause that's fresh in the voters' minds and we're not going to do anything to pre existing conditions that one player of the

of\nAnd you know is there a legal case that maybe somebody could challenge it under certain circumstances you yeah maybe but I think it was so he's pretty close to a lot but not a hundred percent they

message paid for authorized by\nAmerica First policy in corporate joining us now by boiled oh he's a political editor and writer for Breitbart News you can follow Matt go to Breitbart News get their\nAnd he broke a story yesterday or\nThe majority leader\nThe house of representatives congressman McCarthy who is from California and\nUh would be the leading candidate for speaker provided the Republicans hold the house wants to make Trump's wall\nAny campaign referendum this story broke yesterday\nBeing a Kevin McCarthy\nIs going to be introducing a bill or later this week he that he is actually go on a ... at the border day so he was a he flew down to the border last night he sees\nSkiing in his tumor getting threaten assessment briefing from our border patrol agents and law enforcement officials down there\nBut then when he gets back to Washington DC later this week he's going to introduce a bill that fully funds to the border wall so all the rest of the money will go for the border wall erudition and that has a number of other enforcement measures that Kate swap\nWhich has already passed the house that has an ending century city but he's already passed the house or as well as going after a criminal gang members are contained in the bill\nI'm so all those things and the few more or other things like standing on friday the gym thing going out fairly good million voting would all be in this bell and the important thing here is is that\nThere's been no does have the votes to pass the house of representatives I with Republican support at this stage though with only fifty one senator as it doesn't look like it would pass the Senate and this has been the reason why we don't have the\nThe wall money yet right leg and this has been the whole thing right as Senate Democrats have been holding it up\nBecause that it you need sixty votes in the Senate so it looks like based off in these midterm elections are Republicans are going to get a few pickups in the Senate seats right like so looks like based off the latest polling and everything the public is making it to fit for sixty\nFive fifty six senators the question is whether or not they're going to hold the house so\nIf Republicans do hold the house majority them they're kind of a bill that fully funds the border wall can pass both the house and the Senate and we get there you get into the president's desk and actually fun to walk\n[noise] so what is the amount of money that McCarthy is advocating in this bill for the wall\nA twenty four billion dollars approximately four billion dollars that's that's what they say they need\nAnd so we get the whole foundation so we got the right funding at a twenty four billion dollars now the way I read your piece McCarthy wants to make this a campaign issue and referendum if you will a wall referendum for the midterms true or false\nYeah that's exactly right and so again if Republicans hold the majority in the house and they add a number of seats in the Senate then they're going to be able to get the wall funding before wall funding to President Trump next year if they don't\nIf they lose the house and the Democrats take it the the the the Democrats are going to be able to block the wall in from the house just like they've been doing from the San ... sort of the point is is that we're McCarthy's build dies is it makes the entire election uh mid term referendum or this this entire midterm election\nVote for a democratic vote for open borders who to vote for illegal alien crime it's a vote for M. S. Thirteen right like it's a ... I mean that the Democrats are the party of illegal alien crime and MS Thirteen the Republicans are the party of law and order from President has made that\nCase over and over again so if you want the wall and the water you have to show up and vote for Republicans it's that simple and that's what this whole fight lays out but it's really it's become a referendum\nOn and many other things you don't get me wrong I don't think this election is just about immigration but it is very much about immigration ... like so it's it's very much about immigration and many other things as well including the economy including\nA the ... you know what kind of country we want to be including do do you support the craziness of the resistance that we've seen all these people that have gone off the rails what this whole cabinet our situation right like\nWhen the Democrats have gone nuts but the point is is that a ... it's very much a referendum about immigration as well and so again I if you want a border wall you got to vote for the Republicans if you don't want a border wall if you want\nA lawlessness if you want illegal aliens committing murder if\nYou want in a MS Thirteen running around if you want drugs spreading through your community or they're brought here by drug cartels vote for the Democrats by all means right I guess that's what you want but I don't think the vast majority of Americans support the opioid crisis I don't think the vast majority of Americans\nSupport a MS Thirteen committing crimes in their neighborhoods I don't think the vast majority of Americans want MS Thirteen that their kids' schools are so fast the fact of the matter is it's a way to stop that both Republicans against the war\n[noise] so this is gonna be a national referendum on the wall McCarthy

[laughter]\nWhere we watch to see what happens is joining us now that it was ... Newman and\nWe'd love to get Vanessa Newman on a show because she knows everything about South America she's a Venezuelan American business owner a contributor to the John Frederick radio network she's also the president of a company called asymmetrical she spent a lot of time in Brazil she knows what's going on down there we've got\nA an election that's there that we need to know about and uh she has a written on this uh extensively and she is with us now are just returning from Brazil Brazil where we were following her work their Vanessa Newman asymmetric a great great to have you with us for that\nCan be on John thank you so much always a pleasure to be here\nNow I don't think there's anyone in America that does the media that is more knowledgeable about what is going on in the Brazilian elections than you are to New York or dance an overview and you were there for a month you just got back ... what's going on yeah\n[noise] yeah so the color of their empire blind Brazil and Argentina are a lot and I've been to spend a lot of time in Brazil this year [noise] and ah\nI was so basically what's going on is we have the ultra right wing ultra conservative swept through the first round of elections for the way the Brazilian electoral system works\nIs any party can run you know you know it's a different system from the American system and chew and chew rounds of elections right so they had Thirteen candidates running [noise] and you can vote on any of the thirteenth part of the candidates\nAnalysts do I'm not I'm not I'm not really sure I mean it is controversial what detectives to reduce consumption but as far as you you know you do have people protesting that these are extrajudicial killings things you know without due process of\nTo start rewarding fun more people [noise] [laughter] I'm not saying that you're not the right person\nTo down so that you have that\nIt gets down down you know even if it's the fact that it gets pretty quickly right I\nAm sure why they can work I don't know because I think Mexico but seems to be is it basically became an arms race I mean in Mexico the cartels were already so well armed they already have military greater weaponry\nOr that they could out quite a ... the military now the question is will not succeed in Brazil because they're already using the military in Brazil in the U.S which is the storms of Rio\nRight which is you know they were required presidential order [noise]\nThey don't always wins you know when they fight the drug cartels they're often out gun\nShy and he's saying that they'll do more of a shame and the rest of the country I Wonder whether you know they have the Philippine ... you know so called six hours\nOr the fan on Mexico but I think they have to like a and you have too much corruption and the problem is all said you have the local police and the local governors\nAh had too much corruption now you have a similar political system in Brazil where it's what you'd call it that are rich obsessed with the local governors like in the u._s. right but also governors have a lot of power\nOr it's not it's not all rule from the top it's a lot of local governments are a lot of local enforcement and that didn't work in Mexico and\nUh let's see whether it works in Brazil\n[noise] well I think there is a difference and you pointed out and all the\nExperts to study that said that the the Mexican military was way behind it arms that were out gone and the biggest problem we had and you just nailed it is they were doing in pursuit in areas and the local authorities were being paid off by the cartels so they were jumping off the cartels of about\nAll of the military operations were they were where they were going to hit\nA where their movements were and they had they had they had better they have better weapons\nAnd they and they had the intel uh being fed to them by basically despise that were part of the local law enforcement apparatus that we're all in the tank so it puts the Mexican military which is not that bad it's not like you're confident I mean the the way they're rated as is about in the middle\nOf the military in the world I mean they're pretty well rain but they didn't want to\nKnow that it's got a significant amount of training and intelligence officer for us right [laughter] you don't hear about it that there's a great deal of collaboration between the U.S and Mexico\nBecause this is a common problem for both countries so you know there's there is you know and it's very complicated in Latin America and you don't want to broadcast [noise] you're working with the Yankees you know too much because it looks a little bit like you can't run your own affairs\nBeen working with the with the Mexican military and they share intelligence because of that shouldn't have done they haven't done a good job but as you said the spies and the people working for the court trials I mean they'll set that as they are and drug cartel basically\nFound from former special forces\nRight so these are former military special courses that spins off got paid more by the cartels they were they the cardio switches the staff and supported jumping card shop and then they said hey we can do to turn around and establish their own cartel so these guys really know what they're doing you know\nReally unbelievable so uh it seems like false scenario has tapped into the when you say the the desire for changing the status quo for Brazilians and in a way it looks like you know looking people people forget one in four\nOut of every Brazilians voter is an evangelical and uh yeah I understand I think I I read eighty five or Ninety percent of federal lawmakers or even a joke to do this or this is a very Christian nation and I think their heart of this I\nI don't see how the workers' party candidate overcome a overcomes the deficit I mean that would be shocking to me when when you get forty six percent of your closest rival is twenty nine percent I mean all of that\nOf the other people that voted for the other candidates there's at least five percent of their who just don't [noise] like a dog and they're not voting for a show like if a\nFalse narratives his people out to get it going to win\nYou know you have a very interesting point there because there's another changing dynamic in American politics right to the tuition across the region I mean I don't want to every every\nCountry will say broadly but if\nTo generalize there are some things you can generalize on corruption and security right so those are the two issues\nSo aside from that you can get on the other recording issue which is the rise of the evangelical voter so a lot of these countries most of them I I in fact I I'm I'm hard pressed to think of one another in Cuba or are in conflict\nBut now we're seeing something else which is more evangelical it's a form of Catholicism a but it's very much about spreading the word\nOf God it's quite probably right it's it's even John Paul I'm you know adults being baptized and rivers and all of that\nAnd that's a new dynamic that we're seeing in Latin America you'll always kind of combat\nAnd it has been in the sort of smaller local villagers 'em and you'll see it and you're even seeing them parts of the last if you go into the neighborhoods you hobbies and our local church in the news and they call themselves can scandals as opposed to cut all the costs right so they seem to Christian rather than the top of that [noise]\nUm but it's kind of next door to the dollar says on [noise] we're seeing that in ... in Brazil was the biggest example because it's the biggest country so it stands out the most interesting is that we had a hundred and forty seven million bucks\nIn Colombia out in and you're going to do is\nA presidential remind you just you know the summer\nSo they're changing the panoramic kill interviewing and that's part of what's driving this shift to the right is the rise of evangelical a practice is also driving the anti knocked on end and the return to very conservative values\nBut it's also another way of spreading the same type of political ideology sort of getting very intertwined the politics and religion and review themselves as being on a mission\nYou know a on a mission trip purify the political system by fucking system\nThey're going they're becoming a force on to themselves [noise] and um and it it it it it's going to be interesting to watch I'm I'm not sure exactly how this you know how this plays out for the Latin America I think there's anything that the pendulum swing\nWell swinging now we're going to see how this turns out when is the run off to this or what is the day [noise] job of twenty in October twenty October twenty something so in a couple of weeks so we'll know strictly\nYeah so and every country when you have like a first started when the second round election the second round is about like three weeks\nLater changed because we want to bring it to a resolution that gives some comes at parties enough time to do a better you know a messaging and a bit of I support that sort of not that one and to form a coalition but it you know you want it resolved quickly shows\nI think by the end of October we're going to have a boat so now they're in office and he's going to take the horrifying now he's also going to take a hard line against Cuba\nAgainst going to swallow um they also have a problem with this violence on migration coming across a you know and and they got refugee camps in the jungles in the Amazon jungle there um and most when I was going out\nYou just kinda wanna crushed that problem\nUm I mean he wasn't really that stuck to the terms of what she speak so\nYou know the u._s. was going to have an eye on that front but he was going to need to get a lot of advice and she you know maybe there's a possibility to see it is to make a friend out of hand if it's possible but we're going to the scene where he stands when he doesn't have a problem policy we can use that as an opportunity\n[noise] got to be very interesting we're going to have you back next weekend the week after that to keep following this this is a fascinating election and certainly in terms of changing in Brazil and as you as you said it's been a or across South America and that's if people want to follow you are and get more information where
