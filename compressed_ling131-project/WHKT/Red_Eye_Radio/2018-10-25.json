I'll share a material but a later okay are towards the electric but we don't want them to release and even going into Arizona one\nTo ... that's a district which the Republicans are putting money in but we think we can when Armstrong was in Arizona to a\n... I mean he was in Arizona aid to Africa and across there and one of the mistakes that is amazing and this is who would have thought Donald Trump would be the night or right we know him very well you know I wouldn't exactly say that but I think the one thing is and what what I Am happy about this candidate out they should to ensure that\nBush you saw in front of your eyes bushy become a trunk\nAnd what you saw was that the horrible you saw the Steve Bannon juice on me coming out and say we love you cocaine Mitch thank you very much for getting through at least because of your leadership because of the president's fortitude and cabinet understood I think after that\nHe has a right to sit in the nation and not really not only save the country because we have somebody who is much more strict construction is that Anthony Kennedy and the I Believe on certain issues about in hindsight Anthony Kennedy got a bum rap\nI'm married to Iraq but one of course are like are cheap wonderful George W. Bush chief justice John Roberts to legalize Obamacare but um we we change the direction of the court I Believe that this president will get another one soon knock\nOut one but I really think we change the direction of where the president is going to go and it's so interrelated John between forget our economy\nOur economy will go\nOn strike and then there's impeach because I think that a lot of this is about the confidence and Donald Trump right way to operate but how\nIs this man going to be able to continue to fight this geopolitics field what political economic and frankly every single part in that war is fighting against China trying to redo the economic supply chain and the Democrats\nAnd I and I don't quote me on it called me on it China they want the Democrats the White House Iran they want the Democrats going out probably North Korea wants to Democrats\n[noise] yeah I I think national security then look at that camera\nMan you know the Democrats don't want to talk about the caravan because we had the so called a crisis a supporter before you saw their true colors just like the way you saw their true colors with cats and I worked as a dress rehearsal for the impeachment of Donald Trump you saw the two callers John ... of them and they said we want to abolish ice and prosecute the prosecute our\nIce officers right what they said right that's what they that's why they don't want to talk about the caravan right CNN last night job did you see this they don't want to show the caravan anymore\nYeah they stopped showing it and they said they were going to stop showing it and it's like okay so now not only your fake news but now you're going to uh\nUh not report real new it it's it's even beyond fake news it's like they're being CNN CNN stamp is becoming the onion\nAnd you know I was on that now networks three times a week for a very long time I remember watching a long time I was on the uh was I was on it um three times a week since the since June of two thousand twice or three times a week headline news and CNN\nSince June of two thousand fifth pain but it just it's it's become it's become a side show I mean it's like the onion because now I mean not not only knew what they say is they can't the time and they talk they got Stormy Daniels\nOn an ... ... talking about ridiculous top but now they're not even reporting I think it's because they don't want to because it's not favorable to them it's unbelievable what they don't they don't want to show the kennel that look\nThere there are polls there polls on these generic congressional races are outrageous their poll on the presidential race is your Cold War were ridiculous on twenty sixteen but I Want to think about what they what they did on Sunday they are hosting nationally tell us\nPraise they release of all excuse me John\nTheir relief and official call before the debate saying Andrew Gillum is down by ... points you want to tell me what are your poll which is obviously not as good as private polling are not as good as the\nSeat polls extra seat Paul or St Paul or see coal which is a top public call you can get in Florida and it's pretty consistent with everything you want to tell me it's a two or three point race maybe\nMaybe maybe you're in a hole and it was like four and a half or Gillum okay maybe you're running a poll and it was four and a half\nBecause you had to be just came up with your good sample court for the chance to twelve\nPoint race there is no way to reach it can do is outrageous outrageous now they're showing\nThat ad where initial Gillum takes a swipe at Fox News [laughter]\nThey're showing the fact that they really are\nAt stake polls fake poles which are fake news to describe a fake narrative to get a conclusion\nI mean the whole thing is so it's so transfer and saying we've been through this I mean I went through this in two thousand sixteen ... us all the same\nAnd and now it's even stupid or the never because you're right I mean there's no way that Gillum is up the guy's a socialist first of all go up by twelve and then the same poll that they released which which Governor Scott was actually a head of bill\nNelson by one you have to read that entire article three times to get that result at the bottom and yet the ring and say oh Scott they had us you know what to read a thousand words to get that but they still think within the headline\nI mean they're so ridiculous that they tell me I've I've ... I've only got a minute and a half year what's the deal with this caravan what should we do\nWell what we should do of course\nRemember what ... what one side wants to do with it and what the president has talked about it I'm not going to go into I don't really care about the situation in Guatemala El Salvador in Mexico I don't care I care about the situation in Detroit I care about the situation and I'm In the rust\nBelt I care about the situation and things rural towns and West Virginia and Pennsylvania and those people coming in and tell you or maybe they're not maybe they don't have that maybe they're not terrorists let's say hopefully maybe they're not\nMembers although come on come on I'm definitely are\nBut how do you what they are not I will tell you what they are definitely not John pronounced doctors are not engineer's they're not scientists are not lawyers not that we need any more lawyers by the way but now you know they're not they're not\nThey're not they're ... they're not going to fight it and they cannot be allowed and the president has been telling these countries to stop it and I think an example are\nTo be made here I Hope I Hope I Hope is the forces advising him on something like that is such a Jim Mattis who he's right is a Democrat that whole mad dog moniker we see at all\nImportant choice which I Know you or your friends\nTrumped up charge Seventy five minute walk Trump that word got comics available please show\nJohn I Want to let you know I think we're going to get a million years before the midterms over we only have only eleven million for Clinton cats it's gone\nAnd you're going to you go to Trump that war dot com\nTrump or dot com or dot com you can just find it [noise] you'll see in the book Trump that war will be All right I mean he just wants a first\nAn old you are at war dot\nCom by Steve Bannon Sam Nunberg thanks for being with us Sam is a senior advisor with citizens for the American republic that the balance managed to political action committee they got to a rally in upstate New York today and uh Sam or\nI can see I can feel the switch common I can feel or the right under joke\nComing I think the Republicans are going to gain five or six seats in the U.S Senate and\nI think you're going to hold the house my five that's it Josh readings radio network will be back with your calls when I get back into the Trump or dot com there with that\nA sovereign nation we age typical borders and we need to know who is here you can immigrate legally and also this president has been very forthright for over three years now talking about not just the people coming in illegally but the drugs that are pouring into our country Ninety percent of heroin coming into this country come through our southern border\nWe had increases and cocaine coming in now ... folks market learn that word sentence which possible for thirty thousand\nDad just last year it's coming and increasingly or a southern border being manufactured in China but\nTalking about the forties and coming into our communities through the southern border and it needs to stop this is a failure\nAnd that's where the president my boss last January in\nA life changing said he would do a deal and the dreamers he wanted to end chain migration and the recent lottery system that wall built and he would do a deal on the dreamers and you know what the Democrats never thought he'd make good on that he called their bluff yet again they walked away from the table never heard of again [noise]\n\n\nNo you're on the radio network is job mobs\nIn general then that's what we have right now and we know poll\nHere comes less than\nWe've got twelve days to the midterms you vote Republican you're voting for jobs you buddy for economic prosperity you're voting for a continuation of the America First qualities policies\nLed by Donald J Trump you vote for the Democrats you're voting for mob and terror of and that's it and you want to turn the clock back on the tax cuts\nAnd everything else now what you're going to have to do more to the next ... days are fake polls because now we have a new system in the United states ladies and gentlemen you know it's fake news is that we have the polls we I think polls\nTo drive fake news to draw the conclusion let me say it again in the next twelve days be very wary\nOf what the legacy media is going to do here's what's it like I said it's going to continue to do the New York times\nCNN the fake news they polls driving fake news for a fake narrative per se conclusion it's all fake\nAnd you've got to get the truth right here from your got jealous of the truth in America and\nThat to me when CNN puts a poll out showing mayor Gillum in Florida up ... points override the Santa and he's a socialist that is absurdity\nBeyond belief that's not a real poll none of these calls are real not one of them are real they did this thing of two thousand sixteen or they're going to do it again and these are not polls to disseminate legitimate information these polls to drive a result\nSo you're going to get from the legacy media fake news with fake polls\nTo drive the fake narratives to get a fake inclusion and here's what they want you to do they're going to continue to tell you and lie to you what the polls that they take would take metrics and false information these are pushed falls to try to get a result and here's what you're going to get you going to get a constant\nDrumbeat for the next twelve days just like they did in November two thousand sixteen saying there's a blue wave coming\nIn the Democrats are going to win a hundred states the generic numbers have widened to Fifteen all the Republicans are depressed\nDon't bother to work don't hand out of wire don't knock on\nDoors don't make phone calls don't do anything because look the polling numbers show the Republicans are cooked and so why waste your time go enjoy that we can see a football game and have a beer that's what they want you to do they don't want you to work they don't want you to get involved they don't want you to be enthusiastic so they're going to lie to you with fake polls driving fake news to get a fake narrative\nAnd at the end of the day they want if they can push drawn so they can get their own sake result posed by these latest fake news are are no longer to disseminate legitimate information\nTo buttress whatever result they want and so that's why I've been telling you for weeks you just take one district\nAnd that's been tempted Virginia just one and I've been telling you per week Barbara Comstock is tied her head and you're going to win that race now finally pulled comes out showing a tide finally some legit poll somewhere all the other fake news polls\nShowed her down by Fifteen\nAnd I knew from fact that was not true same thing now they're showing spanberger ahead of the seven fake they're showing coal burning had recommended up bring them it's got to win that race by double digits they want to the press Republican turnout and\nDepressed of their volunteers and they do that by lying to you\nOr we're beyond fake news now\nNow we have the networks of the legacy media that won't even report certain news items if they think it's going to interfere with their narrative talking points of the day which is to defeat Trump and the Republicans and look I Know there's a lot of Republicans out there that drive you nuts\nAnd you don't want to vote for them and they voted this way they voted that way they did you just\nSaid they didn't do that or there was some in fight or a primary fight or a few going on\nYou got twelve day here's my thing\nLet's unite now let's keep the house Republican let's build the Republican majority in the U.S Senate still President Trump can't continue his phenomenal America First policies and keep this country moving ahead what's we do that on November seven then\nWe can fight again let's wait now fight later oh I don't like this one because he but he did he think Tanner okay whatever go fight with Dave later\nOh I don't like Scott Taylor 'cause he beat Randy pork I fight with them later oh I don't like Barbara cushy voted this way or that way\n\nSo I'm going to vote no I'm going to vote for nobody or I'm going to vote libertarian are better than how it's ridiculous right now what Trump if you're a Trump supporter Trump needs a Republican majority period doesn't matter who it is he's Republican majority\nYou want to pick your petty fight and we all have them I get it do it later\nThere's a lot of people that I'm getting on my show that I have muted with and you know who they are not going to mention their names and they come on now every single week why because we've got to bring everybody together get everybody on the same page or twelve days when this election\n\nWe are we are we're working against hard with the million dollars in swat money hundreds of millions of dollars from the Hollywood crazy ... was left wing or Z and the entire fake news legacy media network\nFighting so fake news is out there and I'm going to say that again you're going to get fake polls\nWhich is fake news to drive a fake narrative\nTo get a fake inclusion and the end game is to get the result they want which is Democrats would take power so they can do what roll back the tax cuts impeached Trump go further with investigations\nInvestigate Kavanaugh tied the country up\n\nSo that's my advice to you get involved do something to go to tax cuts worked out ... I don't care what you do remember how happy you were the night Trump won those of you that\nAre Trump fans opt out there remember how static you were that night and I know the never Trump or his hated it in the Clinton people and the Democrats listen to my show I Know it all drug you're nuts but for those that were believers like me and Trump member happy\nOr federal goes away November ... next to where you have if we lose because we're not gonna be able to do anything\nAnd then it it ... it ... it comes back to twenty twenty yet\n\nAnd we had a real opportunity to fix things in this country and the Democrats don't want to talk about the economy they don't talk about jobs they want to talk about economic growth they don't talk about business confidence\nThey don't want to talk about all the great things\nThe president is doing they don't want to talk about ISIS is on the run they don't want to talk about the fact that North Korea has been shut off a missile in months they don't want to talk about the fact that Trump it unilaterally renegotiated every bad trade deal with all this money coming in from time to talk about that\nThere weren't talking about the fact that he renegotiated after and Mexico caved and then candidate caved and sold our way we get better deals you it doesn't want to talk about the fact that the Chinese economy\n... thoughts are thought he'd say

see that your average American as I say they may not think of themselves as a conservative or pro Trump but they think\nOh my goodness if you run out of an argument you resort to this kind of thing

loop holes\n\nA magnet attracting these people we have the same when whose funding you know this is actually going to come out my take is it's kind of come out before the election and I'm not even going to conjecture about who is funding in an organizing here 'cause nobody is\nTwo thousand miles march in the heat somebody is organizing this paying for it funding it there's food there's water there's clothing their shoes\nNobody's paying for that\nWe can only conjecture right I was a factor in it\nBut what appears to be is probably people that thought that this would be the end all be all for the Republicans because we'd have should\nCages after zero tolerance that the border which group to be a public relations catastrophe for Trump in the Republican\nBut\nIt's gotten too big they ... they want to maybe a thousand people now it's got to be it's going to be Fifteen thousand by the time it's done now it's an invasion and now with the Democrats trying to do was blown up in their face and it's their policies and their loopholes\nThat have been the reason that the incentive\nI mean these migrants who were coming in this invasion every caravan they know about what they have the schools are US law and the loopholes you step what you put one little tow over that border and\nUs laws protect you was that craving those are the lord you're protected let's go to work from our sponsors Mike and I'll be right back on the job rivers radio network truck to truck in the truth across America stay with us\n[noise] punted this how many times have you been in the conversation and he was someone said that they used to be Catholic it happened to me more often than I'd like to admit when I read the statement [noise] I have some or could ever leave the church founded by Jesus Christ [noise] did they used to go to another Christian\nDenomination it may have been or music or better fellowship [noise] what did they joined a congregation has better preaching did they leave because scandal in the church and find a place of worship led by announced dinner [noise] think about this moment no church or the has to be a president that crashed in\nThe east coast new other non NATO other denominations may have better music better fellowship and better preaching\nI think you're not had the real question in the [noise] most intimate experience with these [noise] never really get [noise]\nAlways take the team [noise] I'm Suzie Kelly and his political moment it's brought he kept the pension ministry [noise]\n\nNancy Pelosi and around I just spending more than ten million dollars to elect Jennifer Wexton they've promised to raise our taxes like thousands and then when the eight to ten thousand dollar child tax credit [noise] still at work as a prosecutor Lincoln repeatedly plea bargain to violent crimes like a talk\nRadio station [noise]\nPerfect union are independent believe is Barbara Comstock I'm Barbara Comstock candidate for Congress and I approve this message paid for by contact\nFor Congress [noise] don't touch that dial you found your home with the truth [laughter] with the best analysis and America\nHave you back here in the John Rivers radio network more than seven million people have already voted in the mid term elections and it looks like the turnout is up for Republicans Democrats and independents are like now the fake news has to report that puts a true\nBut the kind of spinning this you're going to be the next twelve days as the Democratic blue wave\nCrumbles to nothing because the Republicans are going to hold the house now I'm convinced that is by five and they're going to get any five seats in the Senate fives in Alberta to remember five Democrats lose five seats in the Senate and\nCome within five states a power in the house but Republicans hold on by five wives that number go play it on the power ball by by by pot you're good\nSo uh so far more people like you to vote Republican are thought to have cast ballots but the New York times is telling you oh don't draw any conclusions or don't journey conclusions\nIt's still good for the Democrats even though Republican turnout is bigger than ever in the early voting precincts that's an anomaly they say look at our polls we have every Democrat winning everywhere and history of ever\nThe um me time to show the affair um\nSee aren't you glad I covered this stuff right you don't want it to blow it under the carpet and it didn't matter\nAnd did it right there was a big deal and then I covered for two weeks straight nonstop and now look it's a bigger mess than ever that's why you joined me in and out the fake news right so what's happening with this so uh yesterday the a\nCrown prince of Saudi Arabia who seems to be responsible for this Mohammed bin\nSolving who was incompetent that's I'm I'm just going to say at the guys are confident that Trump's problem with this guy and Jared Kurdish terrorist problem with the thirty three year old ... crown princes you simply incompetent so now they don't trust them\nI don't know about Jared I've no idea but I don't think the president in ... trust them I don't think he believes them and I don't think he's competing and here's the problem with Trump when he doesn't think you're confident then you're in big trouble if we can deal with the\nNot trusting thing he can like navigators way through that but if he thinks you're not confident forget it you're done and that's\nI think that's the conclusion the president is drawing eight eight eight for eight oh John aided aid for eight oh five six for six if you want to comment on fake paws fake news and fake narrative coming out of the legacy media\nIs that so it's all fake uh\nMe time a single ticket holder in South Carolina we understand wanting the mega millions Julian dollar jackpot\nBillions of dollars one point six billion with a one time\nOption a nine hundred and Thirteen points to seven million I think I take that where do you think you get\nYou read the numbers the bottom and got that one got that one got that one got that one got that when I'm On my God I just won one point six though\nWhat do you think about that like I don't think we'd be on the radio the next ... I'd probably finish out through the election and that would be it then there'd be like to see if you'd never hear or see for me again the president call like NBS as a cover up\nThe worst cover up ever like the Keystone Cops President Trump's assistant worst cover up ever it's just like a bunch of bumbling fools and then they tried to cover it up and that was a disaster now they found pieces of the body skewed that reading the garden of the council I mean you just can't get dumber than us\nThey botched every this is a complete macho Reno\nAnd when the president says the worst cover up ever well here's here's what you draw from that he met\nWe talk to Gina Haspel who went to assemble jerky or a CIA director you have to assume that uh\nShe gave him enough information for him to make the statement the worst cover up ever which means he gave her information that the Saudis tried to cover it up and it's inconceivable to anybody would have\nA brain in their head that Mohammed bin Salman was not calling the shots so to simply say was wrote people gonna rise ridiculous they planned\nIt they had body doubles their they blow it and the guys incompetent because everything he touches as a disaster simple and\nThe president's going to react when that follow the facts to come out by pulling visas and putting various sanctions are those who are involved as you should\n\nBut I think the relationship with the Saudis going forward or is not going to be based on some grand relational a reality between Jared Kushner and Mohammed and solvent I think President Trump\nIs probably done with this guy we're not going to change anything it's not going to affect arms sales balance of power in the middle east we're not going to cancel treaties are a lot of deals but I think going forward it's going to be very difficult for\nPresident Trump to take Mohammed bin Salman seriously because I Believe after the series of events he now believe he is just simply incompetent\nJohn ... radio network truck in the truth everyday right here you're Godzilla of the truth that America watch the fake news fake polls there'll be coming out you every single day telling you how big you're going to lose stay with us\n\nYou're out of the truth in America you're commander commonsense great to have you with us it is Wednesday ten twenty or that means\nVan continues to move towards the invasion every status of the United states recent illegal limited immigration data\nIs very clear there's an urgent need to address the crisis at our border spark like catch and release loopholes back by Democrats Democrats want mobs Republicans want jobs Democrats why illegal immigration caravan\nInvasions along with the Goldman Sachs lower Manhattan\nDonor base ego driven gangster banks are Republicans in New York that's the holy alliance of all time this surge of aliens\nComing into the United states is a direct result of an outdated laws demanding what is called catch and release now customs and border protection get tips\nThe apprehended Ninety five thousand Central Americans as part of family unit at the border last year\nOkay so customs\nAnd border protection every headed Ninety five thousand Central Americans who came as part of family unit at the border last\nYear you know how many of them are in the United states now Ninety nine percent I just want you to grasp the reality of the situation Ninety five thousand were apprehended Ninety nine percent are still in the United states\nJust last year\nThis is what I've been saying our laws are such you don't understand that you've touched foot on us soil you're you as an illegal war breaker we have other laws that protect your\nIt's crazy customs\nAnd border patrol apprehended thirty two thousand unaccompanied minors from the northern triangle of Central America last year you know how many are in the U.S today Ninety eight percent the number of illegal aliens family you know we can remove in a year\n\nIs roughly equivalent to the number that come over our border illegally into that\nToday's\nThe Democratic back loopholes for the release of apprehended aliens from Central America is outrageous these catch and release laws in court rulings have resulted in de\nFacto immunity for illegal alien\nMinors in adults from Central America who arrive at the border with them die of San Francisco\nPushed the what she called the trafficking victims protection reauthorization act which prevents the screening return of unaccompanied minors from not contiguous countries\nJudicious\nThe tourists settlement agreement blocked they block the US's ability to detain and remove alien family you're in you're only going to do was come with a kid you're in the subject matter\nThat you broke the history of the different things aren't believe will pull him to sell any of our border laws by stepping foot in the United states without any legal status or paperwork you break the law but as soon\nAs you break that law there's other laws that protect you so you can't be removed so the first law that you worked doesn't matter because all the other laws protect your status thing you can't be thrown back\n\nThen you can only be detained for twenty days max you can only be with your child for twenty days Matt\nWhat's your twenty days or do you got to be released you're not released back into the country are you from your not repatriate it you're simply released into the interior the United states this is I mean this is crazy\nThere's no ... it's a mess that's why the president wants the oil I mean this is the most interesting thing you didn't even realize until you're thinking of these laws what they are this is the most outrageous thing you know you can imagine\nThe effect is that the U.S government is forced to release entire\nFamily units in the interior of the United states after which they failed to appear for court hearings they're just really yet they came here legally and broke the law but the\nOther one was that the Democrats fact protect them because they want open borders because he actually every one of these people will vote for Democrats and they will work for them\nAnd so here's the plan Letterman so the Democrats getting eventually have a permanent\nMajority and who's complicit Wall Street donor gangster gangster Republican because they want cheap labor and hey all of their real estate holdings guess what they got to live somewhere where the government pays the rent\nWhere's that money go to shareholders of the companies for bigger bonuses\n\nThey're living in a mansion with guards and gates you're living in a neighborhood where your school is overrun by children who don't speak a lick of anguish and are\nOn welfare that you're paying for and try to go to the line on the first of the month and see how that works out for you is this I mean I Believe it's unbelievable\nDo this do that then you can do nothing you have lost\n\nEighty percent eighty percent of illegal aliens claiming a fear and return to their home country get through the initial credible fear screening it was just three phases of silent\n\nBut only twenty percent of those claiming asylum\nActually ended up being granted it but it doesn't matter because all you have to do is to claim asylum reach the first eighty percent threshold and you're done\n\nRegardless Ninety nine percent of asylum seekers and family units are able to remain in the United states are all you have to do is get your foot over the border you're caught fire to claim asylum you're out\nNinety nine percent are released after twenty days max never be seen from a heard from again illegal immigration in this country has gone from a dramatic shift from what used to be mostly single adults from Mexico\nNow to Central American family\nUnits an unaccompanied minors in fiscal year two thousand Ninety eight percent of aliens apprehended by the United states at the border were from Mexico get that that was two thousand

man you had everybody down there you William ... because the last ... on the platform\nBecause the last year a Virginia was still in play when I was chairman although we were losing their state it was still a battle ground state we had money we had ... resources and the campaign a Trump campaign still look at\nVirginia yeah as a battleground state that they had a chance to when they do not think

and now part upstate but I Want to talk about your rates are going to do politics and policy okay\nLet's start with politics a recent polling I've seen an ad district shows you down by about eight how do you win\nWhile we win certainly by doing that thing that we're doing you know John one of those polls do show and I love the way your character I said earlier\nYou know we're calling heart damage for the\nForest and what we're getting at about sixty percent Clinton is that they're not going to vote to enter the undecided um and that's very telling you know I got to individual call the campaign office on Saturday and one of my staffers pick up the phone and said what do you want to talk to him\nOn them and the guy said sure so I picked up the hotter it was just really the candidate Mike absolutely\nBecause you know I got to tell you something I'm a Democrat and I probably don't agree on Ninety eight percent of the issues that six years I've never been able to talk Custer I call you once I pick up the candidate I pick out and start pockets on my boat and that's what we're hearing there is a lot of people that are at higher John in New Hampshire or the inaction\nOf representative um Custer you know under her or never watch the opioid issue got worse um it it's crazy\nWe failed that we have a target rich environment will reach that under the traveling with the with the voters\nOutlook I I think there is an under current Republican vote out there you look Steve Negron right now you should have a little bit of bringing your step because you're looking at the early voting returns and they are up dramatically and Republican precinct strongholds that means that Republicans are motivated\nThey're excited also independence up not a good sign for the Democrats on the Democratic strongholds Europe also but Republicans up more more that's been the issue in in the midterms from day one can you get the Trump voters out and\nWe're on independence go and it seems that there's a trend that could be looking like they're going towards Republicans because as the president is saying right now the ... the Trump agenda\nIs jobs the Democratic agenda is mobs and invading caravans that's basically the choice that people have okay so it sounds like you're districts in play let's get to politics let's let's start with the caravan ten thousand strong now\nComing to the

with Donald Trump it kept his promise that Mexico was going to pay for the wall man we wouldn't be a talk and having this conversation and\nAgreement with Mexico and Canada to renegotiate NAFTA or that's not an agreement has to be approved by Congress overnight worth the paper it's printed on and I think it's very interesting that the Republicans they have the agreement that they're the habit loop in Congress I Want to own a passing it\nAnd I think is a story there and the reason that's a hotline or is it not been nominated for the green that the Trump has a say on paper but it has\nTo be ratified by Congress or it's just it's just it's just a piece of paper so Mexico's not paying the liquor for the wall and if the if Trump kept his\nPromises and uh I got the million dollars from Mexico then we have a wall or we'd have one started and we wouldn't have to worry about this uh these people are coming up here or if until we get a wall like we could uh uh put sanctions\nOn ... are there any employer hiring illegal immigrants so that will send them home too\nBut they're not about to do that and uh just ... else you know that um [noise] you know this this was not a shoe and a

given by a car liberal was pretty much a a joke we are still under Obamacare the promise for seven\nYears to repeal and replace it with something better\nAnd uh the Republicans have all three branches of government they can't even pass their own version of a Trump care or something better than\nObamacare and even even the the Congress forget that Congress has made a promise for seven years to promise to Donald Trump nights\nOn the campaign that he was going to take care of everybody\nNone of that's been done and that wherever the six day to hold Republicans accountable for their lives to

I've\nOnly got a minute and a half year what's the deal with this caravan what should we do\nWell what we should do of course is a remember what\n... what one side wants to do with it and what the president has talked about it I'm not going to go into I don't really care about the situation in Guatemala El Salvador\nIn Mexico I don't care I care about the situation in Detroit I care about the situation and I'm In the run spell I care about the situation in these rural towns in West Virginia and Pennsylvania and those people coming in\nAnd tell you that maybe they're not maybe they don't have that maybe they're not terrorists let's say hopefully maybe they're not cartel members although come on summer definitely are but I tell you what they're not I will\nTell you what they're ... they're not doctors are not engineer at their knock scientists they're not lawyers not doing any more lawyers by the way but not you know they're not they're not they're not your best or knock your brightest\nAnd they cannot be allowed and the president has been telling these countries to stop it and I think it is\nAre you seeing him on something like that but there's age and so he's right Democrat [noise] all on don't really [noise] and then we're able to take care of the situation [noise] very important\nIssue with that also let you know you or your friends\nTrump that warm ice man in\nCharge Seventy five minutes we'll pump you walk Trump that war got comic available please show it John I Want to let you know I think we're going to get a million years before the midterms over

is a senior advisor with citizens for the American republic density balance manage to political action committee they got a ...\nA rally in upstate New York today and uh Sam or I can see I can feel the switch common I did feel\nOr the red undertow coming I think the Republicans are going to gain five or six seats in the U.S Senate and I think you're going to hold the house by five that's it John triggers radio network will be back with your calls when I get back into the Trump or dot com stay with us\n\nA sovereign nation we typically borders and we need you know who is here\nYou can immigrate legally and also this president has been very forthright for over three years now talking about not just the people coming in illegally but the drugs that are pouring into our country Ninety percent of heroin coming into this country comes or a southern border\nWe have increases and cocaine coming in now sentinel folks market data learn words sentinel responsible for thirty thousand\nDad just last year it's coming and increasingly into our southern border manufacture and China but just to the president's talking about the forties and coming into our communities through the southern border and it needs to stop this was a failure of the Democrats\nAnd that's where the president my boss last January and\nOn live TV said he would do a deal and the dreamers he wanted to end chain migration and the visa lottery system get that wall built and he would do a deal on the dreamers and you know what the Democrats never thought he'd make good on that they call their bluff yet again they walked away from the table never heard of again [noise]\n[noise]\nRadio network is jobs the mobs\nIn caravans that's what we have right now and we have polls and here's my narrative Mike\n\nHere comes less than we've got twelve days for the midterms your vote Republicans you're voting for jobs you've already for economic prosperity you're voting for a continuation\nOf the America First qualities policies led by Donald J Trump you vote for the Democrats you're voting for mob and Taliban that's it and you want to turn the clock back on the tax cuts\nAnd everything else now what you're going to have to endure through the next ... days\nAre fake polls because now we have a new system in the United states ladies and gentlemen you know it's fake news is now we have to take polls we I think polls to dry fake news\n\nTo draw the conclusion let me say it again in the next twelve days\nBe very wary of what the legacy media is going to do here's what the legacy media is going to continue to do the New York times CNN\nThe fake news think polls driving fake news toward a fake narrative perfect conclusion it's all fake\n\nAnd you're going to get the truth right here from your got ... of the truth in America and that\nTo me what CNN puts a poll out showing mayor Gillum in Florida apply twelve point to override the Panthers and he's a socialist that is absurdity\nBeyond belief that's not a real poll none of these calls are real not one of them are real they did this thing of two thousand sixteen or they're going to do it again and these are not holes to disseminate legitimate\nInformation these are polls to drive a result so you're going to get from the legacy media fake news with fake polls\nTo drive the narrative to get a fair conclusion and here's what they want you to do they're going to continue to tell you and lie to you what you pose that they take with fake metrics and false information that these are pushed falls to try to get a result and here's what you're going to get\nYou going to get a constant drumbeat for the next twelve they just like they did in November two thousand sixteen saying there's a blue wave coming in the Democrats are going to win a hundred seats the generic numbers have widened to Fifteen all the Republicans are depressed don't bother to work don't hand out a flyer don't knock on\nDoors don't make phone calls don't do anything because look the polling numbers show the Republicans are cooked and so why waste your time go enjoy that we can see a football game and have a beer that's what they want you to do they don't want you to work they don't want you to get involved they don't want you to be enthusiastic so they're going to lie to you what's fake polls driving fake news you get a fake narrative\nAnd at the end of the day\nDo posed\nBy these legacy fake news ers are no longer to disseminate legitimate information and inform the public they are done to drive a narrative\nTo buttress whenever result they want\nAnd so that's why I've been telling you for weeks you just take one district and that's been tempted Virginia just one and I've been telling you for weeks Barbara Comstock either tighter head and she's going to win that race and finally a poll come out showing a tide\nFinally struggle legit poll somewhere all the other fake news polls\nShow her down by Fifteen\nAnd I knew for a fact that was not true same thing now they're showing spanberger ahead in the seventh\nFake they're showing coal burning ahead of recommended recommended to win that race by double digits they wanted to press\nRepublican turnout and depressed they're volunteers and they do that by lying to you or we're beyond fake news now now\nWe have the networks of the legacy media that won't even report certain news items if they think it's going to interfere with their narrative talking point of the day which is to defeat Trump and the Republicans and look I Know there's a lot of Republicans out there that drive you nuts\nAnd you don't want to vote for them and they voted this way or they voted that way they didn't do this or they didn't do that or there was some in fight or a primary fight or a few going on\nYou got twelve days here's my thing\nLet's unite now let's keep the house Republican let's build the Republican majority in the U.S Senate so President Trump can't continue his phenomenal America First policies and keep this country moving ahead what do we do that on November seven then\nWe can fight again let's wait now fight later oh I don't like this one because he but he did he beat Tanner okay\nWhatever go fight with Dave later oh I don't like Scott Taylor 'cause he beat Randy Forbes I fight with them later oh I don't like Barbara cushy voted this way or that way\n\nSo I'm going to vote no I'm going to vote for nobody or I'm going to vote libertarian or I'm going to stay home it's ridiculous\nRight now what Trump the if you're a Trump supporter Trump needs a Republican majority period doesn't matter who it is he's Republican majority\n\nYou want to pick your petty fights and we all have them I get it do it later\nThere's a lot of people that I'm getting on my show that I have you did with and you know who they are not going to mention their names and they come on now every single week why because we've got to bring everybody together get everybody on the same page for twelve days when this election\n\nBecause we are we are we're working against hundreds of million dollars in swat\nCrazy left wing ours and the entire fake news legacy media network which has a line now behind the Democrats and so that's what you're fighting\nSo fake news is out there and I'm going to say it again you're going to get fake polls which is fake news to drive a fake narrative to get a fake inclusion\nAnd the end game is to get the result they want which is Democrats to take power so they can do what roll back the tax cuts impeached Trump\nGo further with investigations investigate Kavanaugh tied the country up\n\nSo that's my advice do you get involved do something to go to the tax cuts worked out ... I don't care what you do remember how happy you were that night Trump won those of you that\nAre Trump fans opt out there remember how static you were that\nNight and I know the never Trump or his hated it and the Clinton people and the Democrats and listen to my show I Know it all drove you nuts but for those that\nWere believers like me and Trump very happy or that all goes away November sex that to where you have if we lose because we're not gonna be able to do anything and then it it ... it ... it comes back to twenty twenty yet\n\nWe had a real opportunity to fix things in this country and the Democrats don't want to talk about the economy they don't want to talk about job they want to talk about economic growth they don't talk about business confidence in order to talk about all the great things the president is doing they don't want to talk about ISIS is on the run they don't want to talk about the fact that\nNorth Korea has been shut off a missile in months they don't want to talk about the fact that Trump has unilaterally renegotiated every bad trade deals with all this money coming in from time to talk about that\nThey weren't talking about the fact that he renegotiated after an Mexico caved and then candidate caved and sold our way we get better deals it doesn't want to talk about the fact that the Chinese economy", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Red Eye Radio", "city": "Portsmouth", "day": "25"}
