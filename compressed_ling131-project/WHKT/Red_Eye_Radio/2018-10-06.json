some time whenever they whenever they senator maybe this set\nAnd two thousand Nineteen okay this is gonna be the open Mike our will be taking your phone calls for a no shot for eight oh five six for six the boys are back in town\nLet's start with ... and they kept a\nI Know you were so excited about door to the caps game Wednesday night to see the flag\nOn ... world champion Stanley Cup tell us about the experience and Ken the capturing the\n[noise] it was incredible and um [noise] I don't know how to put it into words you know being a caps and my entire life and [noise] the amount of um anguish I think that all caps fans have have had over ... over that time\nUm and the number of times that we were right on the cusp and just couldn't couldn't make it and um it was a great night and a great ceremony and then seven nothing when and yes the cats can repeat I think that actually going to be better this year I think a cloud\nOf pessimism has been lifted from that team [noise] you know John one of the things that I can tell you the season ticket holder that was just so frustrating but you just couldn't break it was in the playoffs you know that we have a great home ice advantage the er the\nGoes out of the stadium because we've seen it happen over and over again\nWe're living in an apartment right in the big game and and and the whole the whole right at the\nEdge media just um I've never seen an arena just goes so last year game seven against Pittsburgh and when we when we went out the ... in in twenty sixteen\nAnd um they went down one nothing and it was like you know one nothing hockey is is nothing nothing and and I mean it was like you're at a funeral that we already lost the game because they were there for a short hair [noise]\nRight [noise] and and and and and that's and now it's like it's lifted and and and you could feel the playoffs last year once we got through Pittsburgh it didn't matter if we went down and again people could still believe in a team and the team could believe in itself I think I think that\nThat the caps in their history was Wayne on the players were they were believing when they went down a goal that they the games where you're from and how they because the fans believe because\nEvery everyone believes it once Pittsburgh got the last year everything changed you could feel the change their I'm Thomas he's taken hold on a season ticket holder we set up four sections away from each other sometimes to each other in the Dunkin' Donuts line between factions [noise]\nUm but um [noise] this is going to be a great era for the caps now I don't think this was a one year thing I think that you look at who's and that's often is young I'm over in in his you know not in the mid mid thirties I think when you're thirty three thirty two\nUm he's going to make a run across the for the ... of all time the regular season is over six hundred rescue the Ninety four he's going to make a serious run it being the number one goal scorer NHL history and the caps have an incredibly bright future\nUm and I'll just end with saying that my dilemma right now I put a thousand dollars and the cap flustered when the Stanley Cup in Las Vegas Fifteen the one we want to in Vegas that the cash for tickets Fifteen thousand dollars when I catch the ticket the person at the counter told me\nThe biggest payout she's ever paid at the sports book\nOr when people will take about like that and roll it over for two or three seasons and she said you know the caps three feet and you wrote this money over it'll be two million dollars by the time they have to repeat so I'm Still having this dilemma for the rest of the season I have not done anything with the money that because it may be that like you know it was just a thousand dollar initial investment\nI might need to roll it over a couple of times because I think the caps are legitimate threat not only to repeat this year to potentially do you have to repeat I'm the only after all every year by year so that's my dilemma but I'm leaning towards the right now I actually think this team is special team and one that um it's going to have a lot of success going forward [noise] well uh\nI get what you're saying I bet the Astros last year to win the world series attendant one as you know because you put to better than in for you and I in fact the ticket we did we didn't just to take it as\nYou have to know you know you gotta play where you were just through your strength and it would be there I think a Ralph one uh [noise]\nI think we're out one by twelve points twelve to Fifteen points I got an ear a in a [noise]\nBlacks district in even more I think in Stuart events district\nAnd uh you know the dynamics are changing in this and it's not just so much a matter of of Trump or anything that demographics and the state or changing and they're changing almost daily\nAnd uh it's obvious which way in Europe they're moving are we going to be like Maryland now we're not going to be like Maryland but were you um northern Virginia is beginning to look more and more northern Virginia suburbs more and more not totally but more and more like the Maryland suburbs\nNational it's not just reached one right after ... nationally and he's kind of various\nRight doesn't say New Jersey suburb send things going on everywhere in Eldorado sorry separate but you're seeing this you're seeing this an awful lot and um I think we have an excellent chance\nAnd no question we're getting help from the guy in the White House whether he will be there or not you know uh I I was joking with Mark Warner and I said you know well we we need them they're just one more election [laughter] you know but I mean it's you know\nUm [noise] generally speaking we've done better [noise] generally speaking when there's been a Republican and the White House they have their print exceptions yes\nGenerally speaking the Republicans have done better when the Democrats been in the White House have there been exceptions yes but the trend is there and son was a mistake of a trend yeah I don't understand and I\nI Would be surprised if we didn't know you know get to Twenty one in the election that are minimum\nI think I I I tend to agree you know it still have to defend a couple of the like you got a couple of comments you got one over on the eastern shore that isn't like I think Republicans can hope that the black sea things they don't have the black\nI I think [noise] far weaker today a competent probably anybody else because he has some personal proclivities and\n... and things that I think that hurts him among some of those voters we have some stronger candidates or black\nOr and I don't know what happens there he's got a hundred and fifty thousand in the banks are like that it sounds like he's ready to go away very quickly but I Will do my advice him and he got nowhere to hold on one of the phone and you want to go out to undefeated not indicted if you could do that and they lost before\nIn ... when he and house delegation and he moved all over the ...\nYou beat him a stream and some very attractive candidate a you are but you've got to issue right for it after the initial matrix there where he has not really thinking or his voting record um [noise] uh to that district\nAnd you've got the state house it fifty one forty nine and some redistricting that's critical happened many many I mean we have to wait and see but maybe working the Democrats' favor [noise]\nUm [noise] I don't mean it would appear that the judges are going to wind up drawing that house district of south Lebanon house districts and I think that's what whatever for me when they come up with that is going to also be what the Senate's going to have to abide by twenty Twenty one\nAnd uh it could change or you know or it could change an awful lot [noise]\nUm you know all the districts are unpacked\nNot totally but below the numbers I mean look what Bobby Scott\nI mean his district one from what fifty some fifty six percent down to you know low forties and I'm a you know produced another democratic district so you're gonna have to see how that plays out\nBut it seems to me that uh the judges drawing that district is by far\nAnd away their their best bet\nAnd if they do you know the Supreme Court I think it ruled before the gerrymandering as is has been constitutionally permissible until spills over and racial discrimination and therein lies the problem and that's what\nThe Republicans are facing there and\nIt's going to change its going to change the way you know a whole makeup of legislatures around the country or it's going to court for a five to\nFour court will view this differently from the records and they don't tell you back if I may be wrong but I think when they sent it back to the lower court it was like seven to ...\nWell I I just say one of the thing is you got to understand the Republican base for better for worse is migrated from your country club with the country in so doing they take no self out of some competitive districts words were economic issues Republicans would be very level\nSo it's not just the demographics of the fact that they have changed the emphasis on issues in ways that help them in southwest Virginia robbery but but it hurts them in the growing parts of the state\nCan we talk about the ... and ... office with a very popular governor with very low negative and you look at ... number ... support amongst Democrats\nWas not popular among Republicans was more polarizing in numbers Ralph Northam has incredibly low negative ads\nFor somebody in this environment you look nationally\nUm here it's very high positives very low negatives um and in going into these competitive seats [noise] um I remember in ... eleven in general construed the state Senate lines and they lost the majority and who was that the person who was in every Republican ... ad that was flipping seats with Bob McDonnell a popular governor\nWe'll hear them these are still national ice races I don't care how you slice of the national environment plays Baltimore that you have to have a messenger boring to celebrate their special I'm turning out the Thomas right the the I mean it that that national same ways very heavily you know which is why you've had you know the the patterns that you've had\nUntil McCarthy Cuccinelli I mean you know what happened almost fifty year I'm In I'm In I'm In here about the surveys like let's take for example that started in the ... feet was not driven by national politics and twenty fifth and it was driven by local politics in Chesterfield versus Richmond and I'd like to be democratic\nUm and I think that we and we know who you're for data more aggressive candidate but we don't have we had it it's in campaigns don't matter you know I don't think we had to I don't think we had a great messenger there I think if you rerun that same race in twenty Nineteen and you had Ralph Northam auntie\nI'm In that district Raul patrol not going to be as they are they all vote the votes would stardom and it's chaos is going to create problems for them\nYeah I think that's a greater problem is that he's he's he's not harmonious with their district on some of the top button issue I just say that like Rob working good governor I think it's a wonderful man but he gives a fireside chat in a fire goes down you put him on TV it it it's not the same kind of rally the team but he laughed at\nMe give you didn't even have to use that ... I don't I you know what I did not it is that's the kind of governor you actually need this and he picked up not a fiery he picked up Fifteen seats I mean I think\nYou're turning the color it's fiery and um you know carnival Barker one and and he doesn't he doesn't pick up the flavor up north I'm dead\nWell north and didn't pick 'em up Trump picked him up for him yet if Trump would have been president and twenty Fifteen we'd be in the majority\nLook I don't I don't want to wish on Ralph Northam disagree however I think he's been very blessed you say the\nChemical upon by three points and rapport with him on by eight and ... pick up near us heats up north and picked up ... step I point difference with not Fifteen ... but it was also hotel different let me tell you the\nWhite House mistake about it\nTrump okay I was a driving factor sure last November\nOn top of that [noise] um [noise] you had a ... and it spilled over into everything [noise] and keep in mind Gillespie was not true but you know I mean he was very polarizing [noise] but um\nI just think people keep underestimating as governor\nOh I don't think anybody on the rest of the ... I don't think anybody underestimate same but make no it was I mean you know what's driving politics in Virginia right now\nIs not a Ralph [noise] uh it's it's what's going on across the Potomac River\nIt's negativity is driving politics on both sides right now in the one thing about Robert and he doesn't have any negative [noise] doesn't have any ... he's a very likely to Austin immigrant\nOr not you know I've now go you know been knocking on doors since may I have not gotten one negative comment\nAbout Ralph none\n[noise] yeah it's not use it probably is you know I I agree with that he is an asset but he's not a fire reader that gets voted off for\nYou know I I think Tom Davis is not a fire leader that got to build up for the Republicans for Twenty years\nEvery single Republican Lippi she would have thought the person was married to Tom Davis because the Republican candidate had his picture bigger than their own picture with a quote him saying like here's what it'd be great for your time sometimes without my permission um so I mean having a messenger is important and Democrats are not had good years later that Ralph Northam is the first time in a\nOr wrong I I agree but now he's taken out an incumbent that we are not entirely different that\nI don't know I tell you what man I I'm actually Joe Joe is kind of beat or do you guys under estimating Morsi and I'm telling you what he had a disastrous press conference I wasn't there and it was a\nDisaster of all time so he had a disastrous press conference that really hurt them there's all kinds of underhanded things going on but you know after that\nMorsi's mayor and [noise] you know the the thing about ... is he's an independent thinker he's got to do with the only way it's a you know he's not\nHe's not a whole bunch of any of the establishment caucuses or anything\nI think you've got to play very well in that district and I think a lot of uh of friends there that I don't think that he got screwed by what they did to him and and take\nConnected you almost did the smartest thing I've ever seen anyone to in politics when he won the was it I think it was the McEachern one Mickey chintzy on each and moved up\nI think and in that primary people and think he was going to win that primary crowded field\nAny more than a landslide networks people are asking what do you know he went around and after he knocked on doors at you know and I wrote a handwritten notes every voter he spoke to the data that for a week and a half before the election in the context that he had remembered the conversation\n... kept these postcards for six months and send them all out ten days before the election with a handwritten note from him talking about how their conversation and you know I met your dog Sam or you're a teacher here and I remember that conversation and do you know hope I can count on your support next Tuesday and\nPeople can out in droves I mean for him to go do that though and I see people read postcards but I've never seen one posting them to make it appears that months later okay what companies didn't I'm Tom Davis does everything better than anyone in politics\nBut [noise] but he did not the end and he won a landslide and like have been done before it really wasn't on arrest me Joe I'm just saying taken on income\nThere's not going to be four or five people in that race either gonna just to I'm not an expert on that's the big difference you know if we had you know there's a whole lot of people have gotten in the journal suddenly because we don't have run all in this day a hole and you won't have that you'll just have to people in there\nAnd she's well why [noise]\nI don't think I if I had the gas and I have to be totally wrong with us and in that district and I guess that Ross dams have extremely low name id pardon I Would guess that route dancers extremely low name id and that if you test it they have a gym or see it and they may not to say the palm pilot I'm just [noise] but like in terms of I'd name id\nRichard Nixon had our name on\nIt [laughter] you know I mean like I don't think rises like real superstar the Senate\nJak hung up you know Joe and I know Joe Rochefort answers gotta get out out work something like Fifteen or twenty to one okay Joe was up there knocking on doors are making phone calls now\nBetween the basketball primary too in that primary like Dick was independent district for Twenty years before I got drawn to safety product basically has a concept of campaigning and knocking on doors and doing the things that you do when you're in a competitive politically\nVery Seventy percent of the vote my district against Mondale yeah\nRoss never been in ... you have a Confederate says she's never\nAnd you got to ask you before and she's got to get out of work I mean Jones got out worker he's fighting Joe he's gotta he's gotta worker and the other thing is I hear the going gets I'm telling you he was going\nTo get a set the there's the sympathy vote out there for the fact that the power banks enrichment screwed this guy out of the livelihood\nAnd that's that's real I mean you got screwed I mean what he pulled his long life it was senator Stanley told me the whole thing is that ... vote but [noise] it was pulling out what happened there was a total bologna and\nIt was because uh it was it was because he challenged the Richmond system that's what happens that's why they pulled him and so I don't remember that\nLike you know there are a lot of people in that area that have an in literature loyalty to the gym or the the reason he does well there's a lot of people there that he has represented and when families\nHave had a time of need you know the attorney that went through the criminal defense attorney to help out someone in their family was Joe Morsi and that created the level of loyalty he had they [noise]\nI I'm not ready to call this one one way or the other yet\nBut um he has a real base [noise] it's it's across that district from being an attorney [noise] I'm In the same way that Donald McEachin you know when he when he ran rubber on his running\nYou know even as a primary challenge of what three times two incumbents are twice twice as the challenger didn't come in Delhi gets been one to the challenger don't come and senator\nAnd and the teacher was the guy who everyone news on TV it was a lawyer um he had to help so many people in the community it didn't matter that he was a challenge or two and a comment um that's how they live there\nPull interest in the communities where they don't know who to turn to joy Morsi has been the guy who's defending their nephew there's time um you know against major charges he's one of the top defense attorneys there so I've just I I think that it's an interesting race in in ... we got to see you know we'll round even run again\nWe don't let me look you had the twenty Twenty one the governorship or when it comes comes through in a lot of um determine who's White Houses that dynamic and so on but when north um goes well the attorney general Montana governor clashes that who else is looking at this at this point in the Democratic party or as I Know I mean\nThere there's a name pops up now and then very oh I was not out of the picture you know I Would imagine you're on the you know of course but [noise] our [noise] I Would hope that herring in Fairfax get things worked out for not contesting nomination but [noise]\nWhen you got a lot of people in the back looking for upward mobility to get the mayor of Richmond in the bar stony you've got some other ones just him getting her yellow sitting there on you'll have a primary\nAnd you'll get to see if it's a\nSuccess ... can be dangerous is only I think you've only a\n... as long as you don't have a two way right [noise] uh\nBetween Fairfax area and uh I think that if a if it's if it's one of them against the whole batch of other people when [noise] uh you know the Fairfax\nCounty somebody out there like you guys are talking about herring and a Fairfax you're not talking about large stony who was absolutely going to do something because the other person you're not talking about\nWho can pull the upset in a two or three person race and that's kind of like Alexander mayor of from Norfolk right now who is three way primary against to progress is trying to allow liberal left wing each other\nKenny Alexander comes in business guy business track record and the mold of hope water businessman ... column in the sky ridiculous why\nThat's ridiculous first of all there's I don't think that there's as if there's a moderate right or the Democratic primary is any way for the first piece safety but the ... the second one in a rough needs to be your state\nThey're not going to line up behind Caroline Kennedy is a good friend but they're going to either line up behind the ear herring for Fairfax whereabouts stony and I don't even know I don't I don't I didn't know that are the same thing with all of our record guy people liking but they're either going to go with one of those too\n[laughter] [laughter] well how ... going to be a Republican anyway Trump's going to be gone and twenty twenty I was going to want to get [noise] ... I mean first years of president is really the same\nType of campaign that Gillespie or ... you write a Republican won't win that governorship you can't ... I'm telling you you know it's graceful\nJak Republican ever win again in Virginia well how do you how do they want is money\nFor Hogan how'd you account for a Christie how do you account for I grew up you know in in ... in Massachusetts I mean you know governorships in particular are not parliamentary rate and people make and you know you know\nBut but let me tell you something as long as people in the Republican Party keep trying to turn over a a political neck or the expense of somebody's car or somebody ethnicity or somebody's religion\nIt ain't going anywhere I Would agree with you there and in till they get away from that you bet well and they should be reject\nOr they gotta I gotta check their from a Senator Bill Stanley he says never bet against fighting Joe so you'll Stanley agrees with me\nYeah he was a it skews may tell Stanley that we know who is Joe ... lawyer huh bill Stanfield Stanley yeah yeah okay what's that going to do a little biased\n[laughter] you know speaking of seeking a statewide races I didn't feel family going to be a very dangerous candidate for attorney general [noise] um if he's very like you have to run 'em and if he runs for attorney general gets the Republican nomination I think he's going to be very dangerous can't well if he doesn't run he'll get the nomination but he has to run\nWhat Republican problems here you can't come out of your [noise]

don't I don't see why she would\nHow you can convict somebody based on what just not even convicts anybody but this guy's applying for the highest court in a land he's not applying for a job or

operation got nobody's talking about taking away the guy's liberty and putting them in jail that's a that's a different issue than it is you know in the way down to Republicans\nAnd that Trump would put up somebody can come come out and say he did something to me forty years ago I have no evidence no corroboration and that's\nYou know they didn't say something that's a sexual assault was entirely different issue and you've got to put yourself in the context of the time in the place and back then in the Nineteen eighties wasn't some people can't afford\nIt don't they don't come for nearly as much today about it they showed that they back then when I was in high school you know that kind of thing people and\nYou didn't hear about the broader look she but externally incredible yeah very emotional ... and and I do think that I think that taking that extra week going back and interviewing some of the people more judging others around it\nI think with with the right thing I think's slam dunk in this thing or the day after her would have been terrible politics and would have been terrible on the institution\nHaving said that nobody else can remember the party was there ... there's just too many holes to really make the case that doesn't mean she's wrong but but that's a tough standard for the future you know everybody can come forward and say anything\nNot to say that but I just wanted to go back within six days and remember after she testified Chris Wallace on Fox News and the president talked about how credible she was an old public operatives protect everybody right after she testified this is done it's over cheese toast\nBack to what we're talking about before either we've gotten this cooperation sidebar mansions blast over mentioned I think had him up Fifteen I Want to say\nNow that he's up by five percent of black but I saw a poll last week that I'm a fair thing that's that's all the polls you read when they're asking you to do that on our news or he certainly is not a production by ...\nBy either under fifty well under well under shift and I and I think what you got remembering this is if you don't know an independent consultant ... I think this is for him this this changes the outcome if he was right yeah I I Can't\nI ... and I'm not an expert on West Virginia but it seems meet Joe Manchin soul position that I'm an independent God I'm not beholden to either side and uh\nI I think it would be hard for him to get reelected it would seem to me in a what a Trump when the state by like fifty point something like that\nAnd I'm not I'm not so not convincing Susan Collins and going to run again either\nAnd I don't know that that I think is what if I'm not ... but she says she's never voted against the Supreme Court judge ever you have any group in the state that has put a million dollars up saying and less she votes against millionaire spent\nYeah okay now it's up to a million and a half ago find me but then it looks like a bribe but I'm I mean I think at the end of the day without corroboration she's going to be there for for for when she got really ... not only twenty twenty twenty is she going to run again well should make that decision at the appropriate time [noise]\nI I think I think Tom now that I think she's going to vote yes on the one that I have no read on the top Davis is I'm Lisa Murkowski of\nWhat about what about you [noise] pretty independent I mean just remember this when she lost that primary to Joe Miller the last Republican primary she run is they write again with the name Murkowski battling it\nStarted and ended up and also as you want to laugh but you know made the part about the independents pizza when you guys mentioned when it's because they claim they're they're reelected ... looking out for their state right mhm yeah and Murkowski has a big issue with the cabinet opinion about Alaskan natives I think was something that you know when\nShe ... she she she does on on that issue so no it's not clear cut I haven't seen the polling in Alaska or they but they I think if you get ... like I think you're going to get flaky booed him out of committee directly without some crap ration Jeff Jeff is fundamentally\nVery concerned right you got to be water Institute He's also very independent and I think a very principled guy which is why people making flaky because he doesn't always taken one boxing\nIs always predictable but this judged if you've got to understand for Republicans this unites us there's this is a very important building in the court\nAs it is on the Democrats on the other side are wanting somebody else\nCan I ask you a question has a has a a vice president were broken a tire on a Supreme Court nominees how can I not that I'm aware\nOf yeah I think that would be unprecedented ...\nThat can and that will kind of a challenge that but it's still count how do you know that\nIt just sort of thing you talked to she just doesn't advise and consent and there's got to be no ... or you want to eat for president\nVirginia his nomination off [laughter] yeah I've never had already lawsuit there's already a lawsuit challenging the whole procedure on the other Democrats\nAnd if he's confirmed that they're going to do and they take over the house or the Senate to move to impeach that would\nBe a disaster two thirds of the Senate good luck [noise]\nYes I just I'm like I think you're going to get around and I'm\nOf elections have consequences that when I take away but here's ... let's get the Republicans in Minnesota stealing Supreme Court to [noise] well I like all of a little more and fall Trump one here's the problem I still can't get over the fact that Trump won two years later he's still can't get over ... let me think what\nAm I Am married Garland well let me let me talk about America I think might bite every indication is a very honorable three four would have made a good Supreme Court judge in in the traditional sense with these balance teeth knocked completely a liberal Democrat property before going to win bench but but met the criteria for free judge\nBut what is better not holding a hearing on are doing what they've done in this case and that it's bringing is putting the sham of of hearing him and then finding a way to trashes reputation and voting no they weren't there to confirm it it was election year Republican senators were confirmed school we used to eat and putting on a more liberal members just wasn't going to happen\nIn a presidential Charleston here not a mentor\nWho who knows who knows what the rules are writing about it but it's the president's it's the president United States who nominates of waiting for the frame court out the ... so therefore I think McConnell's argument is out when he says look a that was a presidential election yeah lots of voters decide that ...\nBut I'm just saying that they stretch it each time I don't know who started it but it keeps getting worse and worse and worse\nAnd once you do it for one year you could do it two years you could do it three years I I don't know gardening guard rails on this I think it was they moved it from sixty votes to fifty votes for everything but the Supreme Court of course they're going to do it for the Supreme Court is me there are new guard rails anymore on this and that's what's scary\nAre they

about the electoral repercussions when you're doing is you're kicked the hornet's nest Republican base that was kind\nOf depressed at this point in what you've seen now in in terms of the energy base of both parties the enthusiasm gap is closed and that's critical Democrats a couple of times\nAt least you know I mean I get when you look nobody wants to have a somebody that is uh doing sexual has a sexual assault get off of it\nWe want people to come over here it's okay you have public because it's almost like a thousand or or the guy who's the guy in the ravens beat up his girlfriend and ... by

into the primary for attorney general I said this is not right the way he's doing it um\nAnd it shows you should be that's the end and not you've been missing in general but it is it and it it it is bad because a lot of people will look the other way and he should not be the number two person on the Democratic\nNational Committee right but this is the Supreme Court and you\nCredible accuser and

wanted\nTo I don't think this is an allegation I mean I I I think we know it I think that when you look at you know um people have put a lot of holes in the story of the the third accuser um and I think that you know you obviously have to hear both sides of\nYou know when an user comes forward of their credibility this visits user everything she has said you can cooperate with what she had done

what they can about catching their say everything that you said it's been ...\nI don't even know what's true anymore yeah\nThat's harsh on the line I I don't even know I think her testimony was a compelling test my bed I give you value everybody watched that but I thought he was too and if my reputation for being trashed I'd be a little emotional ... as as well what happens\nNow everybody's back in the corners this is a very divided country what it has done indigent equalize the enthusiasm gap which were in the Democrats' favor prior to that I've heard of that and and that is the politics of this we can argue forever just got to be a good judge in history will tell back\nBut it's really not a ... this was a certain this was a circus I think it's diminished the book the

going to be enough to come back and you don't take this guy out for the Democrats and on same on the Republican side so we'll have a vote tomorrow I think it passes in in in your your move on\n'em and

don't think it's not as much as the Republicans are claiming that has I think that there was some are more than ...\nThey're not you know in our internal polling\nSure as you as you know like you know pulling motion noise and it while this is going on there and and the reality is rougher and the and the reality is that if you are correct and he's going to get confirmed that there's not going to be a Republican boost from this and the election in fact it will be the opposite it's going to add to the army I'm\nMark ... democratic until he was already at an eleven I mean I\nI don't think that's

[laughter]\nI go to just go to treat that added a thirty are driven Tom Davis ... Peterson and you've got a lot of the truth you John just rhetoric let's get to the other races let's get to the seven I just had Barbara I just said Abigail Spanberger on my show\nYesterday she's a very complex candidate no doubt but ah I see a little momentum going for a day but I didn't think he was going to win a week ago now I I think he is going to win a ban how do you see that race [noise]\nSo I I had that one that slightly new Republican up until the Kavanaugh hearings at this point I think it's a toss up on because what the capital here instead was really re energized and fire up the one voter block\nThat's the problem for Dave Brat in some district which is suburban women um and\nI think that the seven districts historically Republican should be a Republican if the Republican ... um so I could last year but I'm the one path or a Democrat there isn't an right to in Chesterfield with the suburban women um and I think Abigail the match for them\nAnd I think that the Republicans are doing everything they can to lose that block naturally right now um and so I haven't it's tough\nThink binge drinking Kool Aid on his cabinet nominations in terms of I mean I interrupt let me just say yeah in in terms of what this is doing politically and I think we all live in our own echo chambers and we all have our own perceptions of how it's done but what this is done in the nearest polling and some other polling\nChemistry ... is the Republican base is now activated enthusiasm gap which is favored the Democrats for the last year and a half is now closed substantially\nAnd I think that works to perhaps paper they bred has two two issues though outside the demographics\nThe district in the DNA that district is Republican number one he is not close the deal with some of cancers people and they were just assume thrown under the bus and rent that she'd out for two years\nAnd bring back or ... you know somebody it's more in line with their thinking and and even some scores and secondly Tim Kaine is good or be exceptionally strong in that district he was mayor of Richmond if he has a political he's widely ...\nThat had an ... that's the I think that's right this this jacks up that democratic turnout there so you got a factor that into this thing I still think at the end of the day that the DNA of that district establishes itself and bright wins but but this was a close race from Democrats have nominated medical care she's variable\nAnd or or whatever happens you're talking about a study that's got to be involved in democratic politics for some time I think I think Abigail Spanberger is going to have got to be somebody that has got to be reckoned with a and a democratic circles for some time shop\nDot dot you know I don't I don't know a ton about the district uh uh you know I Will say I was driving down to south opportunity to go to an event last weekend and going through some of the rural counties and it seems like you're brat can pull Marjah down those counties are but obviously the critical mass of the the district is in Chesterfield men right goes so\nYou know I I Would probably say you know robotically it's a Republican district but obviously if it's a wave here than it could be one that the Democrats deal than would after defended twenty twenty\nOr let's get to the second district Taylor Maria\nWhatever happened with a tale of the other day I had him on my radio show or the a campaign put my [noise] my name and their team TV ads so I appreciate the PR for that what's going on in that race but\nThis is my first chance to respond to Scott right after he had a meltdown on your show on that went viral yet I'm Upset about our analysis last time\nUm and now France has not changed she still does [noise] um and um I don't think I don't believe in New York Times book I think it was you know I I ... up to this point I'd up near terminals were pretty good at the last week they've they've not been um I think there's some noise going on\nI'm ... I think there is going to win and she's going to win going away [noise] um so I think she's going to win going away I think it's going to be\nA [noise] a secular up until two months ago I was doing everything right um and he's really blown it\nAnd he's not going to win reelection and so are you saying because of the whole the validate the Israeli citizenship issue and the way he's handled it and remember that this district is one of the few in the country\nThat not only sits in the ... side a media market but is in a medium market that doesn't really stretch too many other districts so the media has been all over this this on the evening news every night you know\nIf Barbara Comstock had a petition scandal and attempt district it would have made D.C TV for forty five seconds one night\nOr maybe a week later they quickly re mentioned that you know it goes way you you cannot get away\nWith something like the tide water it's been on the road so let me let me look I think are the New York times for property rights cater is fixed that district very well\nOn you know it was a Navy SEAL all kinds of stuff is is the issue matrix and he has chosen I think you're in line with that district is not a far right kind of guy he understands a suburban Virginia Beach in those areas so we have all that\nDemocrats are very very good candidate and you have a year that favors Democrats ... ... what's ... as a Republican what scares me about this is the fact that if you look nationally Democrats just a ton of cash\nAnd dropping a couple of million dollars on that race in the last week that megaphone just can overwhelm at this point in exaggerate these things I think\nI think New York times pulls correct Huntington up today a again if are betting I I I think he wins but in this environment with a kind of money Democrats put down a you've got to be nervous about that if you're going to watch this on election night if the Democrats win this seat\nIt tells me it's going to be a pretty good year farm in terms of we're talking thirty five forty so yeah I think about [noise]\nThe thing about this district is different than Comstock and it's definitely different than a brat\nIs the turnout model is totally different and I think it's hard for Democrats to win the seat and are not presidential year I just based on who votes democratic and Virginia Beach Norfolk it's you know the the typical democratic voters going to be a minority down there and unless you get an outsized performance it's not\nI think it's tough for the Democrats to win that seat I mean Glenn Nye one or two thousand they he got washed down the drain and twenty ten\nAnd the reason was democratic vote came out in the presidential year for Brock Obama it wasn't there the next cycle for Glenn Nye 'cause nobody knew when I was [noise] um I think Scott Scott advantages that the turnout I remember back when I was in the house caucus we'd look at the turnout model the numbers and [noise]\nYou know Virginia Beach in Norfolk the numbers are just forty percent of what they are in other parts of the state so it's just it's it's you got a lot of people that live there that are you know enlisted men or women that are registered to vote elsewhere so it's just it's hard you know to have to bring people out\nIn that type of environment even though it's bench correct you have one media market and\nYou know they could possible Scott from now till the end of the time but there's going to be a conservative there's going to be a conservative votes is going to come out\nAnd whether I'm a ... Maria I don't know how to pronounce it Luria whether or not you can get people out based on her name as opposed to you know Tim Kaine is not as big a magnet there as he is enrichment um so I I still think it's a pill for the Democrats even though I agree it looks like Scott's kind of botched this one issue\nNineteen Ninety six and Tom Davis one member this well um we had a scandal um state wide where John ... put a television ad up against Mark Warner who is John Boehner was far ahead and um he photo shop Mark Warner and do a picture\nOr who's in the picture and I can't remember who we do to stop what he thought it was up but Clinton I think yeah associated with Clinton but was it was while her when I was glad there was a racial aspect to it too I Can't remember what they did but they sort of shut Mark Warner into a picture he wasn't in\nAnd I'm In a TV ad and it was a huge but national scandal for John Warner who had a moderate brand and was a guy that\nYou know everyone looked she likes you know what you're trying to say Scott Taylor is\nThere like had a friend okay and and and that people you know like respected John Warner much higher than Scott Taylor them [noise] and and his numbers collapse\nAnd he said I'm a needy person and and the captain of my ship and I'm responsible for what happened and I apologize and it's got telling her done that he would run around\nSo I just I was worse campaign chairman that year and it was a it was a close race Merck more than fourteen million dollars on Monday Night here that means is really a much closer race than it might have been otherwise good strong when it was used on beat him and that was put on the map and you kind of earn it after running a close race there but I remember it out and I really fired\nThe people that were involved in the ad and everything else in your brokered in it it was an issue for a week or two and then John took accountability you took accountability [noise] fate or he's mishandled this thing I think it's just kind of destruction and having his people take the Fifth Amendment doesn't help for just keep it in the news\nIs that enough to bring down somebody with a good reputation has done a good job in their first term or not\nUm and also I think the wave turnout are they talking about a ... I think you're really talking about a ... that's really what's happening with the Democrats is that the suburban female voters have swung radically or to the Democratic party and that's\nAll right we're going to take up we'll get our predictions rolling it back the next segment we're got to get to the reds yes yes I Would\nAnd libertarians to automatic ballot access to the next five years in Virginia which ... which are the Republicans that was going to expire this year because ... percent again rather than the Korean Stewart there'll be another five years the libertarian automatic ballot access while\nThey're great and why does that that is a good point and the fact what is going to get over five no no question probably seven Godfather's here to tell me what it was John you'd think you'd think Barbara going to win or lose uh [noise]\nUh what what ... what about\nMaria [noise] you know what's going on [noise] and uh a CEO work [noise]\nAnd ah [noise]\nA terrorist got nothing but negative publicity from a over the last several months and I don't see 'em climbing out of that whole could be wrong but I don't see that and I also don't [noise]\nI mean there are a cop stock can talk about her internal all she wants that's not what people were picking up going door to door [noise] so what have you heard of that risk\nDoors I'm not talking about you know are going to try to bolster the Democratic both are going to democratic doors\nThat those people are telling her there with her\nAnd when they on occasion they've asked what's the main complaint [noise] uh and this was before Kavanaugh's talking about it since then [noise] uh it was the n._r._a. [noise] those ads have been effective but this capping off thing\nI mean that's all you know the door to door and that's all I get\nThat far apart [laughter] [noise] but just gotta go we've we've we've got to get around [noise] yup we've got to be getting Monday Night right Carolina right hunt you start with where they are early in the right you have to be happy so far\nYeah generally happy I think the defence like I said a month ago yawn fast a good ... and they're going to get better I think they're deep Pence will get better [noise] um I I think they need to give a couple of guys more snaps a couple of guys less naps but\nBy and large I liked their defense to be a top ten defenses year into the next few years going forward that makes it for us\nI think they do they have one issue they need to solve and I can solve it if they listen to me they all week on the end they don't have any big play receivers that can go down catch the ball you know catch eight balls for a hundred yards\nAnd you need to have that too when consistently in the NFL you can't just keep throwing too you're tied into your backs especially with a\nTight I'd like Jordan read the genetically going to get injured it comes down to\nDesert is on the street [noise] he's bet on the streets I in you know Bruce was my from Brazil I emailed him literally within twelve hours of being caught by Dallas [noise] begging begging them to pick up and as I have repeated it every time I said um [noise]\nThe day he sets foot on Redskins park you'll be their number one receiver\nThey could get rid of Josh Fox and yes I said it\nThey could keep Jamieson and crowded in the slot they can get that keep decade records and that there are number two receiver who's fast but then you need a big receiver who can pull down eight nine temples a game for a hundred yards desk and do it and so if they put him on the team they will be the best team the NFC East and will make the playoffs sweat it out\nDallas lakes losing um I think it's [laughter] you know they don't like to when they like to lose a why did you know why do they do what they do either keep Jason geared as head coach you know I mean\nWhy do they get rid of Tony Romo and it's just I I think somewhere Jerry Jones just decided he was tired of winning and water and start losing for a while and so that's that's why does what he does\nThat what what do you think that I mean is that the answers that dependency [noise]\nI I'm I'm favorable and dance and I can't believe we're talking about the Redskins are not referring to them as the first place [noise] yeah that's true first place and a phrase for ah like the first place type\nThat's right I I'm going to say this point a lot better than I thought they'd be this year still very very tough schedule next week I'm going to say nine and seven and ...\nThis year so I'm not in the ...\nOr one of the things it's always heard that over ... you're going to the game since Ninety four and

see one thing I can see quite a challenge\nOn them I mean he does he kinda fits what they're\nThe whole crew in philosophy is now crowded out a win games [noise] and I think that I think the things that got a winter games are they they could get in the playoffs the dangerous [noise]\nI got I got to sign off I got to be in court today okay thank you for sharing your events I asked ... let me just quickly add the unemployment down to three point seven percent the lowest since Nineteen sixty nine Lourdes is Nineteen [noise]\nWhich you know I Can't tell stories are not going to get a raise can comment on this really quickly John [noise] this is it's an amazing that but not for the reason the Republicans wanted you to be making that because people say nothing sticks on Trump\nAnd I think it's the opposite I think everything's on Trump the fact that you have an economy that's as good as it is and he's having a good to have a bad of an election as he pointed out everything is sticking to him because you should have with the economy [noise]\nOne of the first times when the president picks up see if it was an economy election [noise] um the Republicans could act\nEconomic performance and the biggest gains in the high income areas are the ones turning against in the faster so for people to say nothing sticks to Trump everything sticking to try [noise] well I think he get credit for the economy and I think [noise]\nI think he gets credit for the economy and I think that mitigate so against the law says they take just because of the ... the cycle but these\nCoalitions are basically cultural collisions they're not economic coalition and\nAs I said the Democratic enthusiasm and the independents wanting to balance the government is really what hurts the Republican [noise] people don't trust the Republicans to have the eastern and you want some kind of check on Trump's yeah he's doing okay they may vote for him in two years\nBut in the mid term they want to put a check on [noise] I I Will say this I think the Democrats take the house is I think it's more likely than not\nAh I I don't know how they don't impeach the president when it comes out you've got the Democratic base right now is rabbit they want to impeach him now before\nMotors a mission and when you [noise] I I don't know how Democrats going back to their primaries in twenty twenty ... not to impeach Trump I I just think that happens in rent for two\nHours each or whether they have any any reasonable evidence or not\nBecause you're like they have a lot of them think they have reasonable evidence now I don't know what more is going to say you know what he's going to say um but I just think you look at the base and you look at the fact that the primary elections or what most of these members worry about that it's politics are girls going to do it I'm not arguing the sugar ... takes on Capitol Hill yeah\nWell I I think what happens is it changes the dynamic for twenty Nineteen it was one thing and twenty Seventeen Trump's than Republicans controlled everything to put a check on him\nWhat the Democrats come in Congress like our class of Republicans in Nineteen Ninety four it kind of their lives you know it's the under Clinton he played off against the Republican\n... yeah she did better than they would do it yeah and I have some of that dynamic and twenty Nineteen that's the way that the Democrats have real that window there back in twenty Seventeen you won't have that same level of wind and twenty a Nineteen now there are other factors matter of fact\n\nWant to call

our will be taking your phone calls for you know John for eight out five six for six the boys are back in town let's start with Ben sherbet and the caps a\nI Know you were so excited about joining the caps game Wednesday night to see the flag\nAnd for all the world champion Stanley Cup tell us about the experience and kinda kept strictly\n[noise] it it was incredible and um [noise] I don't know how to put it into words now [noise] you know being a cap stand my entire life and [noise] the amount of um English I think they're all caps fans have\nHave had over ... over that time um and the number of times that we were right on the ... couldn't couldn't make it and um it was a great night and a great Germany [noise] and then seven nothing when and yes the cats can repeat I think that actually going to be better this year I think a cloud\nOf pets medicines been lifted from that team you know John one of the things that I can tell you the season ticket holder that was just so frustrating but you just couldn't break it was in the playoffs you know that we have a great home ice advantage\nAnd the race cars out of the stadium because we've seen it happen\nOver and over again we're moving in the fire right living in the big game in and and the whole the whole I mean it just um I've never seen an arena just goes so\nLast year game seven against Pittsburgh in ... when we when we went out to ... in in twenty sixteen and um they went down one nothing and it was like you know one nothing hockey is nothing nothing and and I mean you like you're at a funeral that we already lost the game because they were there for a short\nHaired [noise]\nRight [noise] and and and and and that's and now it's like it's lifted\nAnd and and you could steal the playoffs last year once we got through Pittsburgh it didn't matter if we went down and again people could still believe in the team and the team could believe in itself I think I think the\nThe the caps in their history\nWas Wayne on the players were they were believing when they went down a goal that\nThe the games where you from the editor and how they because the fans believe\nFor every everyone believes it and I once Pittsburgh got the last year everything changed you could feel the change their I'm Thomas a season ticket holder on a season ticket holder we set up four sections away from each other sometimes to each other in\nThe Dunkin' Donuts line between factions [noise] um but um [noise] this is going to be a great era for the caps now I don't think this was the one thing I think that\nYou look at who's that's often is young\nI'm obey is in his you know not in the mid mid thirties I think when you're thirty three thirty two\nUm [noise] he's gonna make a run a grassy for the most goals scored of all time the regular season he's over six hundred ... ... Ninety four he's going to make a serious round that being the number one goal scorer NHL history and the caps have an incredibly bright future\nUm and I'll just end restraint is my dilemma right now\nI put a thousand dollars and the cats last year when the Stanley Cup in Las Vegas Fifteen to one we want to in Vegas that the cash for tickets Fifteen thousand dollars when I catch the ticket the person at the counter told me the biggest payout she's ever paid at the sports book\nOr when people will take about like that and roll it over for two or three seasons and she said you know the caps repeat and you wrote us money over it'll be two million dollars by the time they have a three so I'm Still having this dilemma for the rest of the season I have not done anything with the money yet because it may be that like you know it was just a thousand dollar initial investment\nI might need to roll it over a couple of times because I think the caps are legitimate threat not only to repeat this year to touch the do you have to repeat I'm the only after all that every year by year so that's my dilemma but I'm leaning towards the right now I actually think this team is a special team and one that um is going to have a lot of success going\nForward [noise] well\nI think what you're saying I bet the Astros last year to win the world series attendant one as you know because you put Tibetan event in for you and I in fact the ticket we did we didn't just the ticket as\nA several others I mean you know we're not going to spread it all out all over the state [noise] um [noise]\nYou have to know you know you gotta play where you were just to your strengths and it would be there I think a Ralph one uh [noise]\nI think we're out one by twelve points twelve to Fifteen points I got an ear a in a [noise]\nBlacks district in even more I think in Stuart events district and uh you know the dynamics are changing it's and it's not just so much a matter of of Trump or anything the demographics in this state are changing and they're changing almost daily [noise] and\nAh it's obvious which way you know they're moving are we going to be like Maryland no we're not going to be like Maryland but we um northern Virginia is beginning to look more and more in northern Virginia suburbs more and more not totally but more and more like the Maryland suburbs\nNational it's not just reached let me write happening naturally in these kinds of various\nRight as I said New Jersey suburb stand things going on everywhere amount of sites everywhere but you're seeing this you're seeing is an awful lot and um I think we have an excellent chance\nAnd no question we're getting help from the guy in the White House whether he'll be there or not you know uh uh I I was joking with Mark Warner and I said you know we well we we need them they're just one more election [laughter] you know but I mean it's you know\nI'm a generally speaking we've done better generally speaking when there's been a Republican and the White House have there been exceptions yes\nGenerally speaking the Republicans have done better when the Democrats spending the White House has there been exceptions yes but the trend is there\nAn unmistakable try and understand and I I\nI Would be surprised if we didn't know you know get to Twenty one in the end of the election at a minimum\nKnow I think I I I tend to greet you still have to defend a couple of states like you got a couple of comments he got one over on the eastern shore that is in play I think Republicans\nCan hold the black seats if they don't have the black I think that is far weaker today a competent probably anybody else because he has some personal proclivities and [noise]\nAnd I think that I think that hurts him a among some of those voters we have some stronger candidates or black\nOr and I don't know what happens there you've got a hundred and fifty thousand in the bank so why doesn't sound like he's ready to go way very quickly but I I Will do my advice to him and he got no when ... when the phone and you want to go out to undefeated non diet if you could do that and they lost before in mountain when and how\nYou want to in your career because I I think you beat him a German some very attractive candidate a you are but you've got some issue ... after the initial matrix there where he has not really too early voting record um [noise] ah to that district and you got the state house at\nFifty one forty nine into redistricting that's critical happened many many I mean we have to wait and see but may work and the Democrats thinks that\nThe [noise] um [noise] I mean it would appear that the judges are going to wind up throwing their house district as health eleven house districts\nAnd I think that's what whatever formula they come up with that is going to a also be what the Senate's going to have to abide by twenty Twenty one and uh it could change or you know it could change an awful lot [noise]\nUm you know a part of the districts are unpacked not totally but below the numbers I mean look what Bobby Scott him in his district one from what fifty fifty six percent down to\nYou know low forties and I'm a [noise] you know produced another democratic district\nSo you're gonna have to see how that plays out but it seems to me that uh the judges drawing that district is by far and away their their best bet\nAnd if they do you know Supreme Court I think it ruled before the gerrymandering is is has been constitutionally permissible until it spills over in racial discrimination and therein lies the problem and that's what the Republicans are facing\nThere and it's going to change its going to change the way you know a whole makeup of legislatures\nAround the country of course the new court for a five to four or\nWill do this differently because of the record back if I may be wrong but I think when they send it back to the lower court it was like seven to initially but I just think one of the thing is you can understand the Republican\nBase for better for worse is migrated from the country club the country and in so doing they taking yourself out of some competitive districts where these are economic issues Republicans would be very viable [noise]\nSo it's not just the demographic stabilize the fact that they have changed the emphasis on issues in ways that helping in southwest Virginia but but it hurts them in growing parts of the state\nCan we talk about the ... not an office [noise] very popular governor with very low negative and you look at ... number ... ... support amongst Democrats\nWas not popular among Republicans but more polarizing in numbers Ralph Northam have incredibly low negatives for somebody in this environment you look nationally um he has very high poverty is very low negatives um and in going into these competitive seats [noise]\nUm I remember in ... eleven and Democrats drew the state Senate lines and they lost the majority and who is that the person who was in every Republican ... that was flipping seats with Bob McDonald\nI'm item that timetable here than these are still nationalize races I don't care how you slice it the national environment play on words you have to have a messenger more to help right there are special armed you're turning out the Thomas right the the I mean it that that national scene where he's very heavily\nYou know which is why you've had you know the the patterns that you've had\nUntil McAuliffe beat Cuccinelli I mean you know what happened for almost fifty year I'm gonna I'm into his round the surveys like let's take for example that started in the disturbance heat was not driven by national politics and twenty fifth you know it was driven by local politics in Chesterfield versus Richmond and I'd like to be democratic\nUm and I think that we're and we don't believe we have more aggressive candidate but we don't have we had an ex campaigns don't matter you know I don't think we had to I don't think made a great and I sort of there I think if you rerun that same race in twenty Nineteen\nAnd you had Ralph Northam on TV I'm In that district Ralph with what they're not going to be a vote the votes tournament and chaos is going to create problems for\nI think that's the great problem is that he's he's he's not harmonious with the district on some of the hot button issue or just say that like Rob working been good governor I think he's a wonderful man but he gives a fireside chat and the fire goes now you put him on TV it it it's it's not the same kind of rally the team but he's\nIn Africa to that and making Disney handy to use that ... I don't know if that's the kind of governor you actually need this you know and he picked up a lot of fiery he picked up ... seats\nThat means I think you're turning the color things it's fiery and I'm at a carnival Barker is one and and he doesn't he doesn't pick up seats laid off north him dead\nWell north of didn't pick 'em up Trump picked\nHim up for him yes if if Trump would have been president and twenty Fifteen we'd be in the majority\nThey look I I yeah I just don't want to do on Ralph Northam disagree however I think he's been pretty much just stayed\nChemical up on my three points in rapport with him on by eight and ... picked up the receipts north and pick up Fifteen five point difference was not a fifteenth wealth I'm telling you that but there was also a hotel ... let me tell you the\nWhite House mistake about it Trump okay I was a driving factor shirt last November on top of that um [noise] you had a ... and spilled over into everything [noise]\nAnd keep in mind Gillespie was not true but you know\nI mean he was very polarized [noise]\nBut um I just think people keep underestimating as governor\nOh oh I don't think anybody underestimating I don't think anybody underestimate same but make no it was I mean you know what's driving politics in Virginia right now is not a Ralph [noise] ah it's it's what's going on across the Potomac River\nIt's negativity is driving politics on both sides right now in the one thing about Robert and he doesn't have any negative [noise] doesn't have many many he's a very likeable\nOr not I'm not you know I've now go you know been knocking on doors since may I have not gotten one negative comments about\nIn just a likeable person is not is not really the problem is you know I I agree with that even after that but he's not a fire reader that gets voted out for\nYou know I I think Tom Davis was not a fire leader that got to build up for the Republicans but for Twenty years\nEvery single Republican repeats you would have thought the person was married to Tom Davis because the Republican candidate had his picture bigger than their own picture with a quote from him saying like here's why they'd be great for your time sometimes when I'm ... I'm so I mean having a messenger is important and democratic not had good black or started that Ralph Northam is the first time in a sense mark\nThe ordinary either I agree but now he's taking our income but that was an entirely different that\nI don't know I tell you what man I I that's the joke joke kind of Peter ... you can't underestimate or see and I'm telling you what he had a disastrous for us to offer I wasn't there and it was a\nDisaster of all time so he had a disastrous press conference it really hurt them there's all kinds of underhanded things going on but you know after that\nMorsi's mayor and [noise] you know the the thing about Joe is he's an independent thinker he's got to go is the only way uh you know he's not\nA he's not a whole bunch of any of the establishment caucuses or anything like that\nI think you're going to play very well in that district and I think a lot of friends there that no one thinks that he got screwed by what they did to him and and say\nCan I jump more see that the smartest thing I've ever seen anyone doing politics when he won the was it I think it was Mickey chintzy but he won ... each in the ... teaching moved up I think\nAnd in that primary people didn't think he was going to win that primary crowded field any more than a landslide networks people are asking what did he do he went around and after he knocked on doors at you know and I wrote a handwritten note to every voter he spoke to\nThe data that for a week and a half before the election in the context that that he had remembered the conversation\n... kept these postcards for six months and send them all out of ten days before the election with a handwritten note from him talking about how their conversation and\nYou know I met your dog sham or you're a teacher here and I remember that conversation and do you know hope I can count on your support next Tuesday and\nPeople came out in droves for him to go do that though and I I actually people read postcards but I've never seen one posting them to make it appear as a month later okay well tell me that I'm Tom Davis has everything better than anyone in politics libraries\nBut [noise] but he did that to anyone in a landslide and like it's been done before it really wouldn't know I don't underestimate jaundiced\nAs long as ... or five people in that race either\nGonna just to I'm not an expert on that's the big difference you know if we had you know there's a whole lot of people have gotten in the journal suddenly because we don't have run on purpose in the state a whole lot and and you won't have that you'll just have to people in there\nAnd she's well why [noise] I don't think\nI if I had the gas [noise] and I agree totally wrong with us going to live in that district I guess that round dance have extremely low name id pardon I Would guess that ride dance with extremely low name id and that if you test it they were more states are named me not to say that ... I'm just [noise] but like in terms of I'd name id\nRichard Nixon had our name out\nThere [laughter] you know I mean I just like I don't think rises like real superstar in the Senate\nBack on you know Joe and I know Joe\nJust got to get out out worth something like Fifteen or twenty to one okay Joe was out there knocking on doors and making phone calls now well this is science\nBetween the south la primary too in that primary like Dick was independent district for Twenty years before he got drawn to safety prize basically has a concept of campaigning and knocking on doors and doing the things that you do when you're in a competitive political rates for Seventy percent of the vote in my district against Mondale yeah rock this has never been inside of recently\nSome for you ever been a Confederate says she's never been in a Kevin and you got to ask you before and she's got to get out of work I'm a joke on out workers he's fighting Joe he's gotta he's gotta worker and\nThere is a human going get I'm telling you he was going to get a tip to clear the sympathy vote out there for the fact that the power base in Richmond screwed this guy out of it is a livelihood\nAnd that's that's real I mean he got screwed I mean what he pulled his long life it was senator Stanley told me the whole thing is that ... vote but [noise] it was blown it okay [laughter] what happened there was a horrible Loni and\nIt was because uh if there was it was the cause you challenged the Richmond system that's what happened and that's why they told them and so I don't remember that\nLike you know there are a lot of people in that area\nThat have an in little loyalty the job or see the reason he does well there's a lot of people there that is represented and when families have had a time of need you know the attorney they went through the criminal defense attorney to help out someone in their family was Joe Morsi and that created a level of loyalty he had they ... [noise]\nI'm not ready to call this one one way or the other yet\nBut um he has a real base [noise] it's it's across that district to from being an attorney I'm In the same way that Donald McEachin you know when he when he ran rubber and his running\nYou know even as a primary challenge of what three times two incumbents are twice twice as the challenger didn't come and delegates been one to the challenger don't come and senator\nAnd and mceachin was the guy who everyone news on TV was a lawyer um he had to help so many people in the community it didn't matter that even the challenger to income it um\nA lot of people and ... in their communities where they don't know who to turn to joy Morsi has been the guy he's defending their nephew there's time um you know against major charges in that area he's one of the top defense attorneys that I've just I I I think that it's an interesting race and and and we got to see you know will rise even run again let me\nLet me look ahead to twenty Twenty one the governorship or when it comes comes through in a lot of determining who's White Houses that dynamic is going on but when north um goes well the attorney general within a governor clash at that who else is looking at this at this point in the Democratic party or the I Know\nI mean there is a name pops up\nThere on that Perry Ellis was not out of the picture either either now or I Would imagine if you're on the you know of\nCourse but I Would I Would hope that herring Fairfax thanks for delta or not the contestant nomination\nAnd you've got a lot of people in the back looking for upward mobility you're the mayor of Richmond stony you've got a girl and just\nGetting her yellow sitting there on you'll have a primary and you'll just see if it's a [noise] it's successful it can be dangerous you can only I think it's only a [noise]\nAs long as you don't have a two way right [noise] uh\nBetween Fairfax and ... and uh I think that if a if it's if it's one of them against the whole batch of other people when [noise] uh you know the Fairfax\nCounty somebody outside I like you guys are talking about herring and a Fairfax you're not talking about before stony who was absolutely going to do something he was the other person you're not talking about\nWho can pull the upset in a two or three person race and that's kind of like Alexander\nMayor of from Norfolk right now who three way primary against to progress in trying to wild liberal left wing each other Kenny Alexander comes in business guy this is track record and the mold of who water businessman McAuliffe\nBusiness guy daughter in critical why\nThat's ridiculous first of all there's always there's a there's a moderate right or the Democratic primary is any way for the first piece safety but the second one in a rough in order to be in your state\nThey're not going to line up behind ...
