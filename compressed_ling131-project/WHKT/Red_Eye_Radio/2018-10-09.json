Lindsey Graham\nDuring that campaign out here and he put it very eloquently by the way I Can't believe I'm quoting Lindsey Graham I mean it shows you the way the Republican Party exchange strike yeah no more John McCain and will back to ah\nAnd we have from when the party of Trump politically Graham said the Democrats\nWant power God help us I Hope they don't get what they did to cabinet now a dress rehearsal\nFor not only what they're going to do the Donald Trump about what they're going to do to everyone and\nAnyone associated with him on um anyone\nAny White House advisor to anybody who worked on the campaign to the business associates they will all be cold and they will try to walk and talk to this president um God Forbid and that's the only if they win how God Forbid if they win

they used to when the time and time again if you remember two thousand nine two thousand times we were a water\nLike party but Americans came together in the Tea Party movement and\nIs American people here and why do I say that because this could have gone one or two away and I had it had happened now not even my first\nTestimony you would have had he probably would not have that right and he would he would have had something where the politics of destruction where you're allowed to use the roof courts\nAnd it sounded like you know it's time to like cops and it's funny to you know I say bowler who didn't act like throw them in jail in political enemies and trying to undo election but\nThe Democrats to you know very they're very tough against Russia don't you know I think that when they are they also they were acting like a Russian a Soviet communists ma you know mom trial the Chinese all of your own against\nAgainst common out so I think that that was very important now from a political point of view obviously this is a win for the Republicans the issue is do we maintain where are we can with ten days from now we remember\nWhy we realize why why this election is imported enjoy remember what's happening now shows he could have been out what they're only about the Supreme Court wasn't about Cabot\nWas about the direction of the country we wanted and there were about to elections matter and are we going to let the Democrats\nTake over the house and Senate\nHands really thrown the country into disarray so we'll find out for that point of view from a strictly political point of view it remains an open book we don't know yet\nWell look\nYou're right because one of the ... the only apprehension I have is that the Republicans were very fired up\nRight now by the time we get the ... the end of the next twenty nine days see how the hell that uh we ... we got the guy we wanted to kind of forget about it so you you've got to keep them far enough no doubt but just this like you're saying so this is this is the most critical midterm election in our history I mean\nI Know a lot of Republicans were fired up about Obamacare and I remember I call her is calling me up when the Supreme Court passes saying that it was the end of the Republican and it was like okay it's attached to me you know you get a tax you don't have the time\nIt was just policy it's no big deal we didn't like it but it was attacked so what this is quite different maybe because now you're talking about the direction of the country um\nGive me the biggest loser in all this\nKind of the biggest loser [noise] [noise] I think I think the biggest loser one unfortunately are women who are getting abused now look I have been pretty talk on the record\nUm I was much tougher made a point when they spoke about it even two weeks ago on your show and thank you for having me on a lot it's an honor but I said I thought she was line\nI don't know what happened to her it's actually been hostile and Brett Kavanaugh our job is Lee has mental problems but the biggest loser the women's movement the me too movement which has been importing in corporate America which has an important in the entertainment industry in the news industry\nSorry I Love that's her when she was used in the way they said she wanted to keep the confidential she didn't want to go to Congress remember she looked at it for lawyers when she was ... that you know that we could have gone to California\nShows you that this really has set back because\nI just didn't care about her the Democrats thinning hair [noise] about um what actually happened to you are what are the Democrats were I I just wanted to throw the kitchen sink again in the worst kind of way to do justice\nTo president look what you're talking to somebody who frankly and I said there's some people want to criticize it I don't really care I dealt with in birth origin I tell them for the reason I ... was born in the United states I Know you know first typically produce probably I think it's a real\nProblem is the issue is that politics as presidential politics and stuff for a life is what they did here was they went out to sea can destroy\nSomeone and in the worst kind of way possible once again so I think that's really the biggest loser but Democrats me don't may not have law on that\nThere will be guard fires [noise]\nThey're raising a lot of money as well\nUm I think that the clear dining clarify their presidential\nField such that it is last week so a little bit I think Michael often are they going to get any more attention by look down on that one once again once again to linger open book to be the biggest loser\nIf you want to point to anyone that I Would be a loser it's wide ... hour Michael out but now\nI'm Dianne Feinstein and probably Cory Booker\nI Would agree with all those right down the line\nOh I'm Lisa Murkowski John I forgot I mean I'm not going to affect or\nLook one thing people like you and me who have had our criticism of ... of cocaine image but trust me he'll get back at her she she got something\nTo her mentor I made her on the Republican side\nAbsolute loser and McConnell a big winner and uh you know I never I never saw the sign of McConnell and you and I have been I Know it's probably too as they get in on the side uh\nOver the cultural and every other week when things done looking shot and so you got to give credit where it's due and he was a big part of this\nProcess or the equivalent I think for him John when\nTrump came out I think the days after a and B c's lead the Access Hollywood tape out yes sent me the leaks are active Hollywood take they're all calling for Trump to drop out\nAnd he just came out there and he just destroyed her second day he started talking

on the road in the beginning of the very similar happens then the heat or in a much better place than they were they were last year I think that I think we'll find out but this is going to be I think that I think with all of the world series\nThat comes to fruition in theory I don't see any way either Milwaukee and most likely the Dodgers would be able to use or the Astros\nThat the I I think

trucks insurance across America live Washington DC we're with Edward Iranian our man in the middle east been with us since we started eight years ago and he is based in Cairo, Egypt so lesson and\nThe bigger geopolitical situation here but I'm the guy for missing and he's based in Virginia and he works for the Washington Post and he's little legit journalist and nobody knows where he is I'm going to get to our um Interpol executive in a moment\nNobody knows where he is you've got the the president calling on\nNBS Mohammed the sun than solving the Saudi stretch calling on him to pay up a\nFor a bigger percentage of the defense and protection that we provide them he'd just over the weekend he said no he wasn't going to do that you've also got the president mad because he's continued to raise OPEC prices while in Trump's mind now the U.S government has funded their defense always pissed about that\nSo you met a lot of things at play here but let's get off the geopolitics get back to the journalist I mean my question again is where is he and if he was abducted you know don't you take take administrative should back channel it and find out\nHappened to them based on the fact that you know he works for an American company and he lived in northern Virginia\nI'm sure they're doing that right now I I Hope they're doing that right now if I were secretary of state park I wouldn't be doing that right now I I think that is my\nWho could have one just to follow up us relations with Saudi Arabia knowing that he works for the Washington Post then growing\nOr that the Trump Administration isn't a bad position would have to react and knowing\nEspecially considering that you got all these media organizations that have made that are close to a co author and and um the Democrats were were were making a lot of noise about Yemen before this because they were saying that the U.S\nMust stop supporting Saudi Arabia militarily I mean that would follow up relations with Saudi Arabia from the get go and not you know I I I couldn't possibly divorces from the political implications of it [noise]\nOkay so we don't know where he is your contending that let's not jump to conclusions you may be fine and this may be part of the bigger picture or maybe he's in the hands of someone else then abducted him and then depending on the Saudis who are of course are\nSaying that they left the embassy but they can't show footage of him leaving the embassy because you have a channel like if you're constantly you've got me in cameras all over the place or you have to do was released the footage and shows and leaving and then they have a good day I don't know what happened to them not all travel you know things now produce that that's the problem\nYes that's right I agree with you and I and I I Am dismayed about this too but like I have heard from the Egyptians and obviously they um our allies in Saudi Arabia and they don't want to say anything bad about Saudi Arabia their their argument basically that I that you know people in the Egyptian system\nI I've spoken with said that\nThe Saudi intelligence people are not that stupid\nThat they would knock him off and I I think that's that's true and there are a lot of their theory is that a lot of the other parties that would have wanted to follow up relations between Saudi Arabia and the U.S that would have um you know wouldn't would not have thought twice about stopping ... to kill someone like some of the democracy will be assuming that's what happened which we don't know [noise]\nOkay so I'm your advice here is wait and see don't jump to conclusions or I get that I'll take that\nFor what it stands for let's get to the China Interpol situation right so we've got the\nOf Interpol who was a Chinese national goes to China\nHe gets the rest of it um\nIt it gets ... to me that he wouldn't even gone there I mean what do you go there to put yourself at risk you know if you go there there's there's a high chance you gonna get\nAbducted by the communist government\nSo my question is why on earth did he do\nWhat happens now\nAccording to all the media reports he is a government official he's the deputy or intelligence minister I think at some point someone who's a government official is obliged to return to this country um as a matter of course whether he likes it or not um although I mean he could have\nHe he could have resigned from that position or it could have resigned I mean he could have remained in France the French are very upset\nIt was perhaps a calculated risk and he thought something could happen but you know hope that wouldn't turn dark\nAnd got caught I'm\nSad situation up obviously the Chinese government was very proud to Maine him or have him name has had to enter recalls so clearly what whatever it is that they have against them has\nTo be very powerful for them to do that considering that they were proud of having their own national as the head of Interpol\nSo uh you're right I mean that's that's good that's good and they were they were very happy that he was named to that position um\nAnd it comes back and now they've arrested him for what did they say a corruption bribery and things of that nature\nSo whenever they've got 'em on whatever you did that they didn't like you just said must be big because uh you know they they didn't really want to give up that that decision of authority they haven't even looked being being the head of Enron\nInterpol in France ever explain to our audience how big of a [noise]\nWell it is a bit Mario in terms of the actual cloud that he had me he doesn't uh run the day to day operations at the bottom of the people who are putting out the Warren and things like that\nUm but he is a publicly highly public visible person who would get a great deal play in Europe in the media um and clearly gives a positive impression of China to\nThe world um leave the European our audience here in America probably of the American media doesn't cover him that well but he he is well covered and crafts um yeah I mean he\nDoes and that's one of the worries when he was named in two thousand and sixteen was that he could possibly have an influence on\nRounding up Chinese dissidents across the world that has been proven to be the case so far as we know of but as I got because he doesn't have the day to day\nOperations in hand\nSo let's get back to the ownership Flint let's get back to jump on this and the Saudis issue wasting Edward major prediction how do you see it playing out\nI'm I'm I'm hoping that I Know him that he will surface in Riyadh\nAnd that they will be ... be holding on to him and that they will be willing to release them after all this pressure as they did or what the former with the Lebanese prime minister Saad Hariri went right or detained him maybe six to eight months ago I guess right beginning of the year yeah so I'm hoping that's what happened\nOr role playing out where it's great to have your perspectives and certainly a different perspective than we've gotten from\nOther legacy media of this and certainly the Washington Post New York times are\nAdam Schiff head of

during that camera now hearing he put it very eloquently I probably would I Can't believe I'm quoting Lindsey Graham I mean it shows you the way the Republican Party has changed right yeah no more John McCain and will back to ah\nAnd we were in the party of Trump Felicity Graham said the Democrats\nWant our God help us I Hope they don't get it and what they did to cabinet now was a dress rehearsal for not only what they're going to do to Donald Trump or what they're going to do to everyone and anyone associated with him um\nAnyone from any White House advisor to anybody who worked on the campaign to business associates they will all be cold and\nThey will try to try and cook this president um God Forbid something if they win the house God Forbid they when the second I think that's the size of the fact that they may try to do impeachment\nTrial of a cabinet now I Do the you know there's the house can do it they will look to um forcibly take those articles of impeachment will pass through a Democratic House\nAt a time of which will be a historic it will be for a ruling the second half of a first starting credited Andrew is\nObviously fighting a fight so both parties have ignored what China that both parties has\nI'm not flooded with North Korea you know trying to read and read and re strengthen the middle east from the damage leftover from the Shia crescent of Iran Iraq Obama was all too happy\nTo help promote um they're going to shop around the world stage and and they're nice thank God help us because [noise] the Democratic state should not have time for the days when the time and time again\nIf you remember two thousand nine two thousand time we were a water like party by American came together in the Tea Party movement and\nCould have gone one or two when I had it had happened now not even my first choice not your first choice but to carry out not come out and given that response in his opening statement after ... testimony you would've had he probably would not have the right\nAnd he would he would have had something where the politics of destruction where you're allowed to use the roof court\nAnd it sounded like you know trying to like cops and it's funny to you know I say bowler who didn't so much we shouldn't act like put them in jail in political enemies and trying to undo election ...\nDemocrats too you know very they're very they're very tough against Russia don't you know I think that one they are they also they were acting like a Russian Sylvia communist ma you know mom trial Chinese all of your own against\nA getting out so I think that that was very important is now from a political point of view obviously this is a win for the Republicans the issue is do we maintain where are we paying ten days from now\nWe remember why we realize why this something by this election is imported enjoy remember what's happening now shows he could have been out what they're only about the Supreme Court wasn't about cabinet out\nAbout the direction of the country we wanted\nAnd there was about to elections matter mhm or we're going to let the Democrats\nTake over the house in the Senate and really throw the country into ... show we'll find out so for that point of view from a strictly political point of view him remains an open book we don't know yet\nWell look you're right because one of the the the only African engine I have is that the Republicans who were very fired up\nRight now by the time we get to the end of the next twenty and I didn't say how the hell with it or\nWe get we got the guy we wanted to kind of forget about it so you've got to keep them far enough no doubt because it's like you're saying saying this is this is the most critical midterm election in our history I mean\nI Know a lot of Republicans were fired up about Obamacare and I remember I call her is calling me up when the Supreme Court past are saying that it was the end of the Republican and it was like okay it's a tax I mean you know you get a tax you don't have a tax\nIt it was just policy it's no big deal we didn't like it but it was attacked so why this is quite different maybe because now you're talking about the direction of the country um\nDo you think the biggest loser in all the\nOf the biggest loser [noise] I think I think the biggest loser one unfortunately are women who have been abused that look I'm been pretty talk on\nThe record um I was much tougher and I made a point when they spoke about it and he'd been two weeks ago on your show and thank you for having me on a lot it's an honor but I said I thought she was line I don't know what happened to her house to impart cabin out\nBut the me too movement which has been importing\nIn corporate America which has been reporting and entertainment industry in the news industry likes to point out mostly Democrats but deeper minor details that's our credit but I Would say I love her when she was used in the way they said she wanted to keep this confidential mhm\nShe didn't want to go to Congress remember she looked at her lawyers when she was ... you know that we could have gone to California\nJust shows you that this really has stopped because it's never quite seen care about her the Democrats didn't care about um what actually happens who are the Democrats were I just wanted to throw the kitchen sink into work kinds of wiring\nTrust is\nNot a surprise look what you're talking to somebody who frankly and I send their people want to criticize it I don't really care delta Burke there is some kind of breakthrough them I was born\nIn the United states I mean you know typically ... probably not going to be real problem is the issue was is that politics as presidential politics and stuff are electric what they did here was they went out to sea can destroy\nSomeone and in the worst part nobody hospitable once again so I was\nReally the biggest loser Democrats don't may not have lost arm that there are things will be very fired up there were a lot of money as well um I think it's pretty clear diamond clarify their presidential field such that it is actually show a little bit\nI don't think Michael how are you going to get any more attention but we'll find out on that one once again once again the lingering open book ... the biggest the biggest loser if you want to point to anyone that I say it will be a loser [laughter] definitely our Michael often mhm\n[noise] I'm Dianne Feinstein probably Cory Booker\nI Would agree with all those right down the line\nLisa Murkowski John I forgot and I'm not going to affect or look one thing people like you and me who have had our criticism of of cocaine Mitch but trust me he'll get back at her and she she's got something to her message I think her on the Republican side\nAbsolute loser and McConnell big winner and uh\nYou know I never I never saw the sign of McConnell and you and I understand I Know they're probably to his fingers in on the side uh over the cultural and every other week things done to looking shot and so you got to give credit where it's due and he was a big part in this\nProcess or the equivalent hiking for him John when Trump came out their second debate after a leads the elite the Access Hollywood tape out started recently said he would take their all costs\nTroy Eid second debate he started talking about the Supreme Court and he gained a lot of support or so people are like I mean not like this guy personally done a lot of terrible things before but I can see it got\nReally certainly has gone he certainly are delivered on that promise as he delivered on his promises which is unbelievable are semi gotta\nAnd a half I got to get to a baseball this is classic maybe you're a Yankees\nFan I'm an Astros fan a\nYankees where the huge when Saturday Night huge when sensitive to homers now they go home\nI don't think it's ever getting back to the way I think they're going to win it\nThe answer is going to Cleveland up to well maybe they could be today but uh we're in demand a very good chance we the way the ass I don't want to jinx my team but\nI still get a feel good about being in Cleveland the\nAstros play the game is John longer the Syrian the better for the stores that sort of the series the better for the the better for the Yankees I think what the student both teams when I think they will hopefully we don't go back to life I don't think you're going back to the\nHighly on back to the ... that were not Cleveland in theory\nI think the longer this series the better for the Astros better starting pitcher [noise] so [noise] the Yankees are able to get\nA couple of friends on the road for one on the road in the beginning of the series assuming it happened\nThey eat or in a much better place and they were when they were last year I think we'll find out what was going to be I think the equivalent of the world series\nThat what comes to fruition theory I don't see any way that Milwaukee and most likely the Dodgers would be able to beat the Yankees or the Astros\nHere I think that said I think the world series going to be an ale championship game and the answers would have the whole field so many sacked replay\nOf two thousand Seventeen or two to three two and the answer is I don't even think we're close to the game in New York I don't even think we were in again and we get the all terrain and that happened you\nKnow there was one again we have to come back in the area and there was one game win but I Know that I just thought the matter either watch like one of the ...\nNorth yeah well that's what we'll see we'll planes out John triggers radio networks have Sam Nunberg I remember Sam Nunberg senior advisor now when it's a\nSteve Bannon's political action
