got a point and we'll see what the president's response as you have to respond to this I mean you you can have allies that people go into conflicts and get chopped up with a with a chainsaw ... while they're alive and then put in doggy bags I mean you just can't have it you just that's not a civil society and I've told you this before and I know\nUh all my friends out there that like Trump they wonder which skews it and say he's not a journalist who was with the Muslim Brotherhood I don't care who he is\n\nYou have to be consistent in your view are consistent view\nFor America first is America First and we want to country now if you have a country and sovereignty then you need to have international relations otherwise you have a global society so in international relations there has to be a sense of order without order\nThere's there's no sovereignty obvious follow the logic here\nI Believe in logic\n\nAnd Matt two plus two four\nAnd\nIf he had gone into a cafe and got assassinated\nCrap happens right it happen\nIf they blew up his car when he started that crap happens right they got to be for the guy we get it now their business maybe even just has to get it if it happened in the U.S but uh it it ... you wouldn't assessed against it if it happened to us as a homicide but if it was in Turkey it's up to them\nBut the fact that he went into an embassy\nOr consulate\nThat's that's where it breaks down that's why they've been gossipy thing was such a hard\nI mean once she was and that's why the Iranians are over running our our embassy there and and keeping the hostages ... embassies are supposed to be a safe place\nFor a world order and the Saudis violated that they struck their finger in the eye of the of all their allies this it it just isn't the United states it's Theresa May in Great Britain me they're also funding them\nThey're also selling them arms there are also involved in the Yemeni war there's all sorts of implications that go way beyond the U.S here\n\nAnd the president has set a clear single any will so what stopped jumping to conclusions number one he has talked about pale\nNumber two for parents not back number three we don't have all the facts number four they not admitted anything number five number six number seven is not enough interim mission number eight and ten see numbers one to seven once the information comes out I guarantee you this president is going to have a response\nAnd it's not going to be slipping under the property will have a response\nUp to and including what Lindsey Graham said which is the immediate removal of MPs as the air\nSays that he leap frog over to a beat and the planets the session for this route or the kingdom and maybe he's just not the guy certainly if he were to be the scapegoat that would solve it and the other scapegoat like some faceless nameless person was a rogue general\nI think that's gonna work OSU all plays out because the facts on into going to wait for the facts John triggers radio network coast got what can I be\nJust I was just the boys the boys are going to play a little baseball yeah huh\nI Know right it's just us and guys working on friday

seven best teams in the country or to\nAt that level so you get to play it's a very different\nCompetition that when you play locally in Oregon right from high school is very different and best of the best the best so we'll see what else was like you know watch your step up you got to step up\nYou can't get better by plane and people that the people that you only get\nBy playing better players better hitters and you know um and uh you know they're going to be sitting on his fastball I told them that are the first game you started yes riding on these kids get into a fastball my my son he wants to start out with a fastball\nFirst three guys up double double single\nTuesday it and uh he threw for pictures\n... the coach comes out and he says look you're ... Seventy nine that's where the getting clock that but you're really not getting the moving on it and these guys can hit they're just sitting on it\nSo don't don't give that they're sitting on your fast ball you know go to the change up your color and so we started doing that and I'm rather than starting them over the past for the next guy starts or where the change of pop pop set up destruct in Ninety two guys out he went on from\nThere so you know like he's a custom as at this level you know you throw Seventy nine miles an hour fastball most kids in this area is a left hander you know he can he can get that first the first strike older you start playing the best teams in the country\nWould they would their competition like exotic elsewhere so ... so it is good way to ... feet wet and

always have\nBeen three years we played them in my career this far close came down to the wire with a lot of describing football\nWell why don't why do you signing football and uh they have a they haven't they are pretty solid team or their their record hasn't shown it I think they're better than they look to start with their quarterback Jordan Jordan black\nEnjoyable experts you're starting a left handed off your quarterback extremely tough kids probably one of the better pastors states had their true for a hundred and eighty a yard sale last week I was sixteen or twenty three so kind of opens up their traditional last option running attack with some some good play action passing\nOut again that they're very solid on the office wanting to come off the ball low in various parts simulating practice or give it a running backs\nThe thing is there a balance top densely Nazi clean running past but in who tractors the ball and where they touch the ball so very difficult to\nDefend defense plea a multi pressure units are they bring a lot of voices from a lot of locations you have to be really solid in your past protection against them and they play during the heart and then\nSpecial teams so they they get screwed extremely well beat in Merced burn alive stuff up play the game right kickoff return for a touchdown so very well coached by rent Tom send their kids are like our young men they play strongly hard they fight for the for the final\nSound they never said die so heck of a ball game against a very tough and talented team\nYeah in a couple of weeks ago um Palestine quarterback Tom flak though by the way is the brother a younger\nBrother of a so called a quote unquote elite quarterback Joe Flaco uh [laughter] is it is the elite quarterback ah well I don't know but based on uh the last game against tendency look pretty a link to me\nBut coach I'm Flatow really carved up the citadel decent and\nYou look at you didn't ski and uh the the arm strength and he's got in the maturation he's gone through\nYour quarterback you didn't see your fast receivers um they they had a lot I watched some of the game actually they have a lot of uh let's say ... you've got opportunities I think in their secondaries at a fair analysis of mine\nBut I think the central defense probably learned a whole heck of a lot from that ball game it was you know first team they played that just threw the ball around a little bit and you know they're young on defense like we are and so as the game got on I thought they played a lot better defense linking\nConfidence is the game goes on and I think there'll be much better prepared the playoffs after playing that game yeah Flaco also hurt him with his legs a little bit running the ball early and you know I think once again the unsettled\nOur game do you look at a young quarterback or doing a little more scrambling under the pocket maybe having some design runs slaves to keep the defense honest\nYou know we always have to sign run plays in for the second quarter back and so that's part of\nOur all kinds of tactics to keep the defense honest I'd prefer not to scramble from the pocket because that means we have a clean pockets they sell the protection breaks down like it does you know at every level of football than you know obviously reach needs to maneuver in the pocket and do what he takes it needs to do

I mean you would think you would think that if the caravan of invading illegal aliens and that's what this says this is an invasion\n\nThis is an invasion coming to the United states\n\nI don't I'm not going to call it anything but what it is an invasion\nYou would think that that would motivate\nPeople to get out and vote for Republican so that you have some kind of a security on the border of what other people think it's actually going to hurt the Republicans because\nCNN and all the news networks are going to be showing pictures of moms were babies that's\nThat you you can't script this out mom's with babies and they're going to call them economic refugees seeking asylum asylum means you're a political prisoner or you are at risk in your country of some sort of a\nPolitical situation that will ... when\nBecause there's four billion of them\nWhat are they all just kind of come and ask for asylum because they can't get a job in their ... corrupt country\n\nThat we give billions of dollars to these people and it's the corruptions beyond the pale\n\nYou would think that this would motivate Republicans and independents that come out and say look this isn't right and I send my child to third grade there's twenty five kids in that class Nineteen them don't speak English with the help kind of an education is my child going to get my public school\nWhich are not paying for they're not paying anything\nWell you know\nYou're a racist\nWhy because I Want my son or daughter and the third grade to be taught in English with other people that speak English so we can have some kind of a a learning environment yeah you're you're a racist\n\nI had a peanut butter sandwich for breakfast right foot marmalade on in the area is racist\n\nOnly white people eat marmalade\n\nI mean it is this thing is going to go on and on and\nAnd so it's all these mobs and what is going on is intimidating regular people from just looking at something reasonable\n\nTo be called a racist because you don't want your country invaded\nBy four thousand illegal immigrants on the southern border\nNo it was just like you want to pay the law\n\nI guess we have two sets of was hard for people that the Democrats won in and that was very ... I don't really understand it\nThis is a real issue and there's\nNo answer to this and we're really you would think that our ally Mexico wouldn't let them come into Mexico\n\nI mean think about think about\nThink about what what would happen in the U.S if these five thousand a caravan of invaders said well we really want to go to Canada so as we can you let us in the United states and give us just a a a sixty they a status here so that we can go up the highway and ah get to Canada and we can invade them\nI mean what what what would they Canadian say well sure you know I understand I understand that's our problem they'd be like well why are you doing this\nThis is just a logic\nAnd open borders crowd is relentless and they have Wall Street Republicans behind them you would think that this would be the major issue of the day and because of Goldman Sachs is salivating and looking of their chops at\nThe prospect of more cheap labor nothing is going to be done at the end of the day they're all going to stay because the Republicans hands are tied\nJudges will overturn whatever their what whatever ... Jeff Sessions\nSeparate anybody now from the children\nEspecially before the midterms that say disaster even though if somebody today in the Bronx or in ... ... or Richmond or Lynchburg or anywhere in

with them that's the laws that we have in America you want to change it I guess change it but that's the current law but laws don't matter now\n\nI mean if you ever had more evidence why there shouldn't be a wall this or that\n\nSo the Republicans are attempting to make this a\n\nA election issue where they're putting a built together for thirty two billion dollars to fund the wall\nBut they're not getting their message out as far as I'm concerned\nI mean you you really think about you really think about how any other country would handle and organized caravan of illegal immigrants coming into your country and expecting a fully expecting that they will be allowed in and taking care of\nIts crazy and uh\nYou would think that this one issue alone would sink the Democrats in the election but many people think it's going to have the opposite effect so you know you just start scratching your head\n\nI mean I think the debate over this issue in this country should be whether or not you want to border or you don't\nAnd you know there is an argument for not having one and the argument is\nCheap labor and we have a big heart and we'll take care of anybody that comes in and eventually when the country collapses than it is what it is\nI mean that's one argument you in the meantime the elites will continue to profit off it and then obscene fashion\nAnd the gangster benches and make more money and Wall Street executives will get more wealthy than they are and if you worked at Goldman Sachs you'll be able to buy an island\nI mean I guess that's the plan and you'll continue to fund the Democrats who will then have Arnold unlimited power in perpetuity and remember it was President Obama who said um my goal was to transform\nIt America transform it\nTransform it by changing its make up its demographic makeup you change it by allowing 'em unfettered\nIllegals to come in and change the culture whatever the American culture is those who want to change it want it to be something else I'm really don't know what they want it to be\nOr what you think that that's the objective\nThat's at once she votes Wall Street Republicans at one cheap labor and the third in the open a open borders one world government that wants to change and wipe\nOut cultures they want to wipe them out so they don't exist they just want a land mass and the free\nMovement of people and goods between land masses that's it John Frederick radio network in your heart you know I'm right there is no argument to oppose what I'm saying but it it doesn't matter the Republicans are

wants to wait till all the facts come out\nShare with us your perspective on this as it is now\nWell John yet you're like really troubling I'm a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee I Am the lead Democrat on the kids on some Khamenei sees the U.S Saudi relationship and this this has the potential to dramatically change the relationship between our countries\nUm you're right that I'm a mother of a journalist has to be taken seriously this is a journalist who was living in northern Virginia right near Tyson's corner in Fairfax writing for the Washington Post and be murder anybody a conflict\nWhich should be a safe haven that that would take place a is shocking I'm so\nThere's a couple of things that we're doing in Congress first on Foreign Relations committee we sent a letter to the president would trigger\nThe Mac that's yeah I think you know the Magnitsky Act was named after a Russian dissident who was murdered by the Russians oil for his political activity of Congress sent a letter to the president that gives the president twenty days to make that ruling about whether\nThe murder as a human rights violation and if so what sanctions would be imposed we sent that letter about two weeks ago the other two issues that are currently under consideration\nI'm her somewhat related or whether the United states should stop or put a moratorium on her sales to the Saudis we have significant arms sales them and they have for years um and third and this\nIs one that I'm very focused on because it was a significant passion of mark a show uses whether the United states should stop supporting any Saudi efforts are in the war\nIn Yemen the civil war in Yemen that's going on between Lucy\nMinority in the Yemeni government in Saudi Arabia is very very involved out and have a government against the who sees it that was the United states is providing a support for the Saudis in that position refueling aircraft that others and um we have some votes to try to stop\nUs for a patient and that or we had one recently that got up to forty\nSeven votes in the Senate not fifty not sixty grand prix African cultural um and I am seemingly at the opinion that war is a humanitarian disaster in the United states should not be assisting Saudis and the prosecution that war\nThat we're going to have you know get more facts but bluntly I think the burden is on the Saudis to prove that they had nothing to do with any harm kidnapping or ... or a quarter of this journalist enough\nFacts are out there enough information and collaboration is out there burgers now on their shoulders they're going to have to prove that they weren't involved in any harm and if they don't I think it's going to fundamentally change the relationship yeah it's a country of Saudi Arabia\nCenter king is this now the day of reckoning for the u._s.\nYou're on the way you asked that question I I think I Know what you're thinking there and some very very significant challenges in a relationship in recent years beginning where you are warming majority of the nine eleven attackers were Saudis yes um and then you\nForward to a whole series of other instances Yemen um as are Saudi behavior in recent years um especially since the ascension of the crown prince MPs to his position\nAs you know in in within the last year the Saudis were involved in a bizarre kind of error kidnapping after the Lebanese prime minister prime minister Hariri around where they sort of\nAs he was visiting Saudi Arabia he gave sort of a force televised\nInterview announcing his resignation or in the position eleven on that was widely viewed as a Saturday have laying I'll tell you when I go to the region um what I hear I hear a walk in and out here in Iraq I here at talk Syrians in the region is that if every other\nAs this caravan get through Mexico and get to the southern border of the United states senator Kaine watch the authorities do what should we do\nWell well first I mean let's let's not weights um there was that the boxers or not to the Guatemalan Mexican\nBorder yet so we need to work with the government some Guatemala Mexico I'm On this and you know I Hope that the president's especially you know often talk talk about Mexico et cetera is not hurt our ability to reach in accord with Max Baucus I think\nOne of the issues that important thing is you gotta have allies in the world I mean\nAnd when you have allies you can work together on joint solution is saying this for like Jeremy I'm a people made in Honduras\nOr or not even get to the border with United States but that would involve us having a cooperative relationship with Mexico for example and not spending time trashy Mexico which the president does so I Know that a U.S military than your command which basically is that\nRight north of the Mexican Guatemalan border um our own we we do have a da chess another a U.S presidents\nIn Mexico I Would hope that we would work with the Guatemalan and Mexican Government to uh to have had caravan of folks remain in place\nI I Know the president hunter as he points out no country wants to export\nIts young um there are also things that we can do to help promote stability in Honduras Guatemala El Salvador\nAnd if we do that we can reduce people who are leaving those countries to come to the United states\nYou know center I'm you spent time as a young man and missions in Jesuit missions and I really respect what you've done and your uh your work and that and now\nWhere do you think about these these violent left wing mobs that are going around chasing people a lot of restaurants spitting on Lindsey Graham sending packages and and horrific emails to Susan Collins and\nIt make it make what is this is so discouraging job it really is I had an event last night I'm Out in Fairfax County where\nIn Fairfax and the disruptor protester tried to get on my face with a camera and light up and yell at me hoping I think that I Would say something in Tempe price that they could then put on video and\nWhether it's somebody doing that to me whether it's somebody sending something the Susan Collins is home whether it's a colleague Jean accosted in a restaurant um and it it it really really\nI don't know it's just it's just sickening [noise] um and you see a you know an escalation of all kinds of violent behavior we saw Nineteen swastikas painted across the front of a Jewish community center in Fairfax two Saturdays ago that was very shocking\nSo I think we have to those of us in elective positions you what we have to do which maybe\nTry to be better role models bring down the temperature bring down the rhetoric you can disagree with somebody without being you know getting temperature on civil to them I I really try hard to do that and everything I Do I disagree with the president on a lot he signed\nSeventeen and my bills you know either that I've been able to put on his desk I'm I I Try not to get into the name calling saying but you're right any violence has to be in down in whether it's violence on the west on the right ones that you know not political in nature\nI'm asked to be condemned one of the great things about our constitution as you know your your favorite part of the constitution is in the first amendment freedom in the press\nAnd my favorite part of the constitution isn't the first amendment to which is the right of the people to peacefully assemble the right of the people to petition government\nFor redress or pre that says we we give citizens the right to peacefully\nAssemble but it's got to be peaceful or to you know write letters to congressman but it's it's got to be peaceful and I think that that the ...\nOf engagement was necessary for democracy at work but they understood that the engagement had to be peace fought any kind of disruptive or violent okay and he wants to be involved\nWith dinner when a when you were former running mate Hillary Clinton said that an civility is acceptable in this environment doesn't track and field is a fire I mean we're seeing a democratic society and they very much\nYeah I disagree with that sentiment in St Paul I think you got to maintain civility especially at the pop 'em let me just let me use to role models on my side\nOf the aisle you could take some role models on your side of the aisle nobody would say Bobby Scott is not a very progressive Democrats very progressive Democrats dairy farm and his point of view points out what he thinks is right points out while he takes his wrong but Bobby Scott has had a political career or nobody thinks of Bobby\nScott as an uncivil person or a name call Don buyer would be another example in Virginia I'm very progressive Democrats\nPoints that way thinks is right that in mind calling at some point but he thinks is wrong but nobody close down Byron name caller nobody thinks he's on several [noise] so I think I can look at examples and and look I got colleagues on my side and I can take their Senate colleagues on the Republican side Lamar Alexander of Mars might\nShare of health education labor pension come at ease\nSee see something that he thinks is wrong or something that the Democrat once you didn't get any like you'll be pointed at it now but he says that\nLamar Alexander is an on civil person so I think I think Iraq is out there that says you know well it's time for a holiday from civility they want more I think we need more of a novel\nWith examples are biscuits an extra one he's my congressman uh and he's been right on some of the biggest issues in that America in the past two decades so now you can call them a progressive and John you name it reinforces that\nEven when you disagree with Bobby style that's great you know nobody thinks of Bobby Scott as like a name caller rounds and that's not that's not who he is and then we need we all we need to act like that\nI Would put a I Would put your colleagues centered Johnny Isaacson in that category uh have same thing everybody knows where he stands he's very conservative evokes with the president a hundred percent of the time\nBut everything is under the ... civil respectful manner ... were were very short on time but I got to get to the election because that's\nThat's coming up in Nineteen days you have a a what looks like the beach center and insurmountable lead in both of polling numbers but you know nothing is certain the only pulled the matters is the one on November six tell me about your reelection campaign what you've seen how it's going and what you think the ...\nWell she as you pointed out Nineteen days and yeah polls are looking pretty good but I always tell people calls for about preferences and elections are about energy and preferences listening to science as energy so what you want to see is energy um\nI've I've loved serving in the Senate my my campaign themes that I chose is I'm trying to reflect the way I've lived in the way I've served in Virginia that works for all the proper genuine about what the sensuality of work and work and having good policies about working in the workforce but it's also about this Virginia that works for all I've been kind of obsessed\nWith the last two words and the pledge of allegiance\nThe notion that uh you know if it's not working for all it's not working and what's not working\nFor all we have more work to do so I'm going to continue should I be locking beyond and they get reelected I'm going to continue to work on these areas are services Foreign Relations budget and then health education labor pension I'm I have\nSeen really during this calendar year twenty eight teams or maybe no surprise given the elections that results in last November's elections in Virginia I continue to\nSee very strong energy turn out in advance voter registration for an interview\nOr seeing pretty strong energy bully vote is taking place but you point out nothing for granted to go back to grow poppy Scott he says there's only two ways to run an election either run unopposed to run their I'm opposed to I'm running scared so that's the way I'm going to do it all the way through his election eve\nOr are we going to see a potential to obtain for president campaign and twenty twenty\nJohn I'll tell you I I was really an honor to be the first working but junior politician on the national it's Eighteen forty in twenty six team but I definitely came back on that campaign Sony or like at the end up with the wizard of Oz there's no place like home there's no really\nAnd do work that matters what the person in the world that people don't think can be a little bit just taken the label so I Am very focused on if I'm In the long wall continuous circle [noise]\nOkay Senator Tim Kaine our thank you for

have a relationship of the center and I have a relationship we have a friendship and just because we don't agree I mean look I ran\nTrump's campaign in Virginia against them and\nWe did good enough where Tim Kaine and Joe Biden had to come to Virginia\nOn Sunday and Monday because we're closing the gap but that doesn't mean when our friends and that doesn't mean you can't have a\nConversation and um yeah I thought his answers were very interesting now we agree on the Yemeni situation we shouldn't be there there's a lot of these secret war is that the U.S has and then we shouldn't be and then I'm going to go into any minute\nAnd certainly the Saudi episode was Giovanni could show he's bringing all the central light but uh you know we're in we're in the secret wars it though it's like they're all under the radar screen and we're in so many of them now\nAnd the military industrial complex is so big and we've been in wars for so long that nobody really thinks about him into something that was a ride like\nAre the Saudis blow up a school bus with the\nUs made missile you know then we hear about it other than what I hear about it every day because I'm a senior contributor now for the al Jazeera Arabic network and\nSo what we talk about on a daily basis is wars going on over the world and I get to go on panels with military\nDebating various hot spots that are around the globe and so you get a little bit of a different perspective is one thing that al Jazeera Arabic does that al Jazeera satellite news does is it really brings the world news home\nAnd they don't really have an outlet in the U.S you've got to go on the Internet but uh when I go on an algae zero and I'm On several times\nA week yeah I've had to turn this week down most of my assignments because I'm busy with family stopped and opening up this new radio station which is a lot of work by the way at forty odd but are typically when I go on a an al Jazeera Arabic prime time you know the average\nThe average Seventy million viewers Seventy million not seven not seven hundred thousand Seventy million that's their average reach prime time on an average weekday\n\nCNN regions about seven hundred thousand on a good night they might get one of the prime time shows might get a million I go on al Jazeera Arabic I'm reaching Seventy million\nPeople around the globe defending of the president's policies so\nI'd rather I'd certainly rather do that\nThan CNN it'd be quite candid with you it's not just a great network\nIs kind of the last you know people think oh it's owned by a government I don't care who owns it I can just say in my experience with it I go on I get time to respond and nobody tells you what to say I get a time and I get a general topic and sometimes the topic I get is not what they talk about um valuable to them because I can talk about anything\nBut um there you have it\nNow you just heard mark Warner's comments and the I'm In the ...

southern border put for twenty eight thousand out south southern boy we'd have a pretty good forced down there we spent our money is in this country\nIn the city that companies are around the globe\nNow we're talking that now we're talking see that's the plan\nLet's get or a troops out of Germany Japan and where else South Korea South Korea let's get him out and let's put them on the southern border that solves the problem and there is no increase costs now there's an argument that you haven't been in South Korea for ... reasons\nBut why we have twenty thousand troops in Germany and all those troops to Japan makes no sense whatsoever to anybody except those that want to perpetuate the military industrial complex and make money off supplying these troops over the globe because

go for DACA\nAnd they can go for a wall and they can go for the funding but they absolutely want chain migration because that gives them democratic votes and the Republican donors on Wall street back that too because that brings them cheap labor along with the illegals\nBut the president says I don't want chain migration\nBecause that puts a lock on the American economy I Want migration that is

are crowded\nIt was at a premium and immigration court backlogs are growing because they keep coming in and we simply can't process them and we can't arrest them and send them back we already tried

Nineteen days is up is grab a child if it's yours because it doesn't matter grab a child and your family\nAnd you're going to get an entry to the United states because the politicians are now on the

I mean I I don't even know how to even put this in in the logical terms\n\nMean what is a ... even want to ask Tim Kaine he had to admit I'm not for over borders I'm not for these people coming over I mean but you know that the Democrats are going to defend\nIt and they are now calling them economic refugees oh we're not accepting refugees we you know where's the richest country in the world is not

Yankee that's this is\nThe game in Lexington what time is it was one thirty on Saturday against citadel their rival this is the game at\nHome and uh one thirty I tell you what if you can make it down there you just go to the my dot com or Virginia military Institute dot com athletics get your tickets\nThere we're going to be a great game in my own sex and ... one for a both teams are looking for this big win but\nIt's going to be very interesting joining us now is a head coach Scott and walking on the coach this is the game on the day in Lexington you fired up\nI Am fired up for the battle for the shake oh obviously it'd be a great atmosphere\nPeople definitely make plans to come to the game they're bringing a freshman class to cheer them on will have the whole court here cheering us on and you have a great ball game always have been three years we played them in my for the call came down to the wire with a lot of exciting football\nWell a lot of money and sending football and uh they have a they have they have a pretty solid team or their their record hasn't shown it I think they're they're better than they looked start with their quarterback tournaments Jordan black\nAnd joined blacks first year I started a left handed off the record back extremely tough it's probably one of the better pastors they've had their uh for for a hundred and eighty a yard sale last week I was sixteen or twenty three so kind of opens up their traditional laws auction running attacked with some some good play action passing\nOut again very solid on the line they come off the ball low in heart varies simulate you practice you have to start running back they say they are balanced authentically not between running past\nBut in who touches the ball and where they touch the ball so very difficult to expand the pets sleep a multi pressure units are they bring a lot of letters from a lot of locations you have to be really solid or your past\nProtection against them and they played strictly hard and then special teams so they they get extremely well beat Mercer on the last\nDog a play the game right kickoff return for touchdowns so very well coached by rent Tom send their kids are like our young men they place strongly hard they fight for the for the final sound they never said die so heck of a ball game against a very odd topic talented team\nYeah in a couple of weeks ago um Palestine quarterback Tom Flaco by the way is the brother a younger brother\nOf a so called a quote unquote elite quarterback Joe ... a [laughter] ... is the elite quarterback ah well I don't know what based on uh the last game against tendency look pretty lead to me\nBut coach I'm Flatow really carved up the citadel defense and you look at you didn't ski and uh the the arm strength that he's got in the maturation he's gone through your quarterback you didn't see your fast receivers\nUm they they had a lot I watched some of the game actually they have a lot of uh let's say ... you've got opportunities I think in their secondaries at a fair analysis of mine\nWhy I think the federal defense probably learned a whole heck of a lot from that ball game it was you know first team they played that just threw the ball around a little bit and that's\nYou know they're young on defense like we are and so if the game got on I thought they played a lot better defense linking confidence is the game goes on and I think there'll be much better prepared the playoffs after playing that ball game you know ...\nAnd uh you know I think once again the young civil defense having seen that will be much better prepared to take on our style of all things coming into our games\nDo you look at a young quarterback or doing a little more scrambling out of the pockets maybe having some design runs slaves to keep the defense honest\nYeah we always have to design run plays in for the for the quarterbacking so that's\nPart of our all kinds of packages you keep the seat sense on\nA I'd prefer not to scramble\nFrom the pocket because that means we have a spleen pocket but they sell it protects the breaks down like it does you know at every level of football than you know obviously reached needs to maneuvering the pocket and do what do you think it needs to do whether it's run the ball or you know operating a scramble drilled that we've done you know since we installed", "show_name": "Red Eye
