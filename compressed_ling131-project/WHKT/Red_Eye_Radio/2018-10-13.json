episode\nI actually no way that this could have happened without there\nBeing a thought [noise] private planes were too many guys on on some of them have been linked to Saudi security services and intelligence from now it doesn't pass the smell to starting to you know we just cleaning out to the president this morning he he's describing\nThem killing a journalist there have been tens of thousands of civilians killed in Yemen they're doing it with our bombs were refueling\nThey're finding there and it's a big flyer and two weeks ago or three weeks ago they killed the school bus stroller children's school children were killed a year ago they killed a hundred and fifty people on a funeral procession and we wonder why someone in Yemen wants to drop a bomb on and\nKill the Saudi are killing American because they climb the fragments of the bombs were saying married young America\nAnd so we have to realize that reaction\nAnd and that's a blowback from us being involved in some ... gotten civil war a is one that we actually create more terrorists but here's the other possible thing that's going to happen again or what happened in Libya when we toppled Gadhafi\nWe've got offering more terrorism it became a breeding ground for terrorism my fear is that there is some remnants fairly\nFairly strong rent there is out there in yet but we're not fighting them that were Mitchell are stricter civil war between the who'd easing the salaries and also with Iranian influence as well but my fear is they're censoring the chaos\nAnd that you get the rise of al ... the same thing happening in Syria as that civil war that we got involved in the chaos you got the rise of ours\nWell actually uh the network that I go on June near a couple about a month ago was reporting that al Qaida fighters were actually given safe haven a by the by the Saudi forces in Yemen in ... in in order to fight the who the so\nCalled this wouldn't it wouldn't be surprising because here that the
