central Florida would come over to be helpful and help them out here but there's a lot of work that why not number one thing right now people made the power back\nAnd take a little bit\nThis is not about restoring power to actually in many cases about rebuilding the entire grid sort of a lot of work that lies ahead and I'm On the line that needs to be done\nI mean if and encouraging secretly throw around the country and around the south East I'm really precondition and getting there as quickly as they can look from the images that we're seeing as you said there\nAreas that it will take weeks months maybe years for them to get back and that's the way they were before the storm\nYeah again I'm going to talking about power for a moment I mean it's usually in these storms in some lines are down you put them backup you start to get power rowing in\nIn this particular case and it's a total rebuilding the system I mean there's stuff everywhere and then many of these structures that you can't even turn the power aren't going to start a fire and hurt somebody you've got to clear a lot out first\nMultiple we can vent multiple month and then\nEnded up getting better every day or get a

but the crews are from all over the country that are helpful over two hundred people working almost around the clock to get power restored and long term you worried about for example the agriculture industry down here and the forestry industry peanuts\nThe cotton crop was wiped out I mean these are people that I can make any money this year many cases and the economic damages\nThat will be here long after the towers are stored and even some of the structures are rebuilt there's a lot of work to do\nIt's encouraging me in terms of my folks and the panhandle into watching as communities come together and they're tough they will accept each other neighbors will end up in a long hard path to go\nThat are the strength or what we had the about Saudi Arabia as minute by minute things are changing\nMarkets happening today are calling a king said he absolutely denied that the secretary of state Pompeo over there\nI potentially get Saudi Arabia turkey and the other places as well to try to get the truth or the president make mention of potentially road killers it's language that people think that he may have gotten indirectly trauma Audi administration um newer democratic counterpart in the Senate Chris Murphy says that's been hearing a ridiculous called rolling killers theory\nGreat to be back with good\nYou said let's get to the Saudi Arabian situation sep not too good first they say well Jamal came out then they say they didn't come on it's like the ...\nOut now they say well maybe it was ...\nIt was ... ... murder and that he went in for interrogation and ah but there's no official statement\nComing from king Salman who denies the whole thing and now the Saudis threatening that there's any sanctions or they're gonna retaliate disrupt the world's economy and shoot up oil prices ... what the hell is going on here\nWell this individual who's not at the electric in your piece cry that he's not in America and it was a resident alien he's been caught up in the middle of a geopolitical competition between\nTwo Sunni nations who want to dominate the Sunni Muslim world that turkey which is becoming a new often when this theocracy on the\nCrime you ever go on and Saudi Arabia where Islam was started in the second century of of this person has been caught in the middle of an individual who is the reports are true about what happened to him didn't deserve what happened to him was a very very\n... character with very close ties to the Muslim Brotherhood even to the bin Laden family I'm an individual who was the biggest I'm speaking of the twentieth century ... so it's it's basically an individual caught in the middle of a science teacher competition\nSo the president sending a secretary of state Mike Pompeo a to Riyadh to try to get to the bottom of this find out what happened\nObviously the Saudis the first day when they put out which was not a this individual was there an hour guns people work in a department but they said the dog ate the cameras or something they they couldn't produce the footage of that now they're changing\nTheir a story how does this affect us relationship with the Saudis as it relates to Mohammed Mohammed Mohammed bin Salman\nWell when we were in the White House we were very encouraged by the reforms MPs was an interesting thing was used the term behavior modification Saudi Arabia has been in bed\nWith the wrong people for too long key members of the elite that have been funding and supporting a jihadi out the audio ... how they act\nAround the world that was going on a very very close with if there is not what we expect from a nation that says the recording itself so Michael players got up at the top of the closet Westport coma director he will get to the bottom of it\nAnd the report turned out to be true about what happened to be there will be consequences for Saudi\nArabia definitely in the field or on a I'm a traitor if my expectation [noise]\nDo you think that this might affect the United states are backing of the Saudi Emirates coalition\nI think I'm muscle movement right now in the region is where the where where in the beginning of the administration the GTC the Gulf Cooperation council turn it back on ... which is the worst offender in the region when it comes to sponsoring radical Islamic groups\nThat that's going to be the primary concern that we we we maintain pressure\nOn during the G cc continues to to behave in ways that that lessen the impact on the importance of these radical groups all talk about this is the second the second to the to the\nOrder of second most important of all ... Iran so you know that there is the balance in the region but the constant competition between the Sunni Muslims as big as she has the most of those are the raw egg recall we what we cannot have negative consequences from this are brand making Iran stronger\nSo if you were vice president Trump right now if you just turn the clock back and you're in the oval office what would be the advice\nYou would give to the president has this new information comes out in their peers\nThat it appears that this guy was murdered or allegedly in constantly because as\nMarco Rubio just said on Fox and friends he came in he didn't come out so he sees you still there already dead there's only two really outcomes of this what would your advice me to a ...\nWell I I'm not going to speculate what happened what will happen right all the garbage that's been written all read the story\nOr what I what I what I meant by the\nPresident is that we we have to do more than we have to have supplied absolute full disclosure by the Saudi Arabia tree in as to what happened and then once we have\nFull disclosure we will make the requisite decision which is not the Obama administration will get a game plan away right we have to have full disclosure I'm than the president will will decide whether it's arms trade thing whether it's the support we give economically to uh\nTo Saudi Arabia that that will suffer whether it was something else\nWhat did you think of when\nThe president went to the un and this this past two weeks ago at the annual meeting and he and he said to king Salman he's looking a you know this is all find that more friends and all but like\nYou got to start paying out for the defense we're giving you protection you're you're you're only paying three percent\nI Want that double your your your oil prices are too high a lot of people were outraged by that but then to examine said well gee nobody ever asked me that and he said well I'm not going to do that\nHow does that all play out\nWhat the president is a pragmatist and he's constantly questioned this isn't just about Saudi Arabia is about up uh partners and friends in age from elsewhere in Europe the very simple question why is it the country's littering rather pretty well they need us to sort\nThrough a subsidized that spends so it's a very rich\nRichest countries in the world and you don't meet up the substance subsidized you'll go with the fences and a lot of ... any part of the world not just start to rape you\nTell us seven Gorka about uh the new book that you have out why we fight why should people by that\nWell look it's it's a great read it's about all of a threat we face if you want to understand all of the dangers out there and how the president's going to beat them whether it's Russia or China\nYou know whether it's a North Korea or whether it was it wrong but in the book gives you that strategic analysis but more important I I've been to ... the big picture stuff with the story is a great American heroes going right back where he was off post over the years go up through\nThe board walk through with the marine corps veteran checks the colder\nThan Vietnam with capital red McDaniel spent six and a half years and the oil to as a prisoner of war never never ever losing faith in God or in the United states and there's a lot of sleep in a in a in a in a in a creek\nIs parallel to justice capital that I hadn't planned my my last story is about um with the good chambers who was ...\nIn Nineteen forty eight before capital was even born amount of stood up for the truth in Congress was attacked the Democrats tried to destroy them just as they try to\nDestroy the capital so if you want to know what's going on in the world that you know what to do about it and re instill\nIn yourself you know space in the American way of life and the great some stories about great American heroes of why we fight is [noise]\n... what was what was the famous book that was written on the cruise chambers\nHas hit on his autobiography witnesses wet nearly life changing book\nDo you know that that my ... my father who's long dead now he was just a blue collar worker but um I was in high school and uh he used to be used to pay me to read to hug she bring them home when he\nCame out ... yeah this is a true story give me five or ten dollars\nTo read it and that was one of the first ones he brought home and that was the ten dollar bill because it was pretty big and then I Would read them and even even I say I'm done and it would give me ten dollars\nBut then like three days you'd asked me a question and I have the answer that question and I turned out but I never got a big thick book and it was called witness\nAnd I was a sophomore and he said a high school say yet

to get some answers about what happened to the Saudi embassy inside turkey\nYou know what happened who's to blame well I Know there's nothing happens in Saudi Arabia was in the U.S knowing it who's going to be a he's the thirty three year old crown prince who jumped him over other people he's the son of the existing king\nAnd I think he's on a on a bad track\nI can never do business with Saudi Arabia again until we get this behind that phrase and what does that mean that means I'm not going back to Saudi Arabia is longest this guy in charge so you're selling the crown prince has to leave their stuff to them but I'm not going to I've been their biggest offender on the floor of the United States Senate disguise wrecking ball\nHe had just gotten murdered in a conflict in Turkey and to

sanctions in the Senate once we get to the bottom of it if indeed we find out that they were ... murder in the in the conflict\n\n[noise] so um\n\n[noise] that is pretty I mean that that that that is

and bring them back down to the state at every opportunity and back down to our local officials who know how to deal with them better\nAnd it was when it comes to drugs the opioid crisis is exactly this problem we passed a ton of rape built up at the federal level but the problem is the money is trapped got our community service sports at the state level and it's not making its way down to our our our local sheriffs in Chesterfield in Waco and all kinds of our county\nAnd those drugs are vitally needed and we need low cost drugs and so the basic idea is to return power back to states and localities\nThank you congressman brat I'm Sorry I Want to remind our audience that we do have reception penalty seven seconds for Mr grant\nDave sorry or\nMrs spanberger Abigail if you would um would you like the question again\nI don't get ...\nI travel that process is the number one issue that people are talking about the rising costs\nNumber one thing that people are talking about and how it is that we can actually addressed the prescription drug price\nIssue is we need more competition in the marketplace currently\nIt's possible for pharmaceutical companies to do what's called patents ticketing where they elongate the patents and they they depressed competition Medicare for example needs to be able to negotiate his prescription drug prices the Veterans Administration is able to do so and some drugs are up to eighty percent cheaper on the Veterans Administration side than they are on Medicare side\nIn terms of what we need to do overall with health care\nAnd I think we'll probably be talking about this quite a lot we need to strengthen our current healthcare system and we need a public option you will hear my opponent speak very frequently if some expensive program that I Do in fact not support I support the public option but while we're talking about the costs and special interest money I\nThat in our tax bill the twenty Seventeen tax bill that added to the deficit to the tune of one point nine trillion dollars pharmaceutical companies to top five pharmaceutical companies got forty two billion dollars in tax\nAnd so when we're looking about at the reason we cannot find a we cannot lower the price of prescription drugs and Medicare cannot negotiate his prescription drug prices it is because of the pharmaceutical body it's so great it's great that when we had a congressman right congressman brat\nWho said he would not add to the deficit to vote against spending bills because I Would add to the deficit is willing to add one point nine trillion dollars to the deficit in order to get tax cuts to the tune of forty two billion dollars to pharmaceutical companies\nThey can just remember my out of your journey for next question which tries to deal with immigration what impact if any has the current administration's immigration policies and on for juniors workforce\n\nAs a country need comprehensive immigration reform\nIs something that has been talked about for years we have not achieved bipartisan comprehensive immigration reform and right here in colpepper\nHave heard stories from people in the agricultural business who are concerned about whether long term they will have the employees that they need\nPeople threw out or districts are concerned about the way immigration has become such a politically divisive issue the truth of the matter is we need immigration reform comprehensive bipartisan immigration reform that achieves a number of things first that secures our borders and our points of entry I worked at CIA as a former\nAs a former CIA officer I worked Under Cover I worked counterterrorism I worked in narco trafficking traffic\nUnderstanding the drug cartels working throughout Nextel I Am well aware\nOf the threats that present themselves at the southern border and it's for that reason that we need comprehensive immigration reform that is strong on border security and strengthening our coincidental but we also need immigration reform that will meet the needs of the employers here throughout the seventh district here throughout the commonwealth of Virginia and we need\nAnd not white bipartisanship should look like this is a pressing issue that is impacting communities and economies across central Virginia and that's part of this country and we need bipartisanship to actually to ride\nA change on this issue but when we look at what my opponent has been\nFor it is not a bipartisan solution the the bill of a compromise building he so frequently talked with out it was a compromise between the far right and the more moderate Democrat\nAnd the more moderate Republican there was a compromise cell there wasn't bipartisan bill that was put forth in Congress they couldn't get out of committee this time around but it was put forth by a Republican and Democrat there are people who are willing who were working to try and find ... bipartisan solutions but there are currently not enough to run in Congress\nThank you out of Camp David\nYeah thank you for the question I think had to do can you repeat the question\nLabor force shows what if what impact if any has the current administration's immigration policies hadn't Virginia's workforce\nYeah as I say we achieved eight years old my first of all avoiding a huge amnesty bill which would have had a devastating impact on wages for the nation as labor supply goes up with a huge amnesty American wages go down\nAmerican Jobs go down and so our efforts on that front had been very positive and so uh my opponent just brought up comprehensive immigration reform we had the good laugh feel this year\nAnd she says that's not my hardest Obama was for that the Clintons were for e verify is a major components in that bill every one until the last couple of years left has gone off the rails\nAnd so every major Democrat including Barbara Jordan the great civil rights leader was in favor of all the components in that good laugh 'til it is bipartisan compromise we took care of seven hundred thousand DACA kids gave them a legal status that's a compromise no Democrat would vote for it\nThen President Trump upped the one point eight million DACA kids the Democrats said no to that compromise than I did a bill that United parents and kids at the border with Senator Ted Cruz and Chuck Schumer the Democrat said no to that bill\nSo if you look at the facts of the matter and the actual legislation that came up and the vote it's very clear that my opponent falls to the very far left\nOn this issue of immigration she's been on the record in favor of sanctuary cities she said the states and localities to deal with these issues we don't need to cooperate with federal government that's what sanctuary cities are you don't cooperate with the law of the land we have plenty of write laws on the books if we would only follow the law\nAnd so it's just a matter of simple law enforcement\nAnd of course we need our federal ice agents working with us at the state and local\nHurt her objection there is very radical if you think about she said don't follow the law the way we should not cooperate with federal law enforcement and that's done it\nThe ice agents are the ones who are protecting us from the three hundred million lethal doses of fat and all that came across the border last year the heroin the ... the human trafficking\nAnd and write it down in Chesterfield if you don't think it's a serious problem we have a hundred and fifty badge and had rifle alone for that and it's on the on oh start thank you very much thank alright I'm a Applegate was chosen to use one of a red cards you have\nOne minute to ...\nThank you so much and congressman brat I appreciate you explain it in the role of federal law enforcement agents because indeed I used to be one I used to work jointly with ice I worked joint drug cases in fact in the DC area with the high intensity drug trafficking areas for it's often and it's higher\nI'm well aware of the role of federal agents I Do not support ... havens for criminals or gangs I Do not support anything\nThat would make our community is weak or our enemies in fact I used to work every single day to keep the community I Lived in state to keep our communities free of driving on the street so for me to read anything else this is frankly comical\nUm but in fact I Would like to state for the record\nThat I support law enforcement in all its foreign because I used to be among on an island the daughter of a career law enforcement officer [noise]\n\nYou're listening to the treasury common sense [noise]\nOn the radio stations are rich and\nRich or [noise]\n\nAnd we paid for the entire liberal order that has brought us all together for a win win we made friends with our our enemies the Germans and the Japanese and now we all our friends and play when when together on trade and economic growth and it's been great for our country\nAnd so that is the result that we've achieved with this executive and our Congress this year the economy is now booming we still have work to do with China\nBut when it comes to our agriculture is the largest sector in Virginia and so we work very hard with our foreign bureaus across all my ten counties to protect them and to ensure that any tariffs negotiations are short lived in a matter of months not years\nBut we have to do that it's basically more a matter of geopolitics and not a matter of trade policy on trade we all want zero tariffs and the White House is dead\nThank you see this radio isn't updated version of NAFTA which has some positive benefits particularly for Gary it's which is impactful here in colpepper and across our communities in the seventh district\nThe notion that we would move toward zero terrorists starting a trade war is not something that I understand and in fact we have antagonize\nAnd our trade partners by creating and starting a trade war when we looked at the fact\nAs congressman brat just said China is a big threat in China it's such a big threat why don't we comfortable with the fact that they hold\nThe most amount of our debt debt that we have now just chosen thanks to the tax bill is twenty Seventeen to increase by one point nine trillion dollars and these parents and the changes that they've made habits in great and if you don't believe me as to twenty\nThousand Ford workers who just lost their job\nBecause Ford said they couldn't handle the steel and aluminum tariffs that depleted their income by one billion dollars and then we can talk about the soybean farmers right here\nThe seventh district soybean farmers right here who because of these terrorists\nHave decreased prices for Bush will\nIt costs about ten dollars and five cents per bushel for soybean farmers to break even prices since the terrorist went into place I haven't been above nine dollars we're creating challenges in our community and to answer them the president's desire the president's choice whereas in fact to put a twelve billion dollar bailout\nOn the American taxpayers back at twelve billion dollar bailout farmers don't want bailout they wants to sell their crops\nAnd so the notion that we would start a trade war to begin to get ourselves the point where we're\nDoesn't make any sense to me it is reckless foreign policy it creates detrimental relationships with our friends\nLong term is tremendously detrimental to our stability in the world\nThank you how do I do thank you very much would move to our next question I'm when I'm Sorry I Apologize this question is for you\nAnd the second amendment there continues to be a growing public concern regarding gun violence and school safety one measures would you put in place to provide a safe environment for students\n\nThat they mentioned I Am a former law enforcement officer and get to carry a gun every single day I Am well aware of the responsibility of gun ownership I grew up in a house with guns I grew up in the family a sportsman\nBut we can have\nConversations in our community about how it is that we can balance or Second Amendment right which I firmly support\nThe rights of our school children to go to school and he'll say in our county ... county I say our\nBecause Congress and lived there as well one of our schools had\nThe day that I put my children on the bus\nWhen there was a threat of gun violence in our county which is a hard day no parents\nThree out of for duty paying and are a member believe the background checks should be in place background checks on all firearms\nPurchases it's simply a find the same standard that exist if you go to a federally licensed place a point of sale like that was that they can buy a gun show\nThat is a first step forward that we can take the other thing that we should be doing when looking at gun violence in ensuring that our schools have the resources to deal with students who might be facing trauma or who might be facing strap\nMight be at risk for violent behavior they tend to comprehend the issue is not one that we can solve any day but he does certainly not one that we will be able to solve if we do not have leaders in Washington who are willing to have a hard conversations but the good news and there are already members of Congress who are willing to have that\nConversation there is a bipartisan background checks bill in Congress couldn't get out of committee because there was not a critical mass of people willing to have cars conversations\nAnd so I Want to go to Congress will be a part of these discussions again I understand gun ownership I understand the responsibility of gun ownership and these are congregations we can have about ensuring that people who are at risk themselves their community or others are not able to do harm in our schools\nYou rather go Dave is thank you very much a this is a tough conversation to have and we've had plenty of them in the seventh district I have a daughter in the audience that goes to public schools well and of course we all work hard every day on this issue to keep our kids very safe\nSo I can be a major group of all the folks across all ... counties school resource officers school councilors mental health experts sheriff's police first responders\nEveryone who was in a room with school councilors so that we had all voices dance and they came up with three solutions are they all share with you tonight up first and this was after the Parkland, Florida in in a lot of dishes in response to the failure in Parkland and we don't want to repeat that\nIn our counties here and so the first ones to harden the schools with school resource officers the second was to enhance significantly mental health\nEveryone was agreement that that was probably the major peach we need to work on and that's connected to the third piece which is to connect the dots between the federal government state government the FBI their local the localities and law enforcement and then the schools themselves\nAnd that was a total tragedy in Parkland, Florida they connected note that the FBI did not talk to the states to states didn't talk to them all the ... the look at the local police force visited that young boys home twenty times\nAnd no dots were connected the school resource officer was not in the schools in our districts and across our counties we have outstanding law law enforcement you see them with us today\nThe FBI is in constant communication with our state leaders and I'm very proud of the work our law enforcement does on these issues and so those are the primary solutions that I received by listening to my constituents those are the experts in our community and that's what they came up with\nA when it comes to gun if you want to follow the Nancy ...\nFinish the question I have a few more seconds that when we if you want to look at the liberal Nancy Pelosi agenda and my opponent will be a vote for that entire agenda all you have to do is look at the blue states and blue town they say let's just work on this issue in this issue in this issue and have conversations about it\nBut up in those blue states they want to take away your gun and they have taken away guns and crime has not gone down at all in San Francisco or Chicago or New York\nCongressman thank you again there was a ... there was a a family of nine seconds on that answer thank you I see\nOur next question goes to you as well sir I'm dealing with education and workforce readiness\nAccording to the Federal Reserve national student debt reached one point five trillion and the first quarter of twenty Eighteen\nBecause of this and the challenge challenge recent college graduates are facing in finding full time limit or unemployment of adequate implement that it could pay high school students are hesitant were skeptical in a row in traditional two or four year colleges\nWhat plans do you have to either provide insurance to future collegiate or expand higher education funding to college alternatives such as the TV and trade schools\nRight thank you very much for the question is you know as a professor ran for Twenty years at Randolph Macon College\nAnd I work with students every day on a career planning and got to work with community colleges with senator stylish and not CD for years our our districts are blessed with great current technical programs already an excellent programs in the trade but we have huge moves we can still making sure man is part of that solution\nUntil last year our results we improve the K. to twelve education bill by\nTaking away federal mandates and so now our states and localities are not under all of the federal burns for high stakes testing constantly and they have the latitude to add these courses and internships and on the job training and career technical education\nAnd that's step one step to this year I'm On the education committee and we also provided result\nIn higher read by doing it he still that enhanced and broaden all sorts of opportunities for kids to [noise] to follow new and improved path\nAt four year college is not for everyone and we have to break that stigma for our kids there's nothing wrong and there are great opportunities right now are truckers starting pay in my district to sixty five thousand dollars for truckers\nWe have a welder electricians

were there there was no\nCommunication back to the authorities are in the government of Saudi Arabia now the new explanation\nSeems intended to ease a political crisis for the Saudis and to diffuse

looking at the same face\nSaudi Arabia is looking to save face so they got can talk to a story let the guy was murdered right he went in there to get a piece of paper and they chop them up into little pieces and put them back and you're going to tell me that that was not authorized by somebody and this is after they lied and said well he just left\n\nNow they have to come clean here because the

David ...\nSaying that he thought he did very well or last night's debate I think the one thing that he laid out is really spanberger securely seal here\nWhich is a as I watched the debate she didn't really put together a connector coherent message\nAnd it's a lot of soundbites and you know she's in a very as I said she's a walking a tightrope here is she's in a Republican leaning district that went again last year's two thousand Seventeen\nDemographic Democrat crap in Virginia blue wave of all time oh it's still went for the last three by three David got enough money to be competitive sheets\nQuarter so to speak to her campaign is going to be able to spend money on whatever they need they have a ton of money and that's an advantage if not be\nA it's it's not the um the final answer but when you've got to cornucopia of resources at your disposal in the last Twenty one days in a campaign and you you gotta lotta options [noise]\nSo she has a lot of options but it seemed like she was playing\nLast night's debate not to lose like don't say anything dumb\nOr just ride the wave and she was okay you know um but she's going more on hey I'm a CIA person I've served my country I'm a mom I'm great I'm smart I'm cool\nAnd a little lighter on the issue I mean there's all all about the issues that I think you know when you have this kind of an economy that you're back he's got the advantage [noise]\nSo um I don't think ... anything to help herself last night\nBut I don't think she did anything to hurt us up so I think if you went into this debate and you are not going to vote for the Republican candidate you are not going to vote for days [noise] I think you came out of it and you're not going to vote for me I don't think like David changed any minds of his anti\nUh of the the um the blue waivers and the liberal moms have Chesterfield and all that stuff I don't think you changed anything [noise] and I don't think Abigail hurt herself with her base\nNow\nAh here's where I thought they did very very well anybody wavering like if you could really make a decision if you're a true independent and had an open mind last night uh\nSpanberger did nothing to get your vote so again she she had just counting on the Sioux nominee sweeping or into power if you're an independent or a moderate Republican or a moderate Democrat and your truly had major mind up\nAnd you saw this debate or you are more likely to vote for Dave after it then when it started you are not more likely to row for spanberger and that's why we have to look at the ... are you more likely ended either\nEither neither candidate did anything to depress their base both candidates I mean I\nThink they fired his up a little bit more Abigail's got a different style she's a little more long winded\nShe doesn't have the a quick retort for Dave has so her communication style is different not worse or better it's just different and doesn't really up against brat\nAh he just it it gives them an advantage because of span burgers more low key more of a post communication style so all of these things were playing into Dave's favor last night\nAnd I answered the question point blank well why don't you have other debates I mean I I for the life of me after last night's debate I Would think that they would call her up and say look we're scheduled debate every three days I mean I don't care what\nBut um you know consult joined control these campaigns and\nThey have their own way of doing things but hopefully there'll be other debates and\nYou know he said something about somebody got fired and so they couldn't have this other debate but I didn't get fired and I still don't have a date and I can tell you for the radio debate that I proposed that both camps agreed to uh the holdup is not spammer the spanberger campus basically given a bunch of dates for this\nAnd the hold up is the ... campaign so let's just get that out there and I don't think I don't see how we're going to have it now because it's one or two over sixteenth I mean we got three weeks Twenty one days but I'll keep following up and we'll see what happens\nCortland asking coming up eight thirty five people

in\nJohn what genius I slipped on the Senate races [noise]\nWithout revealing any information public I think you're a hundred percent spot on the Republicans are going to pick up seats in the U.S

think that I hold Arizona and John I'm going to sleep for some of the country right now\nNobody's talking about it we got a credible\nCandidate running for Senate mission is closer to seven out right now John James anybody predicted she now he's an American small business owner and even going to win that Senate Michigan you mark my words\nSo you'd think that John James in Michigan has actually shot to be standing about\nI think so about two months ago but the the more I learned about the tenacity and the campaign and\nStoring can't complete accord Americans should be [noise] family still up in Detroit\nIt was when he took over when it came back from his military service catching on [noise] right [noise]\nWell I tell you what that is on nobody radar screen Corey let's go over these races because I'm predicting right now that\nThe Republicans are going to pick up five or six seats everybody says I'm Crazy\nUm Hussein is for some time or the tendency race Blackburn bread and saying\nI'm Marcia pulling way ahead now in that race she is going to win that's going to be a whole remember tendency Corey Lewandowski was was one of those seats\nThat the Republicans were that the Democrats were Charlie about that they thought they could pick up that is now not gonna happen Blackburn way way ahead what do you see their\n[noise] Democrat [laughter] term Democrat from Marcia walks away\nRight she's up by ten now so that's going to be a that's a that's that's that's\nThat's going to be a whole no question a let's get to and we we both believe that the Republicans are going to hold a Arizona with Sally I don't even think that's going to be close a when it's all said and done and I think we're going to we're going to win the bottom as I've been saying for some\nSome time or let's get to Montana Jon Tester are being challenged by Matt Rosendale or re public the real clear politics has\nThis about two or three within the margin of error\nAre predicting Rosendale wins what do you see there\nIn the polling has actually two points before President Trump goes and Montana this week to do a campaign rally [noise] you know the presidents who in the west coast when he's going to do that and Montana to put exclamation point on that you're going to see\nJohn tester become former U.S senator from Montana and we're going to have a new Republican pickup in Montana three weeks from\nJosh Hawley are probably the biggest surprise for Republicans some people not sure that he was going to be the best candidate he's turned out to be a very good candidate remember Claire McCaskill who won\nIn a two thousand two well she beat Todd Akin whose campaign at the end of the told him and\nUh she is now trailing to only in a in the door\n[laughter] [noise] I don't want to change over that will never underestimate Claire McCaskill who's raise twenty five dollars a month but John [noise] something [noise] [noise] [noise]\nNow I Want to get to Florida Corey where with ... uh we do these predictions overtime obviously the majority of them here and he and I are spot on we probably have our own\nIn Florida or post show it very close within the margin of error Bill Nelson with a small lead\nWe don't know what the hurricane impact does this governor of Florida it's been Stiller with these hurricanes I mean he's got a rapid response team they get power on very quickly\nUm so we'll see how this plays out that the devastating hurricane in Panama City but I thought from the beginning Scott what's going to win this race\nYou know same thing but I'll tell you what now for nothing much stronger fight and I thought it was going to I thought by now\nThree weeks ago Rick Scott yup four or five points and he'd be starting to pull this races talking\nYou know you can't estimate the people's focus away rightly so from the elections but that being said you've got to exceptionally well known individuals who both statewide experience I have seen from\nBill in front of the Florida and so this comes back Scott can still talk about but if you would have told me with three weeks ago Rick Scott down one or two points to the public I Would have said no to that goes to tell you the type of campaign\nThat Rick Scott is trying to run as fighting for because he wants to be returned to the U.S [noise]\nAll right I I thought that this race would always be tied up until the end I think I think Scott ... wins he's been a very popular governor\nAnd so I think he's he's got the ... there in the state of North Dakota Heidi Heitkamp down ten or Thirteen I think that's over\nThat race is over Congress and Kramer whether it'd be calling senator Kramer very soon [noise]\nOkay so that that gets us to Indiana Joe Donnelly still clinging to a slight lead over a Mike Braun um I just don't see Indiana's returning Joe Donnelly in this climate that we have with the economy\nGoing so well I'm predicting that are Donnelly goes on him Mike Braun when she wants to you\nI agree with you John look this was the vice president's home state he was out campaigning there this weekend he was friday and Saturday a brother is on the ballot in Indiana [noise] is doing so helping might run for that Senate\nRace this is a big focus of the administration because of the vice president home state the administration can be Donald and so I think you see brown come on\nTwo weeks and talked to open up his lead over sleepy Joe Donnelly\nOkay so um I went to New Jersey I Know a couple about a month ago you said that might come into play I don't see it Mendez up by ten Fifteen and he's going to\nKnow what I saw some internal numbers yes they don't want to reveal but I'll tell you what if I was on them and that's when I saw the numbers and I guess I'd be scared to death you've got this Republican\nAnd I just flip a coin today I Would say yes that is going to buy the resources the Democrats have to put in there and they just keep on going to charge resources away from elsewhere and I'm not convinced that short\nFortified point race right now it's causing quickly\nSo I don't think he's going to win so we can just a Korean that only because I'm from New Jersey and I just can't see them beat him and then as but let me ask you this in West Virginia I'm I'm I'm really shocked at this I thought Morsi would be much better position against Joe mansion\nMany years now but the most recent surveys that have come out mentioned is still holding an eight nine point lead and I think there's ... did\nYou turn in general have any chance that older Corey\nWhat he does the reasoning doesn't it because the Trump Pence ticket won that state by forty two points if any state that has some country I think it's fair that's West Virginia [noise]\nAnd you see the amount of time that the president the vice president in that state campaigning I Believe they're going to be in that state how third congressional district in that Senate race now every time the president and vice president goes in that state numbers\nAbout a month ago mention was sitting at fifty four percent\nThe president's been in a few times and now they're offering under fifty
