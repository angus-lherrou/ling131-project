ready to go Mike what's going on in New Hampshire these days\nWell I'll tell you what we got a we had a couple of presidential candidates running for twenty twenty already here in the last week so\nAh things are wrapping up\nSo this is only from the Democratic side no Republicans have gone up there right\nNo well you know this is talk of course about John Kades sick and or Jeff blank running against Donald Trump for the Republican nomination\nI actually wrote I'm an op ed for the statewide paper here in New Hampshire just last week and it's pretty silly to take on Donald Trump I'm a ... you know he is a ... any time a Republican primary\nWhere a sitting president has been challenged it's been on the right job and these guys will be running on the last day really wouldn't have a prayer feeding the president and the Republican primary\nRight now right now that's that's right now anything can happen goodness knows what\nCan happen any think of course and especially you know God Forbid the economy collapses\nAnd that's what got you know when something like that but if but if what if Mueller drops of big weren't things can change All right let's let's shift in the Democratic nomination credit primary where I think we're four hundred and Seventy nine days away something like that from the Democratic hamster [laughter] who's currently\nRight now that's why I think it's I think it's smart crush for you to be talking about this stop and because the the presidential I just stopped as you well know there's there's all kinds of things happening behind the scenes right now\nThis is where it happens right the person that I broke frozen out then [laughter]\nAnd then come the day after November's election candidates start doing things in a more public way but like I said senator or Joe a branch from New York was op hearing yesterday campaigning with the Democrats can't pay a candidate for governor\nAll across the country and um [noise] ah so she's starting to support things together\nI'm Alec Baldwin I Know it may seem showy I'm sure you've heard about it to the guys he he's making round he made his second trip to New Hampshire just this past weekend real\nTwice in the last six months Alec Baldwin Alec Baldwin and he said he has not ruled out running for private wow\nThank you Mike we're making news this morning this was my comment in my producer in the show looking at we're making news this morning Steve bullock\nThis one that was a young Alex Alec Baldwin has um a spoke at the largest fundraiser for the Democrat Party in New Hampshire who um just last week that wow\nSee if he ran his old out Goldman is Jack Ryan you know it's kind of my God yeah but [laughter]\nThat was back in the Cold War you know a hundred October [laughter] that's right yeah so so who else you've seen up in in New Hampshire and who would you guess to be the front runners in the New Hampshire primary today likely to win or the twenty twenty primary in February mixture European\nBernie Sanders ... Mr President she will be the front runner okay just no doubt about it now I Need New Hampshire no doubt about it ... if he got drink a than a lizard miss Warren will likely be the front runner\nOkay so how 'bout what recently happened with Senator Warren in New Hampshire how does that play with her I mean fumbling of the DNA ancestry ball this week the disaster\nYou know and and democratic circles I actually don't think it does much a liberal Democrats are going to be looking for a liberal Democrat regardless of facts\n[laughter] [laughter] you know they said they face their their choices in in possession primarily on emotion and the\nJesse Paris from a I Would just going to do if you heard that the very a veteran democratic operative in in Iowa\nWas describing a I'm a so called scene but in reality in the in the Democratic voters in the primary motor that they also want to win and they might go you know I don't think it's interesting when nationally I think\nThat that's the other you know I I'm a Republican I think it was\nA bit worn would have a similar problem\nI don't think she's electable in a in a general election nationally nationally okay yeah I I like the open that using DNA issue as an example\nUm I ... and so I think one thing I Will say though it's a I I don't think it affected her here in New Hampshire I Do think it affected the again the behind the scenes operation a and then you know the\nAll the maneuvering going on behind the scenes among potential democratic candidates for her to actually take over a news cycle before the election the way she did was outrageously self serving\nAnd butter leaving do [laughter]\nSome of the DNA test and it was counter to your narrative that you're trying to ... after you put that thing up midday on Christmas [laughter] you Mary that's right you know [laughter]\nNo I don't understand it so how do you think ah okay so you got Sanders worn just because this New Hampshire but the other guys have got to go up there and compete or do they have to they might say just say\nYou know I think they do I think that you know because there's always going to be opportunities and that's as you probably know Chris ... the um Clinton made a name for himself by doing well and and coming back to to win at a time when he was losing\nSo you don't have to win the New Hampshire primary to make to make a poll waves across the country\nSo especially as Elizabeth Warren ... she's from Massachusetts neighboring Massachusetts\nTook the candidate who comes in second and third or a kitten get momentum as a result\nYeah 'cause I think Clinton finished third right yeah that's right yeah so\nSo but you have to win pleasure show in New Hampshire to advance do you have to yeah that's right that is correct and I just I don't think people understand about the the democratic nomination process this cycle is that California\nHas moved up yeah and they're gonna that's expensive snake and Kamala Harris McConnell Harris was going to have a big lead there\nYes and that's the I think that's going to be the interesting thing I didn't hear you guys talked about that sort of put it on the Iowa\nA conversation but what she does in the early primary states will be interesting given the California moved up well she tried we'll ... we'll see try and a ... and pick a state to do was to try and do well in all of them and um you know because they're so different set up so early primary states ... compared to California\nWell again I think you have to at least try to compete in some of these because the reality is even though you might not win New Hampshire you won't matter and the the\nNomination legitimately so you still have to win in the in the electoral college that you can't you can't just blow past Iowa New Hampshire because those are those who have gone in either direction especially with Trump won in Iowa lesson that's right no doubt about it what issues or drive in New Hampshire voters these days what's going on up there\nFor well ... they would expect to uh the economy is still\nThe number one issue um the governor here is a Republican Christian you knew and he's and uh uh with what Donald Trump's been to an addict and governor Sununu the economy's booming we have the second lowest unemployment rate in the country\nAnd um how the Democrats don't want to talk about that they're trying to talk about anything but the economy with\nA family you know he paid leave issue ... they're just trying to make up an issue that might connect with voters authors in the economy so that's going to continue to be number one the second issue here Chris I I don't know how it how it worked in other states you've heard Donald Trump\nEven talk about this is the opioid epidemic to a which is pretty some pretty severe in New Hampshire so that's the second biggest issue really\nThat's that's yeah you have to say the numbers\nAs well and so it's a ... a member of people dying as a result of that as the doors anything else it dies countries but sit down and say they don't even get a handle on it now because I'm part of him and he\nSaid it's not a partisan issue Mike a final productions what do you think coming out with got thirty seconds punch it when he got further the Democratic nominee or the Democratic finishers in New Hampshire twenty twenty\nI think it's going to go a little bit Warren a well when or if she she's going to win the New Hampshire primary um there's going to be I I think there's going to be some kind of dark horse like a\nUm a court reporter I expect will be somewhere in the top three um and then and then you know what I Would not be surprised at someone like Michael Bloomberg you don't have it as well because the Democratic state we need we need a bank or all of a businessman\nAll different All right Mike Denny joining us from the Granite State of New Hampshire four hundred and eighty days plus or minus out of the New Hampshire primary thanks for joining us we'll be back on the John ... filling in extra like my\nHow how about you know we're not going to let a lot of money\nI mean the north north should or should the anyone involved but how do you how do you compare the intensity\nThis year to last year when he was the same similar not as intense as well\nSimilar but I think we we're we're very proud particularly in Virginia last year when we send a message to the country into the world that you know hate and bigotry have no place here and that we were open\nAnd welcoming for business with the election of governor north him and his team and then you know that that gives verse set of a house candidates that got across the finish line that just beautiful tapestry of um of of of our our\nOur candidates that are women and a diverse women and I just eat up so that was that was really great but I think what has happened is people realize we hey we can do this we can do this and it just helped doubled down and we've seen for example the\nSurge in the absentee ballot thing um in Fairfax County and Orange County which our number one and two right now in the state or requests for absentee ballots you know that's good for us that's that's really going on I ... I think we're just at you know adding more excitement and enthusiasm right\nLike quitting kid was on earlier in the southern clock tower and he said he's he thinks the turnout is going to be forty to forty five percent that's a large large a range and there but we all projecting turn out right now\nWe're just going out there looking for every single vote\nAnd [laughter] I Know where do you think the terminals gotta\nYour average mid term elections which normally are hard\nAnd a sandwich going to be better than your average and it turns out you know I'm not in the business of of that we're just gonna we're we've just reached or we can\nYou're describing\nGround yeah we're in a G. O. T. V. now phase and we are just trying to get out our vitamins and bring over anybody else that wants to come\nUp the been impressed with your with your crop of Kansas this year and last year they they definitely worked hard what struck me as a sort of an obvious one is that your the predominant of the male candidates nominees\nRight if this is definitely the year the woman I like to talk about our women candidates and then I got an Anthony Flaccavento nine [laughter]\nI mean Jennifer Wexton is is I mean and they're all they have a different kind of experience and diversity but it is good at all will be a good refreshing brass I'm\nA for Congress and across the crops up autonomy several states that are in general for waxed and up there on the ... congressional district God we are really excited about what we see up there\nUm the volunteers are just showing up on non stop and the Washington Post indoor stroke which is something that I'm a you know I ... got endorsed every other time when they're very disappointed that her that she's going to stand up to Donald Trump and that proved not to be the case so ah her ...\nGoing to be um a congresswoman and then down in uh I'll just run through a real quick if you want to ask me something about him but we were all a lawyer and the second district retired navy commander in a small business woman and of course Scott Taylor got his own his own problems with da\nYou know trying to cheat and quite frankly and on\nAnd and and having a staff or put half fraudulent ah signatures on the ballot I mean that's you know that's unheard of stop that's pretty safely and I I think the divers are going to reject that but but even that we you know without that we still have a fine you know could credible candidate\nWell I Would have I don't know what I've seen in your in your candidate you haven't been obviously a female when I think it says regardless of the outcomes\nAnd we can talk about polling and they'll come November and you know when kids got the Taylor up and he's got ... up and Coburn and then\nIn your Williams and Louis in the in the six uh when I think it's sending a signal though is that you're going to see even more women in the future running for office regardless of party and I think it's a very healthy dynamic\nYeah yeah and I want to I Want I Want to say two things on that real quick we were really excited that Leslie cover and just got moved into the red the blues um program for the D triple C but the thing I think you're exactly right about women women have always um um\nWomen have always and studies show yes but you know then the ones that would and I know your mom would agree with me on that she would have\nBeen harder for her and say don't go\nAway I got raise my kids I got to get my degree got to pay off my line and you know a man can do it better and I think really one of the I guess if you have to\nWaiting anymore we're going to step up your mom lives mom yeah something to offer\nAnd I I think that you we will just see more and more of that because someone sad is that saying and I don't know who was you know it you're not to table you're on the menu and need to look at what is it state this year was women's health care thought with families ah\nWith health care in general you know women have a lot to add to that and there I Believe I just don't think we're going to step back anymore\nNo no no I don't I don't think you should and I think having the frankly it's not just that they're women but they're but they're in a certain age range to relatively speaking to me ... me a little bit older a little bit younger but for for the most part you're you're center kind of moms right the suburban mom is is is a strong voting I Want to say walk but a market\nThat I I think your party is obviously intentionally trying to attract\n... correct correct and um do suburban moms some of them who voted for Donald Trump I think kept seeing the ramifications of that vote and we're reaching out and talking to them and particularly when you take something like the Kavanaugh's\nNomination where you know set aside the fact of whether you didn't did or didn't relate doctor for just as a man who ... temperament we've solved by his temperament that is not fit to be a judge and then add on to it the fact of you know her very compelling testing tests the money and um\nAnd and they you know Republicans decided not to believe up to a belief or they're going to be some ramifications from that\nOkay um let's talk about mostly Coburn moving from into the treat the triple C a red to blue program\nUm you're you're making news during the John Frederick radio show this morning was the other folks make news about nothing on Iowa and Steve bullock is a potential outsider and Alec Baldwin in New Hampshire we have some some [laughter] so you're you're ... three for three but my colors here\nSo this is news mostly Coburn is moving into this special category of funding from the D triple C talk about that\nWell we just we just got the information ourselves and that just shows you know that's an open seat we've always thought it was very competitive\nAnd uh we we are pleased to see that on the inside the beltway group recognize that as well she's Seventy two thousand dollar car you know the ... district has really really dig it goes from up in a faulty accounting all the way down to the north Carolina line it's got a lot of different you know role that you know it's got\nCharlottesville area in it to you it's got you know then you've got sort of a D.C suburbs with foster care so you got a little bit of everything that she is really a campaign in every part of that district and um\nAnd I think that you know here you're sharing it towards the end they finally you know solve the value in investing more in her\nWell it also says hey they have the resources to do it\nWell that's a good point too I think that is and if you've seen the articles that you know that our candidates are actually out raising our candidates not even the committee\nThe psyche you look at Dave Brat versus Abigail Spanberger I think she got raised him three to one maybe this last um [noise] I guess this gets recent foul language poor on and on and and you know that's just what we're seeing all across the board [noise]\nYeah I think you can either of them are slog I'm anxious to which is like really gratifying to see that as small diners are the ones that really invest in you know show up and knock on doors and time again and put the shoe leather [noise]\nWell I think that's showing up obviously in the polling generic ballot is a little behind where are you all were last year at the end of the day\nOr if you just follow up if you just follow those those numbers and the data you're

government 'cause as we heard in the\nIn the news updates Mike we heard that that China's economy is slowing down its growth and that's a problem to have a significant debt burden and their economy is slowing its growth down there\nI'm Wondering the Iraq War out to the collapse of the economy and two thousand and eight\nAnd a and that has led to this massive worldwide suspicion of government or what's going on today this unsettled place that we are in this world is not just manifesting itself in the United states we are not alone in this in this in this cultural shift as a manifesting itself in politics\nIt's showing up in Hungary in Poland and in Germany over the weekend in Bavaria which is actually I ran into a [laughter]\nGerman political future of the weekend fancy that right you're going to exchange program I didn't want to go to the vet and I was like I'm like I really don't want to go somewhere much football I Want to chill out Sunday night it was a great game on I'll go you'll have fun okay fine subsidies to German teachers\nTrying to have a conversation and thinking I don't know any German right what are you gonna do a you know your voice [laughter] how's the weather you know [laughter] you know where do you go with that conversation well it turns out they speak beautiful English and he probably better than than we do structurally and um\nYeah because they're very has their lectures on Sunday it was a very important election in Germany that's the kind of guy and that's what I follow and well this one teacher was a teacher of politics so then we went down a rabbit hole two hours later at the dinner table we just we just were chewing up politics\nAnd what he's telling me about the very was is that is extremely\nSuccessful economically it is the richest region of Germany for full employment like three percent unemployment youth unemployment is extremely low\nOf their school system is set up to get people to work straight away um if if you're like a tenth grade and you're not you don't really want to go to university you don't have to fake it to make it you can go right into a a a trade school and apprentice program and you're gonna get a job and you get a diploma so they get um really it's a very work intensive area they\nThey pride themselves culturally\nOn work and productivity an organization and good government right there it was like a it's not like a shining example of how you would want to have a state where a region actually be everyone's employee there was a job\nYou have any functions ah and it works well they had this major upset in the very end election Neal what are you upset about what what could you possibly be that concerned about\nThat you basically blow up this I don't know if they blow it up\nBut how does major upset and the ruling party that had been has been in control for decades last probably the ... the ruling majority in Bavaria and it was stunning to me to realize that we're not immune from that here in here in America so people say\nYou know the economy Republicans are on the economy is going so great vote\nFor us people don't vote on yesterday's news they don't vote on today's news they vote on the future where are we going where what is going to be happening that's my fear that's my concern because why things are going well\nYou know what Donald Trump got elected gasoline was about two twenty five a gallon now it's around two eighty a two thousand eight was four dollars a gallon or better but are we getting better are we getting worse\nYou know we see here that China news today about their economy is slowing down its growth rate of growth\nAnd that has a factor on the human psyche about how how's it going to manifest itself in my life you see these commercials they're not all about you know skills and here's my dad says there about\nThis guy off all she's horrible there ... there but there's no big overriding issue like here's what we're going to do in the future it's just that the other person's really bad therefore they're not going to be good for you um and therefore because you kind of is going to say well they're gonna hurt the economy I guess this is what they strap relation is in the subconscious\nBut I'm going what is the big driving issue other than obviously Donald Trump and it's a fascinating time in American politics or it's one of reasons why do what I Do because it's so interesting but also to teach people\nAs I used to tell my my students I really don't care I'm really don't care [laughter]\nWhat you think I care that you think if I can encourage people to be more interested about what they're talking about to read another article to dig deeper to challenge themselves\nThey will in turn create a better\nThis year that you vote but if you don't vote I understand that's also a vote in itself because you were saying I'm not I'm not doing this I vote none of the above and it's and that's and that's tabulate in it'll aggregating cell just like a vote will and that people do that doesn't make any sense\nActually does if you don't show up for something the two political parties going to try to get you to show up next time we're trying to reach out to you in some way shape or form that data point will register I told her to a of a family I was at a baseball game with\nAnd they were so upset or you just can't stand voting and dump out if they haven't earned your vote don't vote and tell them you don't put it on social media like you would anyone else anything else so I'm not voting you haven't earned\nMy vote you haven't got me off my couch off my duff\nTo go down and say I'm voting for this person you don't register it'll aggregate data and that raw data that collects and is dissected by the political class to determine what they want to do 'em and they and that in every election the swings on the undecided voter right the independent voter in October it's like oh we're going to\nStop talking about these issues that motivate our base to a degree we're going to focus on these\nOh I'm really happy to work with the other side received this now and in certain kinds I work with the president's wife shows up the polling independence they may not like President Trump but when they agree with you better work with him to get connected because you know all politics is personal not just walk anyway this perception of filling in for John friends if you tuned in to hear me drawing on\nAbout politicians who is this guy a I'm a former member of the house of delegates I'm filling in for John products as I Am wants to do a as John is on vacation with his son down in Florida in a baseball tournament a John as a baseball fan probably like in his words but he was a pitcher in college and his son Joe Joes a picture\nOf you want to call and ask me some questions love to hear from you eight eight eight four to five six four six eight eight eight four to five six four six eight eight forty eight oh five six or six or you can tax free straight away five four zero to nine four zero six eight zero five four zero\nTo nine four zero six zero I'm gonna have some great experts on later today quaint and kick Christopher Newport Jack Nicholson for the Republican Party with congressman Rob Wittman\nA doctor Robin McDougal from the Virginia Commonwealth University of Wilder school and Jesse Harris from Iowa who's a political operative and uh as as on the Democratic side in from the Republican side from New Hampshire will hear from identity\nAnd Susan slacker or my good friend from the Central Valley uh we're I'm Susan for you know gosh early nineties I think when I started aging yourself there's there isn't\nA Democrat a chair a chair of the Democratic party Virginia from highland county ... county I used to represent and they've known citizen for for decades and so we have we have a great friendship and I and I'm looking forward to having all these callers calling today stir up the conversation a little big go a little deeper we're going deeper today\nIn politics we're going to go deeper dive in not just you know the public polling the top one numbers but how those posters got to those numbers who are they listening to who are they calling why are they calling because it's a very different way\nTo talk about this they start with a very broad universe um and it keeps coming down to a smaller University of actual likely voters\nMinutes\nAnd we'll get to that we're getting to the nitty gritty you will be able to get you take you do a deeper dive so when you look at the polls when you go back to real clear politics which which I spend unfortunately way too much time on 'em but I guess is healthier than other websites right [laughter]\nThis is the healthy Internet\nAh it's it's a a ... you look at these different polls and you go like that just to just take a look at the uh\nThe polls on a generic ballot it's insane what a what the what we're looking at here pulled up its it's fascinating like generic ballot follow this truck plus Democrats plus ... Democrats plus five Democrats whatsoever\nDemocrats ... Democrats plus one what how do you get there\nDid you say the polling is wrong well pounds always right it's just data you're collecting other people call what the differences isn't the methodologies who you're going I talked to one leading I'm\nDemocratic source and I said okay what's your polling showing me he said Democrats are around mid low thirties thirty four thirty three percent thirty two that range Republicans we've never seen self identification for Republicans is while it's around twenty\nFour percent and what used to be you know thirty four thirty four is now\nThirty four twenty four and independents are up around the loaded mid forties\nHe goes Republicans have never been lower on self identification but we haven't picked up any of those voters they're all self identifying now as independents that\nIs huge and when you get down to it with people when they understand what's really going on that's when they get more excited more engaged this is Chris X. men\nHappy birthday I have a beer you know put a picture of ... has her brother with this with the Budweiser I'm just reminded me so much of my friendship and I'm a black how blessed that wants to have it in my life but also\nA what a what a blessing and it's just to be alive right to be able to\nUh just a deep experience at all and I'm Wondering is I enjoy coming in during his radio show where they get to hopefully get people excited about politics um it gets it does governor lives it is important\nUh we can't break down we have to work with each other to get good things that we should have the debate though we should have a vibrant vigorous debate that right and lose the country forward\nUm and we shouldn't be afraid to have that debate but we should have in a in a civil manner and I think today we see a a a lack of civility more and more and that's difficult\nIn my professional life I Am the executive director Virginia freed the foundation for research in economic education and uh uh were five and wants to be three see sex and we're not partisan which is a great lane to be in these days because everyone has a\nYou know red or blue and I'm like okay good for you well you know aren't you might not really I don't have to\nThey get healthcare so yeah [laughter] what we did was we represent businesses and uh we have membership and we tried to do is educate them on politics and as a former teacher and a former business person my family had a bottle water business for years old a couple of years ago\nA blessed Hadley um you know I I like getting people excited about learning about politics seeing it differently\nAnd what that makes me there was on an even deeper like you know when you when you go to teach a subject you better than other subjects you have to really get engaged in the subject so it's an every day I get to learn more and more about politics it's it's a it's a deep interesting topic because it brings in culture\nAnd a economics and history that was a history major so I I get to bring out altogether because it manifest itself as Andrew Breitbart said the last ... last segment culture is down politics downstream of cultures so if you want to impact culture or their politics impact culture first and foremost suffer your cultural legal\nLeader you'll be you'll be a political year give us a call\nA day and age four to five six for six we got some great guest calling in today are not just congressman Rob Wittman but also the leaders of the two major parties here in Virginia posters Clinton kid and Robin McDougal\nAnd then two operatives one from Iowa and one from New Hampshire we're only I hate to say this because you're probably second tier the elections already in the midterms we are four hundred and Seventy two days away from the Iowa caucuses [noise]\nFour hundred and Seventy two now it seems like a long time but let's be honest as soon as this election is over you're going to start hearing reports back from Iowa and New Hampshire and we're going to be at the forefront of that we're going to get calls and they were going to shoot up with a with a sub operatives their Republican and Democrats\nTo see what's going on the ground I think Trump's got the lock on the nomination you never know you never know you never know goodness knows you never know what Donald Trump because um that that that that's that's who knows was actually does what he says it says you can do but you never know what's going to happen around him\nAnd I think that's one of the more interesting parts about politics today is because\nHe's brought that dynamic of ... or what max and that sort of it was if you remember from your uh ... days in school or or at work you know when the leader changes and it's like a substitute teacher what's this going to be like your\nYou know you get you get a new boss or whether it's a it's there's just the newness and from\nSince June fifteenth of twenty Fifteen this has been a very different political dynamic are not necessarily unhealthy because it has made us think and react differently and respond differently and I don't think that's necessarily on healthy\nAh but we do have to be ever vigilant to make sure it does not become too unhealthy and I think people are recognizing that we have uh some some discourse in this country\nThat can be improved we can get better at that as a people and how we do that is every day one on one with each other if you want to impact politics if you want better representation be better people sort of comes down to um they represent us and if you want them to be better it's up to us to be better\nSo it was called an eight four five six for six we'll talk about polls goodness knows there's more calls and I don't know what to do with these days\nThe generic ballot what I pay attention to first and foremost is what I checked\nI'm average of all the different polls and they break down the individual polls\nI'm now ... should be looking at what are called Elvis likely voters polling companies should have an understanding of who they imagine are going to be showing up on election it should have a pretty good handle on may ... began in Virginia about a month ago so that we should know who's actually voting\nI'm In Virginia in or you can always tell the Arlington because they're the tabulation their uh their absentee ballots are some friends of mine who are tracking that to see what kind of a who's voting relative to the last round of elections to see what the intensity is\nBut when you look at the uh the averages of the generic ballot them this is why I Do this is why I Do that\nIn twenty Seventeen when governor Ralph Northam defeated that Gillespie he won by eight point nine three percent a point nine three points the generic ballot on that day was nine point one if I'm trying to instruct the class\nWhat do you want to follow Fox News Reuters rats mice and CNBC Emerson Maris Quinnipiac\nWilder pool poll a crystal Newport which one do you follow follow the generic ballot right now because that is that is fairly proximate to what happened last year and the year before and twenty six team\nIf you look the generic ballot in twenty sixteen\nIt was very close it was like tied and Republicans over performed on election day by about a point and they won and the generic congressional ballot I'm obviously Trump lost by about three points a nationally three million votes um so that's something to consider when you're saying okay we're just going to go I think\nI think the the objective view here is look at the generic ballot look at the average and you can pretty much extrapolate where it is right now\nIf election they were held today and because it's on that basis it it takes away the the partisan lens you might have or a would be inclined to\nIf at nine point one percent the dams won by eight point nine nine point one point nine that's very close\nAnd they are at seven point six right now it is safe to assume that they will not perform as well as they did and twenty Seventeen but still will win and likely when the house\nOf representatives given the the dynamics in the Senate very different because of individual races likely that Republicans a hold on to the Senate what's the dynamic that if the Democrats have the house and the sense that Republicans have the Senate what's gonna happen the next two years and that's how you can sort of figure out\nWhere this thing is going so that you can understand what you need to do or not to like myself I don't watch cable news I don't watch broadcast news every papers in the morning or ... times Wall Street journal and I get my information what's going on in the economy and politics and culture and whatnot\nAnd then leave it alone don't listen to you know the the uh the national talk radio shows I go to work right now I I thought with my eyes I see what's going on and I think most voters\nHe says it's a very small subset of the American population but they're the they're the most active voters they are the their the activists so those shows are pretty much you're broadcasting to the activists about what they want to hear about the matching points that they're\n... they're they're supposed to repeat so when you watch when you go to Facebook\nOr Twitter or Snapchat or Instagram or whatever they're very different social media platforms you see the replica repetition of the message and you're like wow I'd I'd go to a town hall I forgot to like a congressional town all my friends up there is no Congress there were ...\nI watch them and take questions from the audience is like where did people getting information it's fundamentally wrong but they're really upset I mean angry not pleasant not understanding but what do they show up for\nThis show up because they're angry they are concerned but more importantly like anyone else in the world they just wanted to hurt right how important is that in a conversation to hear what the other person is is really feeling it get down to okay\nWhat is that what what is what is making you got to say oh 'cause there's no no no\nThat's that's the operative subject matter [noise] what is triggering this fear and when you get down into the to the nuts and bolts you you really can't understand\nWhy people do what they do and hopefully get them to a better place than station life and it's not easy to do but it's a it's it's what we do it in a democracy in the public and form a democracy which we have\nAn in America thank God I'm so we can just live more peacefully amongst each other governors self self governance I think it's really important historical and concept and I think we've lost sight of that a little bit\nIt's easy to uh but more importantly it's up for for folks to point out to be like what we can do better we can do better calm down we got this I mean are are you have too many TV channels at night do you have too many options are there too many restaurants and grocery stores around you\nIs it too good are you afraid you're gonna lose all this I mean it's it's crazy how good life isn't suburban America um rural America has a lot of challenges growing

calling it eight four five six for six right now we've got on the line\nA doctor quaint and kids from Chris er Newport university Washington Center for public policy call and ask a question idiot eight for eight oh five six for six were going to be calling talking about his polling from Chris er Newport university um I think one of the most accurate\nOr posting pulling operations in the in the commonwealth and you can do a great job as Clinton they're All right hey Clinton how are you man\nRight and that's and that's what that's what campaigns do they follow but that means they follow you you look at the\nThe cross tabs in the in the polls and they go okay I've got a problem with um women between the ages of twenty five I'm forty five you don't go there on prime what's to say you know and then they structure their messages according to the beach or if they have high positives for for their opposition to try to attack the attack as to bring down\nThe positives and bring up their negative to have an outcome in the election are you having more difficult time getting people because of cell phones this is a question from a from a from a texture\nAny more difficult time than we had been having 'em in the years leading up to um today\nSo Virginia is about two thirds cell phone mostly or cell phone only users\nAnd so our sample we we actually draw samples of cell phone numbers and so we do quotas on our cellphone versus landline sample so we basically go into the field with about a two third one third cellphone landline split already\nUm and we haven't found our response rate on cell phones to be any different than it has been which is not great um you know people typically are taking cell phone calls to do surveys like they were\nLandline calls in the seventies to do surveys show we're not finding it any more difficult than we were already um I Do have colleagues around the country who are finding cell phone number is being blocked more um and and it's driven by this um all of this fishing that's been going on with our cell phone numbers lately\nThat's come up my phone number is recall from Idaho where I'm driving\nAnd we we do there are two things that we do to try to help us with that we have to end up by ourselves as Christopher Newport university so we're not we're not an anonymous number or we're not\nUm unlisted number you'll see who we are when we call and then um if you say look put me on your do not call list will put you on our callers and we will call you back or we don't have to do that because you know according to the federal regulations were doing research academic research we're not working we're not getting paid to\nYou know do this we're not making a profit so we're considered um researchers so we don't have to comply with that you're not call list\nBut we do keep our own do not call list and if somebody says don't call me I don't want to do surveys then we'll put them on our do not call it so we try to be transparent in that way as well\nWell that's fascinating 'cause most people go oh yeah I'm On those on those do not call assuming they are because because you are academic nature you interesting so your turnout model is showing forty to forty five percent that's interesting because people I talked to the campaigns are they're hoping is going to be around forty eight\nThat's so that's ah so it depends on who you talk to 'em it could be forty eight um it could be higher I mean they're so here's the real sort of question that I have in my head right so\nIf there is a big blue wave if there are a lot of voters that are engaged right now who didn't even vote in twenty Seventeen\nThen we're missing them in our survey were not capturing that right and that some of the pushback I got back\nUm when we want to put out our second district poll showing Taylor leading Luria some Democrats push back and said well you're not even capturing some of the voters that were newly registering in and they're going to vote okay fair enough\nBut we have the luxury in Virginia in in that we had a twenty Seventeen election that we think captured that surge pretty well it it ... it brought Ralph Northam into the governor's mansion\nRalph Northam on a second district by four percent first time a Democrat or one that district in about a decade so we think we\nAnd also Republicans may have responded 'em by by engaging their base voters already know if they've done that we think we've captured them because they were already voters anyway um but if turnout is higher I think it's going to help\n'em I don't know that helps one party over the other all the way it might be helpful to Democrats because it might be that extra surge that we might that might be a lot of new voters were not capturing\nSo you ... you you saw the search I called the suburban tsunami you're twenty seven to ... you saw that you saw coming in\nI think you had an aunt yeah we we were we\nWere modeling 'em in twenty Seventeen\nLike we are likely modeled this year or what we were doing and twenty Seventeen as we were we were modeling ... the same way but we were also looking for new the registered voters\n'em in twenty Seventeen because of that was that was that serves that was the difference between twenty six you know twenty Seventeen with a lot of the new suburban voters\nUm and so we did see the search and twenty Seventeen we all know what it looked like in Virginia and so there's nothing that says to me that that's going to be any less this year than it was in twenty Seventeen and there are things that say to me it might be a little bit bigger than it is that it wasn't twenty Seventeen and by the way in twenty Seventeen the Republicans\nWere as engaged as as you would want them to be it's just that Democrats were a little bit more engaged\nSo you think it might be even bigger this year\nIt very well could be I don't think it can be much bigger but it very well could be um Democrats in particular are trying to register new voters or they they were until the deadline and Republicans I'm work trying to register new voters as much as they were trying to mobilize their their base voters that are already there so\nI mean look if both parties it's not likely to be because we don't have a really robust statewide race going on 'em and we have ... competitive congressional races some places and not at other places ...\nSo that's part of the reason I'm thinking forty five um but if it ends up being forty eight it's because there were met and there's massive turnout\nGoing on and some of these really competitive congressional races um I don't know if you're a if you're if you're looking for a competitive state wide race to drive a turnout we just don't have that this year and so that's part of the reason I'm hesitant\nTo say it's going to go as high as forty eight\nBut look I've been wrong many times um in all the wrong many times in the future\n[laughter] goodness no that's that's a blessing um talk about the state not clubs\nClose um it I you know I think what I find interesting about the statewide races that um it's not close yet you see Tim Kaine campaigning\nIn his ... his campaign campaigning as if it were close he's running ads on on every in every television network in in the commonwealth he's campaigning like he's got a a more for a bit of a formidable candidate that he has\nAnd I think there are two things going on I think Tim Kaine needs to send the statement\nThe guilty of being the vice presidential candidate on the ticket in twenty sixteen but I think he's also recognizing that in some of these are really close congressional races um if he can pull any coattails um if he can let out any coattails\nIt can be really helpful to democratic candidates downtown and so I think oddly enough Tim Kaine is running a campaign to get re elected to the U.S Senate and running several\nCongressional campaigns to elect Democrats um in in in some of these competitive races at the same time um and he doesn't really have a challenger that has a lot of money but Corey Stewart is all over local talk radio which is where his voters are going to be and so I say Corey Stewart's running\nThe kind of campaign that he needs to run to give voters out given\nUm how difficult situation he has and how little money is\nSo your state wide pulling that\nWe used we hold the Senate race several times and then decided it wasn't going to be competitive enough to pull 'em throughout the final stretch from Labor Day on instead decided to pull these congressional races because\nReally for the first time in probably decades in Virginia if if if a hundred and some odd years we've got a lot of a lot of really competitive congressional races going on so we decided to pull the congressional races instead of continuing to pull what doesn't appear to be a very competitive Senate race\nBut we are we're wrapping up here in the segment what what'd you get a final call here on what the series is going to look like in the day\nWell probably somewhere Fifteen Fifteen ashes my is where my ... I'm at right now it could be a little bit higher could be a little bit lower if it's a little bit lower it's going to some of these congressional races are going to look really good for Republicans are going to be really tight if it's if it's higher if it's closer to twenty\nThan some of these democratic congressional candidates are going to have a better night I think fifty\nSixty Seventy yeah OK anything moving a libertarian from making an impact and all you\nKnow in a in in in we we anticipated they might given that that you know a lot of country club Republicans might not be interested in Corey Stewart but at the end of the day\nWe're gonna we're in a very tribal period of our politics and if there's an hour by your name a lot of Republicans were going to just vote for that are\nAnd not actually give 'em the libertarian their their votes or we don't see any uptick I'm I'm among libertarian candidates either state wide or in the congressional races um there's a libertarian and attempt there's libertarian seven we're not seeing any uptick with either one of them\nOkay thanks Quentin Kidd recalling him was like an opportunity loss of Libertarian Party they had a chance to to crack the crack the market here a little bit in Virginia they might have fallen short this is Chris accident filling in for the vacation and John ... come on back\n[laughter] you're the elected got it right now so uh you know if you heard the last leg with Clinton kids from Christopher Newport or are you seeing anything different than what Dr kids seen out there\nWhere I heard the ah the the back end of his\nUm interview and I yeah I I sort of got the sense from the discussion that perhaps he's seen more of a blue wave and I'm seeing I'm you know I'm In in regular contact with all our congressional campaigns um throughout the commonwealth and frankly most of them are doing really well\nUm and I I Will be a surprise if it doesn't really come down to perhaps just two congressional districts being really in play when we get to election night\nTo just to which too\nI I see you know the seventh and the tens clearly or other to battlegrounds right now I think the other ones that perhaps people are looking at the fair but I think Denver Riggleman is clearly running a far superior campaign there and so I think Denver a\nWill uh will be fine come election night there has been some talk Scott Taylor's race Scott really working hard um I mean perhaps we'll be closer than we otherwise would've hope but I think at the end of the day Scott should be fine as well so\nThat's where it comes back down to Barbara Comstock in the tens 'em and Dave Brat in the seventh is the way I see it at this point\nTo a doctor kid he didn't mention that Brad spanberger racing I live in a district I see it every day at least in western ... county and there's a stark difference in what's going on the ground at least but I I pulled back trying to do the objective follow the data if you follow the data that Clinton kids written falling what you're saying\nUm the Taylor and ... are the ones that are most important as far as you know changing I'm changing party right if they're accurate or you've got to build up my seven and Tom struck down by half a day or night tens of like that\nSo if that's consistent than his polling is accurate um it would probably show up if you if you can do one on bread spanberger I Would imagine that he would but what he also pointed out obviously the quality of the candidates important local issues are important\nBut also what do you pointed out was he didn't see the big Kavanaugh kicker or that everyone in the talking about this is going to have this big search for Republicans or if it is it's pretty quiet people make up their mind just going to vote\nAnd as he said Republicans are show up and mentors\nAnd and I sort of see the ladder I mean obviously what I'm looking at a day and it goes away um but during a prior to the to the judge now justice Kavanaugh hearings um there was some um perhaps apathy on the part of the Republican base\nUm but that changed almost immediately or with those hearings and I think the Republican base in Virginia and I think the Republican base around the country saw what a Democrat majority in the United States Senate and the Democrat majority in the house of representatives under Speaker Pelosi would look like\nConstant um investigations calls for impeachment set a precedent investigations of justice Kavanaugh and so what I saw\nThe gas in response to email fund raising jump significantly as a result of that\nAnd I'm as it's been said before somebody is going to write a check or send some money to the party or a candidate they're more likely to vote for that person as well so\nIt may not be showing up in the polls quite yet but I Believe that there is a renewed enthusiasm there clearly was an enthusiasm gap between the Republicans and Democrats prior to the Kavanaugh hearings but I think that gap spin eliminated so now it's just a matter of turning our folks out\nSo you're seeing the enthusiasm kick up I talked to Morgan Griffith about a week and a half ago and he said the same thing you said\nYou know it was a if you were doing a scale of one to ten ten million you know absolutely undermine showing up no matter what\nA he said you know Democrats were were around\nNinety and my folks around thirty said but my folks are now up around eighty a so he he he sensed that he\nFelt the underground been climbed told me the same thing uh so from the anecdotal standpoint I Do think there's a renewed a fervor in the in the Republican base that quite frankly is getting a lot of what they wanted the last election that's part of the hardest thing in politics you know\nYou know when you get what you want your show up are you satisfied or you know you're fat and happy and you stay home because things are going pretty well but what's the point\nAh but I think the the cabin or things sort of ... Energizer refocused at least the Republican base on uh wanting to come out and vote but you're seeing that throughout the state\nI Am and I and I think you know getting what I think that folks realized you're right I mean they got what they wanted and twenty sixteen we have the president and acting tax cuts the economy's booming lowest unemployment and in decades instead of was probably some complacency in that but then I think now the Republican base seems\nAll that can get on done very quickly with the Democrats control the house and Senate and so I think Republicans are saying we've got to roll up our sleeves and if we want to keep what we've got we've got to go to the polls and vote for it\nUsually the cycle of politics right so what as the new chairman of the Republican Party of Virginia ah what is the next step for RPG where are you all go and what should Republicans in Virginia Beach got because when you look at Virginia and Maryland you have to if she was very strange electorate you have\nA democratic Marilyn's with a Republican governor who looks like he's gonna win three Fifteen and twenty points in Virginia which has been a battleground trending now towards a blue state Tim Kaine square jet thinks he's going to win by Fifteen offers probably maybe twenty points as well\nYou didn't really do have this dichotomy don't you all across the Potomac we're we're the the dynamics of politics are changing Massachusetts has a Republican governor\nUm who's up polling are the leading Democrats in the state you know Charlie Baker you have a governor a Republican governor of Illinois\nUm is is is the ... other Republicans in Virginia sit right for the electric well\nI I think what you're saying I obviously I don't know that in our current climate in Virginia whether any of the three candidates you mentioned governor Hogan and others who would which secure the Republican nomination in Virginia right now but\nI think what will recognize it and I and I've sort of sense to perhaps a more pragmatic approach among Republicans I'm again coming out of the\nAnd you know Susan Collins and Lindsey Graham being I'm sort of a stalwarts of the Republican Party people to laugh but now I'm getting requests to how can we bring Lindsey Graham in to speak in Virginia for candidates and and have him as a featured speaker and places it's so\nI think the Kavanaugh hearings may have shown that what we need to do is have a broader based in the Republican Party that can bring conservatives to gather around core principles and perhaps or if we can agree on eighty percent of the issues we can disagree on the other twenty later on after we start winning again\n[laughter] again the cycle because look both parties are having their their uh ... battles right I mean the Democrats have their own battles are Republicans are having their battles were going to have some posters\nAnd that pollsters are some operatives from Iowa New Hampshire calling in the nine o'clock hour should listen to that we have one calling in from a Democrat from Iowa Republican mantra is going to tell us what's going on there are said to the national consciousness because that's really what they are really the\nOnly thing I see I don't have time to worry about that I Do kind of holding out for delegates to take a stand up for reelection but they're not worried about twenty twenty after we win and preserve I bet you're already in the house and Senate next year in Virginia and\nGently push back here because the dominant theme in American politics is what's going on in Washington DC is being reflected back in in the states and in the local to the districts because Trump is the issue right now since\nSince June fifteenth of twenty Fifteen that man has driven the conversation every day in American politics and if you know four hundred and Seventy two days away from from the Iowa caucuses people are going to be focusing on those issues\nBut it's going to get very retail very quickly why all the Virginia races are going on and that's the beauty and the dynamic of Virginia politics isn't it I mean you because we are we are the polls\nWe take the temperature all the time\n... that's exactly right and I think um for our congressional candidates this year I think last year gave them sort of a wake up call and they could see OK perhaps where after roll up our sleeves and work much harder than we thought we were going to have to and so\nUm you're right that this year will sort of perhaps give us a preview of what we can expect in twenty Nineteen but that will be as sort of a pulse of the of the country as you say\nBecause we have the entire general assembly up in this time next year ... all one hundred and forty members the or the district to the general assembly\nAre going to be up for election and there's so many issues at play and what Clinton kid was talking about what he's seeing in his polling is that quality candidates matter and local issues matter I got an email last night from a former colleague of mine talking about Corey in northern Virginia\nAnd uh basically local development and he was engaged you also sends out emails on traffic patterns potholes and I'm like\nThis is not what you do in the general assembly but if that's what the voters want they want someone talking about right but I\nThink that's right people are really looking for results from their elected officials and the things that are impacting most people today with a booming economy and and job I'm strong and wages growing people are looking at some of those other issues that impact them on a daily basis trafficking holds up in northern Virginia as you say the\n\n[noise]\nThings this hour from tells all the top prize has its flaws of ask caravan

I get my energy from that they are\nVery very passionate individual that didn't work hard every day and and uh do do great work so it's hard not to be motivated by that but it it's hard not to be motivated to ah by the by the true honor that it is to represent them\nIt and I appreciate that and I'm having been in that position and like the office of going back to re energize but are you a worn down\nGet certain times it it it does it does give you pause as to you know where we are at the country and the divisions that are out there but but I always work every day to try to find places where we agree I think I think today it takes a little more effort to do\nNo it shouldn't and I think that one of the differences in Virginia which I think has a very healthy system of government operates well is that you have deadlines are constitutionally\nA enacted that hold the line on these things you can't go to continuing resolution that's an awful turn off all reality but they also have I I Love the single object rule in in legislation ... where do you deal with one subject and that's it so you don't have this big mash up coming back from the other from the Senate or vice versa\nThat just just blows up the whole deal\nThough I agree and and you know the or the good news is that in the in the U.S house we are not the same rules you awkward during the general assembly justices you

a benefit and if my rent let's get back to the absolute let's get back to the national district what what are your voters telling you\nWell you know we're hearing a lot from\nFolks they vote I think ... that they are very interested in\nHow do we create a a continual um increase\nIn our economy I think people are a very positive about where the economy is now I think they appreciate what's meant by Congress about the lessons regulatory burden in changing the tax code of somebody can run on euro for businesses individual but the\nThings that they want to see going forward or what I call a sustaining parts of an economy and first of those is having an education system that assures that our children students get necessary uh educational experience to be watching them\nTo feel the jobs are there are seven point one billion jobs so Chris and Seventy five percent of those jobs will not require as you're great and that means we have to emphasize career and technical education as much as we do common strike education because\nThat's where the jobs are in those jobs today are skilled jobs that have occurred as far as a career when you go from an apprentice journey to a pastor and have a career\nThere and do well in many instances better than you wrote him a job that requires a college degree so I think people look at that and say that's where we have to go\nLooking on going how are we going to make sure that my child is successful like how do we make sure the education system gives them the knowledge skills abilities\nTo compete for the jobs that are available today in the future and I think they don't look at it and say hey the other things and the economy are going really well of course when I talked to instances across the district\nI can tell you the top three things they talk to me about our workforce workforce and workforce or you know they say we could grow up\nBusiness today we can just find workers to do the job and it's you know they were or job

recent a sort of downgrade enhanced in his game\nSo we'll see um you know and as you know I got from Philadelphia connection so I've always got a soft spot in my heart for the Sixers I I'm I'm not sure if they're quite ready to make the leap but we'll see other than anybody but them lawyer says\nI I I liked the Sixers we used to have a song in a in in college\nOn the shoulders so sort of ingrained in the Seventy Sixers culture back in the day for us to proceed Conan joins argue starts like here you took thanks okay is a doctor McDougal patiently waiting for us Yes sir I and then she

stock in cardboard boxes whatever the company that publicly traded\nThe mix cardboard boxes that Amazon buys buy that stuff because we have so much cardboard box in our garage stacked up as the on the way\nThat we're we're right there with you yet are I'm sure\nSo a doctor Robin McDougal is with the Virginia Commonwealth University ... Wilder school tell us briefly about the Wilder school what youre doing\nYes so we're we're at school of government and public affairs that we see here um rains in the top fifty I in US News and World Report for schools the public affairs for undergraduate and graduate program focused on criminal justice homeland security and emergency preparedness\nPublic administration as well\nAs programs in the master's level in urban and regional planning and a PHD program and public policy and then we also have our Center for public policy which I direct which areas are consulting and community engagement arm of the work we do in our\nSchool say you will see a lot of things around economic development a leadership in training local and state governments outreach and things like public policy polling that we hear within the center for public policy in the wild her school\nOkay we're going we're coming up pulling real quick but you guys actually go out and work with uh other local governments and businesses that you helped them not just I think people don't understand that about higher education the value that you bring to the community and the state yes\nWe really do I mean we're done\nEverything from looking helping that localities looking at potentially providing incentives for certain business to come into their community and doing a return on investment of what that economic impact would look like on the proposal stage with regards to incentive then come back and provided them that actual economic impact\nIf they went forward with the business and the impact that it had on the community with everything from revenue to job creation other aspect and that way out we've done about rations of um you know criminal justice programs so the implementation of a mental health program or a drug treatment program on reducing recidivism for\nLocal jail or a\nA community partner we worked with a non profit from everything from their valuations of the programs in projects that they do she also coordinating an combining the\nActual help that they need with regards to our students and our staff or which in their community program and then we've done some work\nThird party evaluations of programs in projects for the private sector looking into a pitch to the general assembly and need an actual third party non biased evaluation of that work being able to provide that report\nFor that company for the general assembly to look at legislative impact so we do we are a continual partner\nEvery single day with our local and state governments around the commonwealth um and it it really is what we live and breathe in the wild or school specifically um we do it at a much more\n[noise] cost effective rate than our private sector counterparts if you will\nBecause it really is our mission and our vision and it allows us to bring the bears are\nAcademic experts he says well within the Wilder school you know we have ever thirty academics tackled me this is their area of expertise and you want to talk about the economic impact I've got four economist in our urban and regional planning program or you want to talk about the impact of an opiate program a treatment program I got to criminal justice or academic\nSee that's their area of expertise and they get asked all around the country to look you know present their research and were able to bring my expertise to bear for our localities are in the commonwealth in Virginia\nSo that when you're a you're a whole service higher education schools I mean\nWe are we are uh you know we we provided all give us your students that we will educate their freshman in college through graduate school in PHD program\nGive us your workers that we will train them in executive leadership and management preparation I give us your legislators and you're allowed to us and we will train them and policy analysis and the impact\nOf a variety of hanging on legislation and um give us your community that will help you come up with good solutions and then give you the evaluation of the impact on nicely should I say we really are I'm not one stop all encompassing education and consulting\nAcademic arm for local and state government and our our citizens in the ... around the block\nAnd that's why I brought it up and we'll go to the polling that you're that you're operation is down there because I think it's so important for people to understand the totality of a lot of things in government especially hurricanes which has a bull's eye on his back around the country but in Virginia we've got a great higher education system we really need to be proud of it\nUh even though it's you know it's it's appropriate to hold them accountable tough questions but a lot of things you're talking about art free they are exclusive of of usual operations and they are a complementary to what you are doing and actually facilitate what you were doing in higher education I think it's wonderful I think it's misunderstood not understood at all\nBut most jumping to some polling a while the school has done what are you seeing out there what have you seen what direction are we going\nWhy don't we talk a little bit I think that Clinton on earlier so let's talk a little bit about policy in in polling in public policy that we did um this summer we were out in July of another poll rolling out right here after the election in November but in our\nIn our public policy review talked about higher ed said let's talk about that for a second when we look at it we\nSample of all five region um\nOf our commonwealth and when we look at it and ask people what they think about the value of higher education in Virginia over eighty percent of our responded believed that the community colleges that we have\nIt for our work their cost over sixty five percent believes that are public four year institutions are worth the cost and then right under fifty percent believe that our private\nSchools in the commonwealth of work the car so it's really important that you said that question around down in Virginia we value higher education and not only that we value it but we're putting out a product that comes around the commonwealth bank is age appropriate return on investment\nSay you want to read [noise]\nThere's this hour from town hall though so far speaking at a

go through a pot I'm I'm not here and I'm no I'm just ready to go Mike what's going on in New Hampshire these guys\nWell I'll tell you what we had a we had a couple of presidential candidates running for twenty funny already here in the last week so ah things are wrapping up\nSo this is only the Democratic side no Republicans have gone up there right\nNo well you know this is talk of course about John ... aunt or Jeff blank running against Donald Trump for the Republican nomination\nI actually wrote I'm an op ed for uh the statewide paper here in New Hampshire just last week I it's pretty silly to take on Donald Trump\nI'm a ... you know kids are ... any time a Republican primary where a sitting president has been challenged it's been on the right job and these guys are be running on the last day really wouldn't have a prayer feeding\nThe president and the Republican primary\nRight now right now that's that's right now anything can happen goodness knows what happened and I\nThink can happen anything of course and especially you know God Forbid the economy collapses\nRight right that's what I Do I Know when something like that but if what if what if Mueller drops a big one thing that concerns All right let's let's shifted a democratic\nNominees yeah the credit primary ... I think we're four hundred and Seventy nine days away something like that from the Democratic primary hamster [laughter] killing\nRight now that's why I think it's I think it's smart pressed for you to to be talking about just stop and because the the president shall I just stopped as you well know there's there's all kinds of things happening behind the scenes right now\nThis is where it happens right the pros person that I wrote frozen oh man [laughter]\nAnd count the day after November's election candidates start doing things in a more public way but like I said senator or Joe a branch from New York was up here yesterday campaigning with C a Democrat campaign a candidate for governor\nDoing that all across the country and um [noise] ah so she's starting to to put things together I'm Alec Baldwin I I Know it may seem silly I'm sure you've heard about it to the guy he's he's making wrong he made his second trip to New Hampshire just this past weekend real\nTwice in the last six months Alec Baldwin Alec Baldwin and he said he has not ruled out running for president\nSaying he Mike we're back in the news this morning this is my comment and my producer of the show looking at we're making news this morning Steve ball like this one\nIs Alex Alex ... has um a spoke at the largest fundraiser for the Democrat Party in New Hampshire to um uh just last week yeah\nWow see if he ran his old out Goldman is Jack Ryan you know it's kind of my God yeah [laughter] that was back in the Cold War you know hundred October [laughter]\nThat's right [laughter] so who else do you see in up in in New Hampshire in who would you guess to be the front runners in the New Hampshire primary today likely to win a twenty twenty primary in February of next year European states\nBernie Sanders Robbins for president he will be the front runner okay just no doubt about it now I'm In New Hampshire no doubt about Fifteen thousand or Dan Elizabeth Warren will likely be the front runner\nOkay so how about what recently happened with Senator Warren in New Hampshire how does that play with her I mean fumbling of the DNA ancestry ball this week the disasters\nYou know in in democratic circles I actually don't think it does much a liberal Democrats are going to be looking for a liberal Democrat regardless of facts\n[laughter] you know they they think they based their their choices in in possession primarily on emotion in in a\nJesse Harris from ... Iowa just going to do if you heard that\nVery a veteran democratic operative in in Iowa was describing a I'm a so called scene but a reality in the in the Democratic voter in the primary voter but they also want to win and they might go you know I don't think Sanders can win nationally I think\nThat's the I mean not a I'm a Republican I think it was about the war he would have a similar problem I don't think she's electable in the in the\nGeneral election nationally nationally okay yeah I I like for\nYou know for that using that to be an issue as an example um I think so I thought one thing I Will say though it's a I I don't think it affected her here in New Hampshire I Do think it affected them again the behind the scenes operation a and and you know the [noise]\nThat's all the maneuvering going on behind the scenes among potential democratic candidates for her to actually take over a news cycle before the election the way she did was outrageously self serving him literally\nAll of the DNA test and it was counter to your narrative that you're trying to look after you put that thing I miss a day on Christmas [laughter] have you been married that's right you\nKnow I don't understand it so how do you think okay so you got Sanders worn just because it's New Hampshire but the other guys have got to go up there and compete or do they have to they might say just say\nYou know I think they do I think that you know because there's always going to be opportunities and that's as you probably know Chris I'm Bill Clinton made a name for himself by doing well and and coming back\nTo to win at a time when she was losing so you don't have to win the New Hampshire primary to make to make a lot of waves across the country so especially as Elizabeth Warren is the front runner she's from Massachusetts neighboring Massachusetts\nTook the candidate who comes in second and third ah I can get momentum as a result\nYeah because I think Clinton finished third right yeah that's right yeah so\nSo I bet you have to win place for show in New Hampshire to advance do you have to yeah that's right that is correct and I ended up with\nWhat I don't think people understand about the the democratic nomination process this cycle is that California has moved up yeah and they're going to happen that's expensive state and Kamala Harris McConnell Harris is going to have a big lead there\nYes and that's the I think that's going to be an interesting thing I didn't hear if you guys talked about this but on the Iowa\nA conversation but what she does in the early primary states will be interesting given the California moved up we'll see try we'll ... we'll see try and a ... and pick a state to do well in order to try and do well in all of them and um you know 'cause they're so different to the early primary states ... compared to California\nWell again I think you have to at least try to compete in some of these because\nThe reality is even though you might not win New Hampshire you won't matter and the the the nomination legitimately so\nYou still have to win in the in the electoral college that's why you can't you can't just blow past Iowa New Hampshire because those are those who have gone in either direction especially with Trump winning Iowa last time that's right no doubt about it what issues or drive in New Hampshire voters these days what's going on up there\nWell ... uh uh the economy is still the number one issue\nUm the governor here a is a Republican Christian new new and he's and uh uh with what Donald Trump's been doing it and governor Sununu the economy's booming we have the second lowest unemployment rate in the country\nThen I'm part the Democrats don't want to talk about that they're trying to talk about anything but the economy with a family you know he paid leave issue ... they're just trying to make up an issue that might connect with voters authors in the economy\nSo that's going to continue to the number one the second issue here Chris I I don't know how it how it worked in other states\nYou've heard Donald Trump even talk about this is the opioid epidemic coup a which is pretty ... pretty severe in New Hampshire so that's the second biggest issue\nThat's that's the yeah the ... the number\nSo it's a scourge of member people dying as a result of that is the doors and everything else is good sized country would sit around and it's going to get a handle on it but I don't think that part is that there's [noise]\nSo it's not a partisan issue Mike a final productions what do you think coming out with got thirty seconds punch it when he got further the Democratic nominee or the Democratic finishers in New Hampshire twenty two when\nI say it's going to go a little bit more in a world when a extreme on she's going to win the New Hampshire primary um I was going to be I think there's going to be some kind of dark horse like a um a Cory Booker I expect will be somewhere in the top\nThree um and then and then you know what I Would not be surprised if someone like Michael Bloomberg doing it is in ... as well because the Democratic state we need to read a bankroll a businessman\nFighting All right my identity joining us from the Granite State of New Hampshire four hundred and eighty days plus or minus out of the New Hampshire primary thanks for joining us we'll be back on the job in front of each other sister sacrament filling in ... I smoke\nHow how do you know we're not all that a lot of money to\nMean nor nor should you should the anyone involved in this conflict but how do you how do you compare the intensity this year to last year what do you see the same similar not as intense when he's well\nSimilar but I think we we're we're very proud particularly in Virginia last year when we send a message to the country into the world that you know hating bigotry have no place here and that we were open and welcoming for business with the election of governor Northam and his team and then you know that that first\nSet of a house candidates that got across the finish line that just beautiful tapestry of um of of of our our\nOur candidates that women and a diverse women and I just eat eat up so that was that was really great but I think what's happened is people realize we have we can do this we can do this and it's just\nHelped dump all day long and we've seen for example the surge in the absentee balloting I'm In Fairfax County ... county which our number one and two right now in the state or requests for absentee\nBallots you know that's that's where I that's that's really ... I think we're just added ... you know adding more excitement and enthusiasm\nRight like Clinton kid was on earlier in the seven o'clock hour and he said he he thinks the turnout is going to be forty to forty five percent that's a large large a range and there but where are you all projecting turn out right now\nWe're just going out there looking for every single vote\nTo leave a message [laughter] I Know where do you think the terminals gr\nThan your average mid term elections which normally\nAnd um so we're going to be better than your average mid term but I you know I'm not in the business of of that and we're just gonna we're we're just reaching out or we can you're describing ... yeah we're in a G. O. T. V. now face and we are just trying to get out our files and bring out before anybody else that wants to ... well I've\nBeen impressed with your with your crop of Kansas this year and last year they they definitely worked hard when when that struck me as a sort of an obvious one is that your the predominant of female candidates nominees\nBut I it just is definitely the year the woman I like to talk about our women candidates and then I got Shani Anthony Flaccavento nine [laughter]\nI mean Jennifer Wexton is is I mean the dish and they're all they have a different kind of experience and diversity but it is also good at all will be a good refreshing breath I'm\nA for Congress and across a profit for telling me some states that are in general for West End up there on the temp congressional district that we are really excited about what we see up there on\nThe volunteers are just showing up on non\nStop and the Washington Post endorsed her which is something that I'm a you know\nI ... got endorsed every other time when they were very disappointed at her she said she's going to stand up to Donald Trump and that proved not to be the case so ah her contract Jeffrey ... going to be um a congresswoman and then down in uh I'll just run through a real quick if you want to ask me something about him but we will go on the line at lower yeah\nAnd the second district a retired navy commander in a small business woman and of course Scott Taylor's got he's on his own problems with a ... you know trying to cheat and quite frankly and on\nAnd and and having a staff are put half fraudulent ah signatures on the ballot I mean that's you know that's hard on her to stop that's\nPretty seemingly and I I think the voters are going to reject that that but even that we you know without that we still have a fine you know could credible candidate\nWell what else I don't know what I'm seeing in your in your candidates yeah this is obviously a female when I think it sends regardless of the outcomes that we can\nTalk about polling in and out comes in November and you know when kids got a tailor up and he's got less than up and Coburn and and and then\nThe Williams was six when I think it's sending a signal though is moves that you're going to see even more women in the future running for office regardless of party and I think it's a very unhealthy dynamic\nYeah yeah and I want to I Want I Would say two things on that real quick we're really excited that Leslie cover and just got moved into a red to blue um program for the D triple seats but the thing I think you're exactly right about women women have always um um\nWomen have always and studies showed is that you know then the ones that would and I know your mom would agree with me on that would have\nBeen all over my heart that some things don't go [laughter]\nGo the way I got rights not kid I got to get my degree it got to pay off my lines you know a man can do it better and I think really one of the I guess\nWell not waiting anymore we're going to step up you know ... something to offer and I\nI don't I think that you we will just see more and more of that because someone sad is that what I'm saying and I don't know who was you know if you're not the table you're on the menu and you can look at what is at stake this year with women's health care law with families ah\nWith just health care in general you know women have a lot to add to that and there we just don't think we're going to step back anymore\nNo no no I don't I don't think you should and I think having the frankly it's not just that they're women but they're but they're in a certain age range to relatively speaking I'm In a couple of new to order a little bit younger but for for the most part\nYou're you're center cut on mom's right the suburban mom is is is a strong voting I Want to say walk but a marketing but I I think your party is obviously intentionally trying to attract\nCorrect correct and on those suburban mom some of them who voted for Donald Trump I think have seen the ramifications of that vote and we are reaching out and talking to them and particularly when you take something like the Kavanaugh's nomination where you know set aside the fact\nOf whether you didn't deter didn't delete doctor for just as a man who ... we saw back his temperament that is not fit to be a judge and then add on to it the fact of you know her very compelling touch the testimony and um\nAnd and they you know Republicans decided not to believe up to ... there's going to be some ramifications from that\nOkay um let's talk about mostly Coburn moving from into the three D. triple C a red to blue program\nUm you're you're making the news here in the John Fredericksburg radio show this morning we've had the other folks make news about ethanol in Iowa and Steve bullock is a potential outsider and now we're ... and the hamster wheels [laughter] your your pop three for three callers here\nSo this is news mostly cobra is moving into those special category of funding from the deep triple C talk about that\nWell we just we just got the information ourselves and that just shows you know that's an open seat we've always thought it was very competitive and uh we we're pleased to see that on the inside the beltway group recognize that as well she's Seventy two thousand dollar car you know the ... district has\nReally really dig it goes from up in a faulty accounting all the way down to the north Carolina line it's got a lot of different you know Raul but you know it's got Charlottesville area in it too it's got you know and then you've got sort of the D.C suburbs\nWith all care so you got a little bit of everything that she is really a campaign in every part of that district and ah and I think that you know here you're sheer it towards the end they finally you know solve the value in investing more in her\nWell it also says hey they have the resources to do it\nRight well that's a good point too I think that is and if you've seen the articles that in you know our candidates are actually out raising our candidates not even a committee\nCan you look at Dave Brat versus Abigail Spanberger I think she got raised him three to one maybe a this last um [noise] I guess this gets recent filing report on and on and and you know that's what we're seeing all across the board [noise]\nYeah I think it's a small guy ... which is like really gratifying to see that a small diners are the ones that really invest in you and show up and knock on doors since Sunday can and put the shoe leather\nGo I think that's showing up obviously in the polling generic ballot is a little behind where are you all were last year at the end of the day\nOr if you just followed me if you just follow those those numbers and the data you probably do quite well election day maybe not as large as the nominee that happened in Virginia last year but you know showing up on the ground um I I think the Democrats are going to have another a happy day here again kind of nice to stay\nIn this little plug visited seems on back from the thirties but a citizen swagger I really appreciate your calling and best of luck down the stretch final word what's the what's the message put it on a bumper sticker for the voters of the commonwealth of what is the Virginia Democratic
