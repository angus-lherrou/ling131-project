for president campaign where was this let's see what is it not with the Ninety ...\nNinety to Ninety six Ninety six campaign and um [noise] forms that come from nowhere McLaughlin was its pollster a Bob Dylan was supposed to be an issue in ... in January Forbes had ten point lead in New Hampshire\nHampshire we ended up winning Delaware\nWhat was going to win New Hampshire but then\nWho's the chairman it's a Haley Barbour why don't you McLachlan and they want it to or\nThey went to force and they were whining about negative Anthony was doing a dull and who's going to hurt the party and Steve Forbes team team player chicken down and that don't end up I think when the New Hampshire but how did they kept them up there I think ... would have been the nominee 'cause he would a window after but that's just me and they\nIt all John McLaughlin who's with us now John it's been two\nIt it's going to be the one that [laughter] that's what I don't think I'm playing before Iowa they they were right behind him and uh [noise] uh I don't want to pull that Ohio\nIowa closely and uh you ended up we're going to hear from them for one Delaware in Arizona and uh but but by then the establishment gang up on them\nI Know I Know but uh but\nI I did get the store I 'cause I Do remember half of that that that Haley Barbour once you guys was whining about your your negative ads and you took them down your shit doubled down an doubled them not do well\nAll I was in my decision that the times so but\nBut I mean he's been good point [noise] mostly as we have a positive as he raised a lot of issues that are alive today where where he raised the idea of the black hawk\nThan and pro growth tax cuts and medical savings accounts [noise] terrible of it [noise] and\nHe really was a reform candidate that was really a a a foreigner of Donald Trump right now so uh uh a lot of the issues that he ran they're alive today you know him very well and and with our country well if they acted on those things\n[noise] absolutely John\nTell us about\nYour association I Know you're associate with the with a couple of things you associate with Steve Bannon packing told me that and then also job creators network um but tell me about what you see happening\nThere you did a poll the other day saying things are changing because of the Kavanaugh situation can you share with her audience John McLaughlin what that is\nWell are you sure what it is is is that um I think who's the whole cabinet situation was more than just the Supreme Court [noise] it was really a play or by truck humor and the Democrats have credit when the sun\nAnd when you look at the field of the Syrian seats that are above the thirty five Senate seats that are up this year twenty six\nTony ... seats in Canada the seat of the Democratic seats in states that Trump won by a\nOne in the twenty sixteen presidential election some mid term elections are decided by people that are coming out that\nThat may voted in the presidential but a lot of the people that vote in the presidential\nDon't come out in the mid term so when Trump brand our strategy was looked to bringing out millions of new voters that Mitt Romney didn't appeal to get them to come out and vote for it so we got a hundred and thirty nine million voters which was nine million more than came out for Obama Romney\nAnd those voters voted overwhelmingly late for Trump particularly in the heartland of the country where there was some milk or the rust belt and in the midterms you only get about Ninety million people so it's the sixty three million voters who came after Trump come out more heavily\nIn the midterms the Democrats are going to lose a lot of seats for the U.S Senate side the shooter player to gamble to try to suppress the Trump where\nIf the Republicans get embarrassed and have to pull cabinet or if the Republicans don't provide the votes he needs to get confirmed there and the Trump voters would be mad at our own party\nAnd not so millions of Trump voters stayed home or\nShe would have a play to win the Senate where he'd keep his Democrats impossibly when a tendency\nNevada Arizona and become the new minority leader because the Democrats are really fighting hard to take over the house\nAnd make Nancy Pelosi the next speaker and by the way that the polling took her a whole lot of times with a a packet al as a bipartisan projects so packed it out to the project with the ban in where you could see in in the numbers Nancy Pelosi still very unpopular in September\nShe only her thirty percent favorable numbers ... y share fifty five unfavorable and the vast majority of voters don't want her to become the next speaker and uh uh you know the Republicans whatever reasons aren't claim that up the way they should\nI mean a lot of the house candidates will challenge Nancy Pelosi the districts but you really should have been you know when you think about it you should have a a a a gender where she wants basically\nShe wants to open borders she was she wants to increase taxes she wants to weaken security\nI mean everything stance towards ... to the majority of voters right now and he's going to be the face of the Democratic party if they take over the house if they take over the house Nancy Pelosi will be the most powerful Democrat in the country and in Washington\nState she insisted on numerous occasions that she's going to be the speaker and she said even the other day\nWhat those people that are running as Democrats say what they want at the end of the day I'm going to be the sneaker I have the votes in the carpet and it was like do you have to do to win but then I'm going to be your speaker women when we're John McLaughlin a CEO and\nOf his polling firm and\nAbout how long I Know John [laughter] and uh he's worked on\nA presidential campaign starting with ah our favorite Steve Forbes Fred Thompson and many many others so great to\nWith us he was also involved in the governor Nathan Deal campaign\nNumber two thousand and ten and I was covering that when I ran to begin in a\nIn the Atlanta market the newspaper there so a lot of interesting things that he's been involved in it now he's doing work with Patsy Delano there to try to figure out what is going on in the midterms here John\nLet's get to let's get to the\nLet's stay with the house in a minute so based on the generic polling I Know when I\nPack your dad was on a couple of weeks ago he told me something he said for the Democrats control the house pack canal sad the generic\nHas to be a\nMinimum twelve he sent for them to gain a seat stand to gain the the twenty five seats to gain the house because he said if it's under twelve what happens is a lot of those polls are in districts where the Democrats are way ahead\nAnd uh in California and New York and cetera so he says basically it's got to be twelve or right\nThe real politics average has been about sex right what Republicans chances of actually keeping it even possible\nIt's still possible but like we are pre Kevin we were really separately than than than we do our own monthly tracking national national tracking surveillance on them it's on our website McLaughlin online dot com\nAnd uh so if you go to McLaughlin online dot com you'll see these numbers but the but with Patti LaBelle um he's got a point I don't think it's called but I think it's close to them and they write about there we had a survey that when you compare August or September\nWe do a thousand likely voters across the country and order there were times forty four forty four Republican or Democrat in September of the day before the Kavanaugh hearings we were down for the Democrats were hit forty six to forty to the president told a job or cruel and falling from forty to forty six\nNow the differences since capital those Republicans that\nThe court in some sort of ethical family issue there\nI think more she's going to win that race John I really don't have been saying that for some time in all the polls show mansion up uh I don't see it I think more is he's going to win with your plays out okay to more Indiana a Mike Braun encountered a the incumbent Democrat Joe Donnelly\nPrior to the cabinet thing Donald he was still had he's perceived as some sort of moderate Democrat but he voted for Gore says lectured didn't vote for cabinet this year buried in a different race so that once a toss up [noise]\nOkay and uh my friends are telling me that Bob who can have the shot over Bob Menendez of New Jersey I don't believe it I'm from New Jersey I Know John you spend a lot of time\nI I really can't [laughter]\nUp there and it's like no way I mean and it's going to lose am I right or\nWrong where's your girl Madison New Jersey American voting for union [laughter]\nThat's about as I read it\nMore than ... county Miami somewhat to drew was guy when\nI went to I graduate in play baseball that's fairly Dickinson right\nThe street from drew\nCarey yeah my son played basketball for drew that was their big cross town rival\nThey were I mean\nThey were literally just so just on your audience under understand that there are two major colleges drew university and fairly Dickens and and they were virtually across the highway and so\nI was in fairly Dickinson the big thing but the ... the drew girls were much better looking than a fairly Dickens girls so we always went over there\nOr for whatever you know ... obvious reasons but uh that was and then this is not what we did play them in baseball and I did shut them out twice so I Love playing at drew anyway let's get back to this race who gives\nUsers Boyer Supreme Court nominee I Know [laughter] I'm Doug [laughter]\nAnyway but seriously you members is upside down ... you're going to it's been running really good ads reminding people that when enda was under indictment his ... his co conspirator was convicted than for some reason benign does cut off with a hung trial\nAnd uh so you know if if if ethics and a character can't be Jersey you're going to be the next center pull up a huge upset so pumping into 'em upside down underwater whether it's unfair to hire\nThat is terrible statewide [noise] so uh and it's because of that ethical problem that he had where it definitely is the group to the doctor a Belgian that who is who is trying to do favors for with with Medicare\nAnd other things but I ended up getting elected and and uh [noise] and in the meantime and that just you know cut off on some technicality but says the charges or for real\nSo based on our conversation I've got the Republicans picking up six seats Montana majority Florida north\nIn West Virginia Indiana holding Arizona losing Nevada\nThat that's possible I think some hair John Indiana [noise] and ah you know maybe they're maybe Florida right now so you know when their jerseys the three of those are you know even raise so [noise]\nYou know you got four weeks ago and the Republicans have a chance to win but then you could get that really needs to get a you know be very aggressive during these four weeks to make sure that every every Trump voter that voted in twenty sixteen comes back out this time\nAll right John McLaughlin a great conversation we got to have you back just before the midterm John always a pleasure to have you know we go back to such a long time I'm Glad your oldest on what the true although it's very good [laughter] John as you know a more information on his polling McLaughlin\nMcLaughlin online\nAnd John thanks for being with documents John thank you

Trump for president campaign is now an informal adviser to the president\nAnd he is also with the vice president's a political action\nCommittee that's a hard money factor we spent a lot of time with the VP is also an author and writer of the book let Trump the Trump going to buy that now great read party got another book coming out that's a blockbuster it's going to be a New York times best seller guaranteed called Trump's enemies\nAnd name names about all the windows running\nAround the west wing in the deep state and that he's outing in order to move ahead President Trump's agenda and he's joining us now live from New Hampshire\nI'll tell you what a great speech the president yesterday and then you saw it you know starts out\nApologizing to the American people for the debacle for the clown show the Democrats put on which there was a great opening and that was their lives and I was always for ... role was back in the media so it's right there front and center and\nBut the fact that he came in the cabinet or hearing yesterday and work on the line like he was some kind of a Victorian bureaucrat or running for office was just appalling to me I mean\nI don't like the guy so look I'm biased because of the things that you just don't trust them\nBut one of the fears that Trump supporters are they really want you to address is that they when they made sure that they hang on and maybe hold the house game four or five seats in the Senate it's a big victory then\nTrump supporters are concerned that nothing will change within\nThe White House nothing will change with Trump's enemy at the same thing will go on that the only way you're you're ... you're going to get changes they lose when you get in there and clean house answer that question\nYou know the answer is yes and the Republicans win or lose you know historical precedent has said that after a midterm election by there are changes in the ministry and whether that\nCabinet members whether it's staff members in the building or whether it senior member of the different departments that historically\nHas happened I think will happen again regardless of the outcome of the election that will happen\nBut what are we predict what's going to happen in my opinion the leaves and for weeks or four months or two years or whatever it is he will go out and he will do exactly what Jim Comey did exactly what McCain did exactly what all these guys do they go out and they write these books they get these massive answer\nAnd then they say about their time in the White House or their time in the department of justice and you know how to save America from this president that's what they're going to do that's my prediction I'm sure it will happen and I am certain\nThere are other people who are the administration has certainly demonstrated who are going to do the same thing and this is this is the point now Germany\nSeeing it for two years right people go in there they serve a capacity and then they go they write a book what Jim Comey books on a lot of copies and Jim very very wealthy and that's what these guys want to do with kids book comes out in early December\nCame to the deputy director of the FBI who was fired for among other reasons you know lying under oath on three occasions he was fired\nFor that book is coming out because they all profit off of Donald Trump\nAnd what's in the book world\nWoodward and all the other you know tabloids that have been out there and published but my guess is what Rod Rosenstein is going to do he will use his perch and number two person at the department of justice or took when he finally leave when they fired him quit\nDrawing write a book and just you know be skating against this president because that's how these guys stay alive and this is how these guys said you know in the public arena and it really it's a terrible terrible thing to be honest with you\nWith the new allegations out now\nThe raw string bean\nComments that he was going to attempt to wired wired shape the president\nAnd then go with the tape was set 'em up and then go to the cabinet to invoke the twenty cents to them and get them out I got two FBI as you said to be a senior officials saying they believe them and they thought he was dead serious they reported that to their\nChild to James Baker daughter was seriously thought it was the origins of the planets away now this was mentioned\nAre old that's awful me why doesn't the bird just find this guy now\nLook I I think I think that I think the president wants to get through this election cycle doesn't want anything to distract the Republicans have momentum on their side but I Do think you have to look wrong term at\nThe ability of rose and seemed to stay in that position looked it wants to leave the position he can do that anytime he can resign if he wants to but I think you have to call into question guarantee has the ability to continue in his capacity as a deputy attorney general based\nOn the information that we're hearing from other members other senior members\nThat served with him an official capacity in the department of justice or the FBI if they're saying the accounting for what McCain said to be true that she was very troubling to everybody and we do know unequivocally that Rod Rosenstein who signed one of the fire the application renewable\nWhich allowed them to continue to spy on American citizens on us soil for application has ever been made available to us the president is not on redacted that we need that we need to see that we need to\nSee the three other tools which are the FBI's note after they talk to Bruce or at the department of justice to see what's in there and we have to understand what the insurance policy\nWise to keep Donald Trump from being elected that the FBI was talking about what role if any thing in that because as a deputy attorney general he had the right to sign that application from what I understand and what is it becoming widely known now\nThat climate application was riddled with mistakes [noise] and it was based on the false premise about seeing that last renewable will actually signed when Donald Trump was the sitting president of the United states and the American people deserve the right\nTo see what was in that renewal applications that Rod Rosenstein\nWould you recommend to the president's Robin does November seventh\nAmerican people decide and see what has actually transpired the FBI's credibility because of what Jim Comey and McCain and now James Baker and Peter shock and Lisa Page has done an organization\nIs just devastating it will take decades to recover from what they have done jet organization trying to use their positions pizza with authority people wanting to badgers going after American citizens\nSpying on American citizens because he didn't like the political affiliation or their opponents everything that our country has been against censorship inception\nAnd died like Peter Straub who are the head of the counterterrorism unit had more ability than anybody\nHe was the one box in the Clinton email investigation he's\nThe one who led the team that was called crushed by hurricane that there's nothing to seeing these actors six hundred thousand including males there were all part of the winners and he's been wanting to say hey let's go after Donald Trump he's ordered that investigation when you've\nSeen it now with the text messages between Lisa Page and Peter Struck and they were at least minimum complicit\nWith what Jim Comey and Amy McCain and Jim Baker and potentially Rod Rosenstein wanted done and the question is John and this is a very very big question how did this go in the U.S government we know\nThat the director of the CIA and the director of national intelligence and others were aware of this spying going on on domestic soil against us since but exactly how I get to go this is this is\nThe biggest untold story of the last two years you get this could lead right up to the very top of the government\nNeeds to be which leads to Jeff Sessions\nWhere does your wife what happened to just not doing anything\nLaunching these special counsel to investigate would you alleged to be the biggest scandal in the United states history ever spying on people for political gain all the way up to do everything else where Jeff Sessions\nWill look at it this whole investigation and it's been buying large turned over to the ... the inspector general of the department of justice to find out if there's been any wrongdoing and we've seen some of that report already because there's been released publically the report that recommended\nThe number two person at the FBI and they're only be fired but charged criminally\nWe're waiting for that to occur uh we're waiting to see what happens to a ... page and and and Jim Baker the general counsel from the FBI we're waiting to find out what happened to the\nGym combing because it is very possible that Jim Comey has brought up on charges of potentially perjuring in front of Congress leaking of classified information even though Jim said he didn't think it was classified that's not an excuse\nWouldn't do that he gave his notes his work product which was he was not allowed to do to the law professor to make sure that leaked out to the media\nWhich was try they try to influence the outcome of the election because what Clinton supported by and large they do not want to become President Trump and I don't understand what the accountability and why it hasn't come out yet\nNovember seventh or are we going to clean house or not\nBut I Hope so John I really hope so and I and I hope will take on that he has a tune\nThat focus on helping him achieve all over the results which he's been able to do by and large singlehandedly you look at what the president's been able to accomplish what three point seven percent unemployment the employment rate for African Americans and Hispanics\nHe's down to uh to help others in lieu of her staff quite candidly and we've seen\nIn the Woodward book toward the staff tried on multiple occasions to stop him from doing things and stopping trying to stop him from being successful but persevered to guard down and down the historic levels just think for a second it's stuff\nBut you got to get involved with the tax cuts work dot
