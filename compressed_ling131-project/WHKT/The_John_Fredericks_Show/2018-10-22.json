backing of Trump now there's no way this has a fourteen point differential this is why these are fake polls I'm telling you\nWe don't we talk about fake news but now there's fake polls and we had this discussion the other day about why the pollsters change their methodology when it got two thousand and sixteen so wrong\nIn order to be more accurate because they don't want to be accurate they have

rain\nSo in Hampton Roads today highest sixty three what a beautiful day low forties sunny skies enrich Vegas sixty one's going to be a high\nGetting down to thirty five so very science guy south West Virginia's sixty two high low freezing thirty two but sunny Martinsville, Virginia ... Virginia where bill's family lives\nBill Hi uh sixty one get this going all the way down to twenty nine but sunny\nAnd as far as the greater metropolitan Washington DC area high up fifty eight low forty and very sunny skies so great to have you with us one of the most interesting things here that is going on is this caravan\nWhich many of these migrants have crossed Mexico I'm not sure\nI'm not sure really how steadfast the Mexican effort was in order to stop the caravan but we understand now there is a is about five thousand people strong and many of them have gotten through the Mexican authorities they were stopped on a bridge they jumped in the river many of them now just getting through there\nThe way the United states now the Trump Administration has got to make a decision in a very short period of time on this caravan I'm just going to say the straight out when you have four or five thousand people storming your country and this is what this says they're storming the border\nTheir strength in numbers they're getting money along the way they're being encouraged as the president said we don't know who is part of that certainly CNN is going to play a mom with babies that's all they're going to play they're not going to play the traffickers or anyone else that happens to be involved in it that might not be the type of\nPerson you want the United states are open to show the moms with the babies but at the end of the day you have five thousand people crashing the border of the United states where I come from at sixty years old\nI think that's called an invasion I don't know what else do you call it a migrant right at what is it like maybe we come in\nI mean we have laws in this country the president's kind of have to act on this he has no choice and he threatened to send the military there\nUm hopefully they'll turn back hopefully they'll turn back and they have to turn back and fix their own countries everybody would love to come to the United states as an economic refugee\nWe fill the country up with five being people it would collapse you simply cannot allow five thousand people to simply storm over the border and then be fed clothes education and who's paying for it\nAnd the minute you do that the next year of it that will be fifty thousand and then five hundred thousand and then what do you do then you have the country that's coming that is absolutely coming and it's coming sooner\nThan you think it is because thousands of these um [noise] what what you want to call them migrants or a caravan ers resume their journey on Sunday despite a Mexican Government or just submit\nTo processing by the immigration authorities they simply ignored or just like the will ignore ours\nAnd the differences CNN will be there with cameras\nThat's it they're gonna put all the miles with babies up at the front and take all the pictures and I don't know one of the CNN people and all the other liberals just take them into their home and go through but just drive your car down there take five of them in\nDriving through the process of yourself spending money how's the feed them clothe him I don't know maybe you do that they're not going to that they're not going to do it\n\nAnd all of the news that you're going to see is about how mean we are and not letting them it\n\nIt's incredible now this was going to turn into a major campaign issue\nAnd to be ... this is the worst possible scenario\nYou're talking about an October surprise here it is you're watching five thousand people trying to invade the United states from the southern border and there is no wall and President Trump got elected on this issue and now here comes a week before the election a week\n\nAnd a James says the timing of this caravan interesting yes I think maybe it was put together they thought it would help the Democrats because we have kids in cages again it's going to blow up in their faces are back fire\nI mean average Americans look at this and they're like I don't think it's a good thing for tens of thousands of people just stormed the country I mean that's worth caravan is your storming the country\n\nIt's just not like you're just a group of people in an orderly fashion or they sneak through a rancher there's a handful here and a handful there\nI mean you get five thousand people that's a mob and that's an invasion and what are we going to do there is no one is I mean what are you if you put the military and straighten them out at the border\nHow are we going to stop and you're not gonna shoot them so they're going to stop them during the confrontation goes on TV and the Democrats were screaming about how mean we are or Trump is it\nIt's a it's a powder keg it's a powder keg and you've got fourteen days away fourteen days but it's going to blow up because look if you listen to me right now\nI don't think you're excited about five thousand people just storming into the United states and breaking all of our laws and suddenly their nose at everything and then say take care of me I\nMean you don't have a country if you allow this to happen\nAnd Trump said something to get the relative agree with him he said you will like the Democrats here and you're basically saying an invitation because they're not going to START I got to stop it and the invitation is come on it he said the next ... will be fifty thousand and he's right\nBecause the Democrats are campaigning on let them it basically they don't want to stop them I don't care what they say when they come on my radio show about secure the border Tim Kaine secure the border how ... how\nYou going to do that to him I asked him three times on Thursday specifically what action center are you going to take when this caravan\n[noise]\nIt's our town halls are tough comments come up with [noise]\nAt least five thousand central\nAmericans continue their track north through Mexico vowing to enter the U.S illegally instead of dispersing watch it reached Mexico the caravan has grown and may now total up to seven thousand people\nPresident Trump threatened to deploy the military to close the southern border with Mexico cannot or will not stop the martyrs president tweets caravans or a disgrace to the Democratic party\nChanged the immigration laws now in an earlier tweet the president wrote that for Democrats would stop being

three years old\nAnd everything this guy is touched us trying to craft right he's the one that got the Saudis involved in the Yemeni war that we should have no business being and that's number one\nHe's the one that did the uh whether all along with the gang of ah of four to the blockade on guitar that blew up in his face that's been a disaster now this is a disaster\nAnd he's thirty three

do a deal with whatever I Do\nAnd this president has gone with the Saudis on a lot of issues including the disastrous civil war in Yemen so it's got to be dealt with man it's got to be dealt with you

people don't have to like it but we have to think a bigger strategic picture right just like we did with a Joseph Stalin who murdered millions and millions of his own people zone officers all the polish officers\nThat the mass murder and we decided to be an ally with them and to fight the second World War so look I get it and then again nobody is saying that we have to completely disassociate ourselves from the Saudis are cancelled the arms deal or a or upset or the balance of power in the middle Middle East\nBut it's Congress's saying we're going to have to do something that's going to have to be severe or whether it be economic sanctions or whatever they decide to come up with but you simply cannot sweep just under the carpet because somebody says the guy was Muslim Brotherhood you can't do it\nNor will this president do it cause NBS embarrassed them every instance embarrassed the president\nHits payback for all the grace that this president has given the Saudi regime and that'd

we're gonna we're gonna turn to throw it over to somebody else they got a lot of people not family this guy has proven to be a disaster so far\nFind gender as determined by Gina cilia at first\nPart of a government wide effort to roll back recognition of transgender people under federal civil rights law\nThe New York times obtained a draft memo of the department of health\nAnd Human Services that would define sex as either male or female and on changeable the move would be the most significant of a series of maneuvers to exclude the estimated one point four million Americans who identify\nAs transgender from receiving civil rights protections under the Obama administration\nThe recognition of gender identity became more fluid as you know so the Trump Administration\nAre gradually doing away with transgender as a sex for purposes of gaining civil rights\nNow that has nothing to do with gay rights that has to do with defining a gender\nAnd I don't I don't know I Am\nAs you know pro gay rights and uh people want to be transgender I'm for whatever they want to be but um I don't know that this is a tough one John fabrics radio network we'll be right back stay with us and you can\nWhen they get to our border and maybe a supply I didn't look good food and water to help them get here and if so aren't there was people also in violation of the United states all\nHelping someone to enter our country illegally and can't be prosecuted [noise] ah\nWell let me get the back part of your question the answer to that is I really don't know so I'm going to be honest about that I don't know what the hell do apply to that uh if people are giving food and water to the caravan or there are\nOther sponsors supplying them with cash they need to feed themselves to go forward what how you would implicate them or how you would go to a foreign country to prosecute him I don't know that's certainly if that money was coming from the United states or they're not only that but I certainly think\nThat the organ or whatever it is [noise] excuse me but a lot of churches and God Bless this but a lot of churches are are are taken care of these people once they get in there making 'cause we will dollars off of uh doing that and I just wonder if the other\n... going on in some of them\nCan't these people who do that like your shift from the United states or maybe other foreign countries or be prosecuted for attempting to violate the United states all\nKnow number one uh there's\nBut there there's no evidence is coming from the United states doesn't mean it's not okay so let me just stop there doesn't mean it's not\nBut there is no direct evidence right now might come out this afternoon but right now uh there's no evidence linking to that the churches that make money off that's the reason they make money is because they set up businesses\nIn order to take the refugees and feed them close them and then they charge the government and uh they make a very tidy profit but then we got a lot of money means is this a migrant refugee illegal immigration saying\nAre people always find ways to make money off the government and so there's plenty of companies associated with plenty of church is\nMaking a lot of money off the government because they provide for the food the clothing that housing in the education and they get more than they put out so it's becoming a very profitable business for people and these are short term it's right\nIt's a very profitable business\nFor almost all going to attack and then [noise] sending people down south to organize the rally bringing people north then you can say oh it's a [laughter] it's organized crime\nAnd I think we're going to take a very close who's organizing these people who is finding these people in the if there are cities organization in the United states than profit off of them once they get here you know you know the eagles coming\nMeans no meaning made\nMake it ... Glen you make you make a very good are you making very good argument for that I mean it should get looked into now if it's being funded by drug runners and sex traffickers and other\nUh bad people that are have a better themselves into caravan and if their funding it then there was not a lot that we can do about that and there's a lot of people who have inferred that that's where they're getting the money in order to make the trip to the United states is by bad actors that\nHave access to resources that have a better themselves in the caravan whether it be sex traffickers drug traffickers meals if you'd call them uh you know there's been rumors that there's a a that there's other people from parts of the country and this caravan\nThe way that I like that it doesn't really matter who's there good bad or not it's an invasion at the end to the United states and if you let the stand\nIf you let the stand if you let them come in 'em and the political pressure become such that they get in or the majority of them get in five seven thousand get in and you you know apprehend five hundred of them\nThe next caravan is not going to be seven thousand Clinton is going to be Seventy thousand and the one after that is going to be seven hundred thousand and then they're simply going to crash the United states and you can't do anything about it so they're gonna have to stop this and if you remember a\nThe zero tolerance policy which was the antithesis of catch\nActing as a deterrent and for a short period of time it did until they have to go back to catch and release because they separated the kids from the parents are we got the CNN kids in cages headline and it all blew up and it was a PR disaster that was the end of it\nAnd so you know there's not we have to figure this out\nAnd some kind of immigration reform in the hall the Congress is it going to do crap when you got seven thousand people ready to crash the poor they they're going to have to figure it out factor blend but wants to see how that goes right\nA meantime the uh the caravan is becoming an election issue the Democrats think it's going to help them they really do they think that the fact that these people are coming and there was moms with babies\nAnd it goes back to the kids in cages and don't you have a hard and Trump's meaning that all the Trump supporters of me that they don't want help the kids with debate the moms with the babies\nAre they think it's going to help them I think this is a disaster if you're the Democrats right now every day this caravan gets closer to the United states they are losing votes\nBecause people looked at this and they say the same thing I Do this is an invasion into our country that we're powerless to stop powerlessness powerless because of the media and because of what happened with\nZero tolerance and so I don't think the president is kidding what he says he will put the military there but you're gonna have to have a wall and then they're all gonna be camped out right at the border and they're going to need food and water and they're they're not going away they have to go back and they have to turn back\nIt's got to be a very it's we we don't know how this is going to turn out but right now for the Denver crabs right now at the snapshot in time\nThis is a political catastrophe for them two weeks before the election\nNow what they're hoping it turns into is more kids in cages propaganda so then they can blame Trump the administration and Republicans on having the heart and separating kids from mobs that's what they're hoping it turns out too\nBut if it doesn't if it's just a humanitarian catastrophe on the border\nAnd people see pictures of ten thousand migrants tried to invade their country the Republicans going to hold the house because no one in their right mind can't think that that is a good idea other than\nThe most left wing partisans that believe that every one that comes over as a potential democratic vote that's it and that does not represent the majority of people in America\nSo the president regardless of the political ramifications President Trump ran on this issue this was his signature issue it's coming in for wishing there is no wall\nAnd he is going to have to take a stand and stop these people from coming in [noise] but they have to do it in a way\nIf that makes sense\nJimmy ... says this could be a powder keg if they get to the border before the election imagine troop stopping this that's what the Democrats are hoping I mean that's why they were behind this at the beginning to figure okay if we can get this\nAnd it's a PR catastrophe or with a military with bayonets and miles with babies I then uh it's it'll be great for the Denver crabs New York times post CNN the LA Times will be a beside themselves will sleep\nSo you're right this is a powder keg uh Jennifer in Norfolk says the gets back into the transgender issue has really complicated things were for the majority man just won the women's\nYou see a cycling championship he identifies as a woman and won't suppress is just tossed around any compete says a woman with a male body science is simply science we are different in facet adult someone wants to identify as whatever so be it but they should be identified\nAs with science themes them at birth and should be listed as a male or female on their birth certificates\nI just don't have a lot of passion for the ... I'm Sorry I don't I'm pro gay rights or you want to identify the woman and when a cycling contest\nOr I guess eventually women that are real women are going to get mad over and filed a suit or something\nBut I just I'm passionate about this and if somebody wants to identify as a transgender and married another do whatever they want I just don't care I mean that's how they're made it and that's what they want to do and\nI have no interest in it and uh I'm In favor of people identifying themselves or however they want to identify themselves has no bearing on me and uh you know it is what it is and I know a lot I have a lot of transgender friends they're\nGot to say\nThis hour for down all the time I read some [noise]\nLooks like a showdown would be rolling the southern border as

you know he was no enemy of Saudi Arabia or he wasn't anybody's enemy\nKnow spike open debate about important issues he was a patriot\nHe won in the right thing for Saudi Arabia he was even reading for the crown prince to succeed in his reforms he had these ambitions and dreams and some of which we shared here at the Washington Post to expand the platform uh for voice is a particularly in\nOr about Saudi Arabia in the middle east or to allow for the kind of open debate which he felt those countries are entitled to in people there want\nTheir governments don't allow so I think there's a a last hop and if that's what it is which you know now kind of reads like a final will and testament was not that it was a a mission statement on for what he thought the region needed and and what he still hoped to do\nAnd here's what we know from all walks into that constantly on October second and he didn't walk out\nThe Saudis no what happened\nSo the idea that we need days and days of

thousand people are allowed to come in and breaks our laws are just coming to the United states\nWhat what stopped the next caravan from being Seventy thousand people or the one after that from being seven ... seven hundred thousand people I mean what would be the deterrent if they're simply allowed to I'm Jane I'm basically\nSeen them mob status and just overwhelming is hard Eason and come in\nAs you've seen them do in Mexico what would what would stop\nThe second tower van for being since Seventy thousand instead of seven thousand\nAnd the green light right once you have to see or a\nPrimary

already not just idea but in policy\nWell San Francisco has the seventh largest population in the United states and the third largest homeless population and that is growing and a freezer and it's got to be rivaling Los Angeles as we know ah the estimates are about twenty five thousand people and night are homeless\nIn Los Angeles or sleeping under bridges and drank pipes that's a lot of people and San Francisco rivaling that\nA congressman I Want to get to what exactly do I mean I've asked this question a number of times to pose a threat to you also this caravan is coming they've costs to Mexico and just becoming the president says I'm going to stop it I might send the military there\nWe've already gone through these zero tolerance policy and that was a public relations disaster\nSo what I mean there's not time to enact anything in in in ... days and there's going to happen you guys aren't even in session\nSo what should the president do how does he stop at like what exactly what he says I Want to send the military there and close the border what does that mean\nWell you can be thought about the defense of ... you know to where they started a folk hero bringing are coming through a but more importantly we have a lot of leverage over Mexico right and that's\nWhere it's got to be done to president Mexico there's already a hundreds and hundreds of law enforcement or to weaken him pick off some of the folks and sent them back home already and I think that the primary loop that's what happened last time\nAnd we the war to big huge number problem and so it's just it's just ... percent we gotta\nThere is secure and and obviously you need to build a wall and put up security measures are to keep this threat from happening in in people say well don't work all that kind of\nThing can you imagine the difference if you're ... versus what we have ... and ... it's\nThe fact that the left is so hard and against it it is almost the evidence itself that they know what will be a factor right ... thank God I wouldn't be a factor they just want to say good go ahead and do it [noise] but they know that would be effective in and they don't want it so we need all the above we we have good\nA wine for spent ... on the books and we just need to enforce it and so that's that's the play golf\nCarts rather read you a text for American Richmond who's in your district since I'm In the seventh district if I were to go to the ER and not\nPay I'd be chasing the end of the earth and threatened with every type of legal action imaginable and then they were garnish my wages since double standard is just crazy I mean isn't this one of the issues for average people struggling to pay their bills\nYeah no that's that's right you get traced because he's a citizen and he's got records on the phone with a fan it he's got an income stream [noise] that is the feds have by the IRS all his personal information in terms of income what he's made and that's the whole point\nThat's the total unfairness of citizens versus non citizen right citizens are\nOn the hook for everything that the non citizens do illegally and American eighty percent issue right I'm In touch with the number one a polling Republican issue right now\nAnd that after they the camera knowledge chemical what the last show that the tactics\nThey're using they're using them in my district right collapses threatening businesses one half of the other downside stealing private property or in you know leaving careful notes on my own doors group that was widely reported and so what are the American people see the choice right the economy's growing\nWe got strong America First policies and foreign policy at the border and the alternative is unpredictable to me it's just strictly on think why not I do have people coming our way not\nRepublicans were all coming home [noise] independence are breaking our way up to the cabinet story and so in the end I think the er the Virginia people aren't going to do the right thing\nCars but I have a minute I have I have a minute or they could show the affair we're going to get more information or the Turkish government is saying the next several weeks of MPs was involved in this\nOr do you favor some sort of sanctions or can crush all actions in response to allegedly won it appears that the Saudis did within their own constantly\nYeah yeah absolutely you you you cannot ever milk to another world leader even if they're an ally in in other respects that it's All right or to take the life of another human being and somebody's gonna have to be stiff sanctions I think the White House is going to get there\nProtests and the Congress will come in and a back that up by a it we we have to write so you're going to have an ally but when the I like cross the line like that you got to ... like\nAll right we're in total agreement with that congressman Dave Brat thanks for being with us safer more information or to get involved in the campaign\nHis only have to go to Jay Pratt dot com Dave Brat dot coms got the easiest website imaginable Jay Pratt dot com you can volunteer you can get involved you can send a check you donate outlined you could you

to America First policies dot org this message has been paid for it authorized by America First policies\nIn corporate and you've got to joining us now\nIs Sean Spicer he was the former press secretary for the president of the United states is now the author of the book called the briefing politics the press and the president you can get it on Amazon or your favorite book store you can go to Sean Spicer dot com and get it there\nAnd he's also a senior advisor with America First policies Shaun welcome again great to have you\nOn the job that I I don't know why you're not hearing for getting at it that night balmy like forty two degrees [laughter] pick the right time to Florida\nI Know I heard the weather was changing sort of like I got to go down there and find out what's going on in the Senate race so what better time than we have the a bomb and the weather in Virginia and I can finally get out of the rain it is beautiful here showing no question about it okay we've we've got a\nWe've got some things I Want to go over I Want to start with the caravan coming here to ... to the United states fourteen days before the midterms short and we understand this and that will grow up to seven thousand people to president saying or they're not going to come in he's going to close the border if need be how does this play out Sean Spicer\nOn it I think it ... it ... there's a lot of things right now as we head into the mid term elections there sort of that very electorate is a demonstration of what the difference between the two parties are now you see these things happen it Chris Wise it\nBe important to this election the thought that it to some degree with cat and our people saying okay I get it this is why did the policies and people that will come in with this administration and having a party in power similarly I think that you look at you\nAnd the president said very clear about what his position isn't that he's going to make sure that we are eight a country of law and order and it can't just march on into our country as they see fit\nUh I don't think the Democrats clearly have that same set of policy oriented so so you know getting back to it I think a lot of time 'cause you head into an election there are event and circumstances that crystallized what the differences are between the two parties in various candidates as you had to do an election and right now could be quicker\nSo what should ah\nWhat should the president's action the now as they get if they if they did get through Mexico and you'd have seven thousand I mean I understand the politics of it but let's get to the policy what should the president shall we say these kind of a sudden the military there how would how would that work how would\nThat play and wouldn't CNN be saying okay you've got ... and that's so pointed that moms with babies that's what CNN will do\nBy my ... you know I it's just it's a it's actually a very complicated policy that I'm probably not the right person to get into it in a sense that there there's something about I think that you can send you the national guard a federalized or national ice them or or utilize certain aspects of National Guard I there's a tricky\nIssue between ten and titled thirty two that detail how you could use certain members of the military for domestic purposes but regardless I think that the point that he's making it he couldn't figure out what it takes to do that\nPut him along the border and make sure that people can't cross over a but there is an obligation for anyone to make sure that we're protesting for any president especially that's what he's made it so clear with his priorities are that we protect the border we've got to make sure that people coming into our country coming so legally and correctly and and not with not sort of I\nWill eat nearly and as they see fit this is a country of laws are eight I'm you know people are here to seek asylum I understand that we need to make sure that it's done through with the correct processes\nWere with Sean Spicer he was a former press secretary of the first press secretary for President Trump with its probe administrators and he's also a longtime F. O. J. that means friend of John ... of Sean\nAnd Sean is also the author of the book called the briefing politics the press and the president which you can buy on Amazon your favorite book store or you can buy it on his Web site\nGo to Sean Spicer dot com is also a senior advisor for America first policies the number one political action committee in America that supports President Trump's America First agenda\nUp showing the show your situation and Mohamed been solving a you're in the White House at the time all a lot of our relationship with the Saudis was being discussed that was the president's first ... says it\nUh but now in a BS is really embarrassed President Trump with uh the nonsense that's done out of this or what appears to be a some kind of an assassination in their consulate\nOh what do you think the president does now if uh it's\nSince he was involved in a signing off on this don't you think that was a a basically a slap in the face to the president\nI think you're absolutely right that the idea that if you're that comfortable with the relationship you feel that you can be brave and that that really salty to President Trump [noise] ah to think that you can get away with something like this never mind whether you whether it's the United states [noise] you know to begin with the weather but but especially with the relationship that this president is trying to partner with Saudi\nArabia that was his first trip if you recall abroad because you really wanted to strike and that relationship so\nI think that the actions that have been taken and the idea that it's taking too weak or a bit ridiculous you know these guys knew from the get go high security there's quite\nA new clearly it's one thing when they initially claimed that they didn't know anything about it that was tough to believe but the two weeks later they say well okay 'cause something did happen and there was a fight with that you knew that two weeks ago there isn't an unbelievably in helping stall tactic\nUm and and I think that you know all of the steps that they've taken has just been we I mean the the cleaning crew\nSetting and the team um they either need to explain all of this which I think it's beyond the pale of of explaining [noise] um but right now I think the president should not just look good in terms of the relationship that we had a rabid but it's a personal insult because\nThe idea that we treated Saudi Arabia the way that we have and he made a such an amazing gesture of respect by visiting them first in his presidency\nAnd trying to foster and strengthen the relationship we have with them and this is how we get repaid\nOr the president needs to be strong in town\nI'm In agreement with that showing a hundred percent I think that is spot on a ... exactly what we've been saying for some time it is insulting there's a slap in the face and it was very disrespectful and it's kind of like hey look where friends I've got a hundred and ten million dollar arms deal therefore I can do whatever I Want\nAnd I I think they're gonna find with this president that's really not the way a relationship work so\nWe'll see how that plays out she wants to pressure I Want to uh I I Want to ask you about these mobs these left wing wing moms that are going around I mean in Minnesota last week or two candidates were actually assaulted\nTwo Republican candidates were assaulted by these bombs going all over the United states that are threats to Susan Collins and others are people getting chased out of\nA of a role\n... being a being chased down sub subway stairs what's the deal here\nBut look here's an interesting thing I I was reading on a column last week that I'm I'm a constitutional lawyer or a scholar I Can't remember what your what really positive an interesting theory which is that what he's talking about how our constitution protects the reality is if you actually read the first amendment if they're going to protect our ability to peacefully assemble\nRight and that's the key word pizzeria temple and if you think about how normally things work do you need you know there's do you want to go to temple in particular city and whether it's Virginia or anywhere else you get an apartment and you go do it and that's that's because you have a right to do it just doesn't give you um\nAll of the action from the last week in the right it is not in it we have a right to to express ourselves to we you know I address our government and our elected officials but it does give us a carte blanche to do it however we want and touching something and threatening way\nHere's the thing that I think the bigger problem to me John not only is it happening but they're actually not a deafening silence from the last but almost encouraged me Nancy Pelosi Maxine Waters Chuck Schumer all of these people who are leaders of their parties\nShould be standing up and hang on a capital you have the right to protest\nBut there is a way and it needs to do that going into a restaurant and basically threatening I Wonder if they're sitting there having dinner and let's be clear because for all these people on the west you know they just stood in front of them when you rent rent them try to have that kind of how you how it feels when you are surrounded by ten twenty thirty people\nCan't and you have to to get out get out we're going to throw you out\nYou can't tell me that that doesn't make you feel threatened\nAnd that's what they're doing and I just I think that the biggest thing the media is frankly a complete mess because if this was happening on the right\nPeople would be calling for people's resignation why are you standing against it whatever but because they basically agree with them the function of mainstream media are all sort of complex and that's because they refuse to ask the tough questions\nTo the Democratic leaders as to why they're allowing this to happen and coaching staff", "year":
