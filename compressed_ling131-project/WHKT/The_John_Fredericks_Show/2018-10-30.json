of polls you could at least get a a a context of the closeness now the only way the\nPresident keeps control the house is if Trump voters show up like the two thousand sixteen and nobody saw them coming\n\nThat's the only way because the difference here is you know that the Democrats are going to turn out\nThey're gonna turn out that so it's up to you know are the Trump voters in a lot of

back to what you said earlier which is a with this caravan coming and you said you know you're you're never really excited about the wall\nNow can you envision why the wall is so critical this is what the war this was stopped this strike now it's very difficult because you get the troops there they're not going to be there with bayonets obviously\nBut the minutes somebody steps their little toll

Bush is stupid or that somebody actually would tell them what's going on between the conversation between Bush Bush\nJunior it's ludicrous actually that's where I Want to it's just ...\nIt is and but it seems to be whenever you take something up on these people it gets back to anti Israel anti Semite anti anti\nIt's always it always it always rolls back around that we did was that really the question you know about you know what's in it that's what he wanted to go back to was Israel and and to me that that was the whole basis of what he wanted to get to not\nJust that George W. Bush you know had a issues with white knowing what a new car was or not the fact that they had a source there who can obviously\nTalk about which seems to be what happens but all the way back to this anti Israel thing and and just you get to the point you're just you shake your head and you had enough and I think most people most people realize what's going on there [noise] All right\nI'm going to run a couple of other clubs here from Culver and I'm going to get your reaction to here's one she did a radio show obviously they will not to mine [laughter] but they did a radio show and they are let's Berg area Brian and marine where\nAh they they asked her Brian asked her about her negative comments on making fun of your military service let's run that I Want to get your reaction to this Mike I'm military service to\nThe to your husband Andrew posted on Twitter somebody might be talking about to Mr ... risking his life our door coming off the Garcia I mean isn't that a cheap shot at his service in the air force I mean do you do some that come in [noise]\nYeah I I I got there I think that that was the last ...\nIn any surveying that's country I think I served in as well it can turn learning style and having spent flights out a lot of time in Afghanistan um I think it's important to recognize fat too so that I think you know for your loss married way off what people actually\nCare about individual as\nWell so if it's way often\nHer husband ... set out and bring into question your military service and I\nI don't think being a journalist is the same thing is trying to plan invasions of what is this lady\n[laughter] it's so funny you ask the question in her idiotic or commercial came on where I was joking about being in that job extremist shut off [laughter]\nAnd has about Halloween costume on there and has marchers you know going through Charlottesville um they're just so out of touch and they're so absolutely have no idea what they're about because they actually don't live here I mean this is\nThis is really what we get down to the root of this is that okay let's let's just demeans somebody\nLike they just stayed with George W. Bush much demean change the subject and then say something that's completely ludicrous\nThat that is the this is the whole progressive left game plan also it's just over and over and over again that the district doesn't care about it amazing amount of veterans in the district they\nKnow who I Am the fact that somebody would tweak something like that means or out of touch a leader has no clue what's going on in the real world him sometimes I get angry about it you know it because you're just sort of looking at their school and are you really saying is that nobody cares about that and are you a waiting journalism Kim I veteran\nStatus or you're quite in you being a journalist [noise] the people that have to serve you look over there\nThings where you don't get a chance to be in the Green Zone surrounded by people right there to protect and you can do a story and you can leave anytime there is it's a false equivalence said it's it it actually imply some type of cognitive\nDissonance that you can't even really get your arms around because you know I can I can say anything to make anything up to John but the fact that that she would sit on a radio show\n... ... and and hey God bless her she's she's just defending her husband ... with her husband did it comes to my face you know if you're if you know everybody hides behind weather on social media\nAnd that's the thing that we have the dairy social media has created sort of this this this mob of passive aggressive measures that the only thing they can do is try to slant attacking delete things very

to that\nTo me [noise]\nYou know I I Do want to give a little credit to some of the media outlets over this weekend to call out the Washington\nPost on there disgusting not only their editorial but they're headline which appeared on Saturday morning blaming Trump toward the pipe bomb issues [noise] you're Chris Wallace from Fox News held up the newspaper it was but it was the lead story on Saturday morning and Chris\nBuilt on Sunday and it said you know Trump supporter you know the bombings or whatever it was [noise]\nIt's amazing to me the victory\nTo all of some of the members of the

individual who committed these\nHeinous crimes with the synagogue or is it lets you commit these crimes was a truck here you don't the Democrats supporter permits atrocity than the dog as the headline for the media wants to go after this president for all the wrong reasons they don't want to give them credit and they are\nAt some level we're ... for the headlines and editorials the date of driving narrative which has a victory all against the president and an inch tall\nWell I'm not sure if they will but a lot of those press conferences as you know I'm a White House correspondent I was there yesterday and the questions you get from some of the media and the fake news media and the front row especially CNN and it's just it's just ridiculous and um that's just part of the problem is out of ten\nQuestions you're going to get three that are legitimate all the others are just to embarrass the president or shall something out or some other such nonsense [noise] um\nYou have the bombings a pipe bomb a crazy guy that got arrested you had\nA horrible shooting in the synagogue guys you know the president and the first lady's going in Pittsburgh today that's the right thing to do a lot of

...\nNot ... it's false as a matter of fact our country is going to be stronger after a national\nTragedy it always does and what I have called for and I said this last week said again and we need to be able to\nDisagree with each other but not being disagreeable the president is the console ... chief he and the first lady as well as his daughter and son in law who happened\nTo both be Jewish are going to Pittsburgh today to be part of the comforting process\nFor those families who are impacted by this ... is a whole we can never tolerate this but this is where the president is his strongest when something goes wrong he doesn't look at Republican or Democrat independent black white yellow green it doesn't matter he just wants to fix it and what took place in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania was horrific\nDisplay of atrocity is anti Semitism which will never be tolerated by anyone in this country should never be tolerated by anyone in this country and this president's going to go there and remind the world of why we're the greatest country we are going to unite when tragedy happens he's going to be a\nHe is the president of everybody in this country and toning down the rhetoric is

with what took place when he's you know other executive orders is a\nCourt is going to step into going to put a stay on it immediately will I'm sure the White House has already thought through what the legal challenges are going to be to this and ultimately there's there's going to end up\nBeing litigated at the Supreme Court at the highest levels or the land and they going to make a decision but that decision will not be reached\nIn the next seven days are probably won't be reached the next three months but the president in June a White House counsel et cetera but there is a cork in the amendment that says that they are they going to be born here are subjected to the laws of a country\nThat they're in and there was a cork there that these people here illegally so they're not given citizenship\nTo birth right and that's what I think they're going to litigate in the court system but this executive order or if they just released a will be implemented immediately my guess is they will stay or multiple states put out by a federal judge in this will be\nGood a big choice the election dot com choice the election dot com\nYou can send emails you can make calls you text you had
