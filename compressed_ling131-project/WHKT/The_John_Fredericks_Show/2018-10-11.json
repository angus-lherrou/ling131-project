his ah post articles in tweets and other things about the current Saudi regime under Mohammed bin Salman very critical now we have ... we have FBI intel leak\nThat or into sources said\nThat the Saudis were attempting to lure him back into Saudi Arabia in an effort to interrogate him and then we would assume put them in jail\nHe goes into the stand bow a Sony constantly in Turkey to get paper work so that he can get married or that he can a show the Turkish authorities\nThat he is legally do [noise] course in Saudi Arabia so that he can get married to his Turkish fiance and do the do the right thing we have footage of them going in and we have no footage of them coming out\nTurkish authorities are saying they were small play involved meantime we're funding Turkish military were selling them armed what's deal here\n[noise] [noise] [noise]\n[noise] [noise] yeah I think a lot of things [noise] third you know like you know the Saudis information when I said I Am\nNot I haven't really thought that something [noise]\nYou know value and how somebody trying to tell the truth [laughter] what's going on in the country you know he took it very clear in court [noise] find out what [noise] [noise]\nAre you well there's you know finding out and that could take forever and I think having been some just kind of underestimated the media frenzy here he thought it would kind of die out\nI thought the president or President Trump is doing a massively brilliance thing and inviting the Turkish fiance um ... uh to the White House that's going to put more media focus on says Rand Paul has called for an immediate suspension\nOf sales of uh any armaments to Saudi Arabia until they can\nAre you in favor that\nWent with\nRand Paul and or is one and he's he's on with me in five minutes he has proposed a pension I [noise]\n[noise] [noise] [noise]\n[noise] [laughter] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] how they [noise]\nAll right we're going to leave it at that time I wasn't\n[noise] I think we do a lot of different [noise] certainly [noise] from\nTo you how long we talk to them without our judges or and so there is a group of actually pop artist in Republican and Democrats\nAre trying to oppose sort of the deep state from getting on the information and days and good at that as well\nI just want to remind our listeners that everybody knows it listens to me I Would vehemently opposed to Patriot Act one\nSon and Patriot Act when it's sunset it you were a lonely voice in the U.S Senate I remember you did the filibuster for some time in opposing in questioning\nOr the ... the Patriot act you were right uh then you are right now I was right then I'm right now and just so my own you know\nThis whole wiser thing a with Carter Page and a easy dropping on the Trump campaign and the only five warning none of that put them happen without the Patriot act that set that up\nAnd you're the one that said you keep covering giving government this unlimited power\nOf surveillance and its eventually gonna come around and bite you in the bud center that's exactly what happened\nHaving the same and very ... and the conversation yesterday with the director of the odd because I asked him point blank argue gathering information\nIncluding suppressing some calls and of course he's butter and said oh I Can't answer that they're setting and the answer for him I said the answer is yes there was an article about two or three years ago saying that they recorded Fifteen hundred of President Obama's\nA phone call and then they minimize hand which means ... mark his name now but is it to tell when President Obama or President Trump is talking to a foreign leader here they're\nHaving their voices [noise] even if you minimize or you know a marked out the names that you can't tell her the voices are but we shouldn't be doing that we're listening to members of Congress has conversations were listening to journalists conversations businessmen and women conversation and they're recording and then out there and then the FBI in there and asserts this database\nDidn't understand if you're recording things on potential terrorists from overseas the costs that doesn't really apply\nBut if they're talking to Americans who are just random people are talking to America and we do get constitutional protections because many of the phone call our discussions with terrorists in fact the vast majority are just innocent international phone calls\nAnd so we have had this discussion with them and uh it should be protected by the costume back some say the Fourth Amendment John Adams says the spark that led to the revolution because when you're in like the British soldiers coming into our houses you know breaking down the door and see if we paid our shop tax\nUh we really want it protection that we wanted to save the government and never come to your house or any private\nConversations are belongings without talking to our trucks first\nWell and that's a that's why you were so adamantly opposed to when you were a predictor of the future with this whole thing senator\nYou've also been a very strong voice on the disappearance of juvenile to show that there's a lot of talk about or what should be done and we want more information\nAnd like I get that but as a member of Foreign Relations committee you're the only senator that has proposed action which isn't to get answers on his disappearance because\nSenator the thing is we haven't videotape showing that he went in there is nobody takes showing that he went out and I'm a crown prince NBS Mohammed bin Salman says uh the camera footage was corrupted or the battery went dead that they can't really can only buy that it's like\nThe dog ate my homework or I didn't get any ... battery and sort of battery died now you have more immediate suspension of ah the arms sales to the Saudis until we get some kind of a satisfactory answer can you elaborate on that sir\nI think everybody should remember that Saudi Arabia is the largest state sponsor of radical Islam around the world what I mean by that or if they had been funding for\nMcGraw authors in Pakistan in the Philippines even in the United states teaching critical west hatred of Christianity and teaching them radical violent and jihad just hear the salaries are we shouldn't be selling a weapon simply because of\nFifteen of the Nineteen hijackers who came here were from Saudi Arabia Saudi Arabia is a big part of our terrorism\nProblem they are they find areas of terrorism and teaching of radical Islam around the world their latest episode\nI I see no way that this could have happened without their government\nBeing your thought to private clients with team a guy's on on some of them have been already linked to Saudi security services and intelligence I'm no it doesn't pass the smell test and you know we just clean it out to the president this morning he describes\nArms sales to halt the arms sales are the only thing they listen to in addition to them killing a journalist there in tens of thousands of civilians\nAnd it fired and two weeks ago or three weeks ago they killed the school bus full of children in school children were killed a year ago they killed a hundred and fifty people in a recession and we wonder why someone in Yemen wants to drop a bomb on and kill the Saudi are killing American because they climb the\nFragments of the bombs are saying maybe I'm Erica\nAnd so we have to realize there are a reaction yeah and that's a blowback from us being involved in some Mr gotten civil war is one that we actually create more terrorists but here's the other possible that's going to\nHappen in Yemen what happened in Libya when we toppled Gadhafi\nWe got chaos and more terrorism or became a breeding ground for terrorism my\nFear is that there is some remnants are fairly fairly strong record of al cater and yet we're not fighting them that we're a mixture stricter civil war between the who to using the salaries and also with Iranian influence as well but my fear is that it sends into chaos\nAnd that you get to ride out period at the same thing happened in Syria is that\nThe war and we got involved in centered in the chaos you that the rise of ISIS\nWill actually uh the network that I go on just near a couple of about a month ago was reporting that al Qaida fighters were actually given safe haven of by the by the Saudi forces in Yemen in ... in in order to fight the who the ... so\nThis wouldn't it wouldn't be surprising because who did the Saudis support in Syria they support her down news round which is essentially an offshoot of out so the Saudis are all these poor people who hate America Israel who have a western ways\nAnd yet we kind of big arms deal the president says I Do it for a job for a job that's not something that we should be considering what we argue arms deals we need to be considering our national security not trying to have some sort of Keynesian job spoke\nYou're on the John triggers radio network truck in the truth across America where wind Kentucky Senator Rand Paul Republicans on the Foreign Relations committee a he's been the strongest voice in the un center on\nHow we react to the uh Jamal ... disappearance\nSo have you recommended this to the president\nCenter have you want to direct conversation can remember a look and it was I was an original Trump supporter everybody knows day when it came down the escalator he campaigned on getting out of these entanglements not staying in the have you had any direct conversation with the president on how we should react to this\nNonsense to going out of the journalist um he does know my feeling was talking about once every week or two and we have our conversations are generalized by saying that uh he has the same in strength that I Would have been out of the Afghan or two law and the Iraq\nWar was a mistake shut down a million times Michelin instincts on Syria or that we should mistake forever and yet he's surrounded by stay forever crowd and that's the real problem\nRight and yet the people surrounding him our our job to walk her and you know part of the traditional foreign policy round here which is go skating forever and bankrupt\nSen Paul uh the president has invested a lot of political capital in the Saudis and it was the first place that he went in his first foreign visit a MPs came the United states you do this media\nTour within the Saudis spend a ton of money on media PR as you know uh in in in the swamp\nAnd so he's put a lot of uh and and you know we kind of look the other way when NBS rounded people up jailed them in that hotel whatever they did\nA mystery ... has looked the other way in fact our relationship with the Saudis and my ... and tying it to that is it going to change the president's position on the Saudi ... book Largo of the state of Qatar where we have or\nBiggest military base in the middle east [noise]\nYeah I'm not so sure you got to change his mind he seems to be ...\nOn a continuing to sell our the Saudi Arabia\nI think Congress has also the same way they're going to put up some protests and say they object to the journalists being killed but um [noise] there's there's billions of dollars involved here and you know like I always say all of the ... and there's so much money being
