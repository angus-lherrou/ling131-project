that we're not going to hug this out we're going to fight it out at the ballot box and that's why at the beginning of this segment you know your last\nSegment you had to advertise about how people who get engaged this is all about one side's gonna win and one side it's going to lose here we have two different visions of what direction the country should go that's what America's about this has\nHappened before in American history and where where it takes place at the ballot box and that's\nWhy if you do you set before this is the most important mid term at least in my lifetime because

that right ... ...\nThe ... the country's been through tough times for the court will get through the scores were some people\nBut I think it'd be like the program of Trump if you like this kind of

Spanberger that's just a dead heat that's no one can predict that race because it's all about to turn out if the Trump if the Trump vote turns out and the camera Republicans vote for debut wins if they don't or\nAbigail Spanberger is done gone it's gone to defeat him and good luck this logic here I mean she's probably the best candidate I've told you this spanberger is likely the best candidate now if you're not at the Democratic that doesn't matter to you they're all bad if you're not a Democrat\nBut as far as the Democrats are concerned trying to win a Republican district like the seventh spanberger is likely the best candidate they've ever put up and\nCertainly the best candidate on the Democratic side in\nThat district and likely will be the best ever so here's the good news if you're a brat\nIf you just feed her and ah you hold on by five hundred votes you're likely not going to be defeated again when you leave it will be by your own choice because they'll never feel the

vote Republican this has been paid for an authorized\nAmerica First policies incorporated in America first policies incorporated joining us now a senior advisor to American for U.S policy action former sheriff of Milwaukee County sheriff David Clarke sheriff Clarke great to have you back sir\nSo it's a pleasure to be on with you and your listeners once again\nSheriffs so many topics so little time\nSix days before the mentors let's get right to some of the big issues okay let's start with the caravan this just in sheriff this that's reported by Fox News reporter griffey Jenkins is reporting a last night that a\nStates reportedly providing charter buses to drive the migrants faster to the border so they can get here before the election on Monday and Bobby Rush the border Jenkins saying and showing photos that\nThe thousand strong migrant caravan is now being shorter Boston us for a jacket showed multiple professional buses all lined up\nAnd boarding migrants to take them to the border so they could get there before the midterms what is going out who's paying for this\nWell first of all this abuse at our southern border has got to stop I Believe these reports that are coming out of this has been a political and Bush from the beginning this has been a political construct in time for the November six election but this president has made it very clear he has to remain\nFrom protecting the southern border from this trespassing this was an eastern was southern border to national\nSecurity threat I think the president is handling\nThis the just the way he should he's working with these other governments Mexican\nMexican Government Guatemala Honduras keep looking at all of his options and that's what he should be doing this with an executive does that was an executive\nPosition as a share of electrical Milwaukee County when people ask me what should the president do he'll tell nobody should tell the president wants to do what ... what is it by just to do is give him options three or four policy options given the information\nIn the nearly three or four things you can consider Mr President here are the pluses of those things here the minuses president alone as to make this decision and that's what's going to happen\nSo I'm putting my truck it might be in the decision of president Donald Trump he has not let us down before this\nWhat the president also sending five thousand troops to the border your share a pharmacy or\nWere in law enforcement or a very long time sheriff Clarke\nSo we got five thousand troops going into for twenty two hundred national guardsmen going to border plus we have our own border patrol when they get there and what did they do like how do they stop ten thousand people from just coming in what exactly are they going to do why are they there how did they start you know my question is how do they stop it\nYeah that's interesting is an interesting question first of all the storm the board of that's an invasion and and I'm not going to set up here and say that the military should should fire on them so on and so for those decisions that the commander someone make [noise] but the fact that you cannot\nYou illegally enter the United states do not have a right to come into the United states they request to come in through asylum but they're violated all the principles of asylum anyone you could have declared asylum in Mexico they weren't interested because it's a political construct so remains to be seen what they will do\nA couple of things mentioned they'll set up some tent cities you know detain them until their immigration hearing 'cause the president's made it very clear to catch and release days are over now there's no doubt in my mind that there's some activists judge will probably already has the stay written\nOut uh the the the illegal immigration folks on the left will run to a court and get some judge some activists judge probably in the Ninth Circuit to say that the president can't do this can stop can't set up tent city\nAnd a lot of men and I think at that point a push us to come to show because it's an intrusion upon the it's a violation of the separation of Powers Act I think it's an intrusion on the authority under the constitution that the president has\nIn these situations so I think and this president has shown that I think he by by throwing out yesterday or\nA potential into vis a vis the tanker baby situation is birthright citizenship he's going to push this issue he has to put the push the issue because nobody else well this is the fault of Congress John you know this is the fault of Congress's inability or the will to fix this broken immigration system\nSo this whole rehab but the president does have some options but I think what he's trying to do and he's trying to force Congress to act\nOn this thing so he'll throw some things out there make the courts getting while make Congress getting bothered maybe finding we'll get some action\nOn this but I think that if at some point if the courts to continue to intrude on the executive authority under the constitution I think the president has to push back I don't know how that will be I mean what form that will take but I think he has to push back\nSo the president yesterday sheriff David Clarke how former sheriff of Milwaukee County\nSheriff Clarke the president yesterday saying look this birthright citizenship thing makes no sense a lot of people I've been saying that because you went there with her baby now he's got hotel we we've got a whole cottage industry of legal companies\nTo that get put in a hotel in hidden you have a baby and then it becomes an anchor baby healthy makes no sense but the president says I'm going to do an executive order because there's an opening of fourteenth amendment now we know that is going to get overturned immediately by the strict in Hawaii and everything else but\nThis could end up going to the pre core what do you think if if if you talk to an average people um where do you think this is going to fall politically I think ... Americans are going to say yeah it's a good idea agar babies make no sense or they think you're going to say no I don't\nTo mess with the fourteenth amendment or that's the constitution that's who we are how do you think it'll fall\nWell this ... acre baby thing just persuade citizenship just part of the abuse and so this has to be rectified too there's a lot of moving parts and the illegal immigration thing so he's just taking these one\nThing one of the time because you have to solve the whole thing you can't just take one thing it just it'll be okay because it won't be okay this is a views about immigration system this anchor\nBaby situation I think the people will be on the side of the American people will be on the side of the president is to look at some of these other immigration\nIssues securing the border border wall so on and so forth um the polls heavily in favor of the president's last one I saw nearly Seventy percent of the people want to southern border security they want an end\nTo this uh these sanctuary cities they wanted him to illegal immigration so I think the politics of it he's going to be spot on the road and people will be on\nHis side the thing is these things take time for them to work their way through the American public and so I don't know if this anchor baby thing why every impact on next Tuesday but I Know that in the long run this president's golf course Congress just too damn job\nWell they're not\nRun the John truckers radio network sure if they were talking with us ensure clerk hang\nIn there for ... we have a lot more

coffee big choice the election dot com that when it went to join the local Republican Party you don't make those people I don't like those means you don't have to put a big choice election dot com\nIt's right there you can do something you have to get involved because the only way you lose two thousand Eighteen is if you stay home and don't work\nAnd don't believe the fake polls because here's what the legacy media does they derive fake polls to get a fake narrative to get fake news to reach a conclusion which is basically Republicans can't when\nYou're cooks a stay at home don't work they don't want you to work you gotta do it\nBig choice election that\nJoining us now imagine any she was a she is the chief spokesperson for the Republican National committee springing their step because I think you've got to pick up five\nSeats in the U.S Senate could be six I think five but I'm hoping for six and she's with us now Jay Lynn great to have you hey John how are you know\nHey I'm doing fine I'm this is a little bit different\nBecause normally six days out here's what I've been saying for a decade or all the early ballots are coming in and they all say with the ... the Democrats are all in the heavy heavily democratic populated areas the Democrats do a better job of getting all the early ... blah blah blah blah blah I was sitting there for a decade\nNow though it's different early ballots are coming in from Republican strongholds this has never been seen walks up\nThey are coming in and it's\nPretty high paid and you know we don't read your mind to early voting record it that's not\nFollowing it that then and only pull the party at Penn State only reveals the party that's going by\nYou know well we think you know Republicans are obviously going to likely vote Republican encouraging find somebody that they hate that the public polling is incorrect you well know public polling began with higher than\nFor the credit you prevailed despite what polling that that may be at work here and well it ain't like again are we in a rock star candidate John McCain\nOn your front and whether or not\nIt and he points according to internal point from the ... campaign that there are three that which are the territory might very well go our way and I hope you know of course we know huh it's darkly speaking but nevertheless\nI think the early numbers like that and this idea that Trump voter being real you really don't know when when it happened last night it might be apart from Denver for Republicans in the media will tell you\nAll right let's get to the house Kaylee and let's just be honest here um it's a tough pathway the Republicans are playing defense in the house they have since the first special election I think was in Kansas or ... or something or the Republicans are playing defense the entire time\nUnlike the U.S Senate which will get to in a minute where the run up\nAnd so here's what Scott\nMust have told me the other day he said\nRepublicans the Democrats need twenty three seats everybody knows that she said twelve seats are gone the Republicans are not doing a windows those are going to flip mail the minutes already over other almost by double digits always says it's not really twenty three it's eleven\nAnd he said so there's eleven scenes that the Democrats have to when to give dancing closer to gamble and then he said there or\nThirty seats that are toss ups are in play [noise] uh twenty nine of those Republicans of which Democrats have to win eleven twenty nine or twelve of thirty if one looks the other\nThat's according to my ... year old white you know lax about where you know I was getting the liberal coal carries a little more leeway to lower expectations are like a liberal cold air thick jak lean democratic and likely democratic which what the heck are\nAre are numbered at Seventeen and Republicans pick up here so basically that means that the Democrats to start with the fact that a lot and I trust his number\nMore than the liberal holding I was looking at I don't want\nTo start with Ian basically they're twenty nine hot that the Republican to win a third that does the encouraging thing though is twenty feet in Eighteen is that President Trump wine that district in many cases by double\nDigits so if the Trump voter become the Republican voter we can hold on to the house it might be back yet but we certainly be Donald Trump voter becomes a Republican voter go back with\nSixteen number that you just referred to well over God you're you're basically estimating strip trainer gun rights\nAnd political record at my face on line I don't really believe Democrats will get you know I Would actually number four and you know I I was totally going off the clock but I think it's got it's probably more accurate than eleven\n[noise] yeah well it's I mean that's it you've got\nEleven seats the Democrats are going to have\nBut you know we might be up to very late now there's there's a there's two seats in Minnesota that conflict for the Republicans a that adds to the number both of those I'm Scott has one leading jam the other ... that was one of the one of the
