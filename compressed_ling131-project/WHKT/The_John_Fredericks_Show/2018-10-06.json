in Seoul ... I think this is for him this this changes the outcome is right\nYeah I ... I ... and I'm not an expert on West Virginia but it seems meet Joe Manchin told position that I'm an independent guy I'm not beholden to either side and uh\nI I think it would be hard for him to get reelected it would seem to me you know what a Trump when the state by like fifty points something like that\nAnd I'm not on also not convinced and Susan Collins is going to run again either\nAnd I don't know that that I think it's ... I'm not ... but she says she's never voted against the Supreme Court judge ever you have any group in the state that could a million dollars up saying unless she votes against million man\nYeah poker now up to a million and a half ago front of me but then it looks like a bride I mean I think at the end of the day without corroboration she's going to be there for ... for which she I agree with you

when guys like mentioned when it's because they claim they're they're reelect in terms of looking out for their state right mhm yeah and Murkowski has a big issue with the cabin opinion about Alaskan

I think you're going to get ... an amount of committee directly without some crap ration Jeff Jeff is fundamentally very conserved right now you got to be the water is too he's also very independent

here's ... let's get the Republicans and stealing Supreme Court says well I I mean all Warren popped up one here's the problem you still can't get over the fact that Trump won two years later he's still can't get over ... let me bring on my Web\nOf America Garland well let me let me talk about America I think might bite every indication is a very honorable straightforward made a good Supreme Court judge in in the traditional sense with these balance sheets not completely a liberal Democrat property before he wanted the bench but but met the criteria for it for a judge\nBut what is better not holding a hearing on them are doing what they've done in this case that it's bringing is putting the sham of of hearing him and then finding a way to trashes reputation and voted no they weren't

[noise] who knows who knows what the rules are writing about it if the president is the president United States who nominates of waiting for the frame court not to set a dirt vi rights that threat\nSo therefore I think McConnell's argument is out when he says look a that was the presidential election year like a lot of voters ... that's now\nBut I'm just saying they they stretch it each time I don't know who started his but it keeps getting worse and worse and worse\nAnd once you do it for one year you could do two years you can do it three years I I don't know what they're already guard rails among us I think it was they moved it from sixty votes to fifty votes for everything but the Supreme Court of course they're going to do it for the Supreme Court if they there are new guard rails anymore and\nThat's what's scary are not going to get a text you're from a DJ Republican operative in Virginia Beach if there is such a thing do you just said Joe Manchin has only apply for in

if you voted against all certainly numbers change on this ...\nI don't see the fact that the numbers would change [noise] um but from my perspective I think account on confirmation to is probably the terms of the Democratic again and plan that's five to ten sheets maybe\nA Senate seat or two I mean well I think it helps in house and hurting because when it's brought on very red territory North Dakota uh Missouri I mean these are pretty solid state West Virginia in the Senate race and scaffold on thinking now Republican\nOr where we're where we're at a time for a couple of instructed found

about Democrats do not understand the definition of ... I Would be a steady judiciary account this thing is so off the rails and and and I feel like\nYou know people were completely missing the point with all this process crap\nYou know the reason the judiciary committee's tweeting is that the Democrats have the definition or on a book it's our process and none of it is actually on where people are on it and where voters are on on this is the Kavanaugh only has the support of the conservative base and the message that women are getting around the country\nIs that you know people are OK with sexual assault\nNo I think that that is that we can get their message they're\nThey're getting it you're now a pronounced a wrong\nDoing or where did you do it again it'll shut this message there right I mean this is the same\nDemocratic Party to defend that Bill Clinton bit of tactics accusers right especially the one that got\nWell first of all\nWhich which exists actually didn't exist during the impeachment process do you remember that woman came out a week after on national television that whole process has gone so when you say the Democratic party rallied around through whatever that allegation wants to be out there at the time I Will say second thing is feared\nThat was why he lied he said\nIf you're talking about with Jon Weber power Jones is different than ... then that was not ready to go through and the judge was actual after we had been working out after that was ever catch an interview with a week after the Senate in the Senate vote that you have the sequence Catherine really was the same time it's ... [noise]\nI bet you're thinking about the I'm Anita ... by either by abroad when I first when I was in the ... you were not rape allegations anyway the point [laughter] the message that\nWomen are

history where we get Supreme Court justice or never done that or what what has worked out in the matter matter because we're just talking about the electoral repercussions we're going to you kicked the hornet's nest\nThe Republican base that was kind of depressed at this point yeah and what you see now in in terms of the energy brings to both parties the enthusiasm gap is closed and that's going to call Democrats a couple of\nAt least you know I mean I get like nobody wants to have a family that are doing sexual has done sexual assault get off of it we want people to come up with ... it's okay you have public as a double standard right she fell into it or\nOr the guy who was the guy in the ravens beat up his girlfriend and ... by the hair and they they pay them more money\nJust for for whatever it's worth I mean I I totally concur on he told her I said that publicly I campaigned for his opponent on line when he got into the primary for attorney general I said this is not right the way he's doing it um in\nYour shoes you should be that's the end and not you've been saying in general but it it it ... and it is bad because a lot of people will look the other way 'cause any should not be the number two person on the Democratic\nNational Committee All right but this is the Supreme Court\nHas a credible accuser and we'll put the other two aside from it but I think Dr Ford is an extremely credible accuser but she has nuclear operation that she has a lot of your cooperation what's your corroborate her claim I don't think contemporaneous his\nHe's the people she said Bush present at the party he turned over his calendars from the same month and at the same people are lifted on his challenger and and being like a social good the burning of ...\nAt parties and she didn't go to a school so she wouldn't even know most people and that was all his calendars were released after she made\nIn none of them you know leaving her best friend can remember this like ... ... that's

I was at a social function in high school and no one told me that eight of Ben traumatic event for someone else had occurred I Would have not remembering the event the next week let alone Twenty years

nobody can pinpoint where in the when the party was where\nWas would invite her she got there how she got home\nYou've gotta have something outside of some memory I Wish you credible witness absolutely but I've seen credible witness is before the wrong memories get over Thirty years I don't remember a lot of banks Thirty years ago or or I remember them differently than they were in his corrected\nLook I don't know who's telling the truth here but I think the mere allegation enough if that's now the standard to take somebody down I think we wanted\nTo I don't think this is an allegation I mean I I I think nowadays I think that when you look at you know I'm ... ... people have put a lot of holes in the story of the the third accuser um and I think that you know you obviously have to hear both sides of you know when an accuser comes forward their credibility\nThis this it's user everything she had said you can cooperate with what she had done with how she has lived her life\nWhich are the notes from her therapy sessions\nWhere it is accurate long\nI Know that they gave you do not early in the notes from earth are you ready to get them did he have she offered enough yet when the interviewer\nShe won't give your community many of the fact that I mean\nI appreciate your passion and you know I'm your friend that I Love you to death but you what'd you just said is false I mean she said she couldn't fly and then we find out she delta to me and my were fliers she's gone all over the world and were then we're hoping to reach a month ago she around so\nThey they said she she could be in a place where the one door that was like Robert in fact\nThe person that they are and the parents are ... percent any by the door she lives in a tiny part with one door that was fought she said oh a\nLie detector test I never did it I don't know anything about it that her former\nShe knew everything about it so there was a lot of things that you said that\nShe couldn't recall or what must been thinking about it you can sit there and say everything that she said it would act I don't even know what's true anymore\nYeah that's the harsh on the line I I don't\nEven know I think her testimony was a compelling touched my bed I give you that everybody watched that but I thought he was too and if my reputation for being trashed I'd be a little emotional ... as as well what happens\nNow everybody back in the corners this is a very divided country what it is gone it didn't equalize the enthusiasm gap which was in the Democrats' favor prior to this I agree with that and and that is the politics of this we can argue forever there's got to be a good judge in history will tell that\nBut it's really not a ... this was a ... this was a circus I think it's diminished that broke the institution of the Senate and the and the court to cloud show and I just sort of it's a good one at least they took a week to go back in the interview some of these other people in close that the ... it's never going to be enough if you come back and you don't take this guy out for the Democrats\nAnd on same among Republicans will have a vote tomorrow make advances in in ... and you move on\n'em and we'll go to an election that fact ... says he doesn't pass it probably be the best result for the Republicans elders now more intense\nI agree I I think that the enthusiasm gap um I don't think it's not as much as the Republicans are claiming that has I think that there was some I'm ...\nNow or not you know and our internal polling\nSure as you as you know like you know pulling will show noise and while this is going on there was an ad and and the reality is rougher and the and the reality is that if you are correct that he's going to get confirmed that there's not going to be a Republican boost from the from the election in fact it will be the opposite it's going to add to the army I'm\nMark ... democratic contest he was already at an eleven I mean I\nI don't think that's true and in fact I think that the Democratic intensity and she doesn't Seventeen ... you know you look at Virginia it was only on pockets of neighborhoods there were places where it wasn't a weapon um upper income white neighborhoods were off the charts for Democrats\nBut like the minority communities which I've always been a historic democratic base have not been it we're not engage in twenty Seventeen election the same extent and they hadn't been engaged in twenty eight teams I I agree with that I don't and they still aren't and I think the allegations

seventh so let's start with the tent that's on everybody's mind ... complex look but that was that the debate in ... county and a Jeff from\nWashington was horrific I mean she was just absolutely dreadful of foods that are just big profit she I mean I\nIf you try to be fair in a debate if if I dressed up answer it did that debate in my goal was to be horrible she did worse than I could have done it person or try to either what what's up with\nThis announcement that the ... district is competitive ... by Barbara Comstock for Congress\nI mean it is going to be a double digit race she's reading from a script because he's trying not to screw up the fact that she's going to end by double digits um shall be asleep is capable of of doing more um than um\nThan that um you know she's been a state senator so I'm Talking on policy side I'm so she's not without chops right but at this point in this race she's being told we just script don't mess up that's what happened in that debate I don't disagree with you that like you know\nDid was she a little plane at the debate yes did she make any major errors no\nAnd that's what Barbara Comstock so upset about the debate that wants to talk about oh she did so poorly Barbara ... Jennifer didn't make any errors that allows barber to get back in the race\nIt's a landslide it's been a landslide the tenth district\nHas every single demographic group is breaking against Trump in this country over represented in it if the Democrats do not take the tent the Republicans will hold Congress at that I agree with I don't think yeah it's it's not an end right now that's not in the realm of possibility\nBut the Republican polling is telling me that she tire or slightly ahead\nBarbara is going to lose by double digits Tom when she's over perform for pulling every time her whole career she's over ...\nYears the problem is it can ban here is every demographic group for the Republicans were losing market share right now are collected from from federal employees\nAre high income educated voters gun now she's a woman and she talks but the difficulty they have the Republicans took away the one weapon Frank Wolf and I had to survive up here and it was your marks I was not Tom Davis I was Mr closer word and purrs and Mr Woodrow Wilson bridge Mr rail to dollars\nBarbara gets none of that uh because the Republicans get away with their constitutional obligation or on a do or you know to to designate projects\nSo this makes it more difficult race it it's a single digit rays are at this\nThe closing weeks on a jet for in terms of their operate search I'm not going to tell you what it is so I think this race quoting suicide scene races close a lot more at this point but this was this was a tough race it's a tough atmosphere and it's a tough district then remember\nTribute than what was going to solve anything you said again just as she wants to make the ... [laughter]\nI just I got to treat that out at eight thirty are driven Tom Davis ... Peterson and you've got to love the truth you John just rhetoric let's get to the other races let's get to the seven I just had Barbara I just said Abigail Spanberger on my show\nYesterday she's a very Catholic candidate no doubt but ah I see little momentum going for Dave I didn't think he was going to win a week ago now I I think he is going to win a\nHow do you see that race [noise] so I I had that one a slightly Republican up until the Kavanaugh hearings at this point I think it's a toss up on because\nWhat the cabinet against it was really re energized and fire up the one voter block\nThat's the problem for Dave Brat in some district which is suburban women\nUm and I think that the seven districts historically Republican should be a Republican voter Republican ... I'm Still like him last year but I'm the one path or a Democrat there isn't an right to in Chesterfield with the suburban women\nUm and I think Abigail's good match for them and I think that the Republicans are doing everything they can to lose that block naturally right now um and so I have it as a tough one\nThink men drinking Kool Aid on this Kavanaugh's nomination in terms of I mean I can turn let me just say yeah in in terms of what this is doing politically and I think we all live in our own echo chambers and we all have our own perceptions of how it's done but what this is done in the ... and some other polling demonstrate this is the Republican base is now\nActivated enthusiasm gap which is favored the Democrats for the last year and a half it's now closed substantially\nAnd I think that works to perhaps paper they bred has two two issues though outside the demographics the district in the DNA that district is Republican number one he is not close the deal with some of cancers people and they would just assume throwing him under the bus to rent that she'd out for two years\nAnd bring back or ... you know somebody it's more in line with their thinking and and even some scores and secondly Tim Kaine is going to be exceptionally strong in that district he was mayor of Richmond if he has a political he's widely ... he's the same I ... but he's well regarded enrichment\nUp that democratic turnout there so you got a factor that into this thing I still think at the end of the day that the DNA of that district establishes itself and brought wins but this was a close race in Democrats have nominated ... she's\nVery and or or whatever happens you're talking about uh somebody that's got to be involved in democratic politics for some time I think I think Abigail Spanberger is going to have to be somebody that has got to be reckoned with a in a democratic circles for some time to check\nDot not you know I don't I don't know a ton about the district uh uh you know I Will say I was driving down the south side Virginia to go to an event last weekend and going through some of the rural counties and it seems like if Brad can pull margins outta those counties but obviously the critical mass of the the district has been a gesture film in right now so\nYou know I I Would probably say you know robotically it's a Republican district but obviously if it's a wave here than it could be one that the Democrats deal than would have to defend a twenty twenty\nOr let's get to the second district Taylor Maria\nWhatever happened with a tale of the other day I had him on my radio show or the ... campaign put my by name and their team TV ads so shaped a PR for that one out of that race but\nThis is my first chance to respond to Scott right after he had his meltdown on your show yet and that went viral yet I'm Upset about our analysis last time I'm announces has not changed he's still journalist [noise] um and\nUm I don't think I don't believe in New York Times poll I think it was you know I ... up to this point I'd stop near trials are pretty good at the last week they've they've not been um I think there's some noise going on\nUm but I think is gonna win and she's gonna win going away um so I think she's going to win going away things can be a [noise] a secular up until two months ago I was doing everything like um and he's really blown it\nAnd he's not going to win re election and so are you saying because of the whole the validation ... signatures issue in the way he's handled it and remember that this district is one of the few in the country\nThat not only sits in the ... side a media market but is in a media market that doesn't really stretch too many other districts\nSo the media has been all over the on the evening news every night you know if Barbara Comstock at a petition scandal in Tempe district it would have made the CD for forty five seconds one night or maybe a week later they quickly re mentioned that you know it goes way\nYou you cannot get away with something\nThis in tide waters bent on Hampton Roads here so let me let me look I think are the New York transport property rights cater is fixed that district very well\nOr you know it was a Navy SEAL all that kind of selfies issue matrix and he's chosen I think you're in line with that district is not a far right kind of guy he understands a suburban Virginia Beach in those areas so we have all that going for him now this petition scandal has a little bit of us\nOr what's in the Republican what scares me about this is the fact that if you look nationally Democrats just a ton of cash\nAnd dropping a couple of million dollars on that race in the last week that megaphone just can overwhelm at this point and exaggerate these things I think I think the returns pulls correct commentators up to date a again if are betting I I I think he wins\nBut in this environment with the kind of money Democrat she's put down a you've got to be nervous about this you're going to Washington certain election night if the Democrats win this seat it tells me it's going to be a pretty good year farm in terms of we're talking thirty five forty yeah\nThe the thing about [noise] that are the thing about this district is different than Comstock and it's definitely different than a brat is the turnout model is totally different and I think it's hard for Democrats to win the seat in a non presidential year I just based on who votes democratic and Virginia Beach Norfolk\nIt's you know that the typical democratic voters going to be a minority down there and unless you get an outsized performance it's not I think it's tough for the Democrats to win that seat I mean when I wanted two thousand and he got flushed down the drain and twenty ten\nAnd the reason was democratic book came out in the presidential year for Brock Obama it wasn't there the next cycle for Glenn Nye 'cause nobody knew when I was [noise]\nUm I think Scott Scott advantages that the turnout I remember back when I was in the house carcass we'd look at the turnout bottles and the numbers and [noise]\nYou know Virginia Beach in Norfolk the numbers are just forty percent of what they are in other parts of the state so it's just it's it's you got a lot of people that lived there that are you know enlisted men or women that are registered to vote elsewhere so it's just it's hard you know to to bring people out in that type of environment even though his bench correct your one media market and\nYou know they could possible Scott from now till the end of the time but there's gonna be a conservative there's going to be a conservative votes is going to come out\nAnd whether I'm a ... Maria I don't know how to pronounce it ... whether or not she can get people out based on her name as opposed to you know Tim Kaine is not as big a magnet there as he is in Richmond [noise] um so I I still think it's up for the Democrats even though I agree that looks like ... this one issue\nNineteen Ninety six and Tom Davis will remember this well [noise] um we had a we have scandal um statewide where John Warner put a television ad up against Mark Warner who was John Warner was far ahead and um he photo shop Mark Warner and do a picture\nI don't know who's in the ... I Can't remember who we do to stop what he thought it was up at Clinton I think yeah he's ... with Clinton was while her I was glad there was a racial aspect to it too I Can't remember what they did but they do to shop Mark Warner into a picture he wasn't in\nAnd I'm an artist elevation at and it was a huge but national scandal for John Boehner who had a moderate brand and was a guy that you know everyone looked she likes either but you are trying to say Scott Taylor is\nThere like had a friend okay and and and that people you know like respected John Warner much higher than Scott Taylor them [noise] and and these numbers collapsed and Mark Warner was going to win that race because the scandal and I will say that what John ...\nAnd and the captain of my ship and I'm responsible for what happened and I apologize and it's got telling her down and have it on and\nSo I just I was worse campaign chairman that year and it was a it was a close race Merck worse than fourteen million dollars at his own money that year that made this really a much closer race than it might have been other was drawing or we use on me to ... or so or the map kinda earned it after running a close race there but I remember it out and I really fired\nThe people that were involved in the ad and everything else and you broke it in it it was an issue for a week or two and then John ... accountability and he took accountability ... mishandled this thing I think it just kind of destruction in tapping his people take the Fifth Amendment doesn't help it just keeps it in the news\nIs that enough to bring down somebody with a good reputation it's done a good job in their first term or not\nUm and also I think the wave turnout they talk about a blue wave I think you really talk about a pink wage that's really what's happening with the Democrats is the is the suburban female voters have swung radically or to the Democratic party and that's because\nWe're going to take up we'll get our predictions when we get back the next segment we have got to get to the reds yeah I'd say well that's actually argue\nDeal with that and this happened with ... I'm an ... billion Thirteen were there but not that popular when they're running and libertarian broke five percent and libertarian the automatic ballot access to the next five years in Virginia which ... which are they're public and\nThat was going to expire this year 'cause ... not ... percent again another tactic or if you were there'll be another five years the libertarian automatic ballot access while\nThey're great and why that is a good point and then back what is going to get over five no question probably seven foreigners here to tell me what it was John you think do you think five or it's going to win or lose\nUh [noise]\nUh what what ... what about Scott Taylor\nMaria I know [noise] you know what's going on [noise]\nAnd ah I see you\nKnow [noise]\n[noise]\n[noise] and [noise] uh stand a\nTerrorist got nothing but negative publicity from a over the last several months and I don't see 'em climbing out of that old could be wrong but I don't see that and I also don't\nI mean you know [noise] Comstock can talk about her internal all she wants that's not what people were picking up going door to door [noise]\nOr what have you heard of that risk [noise] I'm just I mean you know where I've had the when the Democrats have gone to independent\nThe Democratic doors that those people are telling her there whether and when they on occasion they've asked what's the main complaint if and this is for Kavanaugh 'cause I talk to anybody since then\nUh it was the ... [noise] those ads have been effective but this cabinet all thing I mean that's all you know I go to the door and that's all I get\nIt back for art\nThis credit shots gotta go we've we've we've got to get to the rest yup we've got to be getting Monday Night ride Carolina right how do you start with where the earliest [noise] right you have to be happy so far\nYeah generally happy I think the defence like I said a month ago yawn fast a good ... and they're going to get better I think their defense will get better um I I think they need to give a couple of guys more snaps a couple of guys less naps but\nBy and large I liked their defense to be a top ten defense this year and for the next few years going forward make the point is I think they do they have one issue they need to solve and I can solve it if they listen to me\nThey all week on the ends they don't have any big play receivers that can go down catch the ball you know catch eight balls for a hundred yards\nAnd you need to have that too when consistently in the NFL you can't just keep throwing too you're tied into your backs especially with a\nTight I'd like Jordan read the ... going to get ...\nDead is on the street [noise] he's bet on the streets I in you know Bruce was my firm Booz Allen I emailed him literally within twelve hours if they'd been cut by Dallas [noise] begging begging them to pick up to as I have repeated it every time I've seen him [noise]\nThe day he sets foot or rich gets park you'll be their number one receiver they could get rid of Josh dachshund yes I said it\nThey could keep Jamieson and crowd on the slot they can get that keep that get retro Senate they're number two receiver who's fast\nBut then you need a big receiver who can pull down eight nine temples a game for a hundred yards desk and do it and so if they put him on the team they will be the best team the NFC East and will make the playoffs white [noise]\nDallas like losing um I think it's [laughter] you know they don't like to when they like to lose a why did you know why do they do what they do I do they keep Jason gear to head coach you know I mean\nWhy did they get rid of Tony Romo and it's just I I think somewhere Jerry Jones just decided he was tired of winning the water and start losing for a while and so that's why does what he does\nThat what what do you think that I mean is that the answers that dependency\nYeah I I'm I'm they were going down and I can't believe we're talking about the Redskins are not referring to them is the first place\nYeah that's true first place and a phrase for a different place type\nThat's right I I'm going to say at this point a lot better than I thought there'd be this year still very very tough schedule in next five weeks and nine and seven and that may be enough to make the playoffs cause the eagles are struggling and the cowboys and the giants are not [noise]\nFor over ... you're going to [noise] you know games since Ninety four\nAnd one of the things that the Redskins of lack for some time to speak to him and and\nI Can't remember the last time I'm sure I probably missed something but I cannot remember the last time I've seen the Redskins a Redskin return upon her kick off for touchdown and a while and it's been a long time\nAnd I remember one of the hallmarks of a ... ... ... was that he always had her parents he called it more burner\nWhether it was you know an ordinary whoever I mean it was he always had at least one burned and we don't have that and uh it it shows\nHow many how many ... Wednesday or they're broken yet that man [noise] tough guy in the last one I Know bank right from five to\nYeah yeah I think [noise] I think they do after working [noise] maybe three or more [noise]\nAh they beat New Orleans at the superdome and on the waiter and eleven o'clock season [noise] I'd say non [noise]\nAll right I'm going to go in the middle I think they're gonna win ... games I think you gotta play offs and here's your here's the thing about Alex Schmidt I'm not a fan of it because you can't win big games in the playoffs and so we got an exciting quarterbacks but uh you know I've watched them now three weeks I'm not a fan one way or the other but they're on TV [noise]\nBut I mean he managed games I mean he's never going to be you know he's never going to be themselves and\nI could see one thing I can see why Allen got him I mean he does he kinda fits what they're\nThe whole crew philosophy is now a crime that I don't win games [noise] and\nThat I think the thing that kind of winter and they they could get in the playoffs or be dangerous [noise]\nI got I got a sign off I got to be in court today okay thank you if you read that they were ... let me just quickly add the unemployment down to three point seven percent the lowest since Nineteen sixty nine lowest since Nineteen [noise]\nWhich you know I can certainly do not get a raise and looks just like I'm not necessarily quickly John [noise] different it's an amazing stat but not for the reason the Republicans wanted you to be an amazing that [noise] because [noise] people say nothing sticks on Trump\nAnd I think it's the opposite I think everything sticks on Trump the fact\nThat you have an economy that's as good as it is and he's having a good to have a bad of an election that he's going to have everything is sticking to him because you should have with the economy [noise] one of the first time that a president picks up see if there was an economy election [noise]\nUm the Republicans could actually be gaining ground in the Congress\nAnd the areas where you're having the\nTurning against in the fastest so for people to say nothing sticks to Trump everything sticking to try [noise] well I think he get credit for the economy and I think [noise]\nI think he gets credit for the economy and I think that mitigate against the law says may take just because of the ... the cycle but these coalitions are basically cultural coalition if they're not economic coalitions and\nAs I said the Democratic enthusiasm and the independents wanting to balance the government is really what hurts the Republican Party people don't trust the Republicans to have the keys to want some kind of check on ... yeah he's doing okay they may vote for him and two years\nBut in the mid term they want to put a check on [noise] I I Will say this do I think the Democrats take the house is I think it's more likely than not\nUh I I don't know how they don't impeach the president when it comes out you've got the Democratic\nBase right now it's rapid they want to impeach him now before ... a commission and when you [noise] I I don't know how Democrats and going back to their primaries in twenty twenty can't not to impeach Trump\nI I just think that happens in rent for tonight's speech or whether they have any any reasonable evidence or not because you're like they have a lot of them think they have reasonable evidence now I don't know what more is going to stay out of it you know what are you going to say um but I just think you look at the base and you look at the fact that the primary elections or what most of these members worry about that it's politics\nAre going to do it I'm not arguing that now\nTakes on Capitol Hill yeah well I think what happens is it changes the dynamic for twenty Nineteen it was one thing in twenty Seventeen Trump's than Republicans control everything to put a check on him\nWhat the Democrats come in Congress like our class of Republicans in Nineteen Ninety four it kind of then but you know it's the end of Clinton played off against the Republican\n... he actually did better than they would do it yeah and I have some of\nThat dynamic in twenty Nineteen that's the way that the Democrats had it for you that when they're back in twenty Seventeen you won't have that same level of wind in twenty Nineteen now there are other factors matter of fact", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The John Fredericks Show", "city": "Portsmouth", "day": "06"}
