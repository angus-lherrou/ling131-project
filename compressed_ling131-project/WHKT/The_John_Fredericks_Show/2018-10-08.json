that if Kavanaugh went down over the shenanigans that the Democrats did that\nHe was not going to be the majority of like a leader he was going to be in the minority because he knew that Trump voters

because when you start hearing that and I've been hearing that for a you know before\nTrump was a considerably disappearing things about Yemen that the U.S needs to react\nTo Yemen I don't think the people who are saying that really other than maybe a save the children really care about children Yemen they're more interested in about disrupting the relation between the U.S president and Saudi Arabia [noise]\nYou're on the John surgeries radio network trucks insurance across America\nLive Washington DC we're with Edward uranium or man in the middle east than with us since we started eight years ago and he is based in Cairo, Egypt so lesson and\nBigger geopolitical situation here but I'm\nThe guy's missing\nHe's based in Virginia and he works for the Washington Post and he's a little legit journalist and nobody knows where he is I'm going to get your um Interpol executive in a moment nobody knows where he is you've got that the president calling on\nNBS Mohammed bin Salman but solving the Saudi sprints calling on him to pay up\nFor a bigger percentage of the defense protection that we provide I mean he just over the weekend he said no he wasn't going to do that you've also got the\nPresident man because he's continued to raise OPEC prices while in Trump's mind now the U.S government has funded their defense so he's pissed about that so you've got a\nLot of things in play here but let's get off the geopolitics get back to the journal is I mean my question again is where is he and if he was abducted you know don't you think take administration should back channel it and find out\nHappened to them based on the fact that you know he works for an American company and he lived in northern Virginia\nI'm sure they're doing that right now I I Hope they're doing that right now if I were secretary of state okay oh I wouldn't be doing that right now I I think that is my second but there there are a lot of possibilities here I mean there are people\nWho could have one just to follow up us relations with Saudi Arabia knowing that he works for the Washington Post\nReacted knowing especially considering that you got all these media organizations that have made that are close to a computer and and um the Democrats were were were making a lot of noise about Yemen before this because they were saying that the U.S\nMust stop supporting Saudi Arabian militarily I mean that would follow up relations with Saudi Arabia from the get go and not um you know I I couldn't possibly divorce was from the geo political implications of it [noise]\nOkay so we don't know\nWhere he is your contending that let's not jump to conclusions you may be fine and this may be part of the bigger picture or maybe he's in the hands of someone else that abducted him and then send it on the Saudis who are of course are saying that they left the embassy but they can't show footage of him leaving the embassy because they have kept on if you're\nConstantly you're getting the cameras all over the place or you have to do was for at least the footage it shows I'm leaving and then they have a good day I don't know what happened to him not our problem is you know things now produced that that's the problem\nYeah that's right I agree with you um and I I Am dismayed about this too but like I have heard from the Egyptians and obviously they um our allies in Saudi Arabia and they don't want to say anything bad about Saudi Arabia their their argument basically that I Know that you know people in the addiction system I've spoken with has said that\nThe Saudi intelligence people are not that stupid that they would knock him off and I I think that's that's true and there are a lot of their theory is\nThat a lot of that there are other parties that would have wanted to follow up relations between Saudi Arabia and the U.S that would have um you know wouldn't would not have thought twice about stopping to kill someone like some of the democracy will be assuming that's what happened which we don't know\n[noise] okay so I'm your advice year is wait and see don't jump to conclusions or I get that I'll take that uh for what it stands for let's get to the China Interpol situation right so we've got the head of Interpol who was a Chinese national goes to China\nAnd now he gets or wrestling\nIt it's inconceivable to me that he wouldn't even gone\nI mean why do you do there are some that yourself at risk you know if you go there there's there's a high chance you gonna get abducted by the communist government so my question is why on earth did he do\nWhat happens now\nAccording to all the media reports he is a government official he's the deputy intelligence minister I think at some point someone who's a government different shows obliged to return to\nThis country as a matter of course whether he likes it or not um although I mean he could have he he could have resigned from that position or we could have resigned I mean he could have remained in France\nThe French are very upset about this since Interpol is based in France um it was perhaps the calculated risk and he thought something could happen but you know hope that wouldn't turn down\nTuition up obviously the Chinese government was very proud to name him or have him named as the head of inter called so clearly what whatever it is that they have against them has to be very powerful for them to do that\nConsidering that they were proud of having their own national as the head of Interpol [noise]\nSo uh you're right I mean that's that's good that's good and now since they were they were very happy that he was named the deposition um\nAnd he comes back and now they've arrested him for what they say a corruption bribery and things of that nature so\nWhenever they've got 'em on whatever you did that they didn't like you just said must be thing because um you know they they didn't really want to give up that that's a session of authority they haven't even looked being being in the head of Enron Interpol in France or\nExplain or audience how big of a position [noise]\nWell it isn't that early on in terms of the actual cloud that he has I mean he doesn't run the day to day operations of at the bottom I mean the people who are putting out the warrant and things like that [noise]\nUm but he is a publicly\nHighly public visible person who would get a great deal play in Europe in the media um and clearly gives a positive impression of China to the world um to at least the European audience and some Erica\nProbably um the American media doesn't cover him that well but he he is well covered in print\n'em so yeah I mean he's done a ... and that's one of the worries when he was named in two thousand and sixteen was that he could possibly have an influence\nOn rounding up Chinese decadence across the world that has been proven to be the case so far as we know but as I said because he doesn't have the day to day\nOperations in him [noise]\nSo let's get back to the ownership let's get back to jump on them and they're starting to shoo wasting Edward major prediction how do you see it playing out [noise]\nUm I'm I'm hoping I Know him\nThat he will surface in Riyadh and that they will be ... be holding on to him and that they will be willing to release them after all this pressure as they did with the former with the Lebanese prime minister Saad Hariri went right or became him maybe six\nTo eight months ago I guess right beginning of the year yeah so I'm hoping that's what happened\nAll right well see we're plays out where it's great to have your perspective it's certainly a different perspective than we've gotten from other legacy media of this and certainly the Washington Post New York times\nAdam Schiff who's the head of the ah\nWho's the
