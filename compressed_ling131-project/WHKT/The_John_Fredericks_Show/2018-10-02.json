[noise]\nIt's just it's just unbelievable I mean it's like we we are living\nIn its rule Broadway just to a Broadway circus play being\nAgenda needs right it's totally grotesque [noise]\nWhen it's going on here [noise]\nAnd how does this man is just getting is getting tarnished crazy [noise] right\nI mean she has no information [noise]\nThat that was that was a good part it gets worse [noise]\nThe interview with snow from NBC went on to say oh\nExcuse me in a sweaty there are some differences between your one statement ah\nShe said she became aware of efforts by Kavanaugh\nAnd mark judge despite punch at parties in\nInterview she said she saw them near the punch but did not specifically say she saw either man spike it\nThis is unbelievable [noise]\nThis is like saying hey bank was robbed and you live in the neighborhood therefore you robbed the bank\n[noise] spike was punched I never saw them spike it but they were\nWere wandering around [noise] ah it was a pardon [noise]\n\nSweating says well I sort of given red tops the quite a few girls during that time frame and there was great punch those parties I Would not take one of those classes from mark Kavanaugh\nExcuse me I saw him\nAround the punch containers I don't know what he did but I saw by them yes or maybe he was serving touch because he was a gentleman I mean when you have got to be kidding me this is the evidence they ended\nHe served punch [noise]\nI mean it is unbelievable\nClaimed understatement it's you'd see Kevin on others waiting in line to participate in a gang rape but she can't see she says she came to this conclusion\nBecause in hindsight it was in hindsight it was too coincidental that he was standing by a Jew or with the other boys [noise]\nSo you know said standing in line so\nAnd what it could be snow\nAnd you describe Brett Kavanaugh in his friend mark judge standing by a door yes with other boy so you're suggesting that in hindsight sweating and yes you think he was involved I Would say yes I didn't see him but it was too coincidental\nOkay so they were at a party they served punch and they stood around\nI mean this is really unbelievable\nThis is unbelievable that we're even talking about this\n\nThat she goes out to say well I'm quite a shy person and quite a private person and it wouldn't be here today except for about six weeks ago I happen to learn about\nBrett Kavanaugh becoming one of the people who was short list it to go to the Supreme Court shows no says this is the July summer\nA sweat like I don't really know what sometimes sweating provided for names to NBC who she claims attended a party of those for once said he does not remember sweat next one is dead and the other two have not responded\nSnow weighted by saying this morning sweating provided for names of strategy says once the parties where the\nOne of them there's not really call a Julie sweat doesn't know who she is and now there is deceased the other two we haven't heard back from that the evidence if you don't think this is a circuits clown showing like Senator Kennedy said\nIt's grotesque what they're doing it as a man with no evidence that you're living under a rock you're on the John ... radio network ...\nYour calls when I get back eight eight eight for you know five six or six stay with us live Washington DC\nBut tonight NBC

went to parties with her one of them says he does not recall anyone named Julie sweat Nick another of the French you named is deceased NBC News has reached out to the other two and it's not her back to Brett Kavanaugh be interviewed by the FBI\nI think so I think it's fine if they do I do I I happen to know some of the United states senators\nWho is on the other side [noise] who's pretty aggressive I've seen that person in very very bad situation somewhat compromising and you know I think it's very unfair to to bring up things like\nThe president refusing to elaborate on that charge

that sort of squashed the long term truce deal with Israel so I think they're willing to have a long term truce deal with Israel but just not to have a um a two state solution\n[noise] so it sounds like what you're saying is that the president's grand plan here to bring peace to this region um which they've not unveiled other than we know that involves two states because they link that\nWhat you're saying is that uh in your estimation your analysis that Jared Kushner plan is going nowhere whatever that might be\nA I don't want to be that pessimistic I mean it looks that way but I mean you you know the middle east is very unpredictable or anything could change in a matter of moments Bob I think what we see\nSouth of complex and I think that that's going to happen again but it could very well because the middle east is the tender box and could go up at any minute in any particular place ... people keep organizing their\nTheir protest on friday and they keep playing the Arab News stations that there are people are getting killed after they marched them into the into harm's way um\nAnd the Israelis are not budging an inch on a this two state solution\nSo I don't think either side is willing to make the necessary um moves towards a peace deal and die as I said once again we could see a conflict that would set the whole place up you know a conflict that could ultimately have results on the ground\nWell the only hope here is that I think\nPresident has done in moving the embassy to Jerusalem the U.S embassy is he gave Israel the biggest chip they wanted right at the outset and it got that done and of course a President Abbas was saying at the un in his speech that based on that\nHe doesn't want us to fall you can't trust them he doesn't have their best interest he said or one hundred percent aligned with Israel so why would I negotiate with them but the other side of the coin is that the president now I'm In a in a position where he can ask\nThe Israeli government for a number of concessions because he's already given that the ... the one big thing they want it right so that I think that's what the strategy is now whether or not Edward this has got to play out I have no idea\nBut uh it's look it's a pleasure right I mean at least it's a plan and we'll ... we'll see what happens but\nI think your analysis is spot on President Abbas says he's really in a lose lose situation because Hamas is not going to sign off on anything he does [noise] so then the other question becomes how are you better off getting a this is Phillip ... they're just\nUm just to go ... when it's a mosque or you better off\n\nI think that they they are\nA lot closer to an agreement with Hamas than they are without bath um and a bath isn't a bad position a internally with respect to his own party and if he made concessions with his own party could\nCould toppled him he's an old man I think he's eighty three now waiting for getting close to eighty four\nHe's had heart problems and uh\nI I I I think with all the pressure the Egyptians are put on him I think he would have come up with a deal that he could have a so I think logistically with respect to his own party he's not able to come up with a deal never mind with Hamas [noise]\nUm so you've got a lot of players here that are unstable um I don't want to analyze the Israeli situation because Everytime you you you turn a there are there people who are trying to pull down prime minister\nScott I'm so ultimately if he were to making a deal make a deal and they work to agree on it God God only knows if there would be someone out there to shoot him as well so um [noise] there's so many\nSo many factors in this kind of a a situation that it's difficult to see how you could move forward but President Trump to the merits of trying new things every time you look at him so I mean I I give him credit for that and who knows you might think of a new a new plan [noise]\nWell look at least she's trying we're trying to do something [noise] um so I\nI really do like the fact that the president at least that he was he was a he he was going towards a two state solution because many of us they really want to see the solved that don't have some of the viruses that go with either side\nYou're you really can't see this ever getting solved without without each country having their own state I mean you just can't see it and I thought the president was spot on\nWhen he says the Palestinian people have a right to be to self self rule they certainly shouldn't be\nYou know some of the Israelis and I think that makes I think that makes a lot of sense and we're only got a couple more minutes I Want to get very quickly to um the Turkish situation when you're the Turks play\nNow in in this whole thing like in a\nI've only got two minutes but to find a\nTurkish foreign policy right now as it relates to the Gulf and Syria and ... where where where where are the\nTurkey is divided because they were trading main trading partners\nAre Iran and Iran is in trouble so they need to you know they need to find new outlets for the country there are there other main ally proud of a president or the one he's\nA Muslim is he's a Muslim Brotherhood guy and he's in the corner of being a bind because he he's he needs to come to an agreement with the Russians I despite the fact that they're opposed to his positions in Syria and with respect\nTo a it'd be a ... world in general um he had to walk into the line and a cut cut deals with President Clinton and that's what they sort of dining in Lebanon north of Syria so he's struggling\nAligned with everybody he's making compromises\nWhile at the same time are putting out harsh rhetoric um so I think are under the surface he's trying to come to terms with both the U.S because they keep saying that they're going to be a you know patrolling\nThe north of Syria together it hasn't happened um I suspect that may not happen but I think they're trying to repair those bridges\nThey tried to repair bridges with Israel despite the fact that there are a bad terms and they've been opposed to each other on a lot of different issues um so I think he's in trouble\nWith Iran and a lot of people want to putting gas and oil pipelines and that sort of trying to cut deals here and there are a ship afloat\n[noise] All right we'll see

some fire yesterday\nBecause they had announced that there were three debates wonder bank in coal pepper on C SPAN one debate was supposed to be in Richmond with the CBS TV affiliate though that was supposed to be televised\nSo that was October twenty fifth and then the third debate which was the\nRadio debate which was hosted by myself and NPR's\nKathy Lohr [noise] ah we don't have a date for are the other two actually had that [noise] so the spanberger campaign as you know Abigail Spanberger who will be with us on Thursday Abigail Spanberger by the way uh with us on Thursday an Abigail\nOr she her staff put out a statement saying\nThat the breath campaign had cancelled all the debates and they weren't having it including by the ... campaign that responded to that and let me\nRead their statement [noise] this is from the Dave ... for Congress reelection campaign [noise] uh\nThey said this is nothing more than the spanberger campaign trying to distract from the real story that span burgers own volunteers were caught harassing Dave Brat and his family\nIt was our campaigns understanding [noise]\nThat we were in the midst of negotiating the second two debates with the spanberger campaign when you simply want honest terms with both candidates having equal opportunities to represent their arguments in a fair for him\nSo here's what happened and I got out of the of the spanberger can't paint told me\nThe ... camp agreed to the first debate on October Fifteen which will be covered by CSPAN and coal pepper [noise] they said the second\n[noise] uh that they had not they had backed out of that commitment and I was pushing for a date for my debate and the spanberger campaign was saying we can't get a date from day\nSo I called the ... campaign and here's what they say they said the fifteenth is good [noise] we never\nAgree to the twenty fifth\nAnd we've never agree to a date for Frederick says radio debate that's what they told me they agreed to have it\nBut they didn't agree to what Jay that's true and what the ... campaign told me is they were going to do the first debate on the fifteenth\nAnd they were also criticized the spanberger campaign they said they were negotiating in bad faith and that they want it to dictate the terms [noise]\nSo and that's where we stand right now so both camps claiming blaming the other um but the\n... campaign absolutely denying that the TV debate under Fifteen has been cancelled they said that is still on and that they wanted to go forward\nSee how that debate goes on what they were concerned about\nIn three things that spanberger people stocking the audience with anti ...\nActivists [noise] I'm liberal moderators not giving each candidate a fair opportunity to engage in express their views and uh basically biased format that turns into a sideshow\nSo that's what they they brought Champaign said they were concerned about\nThe spanberger people basically said that's just not true we don't want to dictate anything\nI can only talk from my experience in negotiating the format of my debate I submitted it today they said fine [noise] I submitted the spanberger and they had a number of\nChanges they want it [noise] so I can only do from my experience I don't know what happened with these other the other debates but I have a format\nThat's proven successful on the radio a center to\nKatie Price campaign manager brat she had she signed off on it\nThen sent it to spanberger I'm Justin ... communications director and they had certain revisions but there are patients were not a big deal I mean the only thing that\nI'm not agreeing to but that doesn't work on the radio is questions from the audience I that that just that that works on TV like I've been through a hundred of these that simply does not work in a radio format so we're not doing that now they could you know we'll have something where the audience can submit questions\nSo we're not doing that so I reached are rejected that other\nThan that I think they had a few minor changes I mean they were cosmetic a time and things of that nature\nBut it was like an hour and Fifteen minutes anyway I got my my a debate or both camps signed off on it was minor revisions\nAnd that was that so I don't I don't know what went on with the Richmond debate with CBS I've no idea although I did try to get CBS engage with me and they turned it down and said they had this whole big instead of a debate rules\nSo I'm not sure how that how that wet but um\n[noise] here's my general position on this\nRight this is a very

never thought I'd see the day when it was done ... gone and replaced by something better\nThan actually help the American worker and more good news [noise] if you're working in America today you have a job even more good news if you wanted to three hundred and fifty thousand people that worked for Amazon guess what you just got a raise if your below fifty dollars now you're going to be starting of

jobs that means companies are searching for good people they have to applicants\nFor\nThree jobs and if they're good applicants they're going to have to pay them so I'm In favor\nOf a fifty dollar minimum wage as you know\nBut here's what's even better when you don't even have to have it mandated by the federal government\nWhen the market driven by Trump's economic is so vibrant that companies have to make decisions in their best interest to raise wages to keep good people that is a great thing to think of all the entry level people that went to work for Amazon or\nAre going to work for Amazon as I could ... a\nCouple of good things to grow that just got a race because of the Trump autonomy let's just say that half of what part of the air\nIt happens because wages are rising so now

America First policy and\nBoard that he was said oh this is ridiculous and he took out a picture\nOf congressmen smooth and congressman Hawley\nNeeds of the guys who wrote the terror fact of Nineteen thirty and ah they of course they look like they were dressed in Nineteen thirties clothes\nAnd they had you know different faction look back then and so they look kind of funny and so it became a big joke and and their name Smoot you know so it's a big joke Smoot\nHawley and anybody who is in favor of NAFTA was like Smoot Hawley\nAnd then with the help of the wall Street Journal editorial page in the wall Street Journal is of course the the the mouthpiece of the global corporations who I Believe in open borders no countries at all just let us rape and pillage anywhere on earth without\nUh any anything like a national legislature or national board or getting in the way of our ability to just exploit the cheapest labor anywhere and\nRape and pillage all over all over the world as as we wish the wall Street Journal editorial page invented this lie that the Smoot Hawley that the terrorist act of Nineteen thirty created the great depression\n[laughter] and and now has become accepted gospel wisdom everywhere and he's still\nPops up and you find Republicans saying it you find Democrats saying it you find better or saying it in Texas\nYou find every moron idiot who doesn't even understand economics but they know for sure\nThat the the the the Great Depression was caused by terrorists right that's what causes the Smoot Hawley tariff act and that's what caused the great depression and it's a complete like complete fabrication than no basis in truth whatsoever but\nThat is now the accepted wisdom and anytime anybody attacks Donald Trump's for standing up to China\nAnd putting terrorists in place for defending American industry to say well don't you know that terrorists cause the great depression and how do you know that well I read it some word you know where you're reading well everybody knows that case closed and so that all happened as a result that all came out\nAnother live from the Democrats and well did by the Republican at the wall Street Journal editorial page all all of the Republican\nI mean I mean back then Curtis the Republicans were totally complicit in this this was driven by Newt Gingrich I mean Bill Clinton basically came along for
