he's an expert or cholesterol virus all one wow I mean what great investigation\nThat is this you're about to show me saying for the kingdom is such an absolute joke and it's and it's just a a bumbling it's bumbling and here's the deal and I said this on\nAlgeria yesterday I don't know what the president's going to do about this was going to do something that's number one number two whatever he does you consult the secretary of state Mike Pompeo he tried to sell Gina Haspel but they're going to do something they have to do something you have to react to this now\nI don't think he's going to cancel the arms deal because he said look I got to deal with that it's economically\nBenefiting the country and if I can see what they're simply going to buy the weapons from China or Russia so why would I Do that here's the other people said oh the president's position has a high keeps changing no the president hasn't had\nA position on there at the end he discovered the idea of scrapping the arms deal everything\nElse around the table including ...\nWar so everything else is on the table so just say that while his position keeps changing hasn't had a position he's done commentary which is involved based on new facts to come out\nAnd the Saudis have changed their story temp jobs did they change again yesterday and they'll change it again tomorrow as more facts to come out so\nI don't understand what they're saying the president has changes but to just have a position he's waiting for the fact that President Trump is not a politician he's a businessman here's our businessmen make decisions facts numbers spreadsheets and math so as the faxes come in\nAnd the mathematical equation it gets put together his\nCommentary evolves as information changes that's what are you supposed to do the end of the day I don't know what the final outcome of the U.S reactions you got to be but I've been saying this all week in the middle middle Middle East on TV this president\nDoes it take well to being lied to and I don't think there's any doubt crown prince Mohammed\nBin Solomon lights off I don't think that goes over well with President Trump he doesn't like being lied to here's the other thing is that the like dealing with it competent people he doesn't have a lot of patients\n\nI'm telling you crown prince Mohammed bin Salman is incompetent everything the guy at thirty three years old has gotten involved in has been a complete undone medicated disaster for the Saudi kingdom so eventually the father just\nHave to say you know what my son is an incompetent bubbling before and I got to put somebody else in\nThe country to lean because it's guys capable of being gay 'cause he does stupid stuff including this assassination allegedly\n\nThe Saudis have now ... that'll by just not a final story or something but that's going to change again\n\nSo who knows what the uh Fisher case has here's what it is tough it is really brought renewed focus\nTo the Saudi average tactics and the support that we're giving them in getting involved in the Yemen's civil war which is causing a horrific very disturbing very growing humanitarian\nCrisis where I can tell you there's a um on algebra zero every day I see the pictures you do see because ah the fake news networks today they don't want to show your real news they want to talk about you know President Trump and Stormy Daniels or whatever they do\n\nBut I I see the pictures on TV and I mean it'll really tear out your stomach but you've got shows are just starving I mean they can eat that they they got mother\nAnd boiling it just matching it up so there's something that's an issue in their stomach green grass I mean there's no food I mean you think about having your child you're sitting there and they started that you think about how the seals men make this thing is\nIs a horror show is worse than the area it's worse than anything I've seen and\nOur involvement in it is shameful and it's absolutely shameful and if there's anything that's going to come out of the show you fair or\nWe're going to get the hell out of there as we should and it just it it's horrific that the United states is involved in something of this nature all because you know we've got the Iranian bogeyman\nWith their Nineteen speed poets or whatever they have looked at the phone lines Mike in Oakland Europe you're on the air Mike\nHey John Yup I agree with you on the other thing I think you're exactly right about that so um I I Do know that comes out with this for anything good could come out of this thing I think that'd be good but I have to\nPoint out though the irony or in something you said just a few minutes ago I'm sure you didn't pick up on it because you don't agree but\nUh you know you said the president does two things he doesn't like he doesn't like to be lied to and he doesn't like incompetent and I I Can't help but think he must be he just wants all that to himself [laughter] I'm\nSure he likes to lie to us and I feel that he's incompetent for the job so he just doesn't want to share those two things with others [noise]\nWell I guess uh I guess you think this tremendous economic renaissance and those who make tremendous economy we have an all these jobs I\nGuess you think that's the old work governed confidence I guess you think the fact that we haven't heard from ISIS and that they've been kicked kicked out of the majority of their caliphate and they they not only can troll a tiny part of terror tore yet when he took over it was a massive I get you think that's a topic\nI guess you think that the fact that the wacko when North Korea has not done a nuclear tests and she's written that might just you think that's a topic I guess you think all these new jobs we have in the fact that\nWe just keep going up as a confident and there's a tax cut and you've figured that's in confidence so I guess your nice definition of incompetence Mike\nUh it it it it's just a little bit different\nBut I guess it is a you know some of those things could happen whether he was in office are not\nSure I'd see\nMe I wouldn't know what one night there was\nSomeone who was confident in that position what kind of position we would be an right thank you weren't going\nOut you know what I thank you for ... is your father economy above only offered

worked for you\n[noise]\nIt's the perfect way ...\nFind morning or I'll shoot you\nJohn Frederick show your whole for the hottest topics the biggest day ... just being a crazy thought whoa commentary and that was bad listener interaction [noise]\n\nYou're on the job from his radio network where where congressman Republican Robert me represents the first district of Virginia He's running for reelection he's the chairman of the subcommittee on sea power rating has for the United states that will be decided November sex his challenger Democrat van gee Williams connoisseur it let me ask you this uh\nThe evolving story of the Saudis it's now clear this was a premeditated murder this guy got chopped up and uh basically got out of there and some kind of doggie bags and they buried him in the garden or something on the whole thing is just a horrible\nWell how much of the summer the administration has been a lot of things in the sky that Jared Kushner has\nAnd a lot of people are saying\nYou know maybe this guy's just incompetent capable of running the country everything he touches turns to crap whether it's the Japanese civil war that's a disaster the agenda for embargo against the state of Qatar that backfired and blew up and they're facing towards better off today than they were\nNow he's got this thing where they change their story nine times what are we do hear\nWhat John as you point out it's clear that a show he was brutally murdered it's clear that it was premeditated it's clear that\nI said I think the crown prince knew about\nThat a NBS Mohammed bin Salman day I think have a lot to answer for and I think they have to be held accountable so I Do think that there has to be significant penalties\nThat they suffer I Do think the question has to be asked is like drugs the United states believes that\nIt can carry on a continued relationship with Saudi Arabia which I Do think we need to but can that be with the\nCrown prince I I think that's a pretty compelling question\nI think the administration is going to have to ask that I think Congress will eventually addressed that an asset to you know what we'll be the penalties are to uh to Saudi Arabia I Wish\nI understand the impact of those of those contracts\nFor what we're doing to supply a military uh equipment to Saudi Arabia I think Saudi Arabia I can be a like a a force on that is is a is a is an ally to us in the\nIn the middle east but I don't think that it can it can be that type\nOf allies that we wanted that we need to you if this is how they're going to operate I mean we have ... you know we have principles in the United states that we that we stand by\nAnd our allies have to have to abide by those and I just don't see Saudi Arabia doing that you know you you point out the issue with Yemen too and you and I have talked about that before a those are all questions I think that come up and\nHow we see Saudi Arabia operating in the region house policies being played out and these are are they are they doing the same as necessary\nIn that region or that create stability and that and that are working in the in the best\nInterest of all involved not just Saudi Arabia but ah other allies in the middle east and listen I I I understand what they're doing that to push back against the Iranians but are are they doing things in the long term moving in the middle east at the right direction I think those are questions that we have to ask them for foreign policy\nStandpoint and I think that U.S policy toward Saudi Arabia you know needs to needs to be directed by those I think very a very sobering issues that we have before us\nIt seems like congressman Whitman a wind chill agreements and it seems like what you're saying is the best way to solve this\nBut Solomon to maybe a step aside for someone else have a father for somebody else in their final question I\nOnly have half a minute and I got to get your butt out so very quickly um is there going to be a vote Congress on our men and yet many civil war and backing the Saudi cameras coalition yes or now\nUm [noise] I don't know where to go but I Will I Wish Saudi Arabia and Yemen\nAnd I got to go more information Rob Wittman dot com Rob Wittman dot com early voting and started in Virginia you get out and get it all go to Robert The dot com ... thanks for being with everything else\n\nOf the truth in America boy that doctors are going on up there every day got a people I compete with hosts like people they just get up every day they read the paper you got the fake news you've got fake\nPaws are we just had a big poll yesterday for the Washington Post is unbelievable I mean the Washington Post like when did they get to learn like they don't want to work people say well what are they going to change a pony methodology to get it right never because they don't want to get right because it's not about\nIt accurate poll it's about the poll driving fake news to get a fake narrative to draw the conclusion that's all it is it's all why\nThe washer posed actually putting out a poll yesterday actually putting out a poll showing Barbara Comstock\nTrailing Jennifer ... than in the temp district by\nSurging points now there is no way that watched and has a third gene point lead over Barbara contact every journal pull that I have seen odd Comstock every a journal published his pay four and a lot of money shows this race a dead heat or cops\nAre slightly ahead and the Washington Post has got cops are down by Thirteen central take complete and utter lie and it's beyond fake news it is and it's beyond the argument it's beyond the national Enquirer what they try\nTo do they have cops are just so much they want that seat so bad\nThey want the liberal do not think Jennifer watched it in there so bad they can taste it they want their\nLeft is in that seat so much that they will actually conducted poll make things up\nDoing in such a way to get results that they want so they could put\nIt out there and say the races over don't give them top start any money and don't work for her it's a lost cause so they do a fishing pole in order to fake news it's unbelievable nobody in that district is gonna look you in the eye and say that they think that Jennifer\n... that has a third gene point lead this raises tired\nThey'll not up to any of this uh neither will the New York times or ABC News or NBC or MSNBC\nOr any of the polling companies that right to where the fake news and that's what they are so it's it's ... it's the fake news network and it's designed to draw\nA conclusion to make you not want to do anything to help her\n\nIf you're in the tent district go volunteer for cops like she is going to win this race if you get out and help her\nBut they lie to you on a daily basis and that's why the president says this fake news and then he said this is an enemy of the people when you why did the painful and masquerading as a legitimate news networks with a legitimate poll is that not that I mean how would you define that\n\nThis is talk of the poster so astronaut that even ... most staunchest supporters think it's a joke because they know it's not true so let me just let me just ask you a question\n\nIf they're putting out purposely putting out the information driving it so that the snake is that not an enemy of the people it's certainly an hey it's an enemy the truce maybe the president\nNeeds to change one work it's an enemy of the truth it's certainly an enemy of fact\nIt is unbelievable they're doing it again they didn't do does the sixteen and they're doing it again things were\nNothing do you know ready to deal with the Democrats have learn nothing from two thousand sixteen the legacy media has learned nothing in fact what they're doing now is they can't believe they were wrong and so they're doubling down and here's the thing if the Republicans don't roll link which the house\nThe legacy media after two elections in a row going all in for the Democrats and losing them both on a federal\nLevel will become irrelevant that's one of the stretch for them are so high don't become a relevant I'm more relevant that they are\n'cause I certainly tell you the truth good bad or roughly they'll become a relevant they are doubling and tripling down a moral\nOn more fake polls and more fake news again to drive the results they want on election day again and it's going to backfire on them again\n\nAnd they actually think that somebody semi pipe bombs or don't go off it's like going to change the trajectory the election\nIn general like we're going to get an economic report coming\nForty five minutes that it's going to show another over four percent GDP Growth\n\nAnd their banking on hatred of the Trump and somebody sending pipe bombs or don't go off targeted at Democrats had already been influencing anything right now\nSpecialist and it's very bizarre\n\nRight now if you're a national Democrat here's what you have to deal with\nMobs and caravans and you're running against Republicans who are for jobs and country mob is versus jobs and ... versus ...\n\nAnd if they really think the Taliban crossing of the United states and gum rushing the border and\nA clip of Fifteen thousand just coming in and getting food clothing shelter education hospital care and well let's just open up our our if they really think that having tens\nOf thousands of illegal storming the country it's going to help them get elected know see what they were hoping for is a couple of thousand which kids and\nBabies and they'd be separated and it would be chaos and Trump would be it meaning any French troops there and they end up paying that and everybody will be outrage and he's got to go\nIn standard has backfired they can't control is a thousand people they can troll Thirteen fourteen Fifteen thousand that's a mob you can't control that\nWho's funding this let me ask you this question I just have to Rob Wittman let's start asking everybody who's funding this one is\nJust coming off the train or just falling on a you know Apple's coke and not sort of falling off the trees along the route so pointing is putting up a lot of money to fund this I Want to know\nDon't you find that interesting I Want to know a lot of things I Want to do a lot of Republicans are gaining the Democrats\nRight now or in a dead panic three weeks ago it was a done deal they were going to get power they were going to do investigations are going to go to all of a sudden started slipping away they have a cabinet debacle they have the Taliban\nDebacle and Republicans get energized just started showing up and all of a sudden you've got early voting is democratic precincts at a level never been seen in the history of measuring the stuff\n\nThis is what's going on here this is why I'm telling you I don't know if the Republicans are going to hold the house what's going to be darn close there's no like Seventy six fifty see blow out here we're going to be up 'til three am that's got to be very close to that I think the Republicans are going to hold out and they're going to pick a boatload\nOf streets up in the Senate are predicting five

that lately issues have taken a backseat on Coburn campaign now\nIt's all personal it's taken Halloween pictures from my Facebook now she's doubled down you know now it's not big but it's you know they're they're trying to portray me as crazy based on I guess\nHalloween costumes and you know me John I have a good time so if it's just it's amazing that last week she pretty much apologizes for\nMarginalizing veterans says she's going to stick to issues then she puts out a commercial or calling me an extremist and trying to make fabricated things up again this is what the left does their own hands it's desperate poised by desperate candidates and\nThat's why common sense is back that's why conservatism is back and that's where I'm going to win the theft\nCommon sense back in your commander\nOf commonsense Dennis Rodman with us running for Congress fifth district Virginia let's get to the caravan I'm the president with my later today saying it's going to deploy a thousand troops he's got to do a series of executive orders that would stop the Taliban from coming\nInto the United states the problem is as soon as they stepped foot and say the word asylum we can't do anything or ... wars and the loopholes in Denver are written in such a way\nThat all they have to do is get a toe in get their hand grab and say asylum and that we can't do anything they cannot go back what you've seen the president's proposed action\nHere if you were in Congress now what would Denver Riggleman the proposing on the terror of it\nYou know what a rule of law and ah we're we're we're a nation of laws and we believe in the rule of law and the way the laws were written right now you're exactly right John I don't know you know how we we don't honor that based on what we believe us conservatives in rural and and people who follow the rule of law however\nI think Congress needs to start fixing these immigration laws as soon as possible and I also believe once that happens\nAre vetting process for any of these people that are coming through has to be extreme vetting uh we do have some of the technology in place now but we don't put time limits on this if there's that\nMany people are that are headed towards the border or we don't know what's in better than those in John my biggest fear um it's easy you know it's like a Trojan Horse right listen Ninety five percent Ninety nine percent of those people could actually\nBe seeking asylum um those that you know our hearts sort of go out to ... with compassion however\nIf you have people inside there that are bad actors and they're able to hide you know within this caravan we have a fair amount and my guess is this we're going to be sending some pretty healthy intelligence assets down range I think we're going to be monitoring and my guess is I can only speculate right now my\nBoth of missions that are coming out of there talking about radio emissions or any kind of been told that we can blame this is not a good situation this is not good and at some point I think we have to fix or immigration laws in a way that again are\nAre much more common sense in the sort of\nSort of ridiculous since we have now are going on on the border\nUm uh\nThe I think the concern that everyone has ever is that okay there's twelve or Thirteen or fourteen thousand people we have to deal with it and\nUh everybody wants to be discern everybody's concerned about the mandatory aspects when a lot of my course here's what they're concerned with okay if they get in if it's Fifteen thousand gets in the next one is going to be a hundred and fifty thousand and you're not going to be able to\nStop that either because we'll never get a wall up in time and even if you have a while to get a hundred and fifty thousand people and it's just a lot of people so um are you in favor of the president taking action\nNow to stop these are this a mob caravan from bomb rushing\nThe border and coming in are you in favor of stopping them from coming in now\nYes yes I mean it's it's I mean this is a matter\nOf national security or it is a matter of precedent um and again this comes back to it was at a normal American will say hey you know we understand people want to come to the United states but there is a legal process [noise] um and we're gonna\nHave to we're going to have to follow that legal process you know we we think that legal process sees me apply to all immigrants and you and you're exactly right John this would set a precedent that could really be damaging\nTo the United states' security to our policies into our rule of law or you're right if the if we just allow everybody in we're actually sort of acknowledging that open borders is what we want if we don't follow the rule of law and they don't stop these these migrants sadly we we have to stop 'em now from coming in and set a precedent\nDenver at about a\nAbout five or ten minutes the U.S government is going to release the new economic numbers or GDP expected to grow again this quarter at so over four percent that could be four point one four points to four point three Obama's kind of name was charging along in about a half a percent growth\nGrowth unprecedented where do you look for in that report in ... which includes you think you might draw out\nIt on the economy general recommend\nWell the thing I first I'm going to look for [laughter]\nIt's just because I got on this stuff is I'm going to look at the specific whatever report that I have I Want to look at the number of jobs are based on that are open right now and I look at Virginia but I also see where we're going as far as an unemployment but GDP Growth I'm going to look at manufacturing I'm looking at agriculture\nI Love looking into the numbers and see where that grow up there and we're continuing on this line John\nIf we're continuing with the lowest unemployment claims in forty nine years of her continuing with Los minority unemployment or for continuing which Haiti he grows four percent of every quarter of what you know is amazing ah at the new normal was too I mean this is pretty incredible\nThe jobs are format worse opportunities zones can be leverage here in the in the commonwealth a ... and opportunities\nZone investment all the things that we look at to encourage opt entrepreneurship to encourage people keeping their own money is working and that's what I'm going to look at it this report is is this just a continuation of this amazing amazing surge or are we seeing and even more positive future for the people in the fifth\nDistrict but also in the United states and then the commonwealth of Virginia\nI think we are I think you're just seeing the beginning of this economic boom and um I I'm\nReally just really excited to see what those numbers say based on what job growth much sectors are growing right now\nWhat's going to be interesting to see these are coming out momentarily we expect that or we're going to get over four percent growth and it's really really tough for a Democrat right now to talk about economics the economy or any of the issues that pertain to jobs and prosperity in America so they'd rather talk about something else that's why your opponent\nLovely Coburn is talking about your Halloween costumes 'cause he doesn't want to talk about the economy she doesn't want to talk about job she doesn't want to talk about growth should want to talk about kids moving out of the basement she doesn't want to talk about the boom and small businesses\nJust want to talk about the deregulation she doesn't want to talk about the number of investments that are going on because of the tax\nCut especially as it relates to one hundred percent deduction of capital investments\nRob doesn't even understand that and so she doesn't want to talk about any ... any of that she'd rather\nTalk about your Halloween costume in two thousand five\nYeah and I mean which I Will not take down off the net by the way so here's what you would rather talk about you'd rather talk about ... trillion dollars in spending not only for Medicare for all but also for forgetting student debt right which is one point for a trillion dollars right now free community college for our free college for all everything she said and even in debate she's like I Want to give away this\nShe doesn't understand the taxpayer money is what you're using I get so limited based on what I fought for you know and government overreach she says she loves government I fear government I think government should be limited I think government should be a fish and he's also said the taxpayer money for the middle class\nIs nothing more than confetti she compared\nEyes to the Nazis I mean I I find it's a stunning job get anybody would vote for laissez\nHer views are great for San Francisco and maybe a three square mile area there or somewhere up in Georgetown right in DC but for the fifth district it's absolutely

MSNBC or any of these other foreign left and they are now they're just they're just propaganda machines\nAnd I think at some point ah that's going to break through that you have comments you have this

conservative values but I represent what the fifth wants to do right now and that's why we're going to win this\nFederal regulation I Want to thank you for being with us what's your website\n[noise]
