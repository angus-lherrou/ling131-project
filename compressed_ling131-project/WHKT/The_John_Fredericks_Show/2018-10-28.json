yesterday and they'll change it again tomorrow\nAs more fashion come out\nDon't understand what they're saying the president has changes but to just have a position he's waiting for the fact that the

[noise]\n\n\nOn the job from his radio network where with congressman Republican Robert May represent the district of Virginia He's running for reelection he's the chairman of the subcommittee on sleep are running for the United states that will be decided number of respect his challenger Democrat\nYou Williams congressman let me ask you this ah\nThe evolving story of the Saudis it's now clear this was a premeditated murder this guy got chopped up and uh\nBasically got out of there and some kind of doggie bags and they buried him in the garden or something the whole thing is it just a horrible situation but look a\nCrown prince Mohammed bin Salman the administration's but a lot of things in this guy Jared Kushner has and a lot of people are saying you know maybe this guy's just incompetent capable of\nRunning the country everything he touches turns to crap whether it's the Yemeni civil war that's a disaster the gang of four embargo against the state of guitar that backfired and blow up in their face guitars better off today than they were\nNow we've got this thing where they range of story night time\nIt's clear that uh the show was brutally murdered it's clear that it was premeditated it's clear that uh that I think the crown prince knew about that a MPs Mohammed bin Salman a\nBank I think have a lot to answer for and I think they have to be held accountable so I Do think that there has to be significant penalties if they suffer I Do think to the question has to be asked is like does the United\nStates believes that it can carry on and continue relationship with Saudi Arabia which I Do think we need to but can that be with the crown prince I think that's a pretty compelling question I think the administration is going to have to ask that I think Congress will eventually addressed that\nAn asset to you know what we'll be the penalties are to uh to Saudi Arabia I listen I understand the impact of those uh those contracts for what we're doing\nTo supply a military uh equipment to Saudi Arabia I think Saudi Arabia I can be a like a a force\nThat is is a is a is an ally to us in the in the middle east but I don't think that it can it can be that\nType of ally that we want him that we need if this is how they're going to operate I mean we asked you know we have principles in the United states that we that we stand by and our allies have to have to abide by those and I just don't see Saudi\nArabia doing that you know you you pointed out the issue with Yemen too and you and I have talked about that before I those are all questions I think that come up and how we see Saudi Arabia\nOperating in the region house policies being played out and are are they are they doing the things necessarily\nIn that region\nOr that create stability and that and that are working in the in the best interest\nOf all involved not just Saudi Arabia but uh\nOther allies in the middle east and listen I I I understand what they're doing to to push back against the Iranian but are are they doing things that in the long term about moving the middle east at the right direction I think those are questions that we have to ask ... foreign policy standpoint and I think that us\nPolicy toward Saudi Arabia you know needs to needs to be directed by those I think very\nA very sobering issues that we have to for us\nSo it seems like congressman Whitman ah we're in total agreement and it seems like what you're saying is the best way to solve this is a four crown prince MPs recovered than solving to maybe a step aside for someone else had his father put somebody else in their final question I\nOnly have half a minute and I got to get your weather out so very quickly um is there going to be a vote in Congress on our involvement in the Yemeni civil war and

Godzilla\nOf the truth in America boy that nonsense going on up there every day got a people I compete with homosexual people they just get up every day they read the paper you got the fake news you've got fake pose we've had a fake poll yesterday from the Washington Post is unbelievable I mean the Washington Post like when did they can learn\nLike they don't want to alert people say well what are they going to change a pony methodology to get it right never because they don't want to get it right because it's not about\nIt accurate poll it's about the poll driving fake news to get a fake narrative\nTo draw the conclusion that's all it is it's all on\nThe washer posed actually putting out a poll yesterday actually putting out a poll showing Barbara Comstock\nTrailing Jennifer ... than in the ... district like Thirteen points now there is no way that western had the thirteenth\nPoint lead over bar because it's like every in journal poll that I have seen on top stock every German poet has paid for and a lot of money shows this race a dead heat or Comstock\nSlightly ahead and the Washington Post has got Tom start down by Thirteen this is a complete and utter\nLie and it's beyond fake news and it is and it's beyond\nArgument it's beyond the national Enquirer what they tried to do they think top starch so much they want that seat so bad they want the liberal do nothing Jennifer watched it in there so bad they can taste it they want their\nLeft us in that seat so much that they will actually conducted poll make things up\nDoing in such a way to get results that they want so they could put it out there and say the races over don't give them top start getting money and don't work for her it's a lost cause so they do affect poll\nIn order to do think it's unbelievable nobody in that district\nIs gonna look you in the eye and say that they think that general Washington has a Thirteen point lead this racist tied\nAnd I think Tom's started going to win for the Washington Post doesn't care do not own up to any of this uh neither one of the New York times or ABC News directly or MSNBC or any of the polling company is that right to do with a fake news\nAnd that's what they are it's think it's the fake news network and it's designed to drive in conclusion too\n\nIf you're in the tent district go volunteer\nCops like she is going to win this race if you get out and help her but they already on a daily basis and that's why the president says it's fake news and then he says it's an enemy of the people when you walk out\nOf the people and masquerading as a legitimate news network was that legitimate poll is right now\nThe enemy how would you just find that\nThis poll for the post the\nAstronaut that even ... most staunchest supporters\nThink it's a joke because they know it's not true so what do they just let me just ask you a question if they're\nPutting out purposely putting out the information driving it so that the snake is that not an enemy and the people it's certainly in hey it's an enemy the truth mainly the president needs to change one word\nIt's an enemy of the truth it's certainly an enemy of fact\nIt is unbelievable they're doing it again they did it in two thousand sixteen and they're doing it again things word\nNothing you know ready to Germany the Democrats have to learn nothing from two thousand sixteen the legacy media hasn't learn nothing in fact what they're doing now is they can't believe they were wrong and so they're doubling down and here's the thing if the Republicans don't relinquish the house\nThe legacy media after two elections in a row going all in for the Democrats and losing them both on a federal level will become irrelevant this district for them are so high that will become a relevant\nI'm\n'cause I certainly tell you the truth good bad or ugly\nThere'll be relevant say are doubling and tripling down on moral\nOn more fake polls and more fake news again\nShould drive the result they want on election day again and it's going to backfire\nOn them and get\n\n'em they actually think that somebody semi pipe bombs or don't go off at like a change the trajectory the election\nGeneral life we're going to get an economic report coming\nForty five minutes that are trying to show another over four percent GDP Growth\n\nAnd their banking on hatred of the Trump and somebody sending pipe bombs adult go wash targeted at Democrats had already been influencing anything right now it's very bizarre it's very the whole thing is very suspicious and it's very bizarre\n\nRight now if you're a national Democrat here's what you have to deal with mobs and caravans and you're running against Republicans who are for jobs in country mobs versus jobs in ... versus ...\nAnd events\nAt a clip of Fifteen thousand just coming in and getting food clothing shelter education hospital care and well let's just open up our\nOur if if they really think that having tens of thousands of illegal storming the country is trying to help them get elected you know see what they were hoping for is a couple of thousand with kids and babies and they'd be separated then it would be chaos\nAnd Trump would be a meaning and he put troops there they'd have bayonets and everybody will be outrage\nAnd he's gotta go instead it has backfired they can't control\nIt a thousand people

doubled down you know now it's not big for that you know that they're trying to portray me as crazy based on I guess Halloween costumes and you know me John I have a good time so\nIf they it's just it's amazing that last week she pretty much apologizes for marginalizing veterans says she's going to stick to issues then she puts out a commercial\nA Colombian extremist and trying to make fabricated things up again this is what the left does their own hands it's desperate ploy by desperate candidates and that's why common sense back that's right conservatism is back and that's where I'm going to win the fifth\nComing back and I'm your commander of commonsense Dennis ... without running for Congress district Virginia let's get to the caravan I'm the president with my leading today things are going to deploy\nA thousand troops you go to a series of executive orders that would stop the caravan from coming into the United states the problem is that soon as they step forward and say the word asylum we can't do anything or ... one of the loop\nHoles in them Denver are written in such a way that all they have to do is get a toe in\nGet their hand grab\nAnd say asylum and then we can't do anything they cannot go back what are you seeing the president's proposed action here if you're in Congress now what would Denver Riggleman be proposing on the terror that\nWell you know we're a rule of law and uh we're we're we're a nation of laws and we believe in the rule of law and the way the laws were written right now you're exactly right John I don't know you know how we we don't honor that based on what we believe us conservatives in rural and and people who follow the rule of law however\nI think Congress needs to start fixing these immigration laws as soon as possible\nAnd I also believe once that happens are vetting process for any of these people that are coming through has to be extreme vetting\nUh we do have some of the technology in place now but we don't put time limits on this if there's that\nMany people that are headed towards the border uh we don't know what's invented in those and John my biggest fear um it's easy you know it's like a Trojan Horse right listen Ninety five percent Ninety nine percent of those people could actually be seeking asylum um those that you know our hearts\nSort of go out to ... with compassion however if you have people inside there that are bad actors and they're able to hide you know within this caravan\nAssets down range I think we're going to be monitoring him I guess as I can only speculate right now my guess is we'll have joint operations but Mexico on monitoring this caravan of seeing any type of emissions that are coming out of there\nTalking about radio emissions or any kind of into that we can blame this is not a good situation this is not good and at some point I think we have to fix our immigration laws in a way that again are are\nMuch more common sense than the sort of sort of ridiculous unless we have now are going on on the border\nUm the\nI think the concern that everyone has Denver is that okay there's twelve or Thirteen or fourteen thousand people we have to deal with it and\nUh everybody wants to be concerned everybody's concerned about the humanitarian aspect but a lot of my color here's what they're concerned with okay if they get in\nIf this Fifteen thousand to get then the next one's going to be a hundred and fifty thousand and you're not gonna be able to stop that either because we'll never get a wall up in time and even if you have a while you got a hundred and fifty thousand people have a lot of people [noise] so um are you in favor of the president taking action\nNow to stop the these are this a mob caravan from palm rushing the border and coming in are you in favor of stopping them from coming in now\nYes yes I mean it's it's I\nMean this is a matter of national security or it is a matter of precedent um and again this comes back to it was a normal American will say hey\nYou know we understand people want to come to the United states but there is a legal process [noise] um and we're gonna have to we're going to have to file that legal process you know and we we think that legal process needs to be applied all immigrants and you and you're exactly right John this would set a precedent that\nCould really be damaging to the United states' security\nTo our policies into our rule of law uh you're right if the leaders allow everybody in we're actually sort of acknowledging that open borders is what we want if we don't follow the rule of law and we don't stop these these migrants sadly we we have to stop 'em now from coming in and set a precedent Denver\nAbout a in about five or ten minutes the U.S government is going to release the new economic numbers or GDP expected to grow again this quarter at\nSo over four percent could be four point one four points to four points off a bomb in kind of name was chugging along in about a half percent growth means it's gross unprecedented where do you look for in that report\nIn ... which can close and you think you might draw out of it on the economy gender recommend\nWell the thing that first I'm going to look for [laughter] and it's just because I'm\nA geek out on this stuff is I'm going to look at the specific whatever report that I have I'm going to look at the number of jobs are based on that are open right now and I look at Virginia but I also see what we're going as far as employment but GDP Growth I'm going to look at manufacturing I'm look at agriculture I Love looking into the numbers and see where that growth is\nAnd if we're continuing on his mind John ever continuing with the lowest unemployment claims and forty nine years of her continuing\nQuarter which you know is amazing a it's a new normal was too I mean this is pretty incredible\nOr if you're looking at all these numbers I think right now what you're saying is that the tax cuts word of the jobs are poor Mak works opportunities zones can be LeBron's here in the in the commonwealth\n... and opportunities on investment all the things that we looked at to encourage opt entrepreneurship to encourage people keeping their own money\nIs working and that's what I'm gonna look at it this report is is this just a continuation of this amazing amazing surge or are we seeing an even more positive future for the people enough that district but also in the United states and then the commonwealth of Virginia I think we are I think you're just seeing the beginning of this economic boom\nAnd um I I'm really just really excited to see what those numbers say based on my job growth on one sectors are growing right now\nWhat kind of interesting to see these are coming out momentarily we expect that that we're going to get over four percent growth and it's really really tough for a Democrat\nRight now they're talking about economics the economy or any of the issues that pertain to jobs and prosperity in America so they'd rather talk about something else that's why your opponent lovely Coburn is talking about your Halloween\nCostume because he doesn't want to talk about the economy she doesn't want to talk about job she doesn't want to talk about growth doesn't want to talk about kids moving on to the basement she doesn't want to talk about the boom and small businesses just want to talk about the deregulation doesn't\nWant to talk about the number of investments that are going on because of the tax cut especially as it relates to one hundred percent deduction\nOf capital investments Rob doesn't even understand it and so she doesn't want to do it any any of that she'd rather talk about your Halloween costume in two thousand five\nYeah and I mean which I Will not take down off the net by the way so here's what you would rather talk\nAbout she'd rather talk about forty million dollars in spending not only for Medicare for all but also for forgiving student debt right which is one point for a trillion dollars right now free community college for our free college for all everything she said it even a debate she was like I Want to give away this she doesn't understand the taxpayer money is what you're using I get so limited\nBased on what I fought for you know in government overreach she says she loves government I feared government I think government should be limited I think government should be a fish and she's also said that taxpayer money for the middle class is nothing more than confetti\nShe's compared eyes to the Nazis I mean I I find that just stunning John get anybody would vote for Leslie\nHer views are great for San Francisco and maybe a three square mile area there or somewhere up in Georgetown right in DC but for the fifth district it's absolutely appalling\nThat she thinks these values are actually a political to the people the fair about every day and work for a living\nAnd don't give a rat's with the chattering class is saying on CNN or MSNBC or any of these other far left and then they are now they're just they're just propaganda machines and I think at some point ah that's going to break through that you have comments you have this coalition of common sense\nProgressive ... and I think that's what's happening in the ... district and we're going to witness John because\nI represent American values I represent conservative values but I represent with us\n\n[noise] [noise]\n[noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [laughter]\nAbsolute shore positive no doubt absolutely don't worry\nIt when for the
