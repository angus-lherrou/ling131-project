arguments you resort to this kind of thing which means you have no arguments so it's very very bad\nFor the Democrats but I really think that they have they disgraced themselves and so when I think when Trump cracks a joke like that similarly your average American sees it as a joke and enjoys it ah I really think that we've never seen a the beltway elites as out of touch with middle America never never in our history and it's just a dramatic\nDivided clearer than it's ever been\nWell then the kind of like the one you know the president is focusing on folks like Eric Holder Hillary

somebody is organizing this paying for it funding it\nThere's food there's water there's clothing their shoes somebody's paying for that\nWe can only conjecture right out of the facts on it but what

...\nBack you're on the job for these radio network more than seven million people have already voted in the midterm elections and it looks like the turnout is up for Republicans Democrats and independents are like now\nThe fake news has to report this was a true\nBut the kind of spinning\nThis going to be fun next twelve days at the Democratic blue wave crumbles to nothing because the Republicans are going to hold the house now I'm convinced of it by five and they're going to gang five seats in the Senate fires the number to remember by Democrats\nLose five seats in the Senate\nFive that number go play it on the power ball by five five hot you're good [noise]\nSo uh so far more people likely to vote Republican are thought to have cast ballots [noise] but uh the New York times is telling you oh I'm trying to get Bush or don't joining inclusion it's still good for the Democrats even Republican turnout it's bigger than ever in the early voting precinct\nThat's an anomaly they say look at our polls\nWe have every Democrat winning everywhere and history of ever\n[noise] the um [noise] meantime the to show the affair um\nSee aren't you glad I covered this stuff right you don't want it to blow it under the carpet and it didn't matter and then and I say it was a big deal and then I covered for two weeks straight non stop\nAnd now look it's a bigger mess than ever that's why you join me in\nAnd not to fake news right [noise] so what's happening with this so uh yesterday the crown prince of Saudi Arabia who seems to be responsible for this Mohammed bin solving who was incompetent that I'm I'm just going to say if the guys are confident that\nTrump's problem with this guy and Jared Kushner's problem with the thirty three year old ... crown princes you simply incompetent so now they don't trust them I don't know about Jared I've no idea but I don't think the president ... trust them I don't think he believes them and I don't think his cabinet\nAnd here's the problem with Trump when he doesn't think you're confident then you're in big trouble if we can deal with the not trusting thing he can like navigators way through that but if he thinks you're not confident forget it you're done and that's I think that's the conclusion the president is drawing\nA day they tore though John eighty four five six for six if you want to comment on fake paws fake news fake narrative coming out of the legacy media\nThat's all it's all fake [noise]\nUh meantime a single ticket holder in South Carolina we understand one the mega ... million ... million dollar jackpot billions of dollars one point six billion with a one time\nCash option a nine hundred and Thirteen points seven million I think I take that\nWhere do you think you're getting the shot measuring getting\nThe ticket and like you see the numbers and you're you read the numbers the bottom and got that one got that one got that one got that one got time when I'm On my God I just wanted one point six bill\nWhere do you think about that like I don't think we'd be on the radio the next [laughter] I'd probably finish out through the election and that would be it then there'd be like see you'd never hear or see for me again\nThe president called NBS is a cover up the worst cover up ever like the Keystone Cops President Trump says it's the worst cover up Everest\nDisaster now they've found pieces of the body skewed buried in the garden of the conflict I mean you just can't get dumber than it\nThey botched every this is a complete macho Reno and when the president said the worst cover up ever well here's here's what you draw from that he met we talk to Gina Haspel who went to\nIts Danville jerky or CIA director you have to assume that uh she gave him enough information for him to make the statement\nThe worst cover up ever which means you gave her information that the Saudis tried to cover it up\nAnd it's inconceivable to anybody would have a brain in their head that Mohammed bin Salman was not calling the shots so to simply say ... wrote people got a rise ridiculous they planned that they had body doubles their they blow it and the guys incompetent because everything he touches the disaster\nSimple\nAnd the president's going to react when that follow the facts come out by pulling visas and putting various sanctions are those who are involved\nAs he should\nBut I think the relationship with the Saudis going forward or is not going to be based on some grand relational a reality between Jared Kushner and Mohammed bin Salman I think\nPresident Trump is probably done with this guy we're not going to change anything it's not going to affect the arms sales balance of power in the middle east\nWe're not going to cancel treaties or pull out a deal but I think going forward it's going to be very difficult for President Trump to take Mohammed bin Salman seriously because I Believe after the series of that scene I Believe he is just simply incompetent\nJohn Curtis radio network trucking the truth everyday right here you're Godzilla of the truth and America\nYou're got jealous of the truth in America you're commander

eight eight eight for eight oh five six\nFor six yesterday John Bolton are going to Moscow meeting with a Russian President Putin I guess you could call him a president that title although it seems to have been there an awful long time [noise]\nAnyway John Bolton the U.S national\nSecurity advisor met with a Russian President Vladimir Putin's in Moscow speaking at a news conference after the talks yesterday Bolton said Washington wants to withdraw from a key nuclear weapons control treaty with Russia\nSince it was confident a Moscow it violated the now President Trump has said over the weekend that he was done with\nThis treaty because we're hearing to it and\nThe Russians are not now this dream is not what the Chinese or there's nothing to do with them\nAlthough the president did say what he renegotiated\nHe wanted to get the Chinese involved but that separate this treaty was signed all the way back by Mikhail Gorbachev and Ronald Reagan back in the day and the U.S into was saying\nThat the Russians are not coming clean it hearing to the terms of the nuclear treaty\nSo they're violating it and of course the U.S plays by the rules remember what Ronald Reagan said trust but verify now here's what Trump is saying we don't trust you and we verified that you're cheating\n\nSo if you're cheating then we're done he says we're not going to be taken advantage of we're not going to be hearing to a treaty that you're cheating out to our disadvantage so we're not\nGoing to a new one will do a new one but you're out\nThe training was outmoded and it was being violated by other countries John Boehner said on for his part said Russia was sometimes surprised but what he said were unprovoked actions by the United states against Mark Kelly also poked fun at the official\nThat's our original Thirteen states in\nOne talent and an olive branch what thirty dollars and the other and he says I have a question Mr bolt how's your ego picked up all the all of a sudden only has arrows has your ego\nDropped all the all is it only has arrows left no fault and said you're cheating it's very simple you're cheating\n\nDimitri Pesca off the Kremlin spokes person that's an oxymoron\nSaid Moscow did not want the u._s. do and the INS treaty as there were no prospects for a substitute agreement let's go to the phone lines where we have colonel Mike in West Virginia Joe Manchin countries up by twelve colonel Mike in that race is over matches going to win\nJohn I don't know I mean you know you want me to repeat what happened in many right eye beach the

insurmountable lead\nYou don't want to call today John do you have sort of all I Want to tell you I don't want to get into the show the story is you're on politics but I'm really curious\nHow come Donald Trump is not in Virginia hoping ... stock or Corey Stewart whatever what's going on why are they not here\nWell uh let's see number one the vice President Kennedy campaign for Scott Taylor tomorrow vice president Pence was here on Saturday campaigning\nFor a day brat in the seventh and Ryan McAdams and the poor Corey Stewart can't when\nThere's about nine Senate seats that are in place door does not one of them so why would you come here and do or rally and waste time uh and it's very tough to do a rally when you can only affects one congressional district right so\nLike when you're in a rich man last year I mean when the election was armed with a rich may yeah everybody down there\nYou really I'm shooting because last year I applied for\nBecause the last year a Virginia was still in play when I was chairman although we were losing their state it was still a battle ground state we had money we had ... resources and the campaign a Trump campaign still looked at Virginia yeah\nAs a battleground state that they had a chance to when\nThey do not think they can win the seat against Tim\nKaine and so it's tough to devote a rally here with the president or for a congressional right so that's why\nComstock what's happening in a user you talk about stuff I think she's going to win so you're putting in the ... plus one two three what number plus one plus one yeah well that's it now or one yeah I've been talking about what the looking like he's gonna win\n[noise]\nAnd I'm I'm more than three\nI'm going to buy I'm gonna go I'm going to take you are going to

J. a fan I think that's super so a good luck to you\nI Know I got to get Bruce baton involved in our maggot network radio investment team [laughter] and nobody's fired a\nPeaceful I just I talked to him earliest quite up right and and now I'm part upstate but I Want to talk about your rates are going to do politics and policy okay let's start with politics a recent polling I've seen an ad history shows you down by about eight how do you when\nWe when certainly by doing the things that we're going you know John one of those polls do show and I love the way your character right there earlier you know we're calling heart damage for the for is that what we're getting\nAt about sixty percent Clinton is that you're not going to vote for an or they're undecided um and that's very telling you know I had to individual call the campaign office on Saturday in one of my staffers picked up the phone it said what do you want to talk to him\nOn them and the guy said sure so I picked up the high surf because this is really the candidate might absolutely he goes you know I got to tell you something I'm a Democrat\nAnd I probably don't agree on Ninety percent of the issues in six years I've never been able to talk Custer I call you once I pick up the cannon uh pick out and start talking to them you have my vote and that's what we're hearing this\nI'm Custer you know under her or never watch the opium got worse on it it's crazy you know she has a stand up for the immigration issues that are important to be on the shirt so we feel that we have a target rich environment we're reaching out that under that directly with the with the voters\nOutlook I I think there is an under current Republican vote out there you look Steve Negron right now you should have a little bit of springing your step because you're looking at the early voting returns and they are up dramatically in Republican precinct strongholds\nThat means that Republicans are motivated they're excited also independence up\nNot a good sign for the Democrats on the Democratic strongholds her up also but Republicans up more more that's been the issue in\nIn the midterms from day one can you get the Trump voters out\nAnd we're on independence go and it seems that there's a trend that could be looking like they're going towards Republicans\nBecause as the president is saying right now the ... the Trump agenda is jobs the Democratic agenda is mobs and invading caravans that's basically the choice that people have okay so it sounds like you're districts in\nPlay let's get to politics let's let's start with the caravan\nTen thousand strong now coming into the United states or Mexico with appears incapable of stopping it\nThe laws are such steam when you get to the border if you step foot over the border a it's a catch and release there are laws that protect miners families with minors they can't be sent back in Ninety nine percent of them ended up staying in the U.S so\nThey break one while but then other laws protect them the president has said he might deploy the military why Steve Negron solution\n[noise] well actually you know you don't you're not that you want to categorize character in Beijing about what you have that many people are coming into our borders you know we have a fundamental responsibility in the president's national security strategy right the four pillars of it the first one is to protect the American people and that's what he's going to do and if we have to do for the military down there\nTo provide that sort of protection I'm all for it you know there are people that don't want to come here um and all of the laws of the land and do what's right way\nThat I'm all for it you know but we know that that that group of ten thousand you know you think that they all the math on their own and decided on one day to start marching for what am I I don't think so so I Believe that what the president's doing you know what he's saying\nI'm all for it of course I'm a representative Custer says you know just open the order that everybody in the book sorted out afterwards it's not the right way of protecting the American\nPeople and people resume didn't want that and I think you don't want this sort of high pressure show differences between Democrats and we want to fundamentally a letter I mean that that are allowed to come in the right way and all those people that aren't you know you've got to wait until we forgot who you are\nWell the reality of the saying is if you let ten thousand in the next wave is going to be a hundred thousand because certainly becomes a magnet now but I Want to get the specifics what specifically directly\nYou want to specifically tanks they've\nActually well I ... oh and you know first of all you're going to put this is unbelievable pressure on on a U.S border and crossed the border patrol agents that are down there right now I'm sure they're going to need some assistance you know they're not going to be able to actually process and do what they need to do and all those people and I would have the state department I'm John getting on on the line and talking to all those countries that\nThese people are Traverse City I'm starting with Mexico working my way back all the way to go walk them all up and say you know what this is a sense of the way we need to do things the president talked about\nI'm receiving some um that to those countries\nAre they're they're coming from so I Would absolutely the points of military down there to augment um the border the border patrol they're the ones that are the lead agent on there that are the ones that have responsibility but we cannot let them I'm hanging out there and waiting on the vine\nTo those kinds of things with the president is doing right now is absolutely on the right thing and you know what it will will show you that we have to put up a temporary barrier\nTo provide to protect it that we need to this country and we have to\n[noise]\nNews

them but he's the\nHe started a new political action committee citizens for the American republic I'm really fired up about Sam Nunberg will be with us that a nine to five so don't want to miss that now there's not a lot of days left so you got to do what you got to do right not a lot of days\nBut only twelve let's get you a few tax that I always promised ... let's see I get to a couple of them carrying Virginia Beach Virginia Beach I thought the better was coming out an eight thirty five is becoming on later don't know\n\nHe was scheduled to come on and we're trying to find [noise] uh let's see for the mechanics mills took about a caravan how about a caravan of Seventy seek buses lined up in the border let them see this and tell them that we have a free ride back to where they came from\nGreyhound you'll get you there faster leave the driving up that's what we want to do is just get like every greyhound bus just pay for it get 'em all down there they got bathrooms and stuff\nOver those double decker buses that they have now right you can get those\nYeah when we were expecting Steven eight thirty five evidently he got tied up and hopefully he'll be on you know tomorrow or later on today but it's not something that's happened especially with twelve days out\nWe don't get the phone lines gene [laughter] rejects that gene run here maybe John how are you today never better\nI Want to I Want to talk about a couple of times it's a you mentioned uh recently you know during our last phone call about to Mexican wall\nWith Donald Trump kept his promise that Mexico was going to pay for the wall then\nWe wouldn't be a talk and have this conversation now and uh Mexico is not paying for the wall\nBecause although Trump passing agreement with Mexico and Canada to renegotiate NAFTA or that that agreement has to be approved by Congress overnight worth of papers running an old and I think it's very interesting that the Republicans\nHave the agreement but they're the habit loop in Congress on on a passing it and I think there's a story they are the reasons that uh Paul Ryan did not there's not many schools with the degree that the Trump has\nPaid on paper but it has to be ratified by Congress or it's just it's just it's just a piece of paper\nSo Mexico's not paying the nickel for the wall and if the\nTrump kept his promises and ah got the million dollars from Mexico than we would have a wall or we have one started as we wouldn't have to worry about this uh these people are coming up here\nOr if until we get a wall if we could put sanctions on any employer hiring illegal immigrants know that'll send them home to if they're not about to do that and uh just that there's something else you know that um [noise] you know this this is not a true\nIn a victory for the Republicans\nA\nNovember the six\nAnd a I don't see any polls that that are that are very prompts here at all for Comstock looked like called the ones that I could access the closest one of those six percent of the problem is is that Comstock man and a trailer and rats\nThey can't bring truck into Virginia Trump is radioactive Virginia\nAnd there's a reason for that and I don't think there's anything done by Donald Trump to rectify that since he's been in a in the White House\nSo you know I Would have gone to a bar the Comstock the best thing she could do but the truth to\nPower down at the White House right down the street and I asked our truck to come up there and ... campaign for her why why not you know a lot of ... it was I was a big uh Donald Trump supporter and a day brown is Donald Trump white man's man's now so\nWhy are these people calling that Donald Trump to get some help where they've got a a toss up a\n... writing in the you know in the polls\nAnd one other thing I just want to tell you this you know I watched part of the uh Williams a ... a fancy way is is a live witness debate yesterday you know that the the er the answer about uh\n[laughter] oh joke we are still under Obamacare promise was seven years to repeal and replace it with something better and uh\nThe Republicans have all three branches of government they can't even pass their own version of a truck care or something better than Obamacare and even even that the Congress\nForget to Congress in the crowd seven years promised that Donald Trump on the campaign he was going to take care of every body\nWhich is is easy to go to the watch like the promise of that's been done and November the sex is the day to hold Republicans accountable for their lives in the American people and the biggest promise is affordable\nAdequate health care you can you can put as much money as if people's pockets if you want but health care will take it right\nBack out okay Jean you got a time where okay you got a time limit okay I Can't let you do a monologue for Fifteen minutes here I've been I've been really polite can appreciate your paycheck you\nWere done now let me go let me go backwards number one you're talking about a a bomb of care and the Republicans promise to repeal and replace it they had a better plan they lie to you for seven\nYears Trump they told Trump had a plan they never did now the president understands that Republicans have lied about this for a seven year period", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The John Fredericks Show", "city":
