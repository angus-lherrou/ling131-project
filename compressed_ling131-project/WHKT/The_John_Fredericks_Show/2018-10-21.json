supposed to be starting either today or tomorrow and on Sunday and then they started like two days\nWell John John we wish you the best was Joe Joe the best out in Florida I'm after his Astros took it on the chin last night against the Boston Red Sox I turned it off a little bit early\nI think a turn off in the eighth inning and living with it looked like there was a it was wrapped up there this is Chris accident I Am a filling in I Do this occasionally I'm I'm a former member of the Virginia house of delegates Esther from two thousand two the two thousand ten and currently I'm the executive director of Virginia free\nThe foundation for research and economic education Virginia free is a nonpartisan underlined nonpartisan boldly non partisan or\nA visitor pro business out of the advocacy organization here the comic or not for Thirty years I'm not only a pro business we're also very much a working towards responsible pro business government because as we heard in the\nIn the news updates Mike we heard that China's economy is slowing down its growth and that's a problem we have a significant debt burden and their economy is slowing its growth down there\nYou know you're trying to like be be that guy and that has that has devolved to where we are today largely as a result of several factors\nI'm Wondering the Iraq War out to the collapse of the economy in two thousand and eight and a and that has led to this massive worldwide suspicion of government or what's going on today this unsettled place that we are in this world\nIs not just manifesting itself in the United states we are not alone in this in this in this cultural shift that's manifesting itself in politics\nIt's showing up in Hungary in Poland and in Germany over the weekend in Bavaria which is actually I ran into a [laughter]\nGerman political teacher who we can fancy that right you're going to exchange program I didn't want to go to the vet was like I'm Talking about like I really don't want to go somewhere I watch football I Want to chill out Sunday night it was a great game on or off oh go you'll have fun okay fine subsidies to German teachers\nTrying to have a conversation and thinking I don't know any German right and what are you going to do ... you know you have all the [laughter] house Hitler you know [laughter] you know where do you go with that conversation well it turns out they sing beautiful English they probably better than than we do structurally and uh\nYeah because they're very has their lectures on Sunday it was a very important election in Germany that's the kind of guy and that's what I follow and well this one teacher was upper a teacher of politics so then we went down a rabbit hole two hours later at the dinner table we just we're just we're chewing up politics\nAnd when he was telling me about the very was is that is extremely successful economically it is the richest region of Germany for full employment like three percent unemployment youth unemployment is extremely low or their school system is set up to get people to work straight away\nUm if if you're like a tenth grade and you're not you don't really want to go to university you don't have to fake it to make it you can go right into a a a trade school and apprentice program and you're gonna get a job and you get a diploma so they get them really it's a it's a very work intensive area they\nThey pride themselves culturally\nOn work and productivity an organization and good government right there it was like a it's not like a shining example of how you would want to have a state or region actually be everyone's employed there was a job\nYou have any functions ah and it works well they had this major upset in the very intellectual and you go what are you upset about what what could you possibly be that concerned about\nThat you basically blow up this I don't know\nIf they blow it up but had his major upset in the ruling party that had been has been in control for decades last probably the most ... and the ruling majority in Bavaria and it was stunning to me to realize that we're not immune from that here here in America so people say\nYou know the economy Republicans are the economy's going so great vote for us\nPeople don't vote on yesterday's news they don't vote on today's news\nThey vote on the future where are we going where what is going to be happening that's my fear that's my concern is well things are going well you know\nWith Donald Trump got elected gasoline was about two twenty five a gallon now it's around two eighty a two thousand eight was four dollars a gallon or better but are we getting better are we getting worse\nYou know you hear the China news today about their economy is slowing down its growth rate of growth and that has a factor on the human psyche about how how's it going to manifest itself in my life you see these commercials they're not all about you know skills and here's my dad says there are about this guy's off all she's horrible there ... there but there's no big overriding issue like\nHere's what we're going to do in the future it's just that the other person is really bad therefore they're not going to be good for you um and therefore because the economy's going so well they can hurt the economy I guess this is what they strap relations in the subconscious\nBut I'm going what is the big driving issue other then obviously Donald Trump and it's a fascinating time in American politics a sweater reasons why do what I did because it is so interesting but also to teach people\nAs I used to tell my students I really don't care I'm really don't care [laughter]\nWhat you think I care that you think if I can encourage people to be more interested about what they're talking about to read another article to dig deeper to challenge themselves they will in turn\nI just care that you vote but if you don't vote I understand that's also a vote\nIn itself because you were saying I'm not I'm not doing this I vote none of the above and it's and that's and that's tabulate in it'll aggregate itself just like the vote will and that people do that doesn't make any sense\nActually it does if you don't show up for something the two political parties going to try to get you to show up next time we're trying to reach out to you in some way shape or form that data point will register\nI tell us to a of a family I was at a baseball game with\nAnd they were so upset or you just can't stand out if they haven't earned your vote don't vote and tell them that you don't put it on social media like he would anyone else anything else so I'm not voting you haven't earned\nMy though you haven't got me off my couch off my dogs to go down and say I'm voting for this person you don't register it'll aggregate data\nAnd that raw data collects and is dissected by the political class to determine what they want to do 'em and they're in that in every election that swings on the undecided voter right the independent voter in October it's like oh we're going to\nStop talking about these issues that motivate our base to a degree are going to focus on these oh I'm really happy to work with the other side received this now and in certain kinds I work with the president's wife shows up the polling independence\nThey may not like President Trump but when they agree with something you'd better work with them because that's the because you know all politics is personal not just walk anyway this is Chris action and filling in for John\nCredits if you tuned in to hear me drawing on\nPolitics go who is this guy I'm a former member of the house of delegates I'm filling in for John ... as I Am want to do a as John is on vacation with his son down in Florida in a baseball tournament a John as

McDougal from the Virginia Commonwealth University of Wilder school and Jesse Harris from Iowa was a political operative and ah it was on the Democratic side in from the Republican side from New Hampshire will hear from identity\nAnd Susan slacker or my good friend from the Shenandoah Valley uh we're I'm Susan for you know gosh early nineties I think\nWhen I started aging yourself there Susan\nA Democrat a chair a chair of the Democratic party Virginia\nIs from highland county to county I used to represent and they've known Susan for for decades and so we have we have a great friendship and I\nAnd I'm looking forward to having all these callers calling today stir up the conversation on our big go a little deeper we're going deeper today in politics we're going to go deeper dive in not just you know the ... polling you're talking about numbers but how those posters got to those numbers who are they listening to who are they calling why are they calling because it's a very different\nAbout this they start with a very broad universe um and it keeps coming down to a smaller University of actual likely voters\nMinutes\nAnd we'll get to that we're getting to the nitty gritty we'll we'll get you take you do a deeper dive so when you look at the polls when you got like a real clear politics which which I spend unfortunately way too much time on 'em I guess is healthier than other websites right [laughter]\nThis is the healthy Internet\nAh it's it's a a ... you look at these different polls and and you go like this is to just take a look at the uh the the polls on a generic ballot it's it's insane\nWhat uh what what we're looking at here pulled up its it's fascinating like generic ballot follow this track plus Democrats plus ... Democrats plus five Democrats plus eleven\nDemocrats plus a lot of Democrats plus one what how do you get there you say the polling is wrong well pounds always right it's just data you're collecting the people who call what the differences isn't the methodologies who you're going I talked to one leading I'm\nDemocratic source and I said okay what's your polling showing me and he said\nDemocrats are around mid thirties thirty four thirty three percent thirty two that range Republicans we've never seen self identification for Republicans is while it's around twenty four percent and what used to be you know thirty\nFour thirty four is now thirty four twenty four and independents are up around the lower mid forties because Republicans have never been lower on self identification but we haven't picked up any of those voters they're all self identifying now as independents\nThat is huge and when you get\nDown to it with people when they understand what's really going on that's when they get more excited more engaged this is Chris X. men selling for John Frederick it eight for eight out five six for six stay tuned come on back\nHappy birthday have a beer you know put a picture of us have is her brother with this with the Budweiser tell me that just reminded me so much of my friendship and I'm a black how blessed that wants to have it in my life but also\nA what a what a blessing and it's just to be alive right to be able to uh just to be experienced at all and I'm Wondering is I I enjoy coming in during his radio show is I get to hopefully get people excited about politics that get that does governor lives it is important you know we can't break down we have to work with each other\nTo get good things that we should have the debate though we should have a vibrant vigorous debate that right moves the country forward\nUm and we shouldn't be afraid to have that debate but we should have in a in a civil manner and I think today we see a a a lack of civility more and more and that's difficult\nIn my professional life I Am the executive director Virginia freed the foundation for research and economic education and are or were fibre Wednesday three's the sex and were nonpartisan which is a great lane to be in these days because everyone is\nYou know red or blue and I'm like okay good for you well you know aren't you might not really\n[laughter] they get healthcare so yeah [laughter] what we did was we represent businesses and uh we have a membership and what we tried to do is educate them on politics and as a former teacher and a former business person in my family out of bottled water business for years old a couple of years ago\nA blessed with like um you know I I like getting people excited about learning about politics seeing it differently and what's that makes me do as aren't even deeper like you know when you when you go to teach the subject get better with other subjects you have to really get engaged in the subject\nSo it's an every day I get to learn more and more about politics it's it's a it's a deep interesting topic because it brings in culture\nAnd a economics and history that was a history major so I I get to bring it all together 'cause it manifest itself is Andrew Breitbart said last night last segment you know culture is down politics downstream of culture so if you want to impact culture or the politics impact culture first and foremost suffer your cultural evil\nLeader you'll be you'll be a political year give us a call it eight four to five six for six we got some great guess calling in today are not just constant women but also the leaders of the two major parties here Virginia posters Clinton kid and Robin McDougal\nAnd then two operatives one from Iowa and one from New Hampshire we're only I hate to say this because you're probably sick and tired of elections already in the midterms we are four hundred and Seventy two days away from the Iowa caucuses [noise]\nFour hundred and Seventy two now it seems like a long time but let's be honest as soon as this election is over you're going to start hearing reports back from Iowa and New Hampshire and we're going to be at the forefront of that we're going to get calls in here we're going to shoot up there with us of operatives that Republican and Democrats\nTo see what's going on the ground I think Trump's got the lock on the nomination you never know you never know you never know goodness knows you never know what Donald Trump because um that that that that's that's who knows it actually does what he says it says you can do but you never know what's gonna happen around him and I think that's one of the more interesting parts about politics today is because\nHe's brought that dynamic of ... or what max and that sort of it was if you remember from your\nUh ... days in school or or at work you know when the leader changes and it's like a substitute teacher what's it going to be like your\nYou know you get you get a new boss or whether it's a\nIt's there's just the newness and from since June fifteenth of twenty Fifteen this has been at very different political dynamic are not necessarily unhealthy because it has made us think and react differently and respond differently and I don't think that's necessarily on healthy\nAh but we do have to be ever vigilant to make sure it does not become too unhealthy and I think people are recognizing that we have ah some some discourse in this country\nThat can be improved we can get better at that as a people and how we do that is every day one on one with each other if you want to impact politics if you want better representation be better people sort of comes down to um they represent us and if you want them to be better it's up to us to be better\nSo give us a call and then a forward out five six for six we'll talk about polls goodness knows was more calls and I don't want to do with these days\nThe generic ballot what I pay attention to first and foremost\nI'm average of all the different polls and they break down the individual polls\nI'm now poll should be looking at what are called Elvis likely voters holding companies should have an understanding of who they imagine are going to be showing up on election they should have a pretty good handle on may ... began in Virginia about a month ago so that we should know who's actually voting\nI'm In Virginia in or you can always tell the Arlington because they're the tabulation their uh their absentee ballots are some friends of mine who are tracking that to see what kind of a who's voting relative to the last round of elections to see what the intensity is\nWhen you look at the er the averages of the generic ballot them this is why I Do this is why I Do that in twenty Seventeen when governor Ralph Northam defeated at Gillespie he won by eight point nine three percent a point nine three points\nThe generic ballot on that day was nine point one if I'm trying to instruct the class\nWhat do you want to follow\nFox News Reuters Rasmussen CNBC Emerson Maris Quinnipiac\nWilder pool all a Christian Newport which one do you follow follow generic ballot right now because that that is fairly proximate to what happened\nLast year and the year before and twenty sixteen if you look the generic ballot in twenty sixteen it was very close it was like Todd and Republicans over performed on election day by about a point\nAnd they won and the generic congressional ballot I'm obviously Trump lost by about three points a nationally three million votes um so that's something to consider when you're saying okay we're just going to go I think\nI think the the objective view here is look at the generic ballot look at the average and you can pretty much extrapolate where it is right now\nIs election day were held today and because on that basis it it takes away the the partisan lines you might have or a would be inclined to shift at nine point one percent the dams won by eight point nine nine point one point nine that's very close\nAnd they are at seven point six right now it is safe to assume that they will not perform as well as they did and twenty Seventeen but still will win and likely when the house\nOf representatives given the the dynamics in the Senate very different because the individual races likely that Republicans a hold on to the Senate what's the dynamic that if the Democrats have the house and the senator that Republicans have the Senate\nWas going to have the next two years and that's how you can sort of figure out\nWhere this thing is going so that you can understand what you need to do or not to like myself I don't watch cable news I don't watch broadcast news every papers in the morning ... times Wall Street journal and I get mine on information was going on in the economy and politics and culture and whatnot\nAnd then leave it alone don't listen to you know the the uh the national talk radio shows I go to work right you know I I thought with my eyes I see what's going on and I think most votes\nMSNBC it's a very small subset of the American population but they're the they're the most active voters they are the their the activists so those shows are pretty much you're broadcasting to the activists about what they want to hear about the all the messaging points that they're they they they're supposed to repeat so when you watch when you go to Facebook\nOr Twitter or Snapchat or Instagram or whatever they're very different social media platforms you see the replica repetition of the message and you're like wow I'd I'd go to a town hall I forgot to like a congressional panel much of my friends get up there is now in Congress there were ...\nI watch them and take questions from the audience is like where do you still see formation it's fundamentally wrong but they're really upset\nI mean angry not pleasant not understanding but what\nDo they show up for the last show up because they're angry they are concerned but more important than like anyone else in the world they just wanted to hurt right how important is that in a conversation to hear what the other person is is really feeling it get down to okay\nWhat is up what what is what is making you got to say oh 'cause there's no no no that's that's the operative subject matter [noise] what is triggering this fear and when you get down into the into the nuts and bolts you you really can understand\nWhy people do what they do and hopefully get them to a better place than station life and it's not easy to do but it's a it's it's what we do it in a democracy in the public and form a democracy which we have\nIn America thank God I'm so we can just live more peacefully amongst each other governors self self governance I think it's really important a historical and concepts and I think we've lost sight of that a little bit it's easy to uh but more importantly it's up for for folks to point out to be like what we can do better\nYou can do better calm down we got this I mean are are you have too many TV channels at night\nDo you have too many options are there too many restaurants and grocery stores around you\nIs it too good are you afraid you're gonna lose all this mean it's it's crazy how good life isn't suburban America um rural America has a lot of challenges growing challenges urban America

you the best down there even though you're Astros lost John to the Bo Sox the Boston Red Sox tough break to break\nA perception filling in for the vacation John products call in eight four five six for six right now we've got on the line\nA doctor quaint and kids from ... University of Washington Center for public policy call and ask a question it eight for eight oh five six for six or do they call them talking about his polling and of course her Newport university\nUm I think one of the most accurate or posting polling operations in the in the world and you can do a great job as Clinton they're right here is hey Clinton how are you man\nRight and that's and that's what that's what campaigns they followed that means they follow you you look at the\nThe cross tabs in the in the polls and they go okay I've got a problem with um women between the ages of twenty five and forty five ... don't go there on crime let's just say you know and then they know structure their messages according to be or if they have high positives for for their opposition go trying to attack the attack as to bring down\nThe positives and bring up their negative is to have an outcome\nIn the elections are you having more difficult time getting people\nWe're not we're not having any more difficult to time than we had been having 'em in the years leading up to um today\nSo Virginia is about two thirds cell\nPhone mostly or cell phone only users and so our sample we we actually draw samples of cell phone numbers and so we do quotas on her cellphone versus landline sample so we basically go into the field with about a two third one third cellphone landline split already\nUm and we haven't found our response rate on cell phones to be any different than it has been which is\nNot great um you know people typically aren't taking cell\nPhone calls to do surveys like they were landline calls in the seventies to do surveys show we're not\nFinding it any more difficult than we were already um I Do have colleagues around the country who are finding cell phone number is being blocked more um and and it's driven by this um all of this fishing that's been going on with our cell phone numbers lately\nI Can't come up my phone number is recall from Idaho we're in right\nAnd we we do there are two things that we do to try to help us with that\nWe're down to find ourselves his Christopher Newport university so we're not we're not in anonymous number or we're not\nI'm an endless number you'll see who we are when we call and then um if you look put me on your do not call list will put you on argue not call is that we won't call you back or we don't have to do that because\nYou know according to the federal regulations were doing research academic research we're not working we're not getting paid to you know do this we're not making a profit so we're considered a researchers so we don't have to comply with the do not call it but we do keep our own do not call list and if somebody says don't call me I don't want to do surveys\nThen we'll put them on our do not call it so we try to be transparent in that way as well\nWell that's fascinating because most people go oh yeah I'm On a do not call list so that they are because because you are academic nature interesting so your turnout model is showing forty to forty five percent that's interesting because the people I talked to the campaigns are they're hoping is going to be around forty eight\nThat's so that's ah so it depends on who you talk to 'em it could be forty eight um it could be higher I mean so here's the real sort of question that I have in my head right so\nIf there is a big blue wave if there are a lot of voters that are engaged right now who didn't even vote in twenty Seventeen\nThen we're missing them in our survey were not capturing that right and that some of the pushback I got back\nUm what do we want to put out our second district poll showing Taylor leading Luria some Democrats push back and said well you're not even capturing some of the voters that were newly registering and and they're going to vote okay fair enough\nBut we have the luxury in Virginia in in that we had a twenty Seventeen election that we've seen captured that surge pretty well it it ... it brought Ralph Northam into the governor's mansion Ralph Northam on the second district by ...\nTwenty Seventeen captured that search pretty well but it may be even bigger than and also Republicans may have responded\n'em by by engaging their base voters already now you have done that we think we've captured them because they were already voters anyway um but it turned out is higher\nI think it's going to help 'em I don't know that helps one party over the other all the way it might be helpful to Democrats because it might be that extra surge that we might it might be a lot of new voters were not capturing\nSo you ... you you saw the search I called it the suburban tsunami I'm twenty seven to ... you saw that you saw\nI think you had to we are yeah we we were we were modeling\n'em in twenty Seventeen like we are likely model this year or what we were doing and twenty Seventeen as we were we were modeling the same way but we were also looking for new the registered voters\n'em in twenty Seventeen because of that was that was that search that was the difference between twenty six twenty Seventeen was a lot of those new suburban voters\nUm and so we did see the surgeon twenty Seventeen we all know what it looked like in Virginia and so there's nothing that says to me that that's going to be any less this year than it was in twenty Seventeen and there are things to say to me it might be a little bit bigger than it is that it wasn't twenty Seventeen and by the way\nIn twenty Seventeen the Republicans were as engaged as as you would want them to be it's just that Democrats were a little bit more engaged\nSo you think it might be even bigger this year it very well could be I don't think it can be much bigger but it very well could be\nUm Democrats in particular are trying to register new voters or they they were until the deadline\nAnd Republicans I'm work trying\nTo register new voters as much as they were trying to mobilize their their base voters had already there so\nI mean look if both parties it's not likely to be because we don't have a really robust statewide race going on 'em and we have ... competitive congressional races some places and not at other places ... so that's part of the reason I'm thinking forty five um but if it ended up being forty eight it's because there were ... there's massive turnout\nGoing on in some of these really competitive congressional races um I don't know if you're a if you're if you're looking for a competitive state wide race to drive a turnout we just don't have that this year and so that's part of the reason I'm hesitant to say it's\nGoing to go as high as forty eight but look I've been wrong many times um in all the wrong many times in the future\n[laughter] goodness knows that's that's a blessing um talk what's the ones not close\nClose um it I you know I did what I find interesting about the statewide races that um it's not close yet you see Tim Kaine campaigning\nIn his ... his campaign campaigning as if it were close he's running ads on on every in every television network in in the commonwealth he's campaigning like he's got a a more for a bit of a formidable candidate that he has\nI've moved beyond twenties sixteen um and and and sort of the difficulties of being a vice presidential candidate on the ticket and twenty sixteen\nBut I think he's also recognizing that in some of these are really close congressional races um if he can pull any coattails um if he can run out and he curtails\nIt can be really helpful to democratic candidates downtown and so I think oddly enough Tim Kaine is running a campaign to get re elected to the U.S Senate\nAnd running several congressional campaigns to elect Democrats\nUm in in in some of these competitive races at the same time um and he doesn't really have a challenger that has a lot of money but Cory story is all over local talk radio which is where his voters are going to be and so I think Korea Stewart's running the kind of campaign that he needs to run to give voters out given\nUm how difficult situation he hasn't had a little money is\nSo your wife pulling it\nWe ... we pulled the Senate race several times\nAnd then decided it wasn't going to be a competitor enough to pull it throughout the final stretch from Labor Day on instead decided to pull these congressional races because really for the first time in probably decades in Virginia if if if a hundred and some odd years\nWe've got a lot of a lot of really competitive congressional races going on so we decided to pull the congressional races instead of continuing to pull what doesn't appear to be a very competitive Senate race\nBut we are we're wrapping up here in the segment what what'd you do have a final call here on what that is going to look like in the day\nWell probably somewhere Fifteen Fifteen ashes mine is where my ... I'm at right now it could be a little bit higher could be a little bit lower if it's a little bit lower it's going to\nSome of these congressional races are going to look really good for Republicans are going to be really tight if it's if it's higher if it's closer to twenty than some of these democratic congressional candidates are going to have a better night I think\nFifty sixty Seventy rings yeah anything moving a libertarian from making an impact and all you\nDo in a in in in we we anticipated they might given that that you know a lot of country club Republicans might not be interested in Corey Stewart but at the end of the day we're gonna we're a very tribal period of our politics and if there's an hour by your name and a lot of Republicans are going to just vote for that are and not actually give\n'em the libertarian their their vote so we don't see any uptick I'm I'm among libertarian candidates either state wide or\nIn these congressional races um there's a libertarian in the Panthers libertarian seven we're not seeing any uptick with either one of them\nOkay thanks Clinton kids calling in it was like an opportunity last Libertarian Party they had a chance to to crack the crack the market here a little bit in Virginia they might have fallen short this is Chris accident filling in for the vacation and John ... come on back\nOur third day this week we've seen each other I Know I think you're talking here I'm Talking you know I haven't figured it out yeah let's not go there [laughter] you're the electric right now so uh you know if you heard last night with Clinton kids from Christopher Newport oh are you seeing anything different than what Dr kids seeing out there\nWhere I heard that the the back end of his um interview and not you know I I sort of got the sense from the discussion that perhaps they see more of a blue wave that I'm seeing I'm I'm In in regular contact\nWith all our congressional campaigns um throughout the commonwealth and frankly most of them are doing really well\nUm and I will be a surprise if it doesn't really come down to perhaps just two and a congressional districts being really in play when we get to election night\nTo just to which too\nI I see you know the seventh and the tenth clearly are the two battlegrounds right now I think the other ones that perhaps people are looking at are the staff but I think Denver Riggleman is clearly running a far superior campaign there and so I think Denver a\nWill uh will be fined come election night on there had been some talk Scott Taylor's race Scott really working hard um I mean it perhaps we'll be closer than we otherwise would hope but I think at the end of the day Scott should be fine as well so\nThat's where it comes back down to Barbara Comstock in the tense 'em and Dave Brat in the seventh this way I see it at this point\nTo a doctor kid he didn't mention Nebraska spanberger racing I live in a district I see it every day at least in western in Rico county and\nIt was a stark difference in what's going on the ground at least but I I pull back and try and do the objective follow the data if you follow the data the Clinton kids right in following what you're saying\nUh the Taylor and ... are the ones that are most in play as far as you know changing I'm changing party right if they're accurate um you've got to tell her up by seven and Tom struck down by the state or nine times like that\nSo if that's consistent than his polling is accurate\nUm it would probably show up if you if you're going to do one on bread spam or you know what I imagine that he would but what he also pointed out obviously the quality of the candidates important local issues are important\nBut also what are you pointed out was he didn't see the big Kavanaugh kicker a that everyone and I'm Talking about this is going to have this big search for Republicans or if it is is pretty quiet people make up their minds just going to vote and as he said Republicans are show up in midterms\nAnd and I sort of see the ladder I mean obviously what I'm looking at is Hannah totally um but\nDuring the uh prior to the to the judge now justice Kavanaugh hearings um there was some\nUm perhaps apt to stay on the part of the Republican base um but that changed almost immediately or with those hearings and I think the Republican base in Virginia and I think the Republican base around the country saw\nWhat a Democrat majority in the United States Senate and the Democrat majority in the house representatives under Speaker Pelosi would look like\nConstant um investigations\nAnd so what I saw as a state party chair with a clear up tech and enthusiasm responses to email fundraising jump significantly as a result to that\nAnd I'm as it's been said before if somebody's going to write a check or send some money to the party or a candidate they're more likely going to vote for that person as well so it may not be showing up in the polls quite yet but I Believe\nThat there is a renewed enthusiasm they're clearly wasn't enthusiasm gap between Republicans and Democrats prior to the Kavanaugh hearings but I think that gap spin eliminated so now it's just a matter of turning our folks out\nSo you're seeing the enthusiasm kick if I talk to more than Griffiths about a week and a half ago and he said the same thing you said you know it was a if you were doing the scale of one to ten ten being you know absolutely out of their mind showing up no matter what\nA he said you know Democrats were around Ninety and my folks around thirty said but my folks are now up around ... or so he he he sensed that he felt the underground been climbed told me the same thing a ... from the anecdotal standpoint\nI Do think there is a renewed a fervor in the in the Republican base that quite\nFrankly is getting a lot of what they want in the last election as part of the hardest thing in politics you know\nWhen you get what you want your show up and are you satisfied or you know you're fat and happy new stay home because things are going pretty well what what's the point\nUh but I think that the cabinet things sort of ... Energizer refocused or at least the Republican base on uh wanting to come out and vote but you're seeing that throughout the state\nI Am and I and I think you're getting what I think folks realize you're right I mean they got what they wanted and twenty sixteen we have the president and acting tax cuts the economy's booming lowest unemployment and in that case and so there was probably some complacency in that but then I think now the Republican base seeing\nAll that can get done very quickly with the Democrats control the house and Senate and so I think Republicans are saying we've got to roll up our sleeves and if we want to keep what we've got we've got to go to the polls and vote for it\nUsually the cycle of politics right so what as the new chairman of the Republican Party of Virginia ah what is the next step for RPG worry all going what should Republicans in Virginia Beach got\nBecause when you look at Virginia and Maryland you have to get to a very strange electorate you have a democratic Maryland with a Republican governor who looks like he's gonna win three Fifteen and twenty points in Virginia which has been a battleground trending now towards a blue state\nTim Kaine couldn't just thinks he's going to win by Fifteen offers probably maybe twenty points as well you didn't really do have this dichotomy don't you across the Potomac we're we're the the the dynamics of politics are changing Massachusetts has a Republican governor\nOr who's up pulling a the leading Democrats in the state Charlie Baker you have a governor a Republican governor of Illinois\nUm is is is the ... other Republicans in Virginia sit right for the electric\nI I think what you're saying obviously I don't know that in our current climate in Virginia whether any of the three candidates you mentioned governor Hogan and others would which secure the Republican nomination in Virginia right now but I think what will recognize\nUm again coming out of the Kavanaugh hearings um uh if somebody here six months ago had mentioned Susan Collins and Lindsey Graham being I'm\nSort of a stalwarts of the Republican Party people to laugh but now I'm getting request is how can we bring Lindsey Graham in to speak in Virginia for candidates and and have him as a featured speaker and places it's so\nI think the Kavanaugh hearings may have shown that what we need to do is have a broader based in the Republican Party that can bring conservatives together around core principles and perhaps uh if we agree on eighty percent of the issues we can disagree on the other twenty later on after we start winning again\n[laughter] again the cycle because look both parties are having their their uh ... battles right I mean the Democrats have their own battles are Republicans are having their battles were going to have some posters\nAnd that pollsters are some operatives from Iowa New Hampshire calling in to nine o'clock hour she wasn't that we have one calling in from a Democrat from Ohio when Republican mantra is going to tell us what's going on there are said to the national caucuses because that's really what they are really\nOnly I say I don't have time to worry about that I Do I just holding out for delegates to the state Senate up for re election but they're not worried about twenty twenty after we went in to preserve our ... in the house and Senate next year and virgin\nGently push back here because the dominant theme in American politics is what's going on in Washington DC and it's being reflected back in in the states and in the local to the district because Trump is the issue right now since\nSince June fifteenth of twenty Fifteen\nThat man has driven the conversation every day in American politics and if you know four hundred and Seventy two days away from from the Iowa caucuses people are going to be focusing on those issues\nBut it's going to get very retail very quickly why all the Virginia races are going on and that's the beauty and the dynamic of Virginia politics isn't it I mean you because we are we are the polls\nWe take the temperature all the time\n... that's exactly right and I think um for our congressional candidates this year I think last year gave them sort of a wake up call and they could see OK rats were after roll up our sleeves and work much harder than we thought we were going to have to and so\nUm you're right that this year will sort of perhaps give us a preview of what we can expect in twenty nine teams but that will be a sort of a pulse of the of the country for as you say\nBecause we have the entire general assembly up\nIn this time next year all one hundred and forty members that are the district of the general assembly\nAre going to be up for election and there's so many issues at play in the Clinton kid was talking about what he's seeing in his polling is that\nQuality candidates matter and local issues matter I got an email last night from a former colleague of mine talking about Corey in northern Virginia and uh basically local development and he was engaged on the also sends out emails on traffic patterns and potholes and I'm like\nThis is not what you do in the general assembly but if that's what the voters want they want someone talking about it\nBut I I think that's right people are really looking for results from their elected officials and the things that are impacting most people today with a booming economy and job I'm strong and wages growing people are looking at some of those other issues that impact them on a day\n[noise]\n[noise]\nJust

that but it it's hard not to be motivated to ah by the by the crew on or that it is to represent\nIt and I can appreciate that and I'm having\nDown by Washington at all\nWell you know Chris I mean I think at certain times it it it does it does give you pause as to you know where we are at the country and that division that are out there but but I always work everyday to try to find places where we agree I think\nNow should and I think that one of the differences in Virginia which I think has a very healthy system of government operates well is that you have deadlines are constitutionally\nA enacted that hold the line on these things you can't go to continuing resolution that's an awful term I'm all for it but they also have I I Love the single object rule in in ... where do you deal with one subject and that's it so you don't have this big mash up coming back from the other from the Senate or vice versa\nThat just blows up the whole deal\nThough I agree and and you know be a good thing is that in the in the U.S house we operate under the same rules that you weren't there the general assembly ... you and I both know that is\nSpin through it you figure out the rules about how things are happening on but the site has such different rules so it's kind of get combined together and you look at how Alice is related in any way shape or form in the the the the\nThe most highlighted example is we're here for to go to Iraq passed the title of the bill was not the accord with Iraq they\nLike they took they took a sunny bill script all the language out of it kept the bumper and the title of the survey or the houses version of the Affordable CARE Act so it it it's that kind of procedural stuff it's just shakes her head why how could that happen but I Would argue that\nYou know sticking with the logic of of systems aren't seeing justice has made it was the way to make sure that your keep debate on track you make sure you don't have a lot of you know aren't related to a piece of legislation people go how does that get in there and it's like you know crawling everything on the last train leaving the stage fright\nAnd all that stuff doesn't doesn't belong or there are a spot related or should be used you know as the way as equals a pass things that are unrelated so I I agree that that's one of the I think the problems up here is that it doesn't it doesn't require\nThe necessary debate in twelve plus see when you're using that mechanism when you have unrelated\nAh aspects of legislation or language to bill or people just you know look at it and go how how could that\nI Hope you're well we'll take a look at some of the rules and get more to wherever upper junior way of governing up in DC because\nI I one of the things that are when you pull back from politics and and watch sports people get upset when they see rules violations because they know the rules ... last night there was a has just in Berlin or through as a slider it was a

the\nYou saw that that was wrong and what happens when people in in politics people they don't know the rules to get upset about that's just not cricket you're not doing it the right way guys you know we deserve better and so they pulled back it's just the ... they they shrugged their shoulders and throw your hands\nYou know it's just it's just not working on on on my behalf you know I I don't get right in the distance and or anything you can do to to to change that would be for the benefit ended my rent let's get back to the next we'll just get back to the national district what what are your

Wilder school tell us briefly about the Wilder school when you're doing\nYes sir where we're at school of government and public affairs at VCU um rains in the top in US News and World Report for schools the public affairs got but undergraduate and graduate program focused on criminal justice homeland security and emergency preparedness\nPublic administration\nAs well as programs and the master's level and urban and regional planning in a PHD program on public policy and then we also have our Center for public policy which I direct which ended our consulting and community engagement arm of the work we do it in the wild her school so you will see a lot of things around economic development\nOf leadership in training local and state government outreach and things like public policy polling\nThat we hear within the center for public policy in the wild her school\n... we're going we're coming up pulling real quick but you guys actually go out and work with uh other local governments and businesses you help them just not just I think people don't understand that about higher education the value that you bring to the community and the state yes\nWe really do I mean we had done\nEverything from looking helping localities looking at potentially providing incentives for certain business to come into their community and doing a return on investment of what that economic impact but it looked like on the proposal stage with regard to in the Senate and then come back and provided there that actual economic impact\nIf they went forward with a business and the impact that it had on the community with everything from reading your job creation other\nAspects and that way out we've done evaluation of um you know criminal justice program there the implementation of a mental health program or a drug treatment program on reducing recidivism for\nLocal jail a or a a community partner we worked with a non profit from everything from their valuations of the programs in projects that they do she also coordinating and combining the\nActual health but they need with regards to ours\nPublic sector and private sector as well on the business community\nAre looking at a third party evaluations of programs in projects in the private sector and looking to pitch to the general assembly and need an actual third party non biased evaluation of that work being able to provide that report or\nFor that company for the general assembly to look at legislative impact so we do we are a continual partner\nEvery single day with our local and state governments around the commonwealth um and it it really is what we live and breathe it in a while or school specifically um we do it at a much more um cost effective rate than our private sector\nCounterparts if you will\nBecause it really is our mission in our vision and it allows us to bring to bear are academic\nExperts he says well within the Wilder school you know we have ever thirty academic faculty they're areas expertise if you want to talk about the economic impact I've got four\nEconomist in our urban and regional planning program or you want to talk about the impact of an opiate program a treatment program I've got to criminal acts as a academic see that their area of expertise and they get asked\nAll around the country to look you know present their research and were able to bring my expertise to bear for our localities I in the commonwealth in Virginia\nSo whether you're a service higher education school because I mean\nWe are we are\nYou know we we provide it all seems like you're a student that we will education freshman in college through graduate school in PHD program give us your workers that we will train\nThem in executive leadership and maintenance met preparations give us your legislators and you're a lobbyist and we will train them and policy analysis and the impact\nOf a variety of hanging on legislation and give us your community that will help you come up with good solutions and then give you the evaluation impact obviously should I say we really are um the one stop all encounter the education and consulting\nAcademic arm for local and state government and our our citizens and students around the common law\nAnd that's why I brought it up and it will go to the polling that your that your operations down there because I think it's so important for people to understand the totality of a lot of things and government especially heritage which has a ... on his back around the country but in Virginia we've got a great higher education system we really need to be proud of it\nUh even though it's you know it's it's appropriate to hold them accountable national questions but a lot of things you're talking about art free they are exclusive of of usual operations and they are a complementary to what you are doing and actually facilitate what you were doing in higher education I think it's wonderful I think it's misunderstood not understood at all\nBut what's jumping to some polling or not the Wilder school has done\nWhat are you seeing out there and what have you seen what direction are we going\nWhy don't we talk a little bit like Clinton on earlier so let's talk a little bit about policy in in polling in public policy that we did on this summer we were out in July we'll have another poll rolling right here after the election in November but in our in our public policy arena\nBut we surveyed over eight hundred Virginians around the entire commonwealth so a true representative sample of all five region um\nOf our commonwealth and when we look at and ask people what they think about the value of higher education and Virginia over eighty percent of our responded believe that the community colleges that we had\nIt for our work their cost over sixty five percent believe that our public four year institutions are worth the cost and then right under fifty\nPercent believe that our private schools in the commonwealth of work the costs so it's really important that you said that question around down in Virginia we value higher education and not only did we value it but we're putting out a product that citizens around the commonwealth think is age appropriate return on investment", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The John Fredericks Show", "city": "Portsmouth", "day": "21"}
