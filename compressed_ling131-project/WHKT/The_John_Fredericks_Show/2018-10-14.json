I go back with the guys thirty five he shares\nI suggest I got your poll and you're ... you're saying that the generic spread between Republicans and Democrats right now is four percent CNN poll scattered at Thirteen percent I mean that's a that's a three hundred percent difference right that you make any sense to me\nTell me what is the difference between your poll and they're just explained to me John like Goldman home Sunday nights layman's terms explaining he said it's very simple I Do polling methodology based on likely voter turnout model\nBased on two thousand sixteen based on

pulled that way it's always going to skew democratic big\nAnd he said so they're pulling basically and and agenda narrative the miners are you saying we're down by four or five [noise] and then he walked me through the crust that so I mean I Believe the house right now is a toss up\nAnd the Democratic operatives that I talked to a week ago told me that the Republicans were going to win two hundred and three the Democrats were going to win two hundred and two there were thirty seats up for grabs\nAnd uh without attribution he said we need to win sixteen states and below sea will be speaker out of those thirty\nNow that makes sense to me and I told him what are the odds on it and he said fifty fifty so how do you go to see CNN saying the Democrats are going to win to sixty cents

have\nThat resist any minority that well if you want to do anything just because the president is putting forward and I think we've got to their house you know when I was in Congress with Iraq I found that\nI didn't have pose dealing with the opioid crisis or doing you know New York and he couldn't find they took a bond that we're supporting and this is what's going on right now we're just really hurt the country so we can get to have to talk of somebody saying on border security\nThan having reform to work with people on in our area who want to clarify that goes on for someone else if we can just sit down and get that compromise\nBecause that is done on that it's kind of in terms of trying to tell a lie a different way and I appreciate\nThat the president wants to compromise on on that thing where he might not have been there before but now he is he's put forward that a leader in my car than feeling that the Democrats need to come to the table [noise]\nOkay let's get to juvenile to show a Barbara this is very troubling to me and a lot of people this is a journalist yeah this is a journalist so that was living in\nHe was an employee of an American company the Washington\nPost he was very critical in his a post articles in tweets and other things about the current Saudi regime under Mohammed bin Salman very critical\nNow we have we have FBI into linked that or into sources said that the Saudis were attempting to lure him back into Saudi Arabia in an effort to interrogate him and then we would assume put them in jail he goes into\nThe stand bowl a steady constantly in Turkey to get paper work\nSo that he can get married or that he can a show the Turkish authorities that he is legally\nDrunk [noise] forced in Saudi Arabia so that you can get married to his Turkish

when you have to say\nThat I haven't really thought that something\nYou know value and obviously somebody trying to tell the truth about what's going on in the country you know he can be very [laughter] [noise] I went from court we'll find out what [noise]\nAre you well there's you know finding out and that could take forever and I think having been solved and just kind of underestimated the media frenzy here he thought it was kind of die out\nI thought the president or President Trump is doing a massively brilliant thing in fighting\nThe Turkish fiance of your mouth to show the or to the White House that's going to put more media focus on that land hall has called for an immediate suspension of sales of or any arguments to Saudi Arabia\nUntil they can they can provide evidence that he's okay or something are you in favor that\nGoing in and out of it ran away\nRand Paul and or is one and he's [noise] he's on with me in five minutes he has proposed a pension\n[noise] I think [noise] more [noise] [noise] [noise]\n[noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] how they [noise]\n[noise] I think we do a lot of [noise] okay [noise] [noise] coming down\nWhere all the time that you Barbara for being with us a Republican congresswoman Barbara Comstock representing the Tampa ... district of Virginia she's up for a third term on November six Barbara people want more information or did they go\nFarther huh [laughter] Congress'\nLimit what they mean by probably getting a lot for example the Hillary Clinton oh wait it out or yesterday on your way to go [noise] I get your mouth and I\nThink the\nWebsite again Barbara Congress dot com Barbara\nLook at all of our phone calls where the government to a record to talk to how long we talk to them without a warrant and there is a group of actually bipartisan\nRepublican and Democrats are trying to sort of the deep state from getting on the information and there's been good at that as well [noise]\nI just want to remind our listeners that\nUh everybody knows and listens to me I was a vehemently opposed to Patriot Act one\nSon Patriot Act when it's sunset it you were a lonely voice in the U.S Senate I remember you did the filibuster for some time in opposing in questioning\nOr the ... the Patriot act you are right and then you are right now I was right then I'm right now we're just so my audience knows\nThis whole Pfizer thing a quarter page and uh he's dropping the Trump campaign and the phone he finds a warrant none of that could have happened without the Patriot act that set that up\nAnd you're the one that said\nYou keep covering ... getting government this unlimited power\nOf surveillance and its eventually going to come around and bite you in the bud center that's exactly what happened\nWhy have the same very into the conversation yesterday with the FBI because I asked point blank argue gathering information including the president's phone calls and of course he fired at earth's without that they're setting\nAnd the answer for it and I said the answer is yes there was an article about two or three years ago saying that they recorded Fifteen hundred of President Obama's ... a town called [noise] and then they minimize sandwich ... market name out but is it to tell when President Obama or President Trump is talking to a foreign leader here they're out\nOf their voices [noise] even if you minimize or in a parked out the names that you can't tell who the oysters are but we shouldn't be doing now we're listening to members of Congress this conversation\nAnd and then they're out there and then the FBI can search this database regard jazz is Warren and my point to him was in I think he didn't understand it didn't register understanding there [noise] if you're recording things on potential terrorists from overseas the cost of government really apply\nBut if they're talking to Americans who are just random people are talking to Americans when you do get constitutional protections because many of the phone call our discussions with terrorists in fact a vast majority of innocent international phone calls\nAnd so we have had this discussion with them and uh it should be protected by the cost of some say the Fourth Amendment John Adams says the spark that led to the revolution because when you're in like the British soldiers coming into our houses you know breaking down there to work for the stamp tax [noise]\nAh we really wanted protection that we wanted to save the government and never come into your house or any of your private\nConversations are belonging without talking to a church first\nWell and that's a that's why you were so adamantly opposed to when you were a predictor of the future what this whole thing senator\nYou've also been a very strong voice on the disappearance of ... to show the there's a lot of talk about what should be done and we want more information\nAnd like I get that but as a member of the Foreign Relations committee you're the only senator that has proposed action which is until we get answers on his disappearance because\nSenator thing is we have a videotape showing that he went in there is nobody will tape showing that he went out and I'm a crown prince NBS Mohammed bin Salman says\nThe camera footage one's corrupt or the battery went dead\nThey can't really only by that is like\nThe dog ate my homework or I didn't get ever ready battery and so the battery died now you have more in a meeting in suspension of the arms sales to the Saudis until we get some kind of a satisfactory answer can you elaborate on that sir\nI think everybody should remember that Saudi Arabia is the largest state sponsor of radical\nIslam around the world what I mean by that if they have been the funding for murder authors in Pakistan\nIn the Philippines even in the United states teaching critical ask hatred of Christianity and teaching radical violent jihad just hear the sound of your car we shouldn't be selling a weapon simply because of\nHis queen of the Nineteen hijackers who came here were from Saudi Arabia Saudi Arabia is a big part of our terrorism problem there are a funders of terrorism and teaching of radical Islam around the world this latest episode\nArt I see no way that this could have happened without\nThere being it's all too private planes were too many guys on them who some of them have been linked to Saudi security services and intelligence I'm now it doesn't pass the smell test and you know we just we ate out to the president this morning he described\nTo them killing a journalist there are tens of\nThousands of civilians killed in Yemen they're doing it with our bombs weird refueling they're finding their ends at wired and two weeks ago or three weeks ago they killed the school bus full of children's school children were killed a year ago they killed a hundred and fifty people on a funeral procession and we wonder\nWhy someone in Yemen wants to drop a bomb on and kill the Saudi are killing American because they found the fragments of the bombs were saying you know America [noise] and so we have to realize that for every action there's action and that's a blowback\nFrom us being involved in some ... gotten civil war or is one that we actually create more terrorists but here's the other possible thing that's going to\nHappen again or what happened in Libya when we toppled Gadhafi we've got chaos and more terrorism became a breeding ground for terrorism my fear is that there is some remnants fairly fairly strong remnants of al ... to India but we're not fighting down that we're missing a stricter\nCivil war between the ... and the salad and also with Iranian influence as well but my fear is that they censor the chaos and that you get to ride out period at the same thing happened in Syria as that\nCivil war that we got involved in standard in the house you got the rise of ISIS\nWill actually the network that I go on June near a a couple of about a month ago was reporting that al Qaida fighters were actually given safe haven a by the by the Saudi forces in Yemen in ... in in order to fight the who the so\nCalled this wouldn't you shouldn't be surprising because here that the Saudis support\nIn Syria they supported out in the news forever which is essentially an offshoot of out so the Saudis are all these poor people who hate America who have a western wires and\nYet we kinda big arms deal the president because I Do it for a job for a job that's not something that we are considering what we argue arms deals we need to be considering our\nNational security not trying to have some sort of Keynesian job scope\nYou're on the John triggers radio network trucking the truth across America where wind Kentucky Senator Rand Paul Republicans on the Foreign Relations committee a he's been the strongest point in the U.S Senate on\nHow we react to the uh Jamal to show the disappearance so\nHave you recommended this to the president center have you on a direct conversation can remember a look than when I was an original Trump supporter everybody knows day when he came down the escalator he campaigned on getting out of these entanglements not staying in the\nHave you had a direct conversation with the president on how we should react to this\nNonsense and killing of the journal asked um he does know mark you're on TALK to him about once every week or two and well we have our conversation as our general ours by saying\nThat uh he has the same instances that idea that we've been or the Afghan or too long in Iraq was a mistake shut down a million times\nYeah he's surrounded by state forever crowd and that's a real problem is I think the president's instincts are good I'm sort of in the crowd at what the president of bigger president right and\nGet the people surrounding him are I think uh to offer her you know part of the traditional foreign policy around here which is go stay forever and bankrupt America\nSen Paul the president has invested a lot of political capital in the Saudis and it was the first place then he went in his first foreign visit a NBS came the United states he did his media tour within the Saudis spend a ton of money\nOn media PR as you know uh in in in the swamp\nAnd so he's put a lot of uh and and you know we kind of look the other way when NBS rounded people up jailed him in that hotel whatever they did\nThis administration has looked the other way is this going back to our relationship with the Saudis and my ... and tying it to that is it going to change the
