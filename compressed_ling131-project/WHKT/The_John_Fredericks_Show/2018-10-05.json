I'm so much yet but I'm the one path or a Democrat there isn't an right go in Chesterfield with the suburban women\nUm and I think Abigail's the match for them and I think that the Republicans are doing everything they can to lose that block naturally right now um and so I haven't it's a tough one\nI think binge drinking Kool Aid on this cabinet nominations in terms of I mean I interviewed let me just say yeah in in terms\nOf what this is during politically and I think we all live in our own echo chambers and we all have our own perceptions of how it's done but what this was done in the nearest polling and some other polling demonstrate this is the Republican base is now activated enthusiasm gap which is favored the Democrats for the last year and a half is now closed substantially\nAnd I think that works to perhaps paper ... David Wright has two two issues though outside the demographics the district in the DNA that district is Republican\nThrowing him under the Boston Red that seat out for two years and bring back or ... you know somebody it's more in line with their thinking and and even some scores\nAnd certainly Tim Kane is good or be exceptionally strong in that district was mayor ... Richmond if he has a political he's widely ... ease ... say ... but he's ... well regarded enrichment where he was mayor he'd run I link ... that that the I think that's right this structure that democratic turnout there\nSo you got a factor that into this thing\nI still think at the end of the day that the DNA that district establishes itself and brown wins but ... but this was a close race and Democrats have nominated ... ... she's\nVery and or or whatever happens you talk about uh somebody that's got to be involved and democratic politics for some time I think I think Abigail spare burgers gotta have gotta be somebody that record was a\nA democratic circles for some time ...\n... die you know I don't I don't know a ton about the district uh I Will say I was driving down the south side Virginia to go to vent last weekend and going through some of the rural counties and it seems like you have ... margins are those counties are but obviously the critical mass ... the district ... adjust your film and ... so\nYou know I I Would probably say you know robotic ... Republican district but obviously if it's the way ... here than it could be one that the Democrats deal would after defended twenty twenty\nI get to the second district Taylor\nOr whatever happened with John Taylor the other day I had my radio show or the campaign put my [noise] my name and their TV TV ads so great shape the PR for that one out of that race but\nThis is my first chance ... respond ... Scott right after he had his meltdown on your show yeah and that went viral yet I'm Upset about our analysis last time um and now this has not changed he's still going to lose 'em and [noise]\nUm I don't think I don't believe the north ... I think it was you know I I'd up to this point I'd not near term goals are pretty good I had the last week they've they've not been um I think there's some noise going on\nUm but I think there is gonna win and she's gonna when going way um so I think she's gonna wind going away things can be a [noise] a a you know Scott Huler up until two months ago was doing everything right um and he's really blown it\nAnd he's not gonna win reelection and some argue saying because of the whole the ballot initiatives real signatures issue and the way he's handled it and remember that this district is one of the few in the country\nThat not only ... side a media market but isn't a media market that doesn't really stretch too many other districts\nSo the media has been all over this on the evening news every night you know if Barbara ... had a petition scandal and attempt district it would've made ... for forty five seconds one night\nA maybe a week later they quickly ... mentioned that you know because like you you cannot get\nLook I think a zero transport property rights cater is fixed that district very well on you know it was a Navy SEAL all kinds of stuff is issue matrix and he's chosen I think you're in line with that district is not a far right kind of guy he understands us a suburban Virginia Beach in those areas\nSo we have all that going for him now this petition scandal has it is a little bit of a smart on him now Democrats are very very good ... and you every year the savers are Democrats who were watched as a Republican what scares me about this is the fact that if you look nationally Democrats just have a ton of cash\nAnd dropping a couple of million dollars on that race in the last week that megaphone just can overwhelm at this point in exaggerate these things I think\nI think New York times pulls correct Huntington up today a again if I were betting I I I think he wins\nBut in this environment with the kind of money Democrats put down a you've got to be nervous about this you're going to watch this on election night if the Democrats win this seat it tells me it's going to be a pretty good year farm in terms of we're talking thirty five forty yeah\nGet a job at the Godfather's here we were just talking about you but let's turn on your white lifted okay uh\nLet's see I think that says okay\nSheryl Peters [noise] uh west in a second I'm gonna I'm gonna say Taylor although I think it'll be close but for the reasons I imagine if it was a presidential year it would go democratic ah I don't know the seven that well it's also a toss up I don't really have an opinion on that one\nAnd how many how many of the tank when by Fifteen Fifteen okay\nUp going with the Taylor brown and I'm\nGoing to be upset and attempts Barbara and then I think a rod capital with Barbara and I think a because it says here talking points from barbers say [laughter]\nSo you're always over perform right actually perform\nA internal foe show me\nI always flowing plane ah my answer really as soon as I got 'em all written by Albert counting the\nComposition and I'm I'm like a zombie makes the county morale and Tom Davis\n[laughter] I got four retard you point out I think Corey store to get under forty percent I don't know what the libertarian will get but I Know there's a lot of Republicans that are not going to vote for a course toward it no matter what\nAnd there there's there is going to be a a Republican Party of Virginia Public extra system on November seventh that they're gonna have to basically we're going to spend your hand spit out that green stuff that Lyndon Claritin but you're going to have to get the story\nI've given you a given you by the way the path to uh\nThe five year ... we're not talking about major major\nDeal which isn't that and this happened with Carlos I'm an ... billion Thirteen were there but not that popular when they're running and libertarian broke five percent and libertarians the automatic ballot access to the next five years in Virginia which ... which are the Republicans\nThat was going to expire this year because of the trans had not crack five percent again another tactic or a Stewart there'll be another five years with libertarian automatic ballot access loud\nIn a great point is that in a good point point as fat water is going to get over five no no question probably seven Godfather's here which I think you think five or it's going to win or lose\n[noise]\nUh what what ... what about Scott Taylor Maria [noise]\nGoing on [noise] and uh a sealer [noise]\n[noise]\n[noise] and I spent a a\nTerrorist got nothing but negative publicity from up over the last several months and I don't see them climbing out of that whole could be wrong but I don't see that and I also don't

[noise] uh it it was the n._r._a. [noise] those ads have been effective but this Kavanaugh's thing I mean that's all you know I go door to door and that's all I guess\nIf you think it's kind of hard to get back to ... got to go we've we've got to get to the Redskins yup we've got to get the record beginning Monday Night right Carolina right well let's just start with where they are early in the right you have to be happy so far\nYeah generally happy I think the defence like I said a month ago yawn fast\nA [noise] good and and they're going to get better I think their deepest will get better [noise] um I I think they need to give a couple of guys more snaps a couple of guys less naps but by and large I like their defense to be a top ten the patches Sharon for the next few years going forward\nAnd make the point I\nThink they do they have one issue that need to solve and I can solve it if they listen to me they are weak on the ends they don't have any big play receivers that could go down catch the ball you know catch eight bucks\nKeep throw onto your tie dance and your backs especially with a tight I'd like Jordan read the genetically going to get into some dance\nDesert on the street [laughter] he's been on the street I in you know Bruce as my from Brazil I emailed him literally within twelve hours if they're being taught by Dallas begging begging them to pick up and as I have repeated it every time I said um [noise]\nThe day he sets his foot on rich gets park you'll be their number one receiver they could get rid of Josh dachshund yes I said it they could keep Jamieson ... get that keep decade Richardson that there are number two receivers fast but then you need a big receiver who can pull down eight nine temples again for a hundred yards\nDesk and do it and so if they put him on the team they will be the best team the NFC East and will make the playoffs way down the\nDallas like losing um I think it's [laughter] you know they don't like to when they like to lose a why did you know why do they do what they do I do they keep Jason Garrett his head coach you know I mean\nWhy do they get rid of Tony Romo and uh it's just I I think somewhere Jerry Jones just decided he was tired of winning and want to start losing for a while and so that's why does what he does\nThat what what do you think that I mean there's the answers that dependency [noise]\nYeah I I'm I'm they were going down and [noise] I Can't believe we're talking about the Redskins are not referring to him and the first place yeah that's true birthplace and afraid for uh like the first place [noise] type yeah that's\nI I'm going to say at this point a lot better than I thought they'd be this year still very very tough schedule the next five weeks I'm going to say nine and seven and that may be enough to make the playoffs because the eagles are struggling and the cowboys and the giants are not all of this year so I'm not that I'm actually\nOne of those things it's always hurt for over ... you know go into the game since Ninety four and one of the things that the Redskins of lack for some time as a speed demon and I can't remember the last time I'm sure I'll probably\nMissed something but I cannot remember the last time I've seen the Redskins a Redskin return upon or kick off for a touchdown and a while and it's been a long time\nAnd I remember one of the hallmarks of a ... a little party was that he always had pets he called it one burner\nWhether it was you know on your nerves whoever I mean it was he always had at least one burned and we don't have that and uh it it shows\nHow many how many or when you're there for about nine [noise] I Know that my from ...\nAnd [noise] maybe three and one [noise]\nAh they beat New Orleans at the superdome and on the way to an eleven o'clock season [noise]\nAnd here's your here's the thing about Alex Smith [noise] I'm not a fan of it because he can't win big games in the playoffs so we've got an exciting quarterbacks but you know I've watched them now three weeks I'm not a fan one way or the other but they're on TV [noise]\nBut I mean masks games and he's never going to be you know that we're going to be themselves and he kind of ...\nI could see where I can see quite a challenge on him I mean he does fit a kind of that's what they're\nThe whole Krueger philosophy is now that I don't want to get [noise] and\nThey're I think the thing that got to win ... games that they could get in the playoffs will be dangerous [noise]\nI got I got to sign off I got to be in court today okay thank you sorry we're going to let me just quickly add the unemployment down to three point seven percent the lowest since Nineteen sixty nine lord since Nineteen uh [noise]\nWhich you know I can certainly argue to get a raise you can comment on this really quickly John and say this is it's an amazing stat but not for the reason the Republicans want it to to be an amazing that because people say nothing sticks on Trump\nAnd I think it's
