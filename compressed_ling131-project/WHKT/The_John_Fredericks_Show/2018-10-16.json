patents which makes sense and will eventually to generics and low prices is a lot of ... competing against each other to produce low cost outcomes\nAnd so the contrast between me and my opponent could not be clear tonight my opponent for example on the tax cuts wants to return the money from the tax cuts back up to the federal government\nMy philosophy is to take the government and the federal dollars and bring them back down to the state at every opportunity and back down to our local officials who know how to deal with them better and it was when it comes to drug the opioid crisis is exactly this problem\nWe passed a ton of rape build up at the federal level but the problem is the money is trapped got our community service for the state level and it's not making its way down to our ... our local sheriffs in Chesterfield in right go in all ten of our county\nAnd those drugs are vitally needed and we need a low cost drugs and so the basic idea is to return power back to states and localities\nThank you congressman brat I'm Sorry I Want to remind our audience that we do have reception penalty seven seconds for Mr Brown Dave sorry I missed the spammer Abigail if you would um would you like the question again I don't get hooked up\nI have traveled across the ... the number one issue that people are talking about the rising cost of prescription drugs and the cost of health care across the board is number one thing that people are talking about and how it is\nIn the marketplace currently it is possible for pharmaceutical companies do what's called patents ticketing where they are Longate the patents and they they depressed competition Medicare for example needs to be able to negotiate his prescription drug prices\nThe Veterans Administration is able to do so and some drugs are up to eighty percent cheaper on the Veterans Administration side than they are on the Medicare side\nIn terms of what we need to do overall with health care and I think we'll probably be talking about that quite a lot we need to strengthen our current healthcare system and we need a public option you will hear my opponent speak very frequently at some expensive program that I Do in fact not support\nI support a public option but while we're talking about the costs and special interest money I wouldn't\nThat in our tax bill the twenty Seventeen tax bill that added to the deficit to the tune of one point nine trillion dollars pharmaceutical companies the top by pharmaceutical companies got forty two billion dollars in tax\nAnd so when we're looking about at the reason we cannot find\nA we cannot lower the price of prescription drugs and Medicare cannot negotiated prescription drug prices it because of the pharmaceutical lobby it's so great it is so great that when we have a congressman like congressman brat who said he would not add to the deficit who voted against\nSpending bills because they would add to the deficit is willing to add one point nine trillion dollars to the deficit in order to get tax cuts to the tune of forty two billion dollars for the pharmaceutical companies\nLike if you're spending your attorney you for our next question which has to deal with immigration what impact\nIf any has the current administration's immigration policy has on Virginia's workforce\n[noise]\nAs a country need comprehensive immigration reform\nIt is something that has been talked about for years we have not achieved bipartisan comprehensive immigration reform and right here in colpepper I have heard stories from people in the agricultural business who are concerned about whether long term they will have the employees that they need\nPeople threw out or district are concerned about the way immigration has become such a politically divisive issue the truth of the matter is we need immigration reform comprehensive bipartisan immigration reform that it's changed a number of things first that secures our borders and our points of entry I worked at CIA as a former\nAs a former CIA officer I worked undercover\nI worked counterterrorism I worked in narco trafficking traffic\nUnderstanding the drug cartels working throughout Nextel I Am well aware\nOf the threat that present themselves at the southern border and it's for that reason that we need comprehensive immigration reform\nThat is strong on border security and strengthening our points that entry but we also need immigration reform that will meet the needs of the employers peers throughout the seventh district here throughout the commonwealth of Virginia and we need comprehensive immigration reform\nThat give certain teacher dreamers children who were brought here through no fault of their own\nAnd that what bipartisanship should look like this are depressed\nVirginia has crossed this country and we need bipartisanship to actually drive\nA change on this issue but when we look at what my opponent has been advocating for it is not a bipartisan solution me the bill for compromise building he so frequently talked about it was a compromise between the far right and the more moderate\nRepublican there weren't the compromise bill there was a bipartisan bill that was put forth in Congress they couldn't get out of committee this time around but it was put forth by a Republican and Democrat there are people who are willing to work working to try and find ... bipartisan solution but there are currently not enough of an in Congress\nThank you out of jail Dave\nYeah thank you for the question I think it had to do can you repeat the question\nLabor force sure of what if what impact if any has the current administration's immigration policies Adam Virginia's workforce\nYeah as I say we achieved a huge result by first of all avoiding the huge amnesty bill which would have had a devastating impact on wages for the nation as labor supply goes up with a huge amnesty American wages go down\nAmerican Jobs go down and so our efforts on that front had been very positive\nAnd so uh my opponent just brought up comprehensive immigration reform we had the good laugh 'til this year and she says that's not bipartisan Obama was for that Bill Clinton's worst for e verify and the major components in that bill every one until the last couple of years left has gone off the rails\nAnd so every major Democrat including Barbara Jordan the great civil rights leader was in favor of all the components in that good laugh 'til it is bipartisan compromise we took care of seven hundred thousand DACA kids gave them a legal status\nThat's a compromise no Democrat would vote for it then President Trump up to one point eight million Dr kids the Democrats said no to that compromise\nThan I did a bill that United parents and kids at the border with Senator Ted Cruz and Chuck Schumer the Democrat said no to that bill\nSo if you look at the facts of the matter and the actual legislation that came up and the vote it's very clear that my opponent falls to the very far left\nOn this issue of immigration she has been on the record in favor of sanctuary cities she said the states and localities can deal with these issues we don't need to cooperate with federal government that's what sanctuary cities are\nYou don't cooperate with the law of the land we have plenty of great laws on the books if we would only follows the law and so it's just a matter of simple law enforcement\nAnd of course we need our federal ice agents working with us at the state and local\nHer her objection there is very radical if you think about it she said don't follow the law the last we should not cooperate with federal law enforcement and that's done it\nThe ice agents are the ones who are protecting us from the three hundred million lethal doses of fat and all that came across the border last year that heroin the opioids to human trafficking\nThese are real and talk to the sheriff's up here in colpepper talked to the sheriffs in hand right go down in Chesterfield if you don't think it's a serious problem we have a hundred and fifty badge and Michael alone for this\nIt was chosen to use whatever red cards you have one minute to ...\nThank you so much and congressman brat I appreciate you explain it in the role of federal law enforcement agents because then Pete I used to be one I used to work jointly with ice\nI worked joint drug cases in fact in the DC area with a high intensity drug trafficking area\nOr it's often any higher\nI'm well aware of the role of federal agents I Do not support faith haven for criminals or gangs I Do not support anything\nThat would make our community is weak or hurt our enemies in fact I used to work every single day to keep the community I Lived in state to keep our communities free of drugs on the street from me less anything else it's frankly comical\nUm but in fact I Would like to state for the record\nThat I support law enforcement in all the poor because I used to be among on an island the daughter of a career in law enforcement officer [noise]\n\nYou're listening to Shaun ... comments\nOn drink radio stations and\nAny time at which your show [noise]\n[noise]\n[noise]\nAnd we paid for the entire liberal quarter that has brought us all together for I when when we made friends with our our enemies the Germans and the Japanese and now we all our friends and play when when together on trade and economic growth and it's been great for our country\nAnd so that is the result that we've achieved with his executive and our Congress this year the economy is now booming we still have work to do with China\nUh but when it comes to our agriculture it's the largest sector in Virginia and so we work very hard but our foreign bureaus across all my ten counties to protect them and to ensure that any tariffs negotiations are short lived in a matter of months not years\nBut we have to do that it's basically a matter of geopolitics and not a matter of trade policy I trade we all want euro tariffs and the White House has said that if the goal for the long run\nI think to a game I appreciated Abigail same question\nTrade deal is an updated version of NAFTA which has been positive benefits particularly for Gary and switching impact or here in colpepper and across our community\nWar is not something that I understand and in fact we has antagonize\nAnd our trade partners by creating and starting a trade war when we look at the fact that as congressman ... said China is a big threat to China it's such a big threat why are we comfortable with the fact\nThat they hold the most\nOur debt debt that we have now just chosen thanks to the tax bill of twenty Seventeen to increase by one point nine trillion dollars and these parents and the changes that they've made haven't been great and if you don't believe me after twenty thousand for workers who just lost their jobs\nBecause Ford said they couldn't handle the steel and aluminum tariffs\nThat depleted their income by one billion dollars and then we can talk about the soybean farmers right here\nThe southern district soybean farmers right here who because of these terrorists\nHave decreased prices for Bush will it costs about ten dollars in five cents per bushel for soybean farmers to break even crisis since the terrorists went into place I haven't been above nine dollars we're creating challenges in our community and\nTo answer them the president's desire the president's choice was in fact to put a twelve billion dollar bailout\nOn the American taxpayers back at twelve billion dollar bailout farmers don't want bailout they want to sell their crops and so the notion that we would start a trade war to begin to get ourselves to the point where we're\nDoesn't make any sense to me it is reckless foreign policy it creates detrimental relationships with our friends\nAnd our trading partners and long term it is tremendously detrimental to our stability in the world\nBank robbers yeah I Do think you very much for the next question I'm when I'm Sorry I Apologize this question for you\nSecond Second Amendment there continues to be a growing public concern regarding gun violence and school safety what measures would you put in place to provide a safe environment for students\n\nAs I mentioned I Am a former law enforcement officer I get to carry a gun every single day I Am well aware of the responsibility of gun ownership I grew up in a house with guns I grew up in a family a sportsman\nBut we can have Congress stations in our community about how it is that we can balance our Second Amendment right which I firmly support with the rights of our school children to go to school and feel safe in our county ... county I say our because the congressman lived there as well one of our schools had\nOf gun violence the day that I put my children on the bus\nWhen there was a threat of gun violence in our county which is a hard day no parents should feel that way No Child should feel concerned that they might die in their classroom three out of four dues paying and are a number believed that background\nShould be inflates background checks on all firearms purchases it's simply applying the same standard that exist if you go to a federally licensed\nFirst step forward that we can take the other thing that we should be doing when looking at gun violence in ensuring that our schools have the resources to deal with students who might be facing trauma or who might be facing strap\nMight be at risk for violent behavior this is a comprehensive issue is not when we can solve in a day but it's certainly not one that we will be able to solve it we do not have leaders in Washington who are willing to have\nConversations but the good news is there are already members of Congress who are willing to have that conversation there is a bipartisan background\nBill in Congress couldn't get out of committee because there was not\nA critical mass people willing to have cars conversation and so I Want to go to Congress would be a part of this discussion again I understand I'm ownership I understand the responsibility of\nOwnership and these are conversations we can have about ensuring that people who are a rich themselves their community or other are not able to do harm in our schools\nThat you have a Bill Gates is thank you very much this is a tough conversation to have and we've had plenty of them in the seventh district I have a daughter in the audience that goes to public school as well and of course we all work hard every day and it says you to keep our kids very safe\nSo I can be a major group of all the folks across all ... counties school resource officers school councilors mental health experts sheriff's police first responders\nEveryone who was in a room with school councilors so that we had all voices in and they came up with three solutions I share with you tonight at first and this was after the Parkland, Florida in in a lot of dishes in response to the failure in Parkland and we don't want to repeat that\nIn our counties here and so the first ones to heart and the schools the school resource officers the second was to enhance significantly mental health\nEveryone was agreement but that was probably the major peace we need to work on and that's connected to the third piece which is to connect the dots between the federal government state government the FBI their local the localities and law enforcement and then the schools themselves\nAnd that was a total tragedy in Parkland, Florida case they connected note that the FBI did not talk to the state to state didn't talk to the localities still look at the local police force visited that young boys home twenty times\nAnd no dots were connected the school resource officer was not in the schools in our districts and across our counties we have outstanding law law enforcement you see them with us today the FBI is in constant communication with our state leaders\nAnd I'm very proud of the work our law enforcement does on these issues and so those are the primary solutions that I received by listening to my constituents those are the experts in our community and that's what they came up with\nA when it comes to guns if you want to follow the Nancy Pelosi liberal agenda and if you look at blue states\nCan I finish the question I have a few more seconds ... when we if you want to look at the liberal Nancy Pelosi agenda and my opponent will be a vote for that entire agenda all you have to do is look at the blue states and blue counts they say let's just work on this issue in this\n[noise]\nThis is our town halls are tough communists Thomas [noise]\nQuestions over the fate of a missing

anybody money you want to go to America First policies dot org that America First policies dot ... dot org [noise]\nNow this is breaking news over a thousand legal immigrants are marching from Central America to or border right now and more more are joining the march everyday they're determined to crash the board and if they get through there are millions more where they came from that's why we need to\nBuild the wall now if we don't have a border\nWe don't have a country Congress has put this off for months but they're about to take a funding for the wall liberals want to abolish ice and let everyone including criminals in big business wants cheap labor and they let everyone in to that as the unholy alliance\nOf all of all time we\nCan't let them have their way we just can't do

incorporated America First policies in corporate\n[noise] we have a shifting story from Saudi Arabia the\nCountry is now we understand according to CNN preparing an alternative explanation for what happened to Jamal could show he saying that he died at the consulate in Istanbul two weeks ago during a botched interrogation according to a person's to know your with the kingdom's planned\nThis of course after Saudi Arabia and said that he left and they couldn't find the camera footage now he didn't leave and his dad and it was a mistake you shouldn't be dead yeah\nSerious Saudi officials have repeatedly denied knowing what happened to his show geek President Trump suggested on Monday\nAfter talking to king Solomon that or he may have been a victim of road killers as I said on al Jazeera yesterday obviously the president didn't get that from his own staff he got it from king Solomon\n\nIs inconceivable to me that\nMohammed bin Salman crown prince Mohammed bin Salman NBS did not know about this and it's inconceivable that they would have set Fifteen operatives\nTo if they're bowl and they had no idea why they were there there was no communication back to the authorities are in the government of Saudi Arabia now the new explanation seems intended to ease a\nPolitical crisis for the Saudis and could diffuse some criticism of the Trump Administration which has refused to back down for billions of dollars in a weapon sales for the kingdom so everybody here is looking to save face Trump Administration is looking at the same thing as\nSaudi Arabia is looking to save face so they gotta could top story look the guy was murder right he went in there to get a piece of paper and they chop them up into little pieces and put them in bed and you're going to tell me that that was not authorized by somebody and this is after they live and said well he just left\n\nNow they have to come clean here because the Turks apparently intercepted his apple watch communication\nBecause\nLike it's inconceivable that decided that the Saudis didn't have a camera working you know you go around these embassies and everybody spying on everybody that's the name of the game and especially when you're in a host country they got satellites and microphones that communication and bugs all over the place\n\nNow several Wall Street executives have pulled out every very lavish investment conference next week in Riyadh Saudi capital Steven Mnuchin treasury secretary still plenty to attack I mean the Trump Administration here really wants to go on with the Saudis\nAs businesses is as usual\nAnd this is also a tough spot that you are Christians and because he's been the one pushing the expansion of the U.S relationship with the Saudis from the day he got in there\n\nAnd now they think they can just put this a communique out so yeah it was a mistake and we'll deal with the people that did that like we just really wanted to interrogate him and get some information or that he died\nA John traffic's radio network trucked in the truth across America any raining coming up then Dave Brat eight oh five currently without the eight thirty\n\nAnd that's showing up this segment

truth\n[noise] with\nThe best analysis that America true and now back to the John fresher\nIt's great to have you back during the John figures radio networks so you're from David\nBrock thing that's a nice already did very well the last night's debate I think the one thing that he laid out is really spanberger securely deal here\nWhich is a as I watched the debate she didn't really put together a connected coherent message and it's a lot of soundbites and you know she's in a very as I said she's walking a tightrope\nHere is she's in a Republican leaning district that went against last year's two thousand Seventeen\nDemographic Democrat crack in Virginia blue wave of all time oh it's still went for the last three by three David got enough money to be competitive she's raised a ton of money it's unbelievable that she got a three and a half million dollars this past quarter so to speak to her campaign has got to be able to spend money on\nIt's it's not the um the final answer but\nWhen you better cornucopia of resources at your disposal in the last Twenty one days in a campaign you you've got a lot of options [noise] so she has a lot of options but it seemed like she was playing last night's debate not to lose like don't say anything dumb\nOr just ride the wave and she was okay you know\nUm but she's going more on hey I'm a CIA person I've served my country I'm a mom\nI'm great I'm smart I'm cool and a little lighter on the issue I mean James all all about the issues and I think you know when you have this kind of an economy that you're back he's got the advantage [noise]\nSo um I don't expand virgin anything to help herself last night but I don't think she's anything to hurt herself\nSo I think if you went into this debate and you are not going to vote for the Republican candidate you are not going to vote for days I think you came out of it and you're not going to vote for me I don't think like David changed any minds of is anti\nOr of the the uh the\nBlue waivers and the liberal moms are Chesterfield all that stuff I don't think he changed anything [noise] and I don't think Abigail hurt herself with her base\nNow\nAh here's where I thought they did very very well anybody wavering like if you could really make a decision if you're a true independent and had an open mind last night uh spanberger did nothing\nTo get your vote\nSo again she she just counting on the two nominees sweeping or into power\n\nIf you're an independent or a moderate Republican or a moderate Democrat and you are truly had major mind up and you saw this debate or you are more likely\nTo vote for Dave after it and then when it started you are not more likely to vote for ... and that's what we have to look a debate or you're more likely ended either\nEither neither candidate did anything to depressed their base both candidates I mean\nI think they fired his up a little bit more Abigail's got a different style she's a little more long when did\nShe doesn't have the a quick retort for Dave has so her communication style is different not worse or better just different and doesn't really up against brat\nOr he just it it gives them an advantage because of spanberger is more low key\nMore of a post communication style so all of these things were playing into Dave's favor last night\nAnd I asked that question point blank well why don't you have other debates I mean I I for the life of me after last night's debate I Would think that they would call her up and say look let's scheduled debate every three days I mean she ... I don't care what the venue with me and I'll go I'll debate you in the back of a cab I mean unless you're debate\nBut um\nKnow consultants are in control these campaigns and\nAbout somebody got fired and so they couldn't have this other debate but I didn't get fired and I still don't have a day and I can tell you for the radio debate that I proposed that boat champs agreed to uh the holdup is occupy ever the spanberger camp is basically gave it a bunch of dates for that\nAnd the hold up is the brown campaign so let's just get that out there and I don't think I don't see how we're going to have it now because it's what October sixteenth I mean we got three weeks Twenty one days but I'll keep following up and we'll see what happens Cortland asked you\nComing up eight thirty five people right here [noise]\n\nThey allowed on everybody I\nSorry about that my my bad this is for the Jeff Flake cedars I knew somebody's return Jeff Flake see\nWho's um who's retiring and you you heard in that cut their mix Sally accusing a representative or cursing stamina yesterday of a saying hey you know you should join the Taliban because I was going to win this race in Arizona\nI have no no doubt in my mind big Sally now has all the momentum I Believe and that debate last night when her way makes it I was going to win the race than the Republicans are going to hold that seat I also think they're going to win a watering hole that joining us now Cortland algae\nCorey was the campaign manager for Donald J Trump for president\nTwo thousand Fifteen and sixteen the engineers victory or he is now a informal advisor\nTo the president and also a senior adviser to the vice president's political action committee that's the hard money pack and a quarter but without the also the author of the best book written on the campaign let Trump be Trump go to Amazon by that he's got another book coming out\nNovember twenty second that is really creating waves in Washington no one knows exactly what's in it like to me but no one knows exactly what's in it and that's coming out in November twenty second and it's called Trump's enemies\nAnd little down you're going to name names of people past and present in government and the White House in the west wing\nThat have been systematically undermining President Trump's America First agenda so November twenty second in DC all hell breaks loose [noise]\nCurrently going to ask you great to have you man\nWithout any information now\nThey're going to the seats that however race you know people are talking about this I just got to be a close election Pete how it's going to win that race in about\nFour or five points it's knocked people out there [noise] I think we're going to hold Arizona and John I'm going to sleep or some of the country right now nobody's talking about it we got an incredible candidate running for the U.S Senate Michigan\nIs closer to examine our right now John James anybody predicted she now the debate in Asian American small business owner here and even then it's going to win Michigan you mark my words\nSo you think that John James in Michigan has actually his job to be standing about\nI think so about two months ago but the more the more I learned about in the campaign and the story\nOf what America should be plenty of that now he's standing still up in Detroit and not\nPlaying she shot she grows family business three times as I was when he took over when he came back from his military service catching on fire Michigan right now\nWell I tell you what that is a nobody radar screen Corey let's go over these races because I'm predicting right now that the Republicans are going to pick up five or six seats everybody says I'm Crazy um Hussein is for some time\nUh the tendency raise black burn brighter than I'm Marcia pulling way ahead now in that race she is gonna win that's going to be a whole remember tendency\nCorey Lewandowski was was one of those seats that the Republicans were did that the Democrats were Charlie about that they thought they could pick up now not gonna happen Blackburn way way ahead what do you see there\nWas that the Democrats site germ moderate Democrat from Tennessee's Marsha Blackburn is going to win that race hands down and walking away\nRight she's up by ten now so that's going to be ah that\nThat's that's that's that's gonna be a whole no question a let's get to and we we both believe that the Republicans are going to hold a Arizona with my family I don't even think that's going to be close uh what is all said and done and I think we're gonna we're gonna win the bottom\nAs I've been saying for some sometime or let's get to Montana Jon Tester are being challenged by Matt Rosendale a real public the real clear politics has this about two or three within the margin of error I'm predicting Rosendale when what do you see their\nWrote down in the polling I have seen it\nThe the Joe Donnelly still clinging to a slight lead over\nA Mike Braun um I just don't see Indiana's returning Joe Donnelly in this climate that we have with the economy going so well I'm predicting that Donnelly goes down him Mike Braun win that seat what's her you\nI agree with you John look this was the vice president's home state he was out campaigning there this weekend\nHe was there Saturday or friday and Saturday I age you know his brother is on the ballot in Indiana [noise] is doing so many not helping might run for that Senate race this is a big focus of the administration because of the vice president's home state the administration knows or they can beat Donald nasty and so\nI think you've got to see Ron come away I'm In the next two weeks and start to open up his lead over the Joe Donnelly\nOkay so I'm a camp in New Jersey I Know a couple about a month ago you said that might come into play on the Edmund ended up by ten Fifteen and he's going to you\nKnow I I I saw some internal numbers yesterday I don't want to reveal but I'll tell you what if I was on my cell phone numbers and I'd be scared to death you've got this Republican candidate was putting his own money into this race is scare and I had to\nFlip a coin today I Would say yes there's going to the resources the Democrats have to put him to keep them is going to drop resources away from elsewhere and I'm not convinced that", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The John Fredericks
