I have um\nThat just can't be solved right now when I agree\nI agree with that\nThe I I I also think that you're right the confrontation with McConnell and his wife and trying to go to the air port a backfired on the left because I think like you said I'm not you're not going to a gym and Amy I'm Seventy years old like I'm done with all this stuff and\nI think the third thing is I think things have\nThem under the they they look at these Trump rallies and they look at the Trump victory and they look at the level of support the president able to generate because he does it back down and the Republicans have\nDown for so long it's almost second nature because they don't really stand for anything except getting themselves reelected and\nThink the Lindsey Graham's in the world and the McConnell are seeing that Trump voters want something else and they were banned them in a heartbeat if they don't stand for something and so I think that's\nPart of it also but you know look there's this is just out Johnny ... welcome to stay on we uh you you you want but this just\nI don't know cooperation of the allegations of sexual misconduct against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh this

away with paying seven twenty five an hour they'll pay seven twenty five an\n[noise] right [laughter] come on man\nCompanies don't give you money because they like you right\nYou're doing good job you might get a raise but companies do this because they have economic\nAlgorithms that they run through and they say at seven twenty five an\nWe're not going to be able to maintain the employee for that we need in order to be competitive\nAnd then they say okay in order to make up for the money we're paying the entry level employees coming in\nWe're going to cut stock bonuses and cut management bonuses and that's how we're going to save some of the money okay well then if their\nManagers were unhappy with that the marriages don't leave I mean this thing done by a company that isn't the free market mark that says not\nMandated by Obama so I don't really care what Amazon does everybody is going to have to pay more to get good people because so many jobs now are available\nBecause the economy under Trump is roaring so it's all good and if you're a manager for Amazon and you get screwed out of your stock bonus get another job because jobs are available\nSo okay [noise] uh

wanted to have a\nMother is march in Washington\nAnd they came to him and they gave me money for our our products launching out there is no [laughter] he just reached in without so\nMuch as a buyer leave from the council of the rest of the council members in public and you just grab a bunch of money for you and then when he was running for governor he's promised not raise taxes on and as soon as he put his arm down from having made its oath of office\nHe did meet it started to raise the taxes\nAnd I think this guy doesn't tell the truth and he spends our money without much as a buyer\nCain [noise] okay uh\nNot really following the race because you've got to win so you know\nDon't like to spend time on things that\nI like to think about what people spending our money makes a lot of sense to me yeah she's known\nI mean you know Tim Tim Kaine is it's kind of vote with the liberal I'm eighty five percent of the time I mean there's a couple of\nTimes yes yes yes but\nIt's like you know it's it's like a [noise]\nIt's it's like having on the the ... the guy that trying to get out and it's challenging Don buyer or challenging Jerry Connelly in northern Virginia\nI mean the Republicans up they were going to get ... twenty five twenty percent of the vote so they have on and waste time on the on the race is of no value to me and I think it's no value to the\nLand right now to be true

out and joining us now from the White House if you don't have our senior economic policy advisor to the president and his sister should the president's for trade and manufacturing Peter you're my hero it's great to have you on that\n[noise] that yeah you got pretty shape the crane he's my friend but you're you're doing the work out there getting the message\nGreat deal not just for America but North America the president is just an amazing guy because he actually keep the promises that he makes what a concept for a politician and he promised back in June twenty six he would renegotiate or that NAFTA deal NAFTA is now dead\nNow have the U.S Mexico Canada agreement and it's great news or for workers in manufacturing industries as well as farmers and innovators and when we go through some of the some of the elements of it if you want but yes top line is great for America [noise]\nLet me start with I I Want to get to the elements and as you know [laughter] you know this well because we've talked many times I hated NAFTA from day one I was one of the only Republicans rarely in opposition to it when it first came out and\nI always said that Ross Perot at the end of the day he was court t._v. but he had that sucking Saudi that now and that's exactly what happened\nSo I never thought that was the the day we would go and so to me Sunday night was like Christmas but [noise]\nI Would say that the un on Wednesday so I just want you to spend two minutes on this and then we can get to the specifics of the deal I was in New York on Wednesday was at the prison is alive press cars and it was fascinating because somebody asked him about his negotiations there with Canada\nAnd one of the questions was prime minister Trudeau asked for your turn it down is that true and he said absolutely\nAnd then he said not only did I turn the beating down I've instructed my trait team just stopped negotiating with Canada they're not negotiating in good faith\nI don't appreciate how they're going about this they don't understand the stakes here and so I've told them we're going to go into Mexico and maybe they'll come back to the table some other time but\nI said stop negotiating with them where that was Wednesday Sunday night you get a deal what happened [noise]\nWell one Ninety nine percent of the deal was done based on a framework lay down with uh the Mexico deal member um some weeks ago we entered into a bilateral with Mexico and that he had all the high notes\nHit sample or in the manufacturing space a strong domestic content in the cars we build it hit market access for agricultural products that hit the notes for protecting digital trade and so called biologics which are pharmaceuticals\nUh at at the modern the end of the spectrum that we were still a little a little part on a couple of things like Gary and some dispute resolution mechanisms\nAre and I like I said this on the air on TV and radio yeah I was puzzled why was taking so long to get to 'em or in agreement that really benefited all three countries so I mean at the end of the day like in this to a boxing\nThis is all three parties raise up their hands and and trying and I'm like that thing that that that abomination that they signed in Nineteen Ninety four for NAFTA [noise] um this is actually good for America what a concept\nI Know right where with Peter Ing if it is I mean I'm telling you you know this better than I Am in NAFTA was a bad deal for America America China\nGetting into the WTO in two thousand and one which was pushed by by Clinton in Congress bad deal for America twenty twelve South Korean deal I mean we lost over a hundred thousand jobs are merely auto industry that deal for America I mean for the president is lining these things up\nA well like uh the pins in a bowling alley and knock them down and it's beautiful thing to watch\nIt really is where when Peter Navarro he's assistant to the president for training manufacturing in the west wing he's also a senior economic policy adviser\nPeter Navarro let's get to some of the cheap items in this new deal the U.S and see U.S Mexico Canada or some of the differences some changes if you could go through some of the bigger ones that would be great\nSure let's start with the easy stuff which is the modernization agreement back in Nineteen Ninety four there were some things that didn't exist and therefore did meet a provisions are one of them obviously is digital training which is the protection of of copyright Perino actual property to transfer to do within\nThat something as simple as a as an electronic book you might might buy and read what I have strong provisions or for that there's a there's these things called biologics which is a reference to ah get complicated of pharmaceuticals are at a very research intensive that are designed\nA overtime to cure things like cancer rheumatoid arthritis or whatever\nAnd uh we got a strong protections for that up to ten years why is that important\nIs because unless companies have protection a so that they can make some money on these things over a period of time or they won't put in the money for the research and development so so that's that's all good ah so so innovators are taken care\nOf a digital trade is taking care of now um another a small but important thing relatives the scope of the whole deal uh we were able to resolve some of the\nDairy issues with Canada and so uh that's good news will have much more market access there as well as for other types of products like chicken and egg things like that so that's good for me as a director of the office of\nTrade manufacturing policy or the the the big white whale here that we actually got was a\nBringing back the supply chain to North America particularly for the auto industry with NAFTA did in Nineteen Ninety four is creative set of incentives to offshore\nShereen auto plants into assembly plants performed parts and that didn't just happen here in the U.S it happened in Canada and Mexico as well and so the key provision is Seventy five percent of the of any car that that's a made has to have\nA a U.S part Seventy five percent and then to ensure that the u._s. gets its fair share of that region on contract and uh there's a strong provision for labor in their strong provision for the environment so you can't have sweatshops\nAnd pollution have in South of our border grabbing that business\nSo that's kind of ... dramatically change the structure and supply chain of the global auto industry in a way where we as as a door just purchaser a vehicle a per capita a will benefit\nFrom that so that that's that's\nThat's the big deal it's it's great news for this country [noise] and\nThey're also safeguards that\nWould discourage China for instance\nFrom jumping into Canada and then bringing them into the U.S by a third party which they've been great\nAnd the stupid question yeah yes there are a and um we were written these enhanced border for a review and things like that but there's also a couple of provisions in there which which are going to be part of any agreement that when you sign that that are directly\nAh aimed at the unfair trade practices that China for example there's in the jargon that called disciplines they called the disciplines on state owned enterprises being able to enter enter\nThe zone and uh China's you kind of the leading purveyor of state owned enterprises that engaging entree trade practices there's also a provision in there for currency\nManipulation a and again there's a lot of countries out there that purposely undervalue the currency is way of boost Iraq's for discouraging\nOur exports to them and trade deficit so if you look at this\n... this agreement um we see it uh both as a great deal in and of itself but we also see it\nAs the most sophisticated cutting edge template for future agreements in by the way I'd bury the lead here it is the largest at one point two trillion dollars it's the largest trade deal us together entered into and the fact that it's a good deal for America a means that a big is good here [noise]\n[noise] [noise]\nThere's this hour from town halls are

states Heitkamp mansion in a tremendous pox\nPolls are showing in their states there is overwhelming support for judge Kavanaugh especially now that\nOkay so let me ask you a few questions I\nLooked at the cross tabs on I just have a couple of questions if I may sure um I didn't see him play down for each obviously tops talked much stronger in western part of the reason I didn't see a regional breakdown\nYeah because we didn't wait on it um [noise] we're we're we we try to wait as minimal as possible I'm In a survey intro we wait on race um sex and I'm In an age\nAnd um we don't wait on region I I'm simply uncertain about ... you know how comfortable I Am waiting on rejoining a congressional district survey I'm with a smaller sample size if I had Fifteen hundred respondents I'd feel more comfortable doing it but\nWe have seven hundred and Ninety correspondence\nHere which is larger than some of the other I'm pulling that's come out um you know it's a respectable\nSample size but when you start breaking a congressional district down into regions you're talking about moving um or waiting I'm you know thirty and forty voters at a time and I'm simply uncomfortable methodological doing that and so\nWe didn't wait a sub regionally which which is how you would characterize sub originally within the congressional district [noise]\nSo [noise] after kid having said that since no breakdown of region and I understand your reasoning um the way I looked at you told [noise] forty six percent of your correspondents were making over a\nHundred and fifty thousand dollars obviously if you live in that area that's about what's your bag so I get that\nA sixty four percent were making over a hundred thousand but what that says to me it's really didn't sample the western part of the district at all which is Barbara stronghold because I'm\nHer voters there may well under a hundred thousand dollars going out into the Winchester area but what a\nQuarter of respondents are making under a hundred thousand dollars and um [noise] the uh the the the larger part of the population in that district is on the eastern side which is where the most household income is\nAbout twenty five percent you've you told us not enough to put\nA Barbara in a I'm In a competitive position is that the way to understand that\nYou will I mean generally that's what I'm saying um the the income breakdown looks very similar to what the district looks like so if you look at age if you look at education if you look at all the basic demographics I think we're\nAccurately reflecting the district pretty well I'm recognizing that a Barbara Comstock stronger on the west side of this for dinner on the eastern side of the district it also is in fact that the west side of the district is population is much smaller much lower than the more urban and suburban eyes the eastern part of the district [noise]\nSo what other question I have is um and I appreciate your coming up because this is this is for normally you know you just say what you're told as I really tried to spend some time to figure it out [noise] um\nSo according to your poll Barbara Comstock is leading waxed and buy one where\nThe age of forty five plots right Colorado barbers winning that group forty five and older is it possible you may have over sampled a younger vote in the ... district\n[noise] I don't know if you look at our crops if you look at our demographic breakdown our our age you know here's an email we know what the age distribution of the district is because we know that the voting population is with census data and so\nUm you know we're talking to about twenty five percent of voters who are thirty five and under um Seventy five percent of voters or [noise]\nOr a thirty five an older in uh actually eighty percent of voters at thirty five an older so we're not over sampling young voters in a disproportionate to their\nShare of the voting age population in the district um you know the district looks at the demographics of the survey look look pretty much like what the district looks like um [noise] and we have we have access to all that sort of data so we we know what the district's gonna look like [noise]\nYou know you've also um have low approval ratings and the district by President Trump [noise] I'm just approved fifty nine percent approved thirty eight percent and along with that\nAlthough you didn't pull the Senate race you said that you did ask the question within the district\nAnd the change was being stored or in the tens district by Twenty one fifty five to thirty four which basically is doomsday for stored I mean you can't I mean what if it I mean I've said this over and over and over having\nRun the Trump campaigned in Virginia in two thousand sixteen I mean we carried south West Virginia five big numbers but when you lose Fairfax I think we've lost Fairfax Alexandria in\nArlington by a hundred and forty four thousand votes right three cities you just can't\nFor it to make that up you simply can't make it up it's just too many yeah and and I\nAnd I think you know you pointed out Trump's approval and you pointed out\nUm the Senate race numbers and we did those uh because we wanted the test really what we think are the two ... two of the big things that are shaping this election in a tent um what kind of headwinds\nAre coming out of Washington and I'm a related to Donald Trump and are there\nCoat tails or lack of hotels are negative coattails when it relates to the Senate race in both of those situations\nAnd then comes talk is facing strong headwinds I'm Out of Washington are a lot of her constituents aren't happy with the president and what he's doing and what Republicans are doing and Corey Stewart isn't helping in any way in fact he's probably hurting\nBecause people who aren't excited about coming out to\nVote for a Senate race or a half to get excited about their local ready to send if they're not excited about their local rates are likely not to turn out to vote and\nYou know so that means Republicans who would otherwise be excited about Corey Stewart and aren't a Barbara Comstock has to work extra hard to track their attention to say look you need to come out and vote in history ...\nEven if you're not happy about Corey Stewart\nIs something a\nDoctor said that you can glean from the polling in the days you spending the district what it's if you could give up a figure or\nA ballpark to what degree is Corey Corey store on the ballot as to what degree is she hurting farmers ability to get reelected like if you were put it on a scale of one the one being\nMuch tending a yeah big time what would it be based on your readers\nWill ... probably somewhere below five I'm probably somewhere between two and five or three and five I mean I think\nTo some extent he's been baked into the to the calculation for ... to ... you know for some voters but I Do think there is it is the\nCase that turnout is typically higher in the U.S Senate race than it is in a local congressional race and so if you happen to have a U.S Senate race going on in the same year that your local congressional races going on and you're a Senate candidate is\nWay ahead and you need those coat tails that's good for you and Barbara Comstock doesn't have that this year she's got um a Senate candidate who's running behind\n'em by anywhere from ... we haven't Twenty one points behind in this district statewide he's running behind anywhere Fifteen to twenty points that's not helpful to Comstock it's hurtful to her [noise] um because she has to work her campaign has to work extra hard\nTo reach out to those voters who would otherwise be engaged because they were engaged by the Senate race she's gotta work extra hard to reach out to them and say look I Need you to still be engaged for me and I think that's part of the problems she's having\nSo I think it would be fair to say listen you have to have the numbers [noise] you're probably going to find the same court George drag in the seventh\nI Would say you're probably gonna gonna see that Stewart thing any drag on all the Republicans in Virginia ... who are in competitive races [noise] because of the toxicity of of some of the things he's said and done\nHalf minutes are we going to get you back on are you going to do a poll on a second and this time it's also\nWe are in the field we went into the field last night on a second I'm sure right after we took this went out we went into the field on a second will come out and about\nEight days with that and then we're going into the field and the seven um and will come out um later October on the seventh and we're spending our season doing congressional polling because the Senate race doesn't look very competitive [noise]\nAll right well we should have a lot of fun that means we'll have you went back at least two more times of that and then we'll keep our tradition to have you on the day of the election to make your final pony production Dr Clinton get thanks for being with us I think yesterday at burger coming up Democrats seventh district keep it right here\nThat you were a substitute teacher at Chuck Schumer the minority leader Democrat in the U.S Senate blasted it\nSome time ago was a harbor for terrorists the the\nAssociated Press not biased called Terrell high you look at your resume and you look at your credentials and you could you could have got they substitute job teaching anywhere that you please anywhere why did you choose to teach at\nSaudi school with a record that\nWell the first thing you notice that the average running on air really distorted truth and the ... in the Schumer commenting question in two thousand five\nOn at the time that one of the graduate from high school in generally graduated when I myself was in college well before I was ever a substitute teacher Schumer is quote and the eighties article we're out\nIn two thousand five and I was a substitute teacher there years before that the average toward the two state senator during a timeline but I Wonder if that's the key a teacher I was a long term south I taught English\nEnglish curriculum Shakespeare brown tank\nAnd out of school where it was and the kid in Alexandria, Virginia and the kids who were my students are predominantly from Middle Eastern countries and there were other American teachers who taught English courses science courses in the\nWorld geography social studies courses and [noise] and I taught English curriculum [noise]\nOkay but you know I still don't understand I mean you could have taught anywhere I mean just walk us through why you chose to teach at that school even this may have been prior to some of these\nThe decision to make because you could have taught anywhere based on your credentials why do I mean at some at some time you got an offer for them and then over from other schools and said okay I'm going to go to summer school why\nSo said Jon I I Would argue that it wasn't a questionable decision at that point in\nPain in my career I had received my [noise] my job offer from CIA [noise] I was in that process of getting my background investigation completed\nUm and like I get about every personal moved from moving locations are moving apartments to getting married to getting engaged um when I decided or with considering whether or not to take the teacher job\nI contacted the CIA made aware [noise] and they approved bad or you know didn't express any concerns about that\nNext step and really one of the reason that I was interested in taking a long term sub job in that I was\nWaiting for my background checks to come through and I needed to be ready to jump on a dime when the government said we're ready for you which is ultimately what what happened when I began my career in law enforcement or before then later transitioning to see it\nAnd you know from a teaching perspective it was a really interesting place to teach 'em some of the kids were local Americans from northern Virginia but you know it was it was a very interesting place to teach and and and be the American teacher that all of these diplomatic children had\nThey're kind of point of reference as someone who later went overseas and my colleagues had their kids in American schools are broad you know part of the cultural learning is having the teachers who are local area to teach their language teach their culture I'm into it was actually a really interesting experience\nFor me to be the kind of American English teacher for a bunch of young kid who many of whom were returning to their countries of origin when their parents diplomatic time and he was over\nSo it sounds like what you're saying it's a job soon your\nYour personal and professional situation and you simply thought it would be interesting\nRight I'm pretty much yeah\nLet's get to the for you um you claim that your staff did uphold research on yourself and settled for your request and never got a response back from the government\nYet when you get a four year on your own Sawyer thinks oh forty was never submitted so there's a discrepancy there how do you reconcile that up and go\nFor starters I Would say that ... that we hired an outside and investigator to do a background investigation on me in and basically determining what ... what the information that someone politically aligned with my opponent would would gather around me and then you try to use against me\nAnd so he individual we hired ... lawyers when CIA [noise] and when the U.S postal inspection service which notably that was the entity for which where I actually worked on the differences\nWith what America Rising did on behalf of the congressional leadership fund that they filed a poor or with the national personal record center which has a different entity\nRight out of the postal inspection service on their website\nNow which is what our individual did\nUm and ah yeah and the response was never received back from us or we've never received anything back over all that didn't look particularly confusing are alerting or problems problematic to me because our only goal is to understand what would be the experience of someone else who was for me right um\nBut then even though your claim to do that for you to get a response CNN said they could afford it on your ...\nThere was no record of it so yeah there's also\nThe same entity that release my underrated actor personal national security questionnaire\nUm so I mean at this point [noise]\nI heard a little I have a little bit less safe in the fact that they are following the steps that they should be following I mean the the real the real issue here is the U.S postal service in violation of federal law the privacy act ... released my national security questionnaire which is\nA fully protected document in providing and processing\nBackground background investigations and providing clearances and of course her seat this secret clearance for my time in law enforcement and top secret clearance with special compartment capacities for my time with with the IRA and so the violation was when the U.S postal service violated the law by releasing that\nAnd then of course later it was distributed fully unproductive formed by another entity [noise] so are you saying that\nThe absolutely you're saying that you absolutely set the forty a request and now you're claiming that based on top of them\nReleasing all your rejected information it's not out of reason to think that they were talking and not being able to find the for you that you also but\nNow I'm actually a thing that it's a distraction from the real violation of law and the violation of law curtailing the postal service broke the law by providing my information one of the pieces of the story and it's also not reported on is that the national\nPersonnel records center actually initially\nDenied the forty a request when we forget the fire that America Rising submitted um and so there's so many more questions to the situation but really what it boils down to is that where the violation of federal law\nMy national security questionnaire which is the document that anyone who's speaking of security security clearance fills out\nAnd those are not members of our military members of law enforcement numbers or the intelligence community sellout they provide their detailed\nPersonal information not just about themselves about other people in their lives on very detailed information very personal information that document was released erroneously in violation of law\nAnd winning outside organization received that um document they proceeded to pass it on to members of the media or without taking the steps to protect 'em my Social Security number my medical history that\nWell that was irresponsible no question about it\nIn top by somebody that just didn't know what they were doing or you think it was some kind of a conspiracy\nThere's currently an ongoing investigation and so I I Can't necessarily comment on that topic\nArt fair fair enough let's get to the bank\nYour tone it the right has said when we talked to his campaign about these debates he said that you had not officially committed to end debate just beyond the first one in October Fifteen which is going forward on\nYour she'd put out a very strongly worded statement blasting day for backing out a saying that they were supposed to be three debates of course the third debate was with me which hasn't been set so that date has not been said even though I've I've asked about a hundred times a\nOut from these scheduled debates I mean were they scheduled or what\nYeah so you know he's he's talked on your show even about the fact that we've agreed multiple debates we had identified a location we identify the place or teams had done independent walked through we had\nA they don't walk through other location we had told the media partners we had the media lined up our local station that was going to [noise]\nTo air it everything was set up the only thing we had done was sent out a press release um and that was something that we had been I'm pushing for and uh certainly the host and the media partners had been pushing for ultimately then", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The John Fredericks Show", "city": "Portsmouth", "day": "04"}
