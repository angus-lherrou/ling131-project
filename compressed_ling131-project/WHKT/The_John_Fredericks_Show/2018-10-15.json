radio network no drought going on here in the er the minute all the men Atlantic I'll tell you that meantime the a kiss choking situation gets even worse [noise] um [noise]\nThe uh the kingdom of Saudi Arabia kingdom now threatening western countries but particularly of the United states\nAnd saying if you take any action than they're going to be a reaction that's got to be severe because the president said it would be severe punishment if indeed uh\nHe can tell beyond or the U.S and tell can tell beyond a shadow of a doubt that a judge or a mile a\nShow he was murdered entering the Saudi Arabian conflict I don't know what exactly this empty threat is like Saudi Arabia running around and acting like this in some kind of a world economic power\nThreatening their sovereign from they are going to pull them out or the president saying look this is going to effect the arms deals because decided to just buy it from someone else\nBut that's not really the point Congress is going to act on this if indeed the evidence is there there's no question about it and Rand Paul is going to introduce legislation in the U.S Senate\nIn order to get the United states out of the Yemeni war this is kind of make senators during an election\nUm go on record in supporting this or not this is a political relations disaster for the Saudi kingdom and four MB yes that is a king Mohammed bin Salman no matter\nHow it turns out or they were very brazen in in in this um move very brazen and I think they again they underestimated Trump the Trump Administration the president himself for us just underestimated them they said some guy can go into a conflict not come out\nCameras on them and drink but not leaving\nAnd somehow this was going to get swept under the carpet the day of reckoning for Saudi Arabia is coming and coming very quickly if once we get to the bottom of this um it is a\nProven that something happened to him that is I'm not good however you want to say that\nAlleged so we'll see what happens but this president doesn't play games and if he says it's going to be severe punishment\nYou can bet your bottom dollar they got to be severe punishment now there's media reports going around that took the show was an operator of a\nIntel for the Saudis that he was involved with the um [noise] uh with uh al ... when they were fighting the Russians ... uh but none of that matters\nIt it just doesn't matter what matters is the guy was living in the United states and he was working for a U.S company and he went into the conflict in his stand bolt and turkey to simply get paperwork to get married at him and he never came out I mean this is a problem\nRegardless of how you want to spend this is a political disaster of for the kingdom and these empty threats that they're making is absolute nonsense [noise]\nLook teaching them stock market went down\nA seven percent of it last seven percent of its entire virus billions of dollars and I was [noise] rebounded a little bit to only I think a three point nine percent or maybe three point eight percent the last time I checked but ah I\nWhen are these ... international leaders kind of understand that if the president sets the company's gotta follow through on it and he said there's got to be severe punishment and I would think there is but\nThe president said yesterday he wants to wait until all the evidence is in Seoul seal that um we'll see how that goes [noise] but uh I Would expect that the U.S is going to act now Saudi Arabia has just given turkey permission to a\nSearch it [noise] it stand bolt tops and went on Monday afternoon just nearly two weeks after\n... show us missing or the news comes as international\nPressure is mounting on um Riyadh to explain this guy's disappearance now remember he disappeared on October second it's Thirteen Days later and now finally the Saudi kingdom is reacting because of the pressure being put on by western countries and here's the bottom\nLine we are supplying the Saudi air force in Yemen with complete logistics and his Rand Paul set on my show I Believe on friday or Thursday I forget what he was on one of those days you came on and he said\nHere's the bottom line if we pull out of supporting the Saudis\nAnd the Yemeni civil war they can't fly an airplane I mean we provide them with totally ...\nYou said that air forces grounded so they're really playing with fire\nWhich is the uh acronym for\n... Mohammed bin Salman of Saudi Arabia thirty three years old it seems that he wants to be the strong man in the middle east or something something to uh as far as that image is concerned\nBut ah you're not going to be able to do that with the United states so he is going to have to figure this out and this president is not going\nTo mess around with it so we'll see what happens and I don't\n... the the rats that the er the that the that the Saudis made on a on Saturday and Sunday and I think it was on Sunday they made threats about a disrupting the world economy and pulling their sovereign funds out and uh they were laughable\nI mean they're not an economic world power there a country that\nMakes some investment it will have zero\nImpact on the United states and I think we're going around saying well your gas prices will go up I mean there's certain things in international politics you have to do what you have to do because that's like saying we're not going to fight certain elements because our gas prices are going to go up or something I don't know if that's true or not\nBut I don't think it matters it if if I got to pay three extra cents a gallon\nFor a short period of time because we have to do the right thing and the international stage and show global leadership then so be it for two weeks I'll deal with it and so on everybody else Jon triggers radio network trust the

certainly not going to do anything to jeopardize this economy and that was her comment\nAnd I'm telling you there are so many Democrats like that out there that are they might say they don't like Trump and they might say that there's been a poll or whatever but they don't want to ... they don't want to do anything to screw this economy up and certainly putting Nancy Pelosi can charge\nIs a prescription for disaster joining us now is Elaine Parker she's the chief operating officer of job creators network Elaine great to have you with us\nGoing in for\nElaine these are economic numbers continue to just stunned people the ah the the level of growth that we're having the newest unemployment report coming out to about ten days ago three point seven percent\nWhere the economy where it's just phenomenal Trump autonomy ranks in there just isn't making\nMatrix when they show up on November ... they got where is it\nWell health care and the economy just about all over the country are the top issues national security is important to many and in some states like Arizona immigration is a critical issue so economy\nEverywhere it's one of the top two issues but I think you or your framing of the question is a little bit of oil you know I talked about this a lot [noise] um [noise] the economy is great there is not as much of an awareness that was not a lot of voters aren't giving credit to the Trump\nAnd Republican policies and that's creating a bit of a disconnect [noise]\nWow that's a I mean it's it's it's unfortunate and to me every day that goes by where the Republicans are not talking about the economy and jobs and\nPromotions and raises and you know the other thing only give you a lame back involves the ... of um chief operating officer of the jobs created network\nElaine another thing that is a not readily talking about is the number of people now that are comfortable changing jobs Elaine\nAh which is another number that is off the uh CNN polling radar screen if you will\nBut the number of people that were in jobs eat dinner particularly want to be in or didn't like her one happy\nBut in the Obama economy one percent one percent growth they were afraid to move now you're getting movement from one level to the other people changing companies going more comfortable\nThat they can make that move can you expand on that all it\nAbsolutely accept all part of what I was talking about earlier with having more out of all people die if I can tell\nThe people out there and there's always the skills naturally the jobs\nThat are available and there is overseeing leaders right arm just by the market and how it how it comes to work and people are feeling the counter fall in love for other opportunities but it got other\nOpportunities for people who are taking

federal\nAnd the fact that people want access insurance they want access to affordable insurance either a government that role and sharing it cutting are providing\nSo a lot to get back to Scott Rasmussen so Scott to what degree is the that issue going to show up on November six I noticed that\nThe Democrats come on my show now uh one of their major talking points are well Republican X Y or Z\nVoted against a extending preexisting conditions when they voted to replace repeal Obamacare where's that showing up\nTo that is a fear that gets to ... people want to make sure that everyone\nHas access to quality health care and to to read the church like that is believed to this person is going to lead to ending coverage for those with preexisting conditions facts or that's what our practice pouring\nI'm obviously it as something that Republicans would say is not true in a certain misrepresentation vote to misrepresentation\nOf legal actions that have been taken 'em so clarify what happens there is it's tricky because again Americans do want everybody to have access to health insurance to want to make sure it's horrible they they're not aware again or some of the activities that the lenders mentioned some of the policies that have made less expensive\nPlans which increases the actual um probably of anything on the health care in the ... the Welsh coined a scary thought is in the ocean it's somebody in any condition many places will be unable to get access to health care\nAnd so that's the leading a the the drink driving some some people um yes to vote the underway thinking well if the if if the Democrats getting they're not going to end the bombing here\nI mean it just said that I Know it's amazing because um two thousand ten and the the Tea Party and all that we covered all all that and\nGetting rid of Obamacare was like everybody's number one issue\nAnd now the polling numbers show that you know people have accepted it they're comfortable with they they don't want to change it\nSo um how how do you reconcile that\nIt's very simple the healthcare system was broken the whole bombers here it was not by Obamacare people still believe the system is broken [noise] um but it's no longer the shoulder find any part of the health\nCare discussion because it's been in place now for several years people aren't quite sure what privileges of all while they like or don't like 'em have anything to do with Obamacare what we know is that people want to have your choice in their own and making their own decisions on health insurance\nAnd take over the healthcare system um there are a number of [noise] things you would say would be opposed to Obamacare Clinton appointees\nLook people are you know President Obama has now been out of office for a few years his policy was past ... years ago people want to deal with the system as a loser makes you better\nUm and they don't see either side really having a solution to this point\nYou Parker how do we get a\nMaximum engagement on November six knowing what twenty two days remaining how how do you get maximum exposure to get Republicans out on November sick how do we do\nI think we have to keep talking about the economy and connecting the economy to the policies that the administration like the tax cuts couldn't job back in the cutting of regulation um we did a poll a couple of weeks ago\nI'm asking how many Americans knew that there has been a tax cut and about a third of them is that they didn't even know that they had had their taxes I\nMean that's that's the potential we should be talking about um the fact that five million Americans had gotten a little higher wage increases and that means is that the results of at the ...\nNot just the people the companies that put out press releases we got numbers just small main street small businesses get rain has been getting raises and hiring people and expand their businesses\nYou just don't put out press releases about it that we know that things are happening for employees you know people are getting my money back in our paycheck you know small businesses hiring\nOr you know the economy's doing well but we have to be talking about it in educating Americans about that\n[noise] so uh what what is the advice that you have for Republicans that are running in tight races or how would you change their or encourage them to change the message in order to take advantage of this tremendous economy we have going\nWell I mean I think it's it's very clear it's about choice choice between continuing the on the very high crime on as a result of these policies or going back to um you know wage stagnation\nGoing back to a higher unemployment and they took the better choice and and that's why people have to educate themselves on and on the benefits that the policies coming out of the destruction\nI don't want to thank God willing for being with us Scott Rasmussen the number one pollster in the history of American Jen and you're

stronghold of Don McEachin and African American churches and other things obviously you have to get ...\n... what are they saying\nWell we have a program to back up a little bit one of the things I think that makes me unique is that I'm a pastor and has been a social worker I care about a lot of things that I Believe the African American typically the urban area's really care about like we've already talked about welfare public housing I care about criminal justice reform I've seen that close and so those are things we're talking about the economy is used as\nYou believe in I Believe it's just\nGoing through the roof with a booming and that's a good for all Americans really been good for African Americans actually the unemployment is you know as long as it's ever been so we talk about the economy and as you know a lot of African Americans particularly the the conservative African Americans in the church\nAre very conservative socially do we talk about her life and and what are they saying I was there isn't and what\nWhat yet or telling them but when you go to a Democrat who voted for him and Cajun voted for Clinton there a democratic voter and you go in a rich man or Petersburg and you say I'm Ryan McAdams I'm a Republican running for Congress blah blah blah what did they say\nWhat did they what they said to me is you're right because I'll tell them you know what the Democratic Party has done anything for you they made a lot of promises but they really haven't produced anything and they say you're right and then I say you know what and Republicans haven't come and talk to you and message to you and ask for your vote and they've taken for granted in that sense\nAnd they say you're right and I say well I'm here and I said I to me I'm not about Republican or Democrat about solutions that I have solutions for you I've conservative solutions for you I've got different solutions ... Democratic Party has but I've got solutions for you and I believe that the work I Believe that's going to give you\nThe jobs that you need in this community I Believe it's going to give you the redevelopment that you need opportunity guns and we talk about that I Believe it's going to give you the portable housing that you need I mean we get we're not going to solve all their problems but I Believe that hey compared to what the Democrats have given you which is nothing I mean we are a huge step up and I'm actually here I'm\nPresident you know that's the one thing that they said you know what you're here and I appreciate that and then when I tell them faster\nWhen I tell them been a social worker\nTheir eyebrows go up you know they're like oh really and they want to know more they want to know they want to know why I'm In this race they want to know well how do you feel about the president and I tell them I said you know what I Love the president I Love his policies but I'm not the president on my\nOwn person I have a different tone or you know I have a more moderate tone I'm One that wants to be a bridge builder I Want to reach out I Want to bring us together I'm not a divisive\nVoice and say whatever you think about the Democratic party or your current congressman and needed a divisive voice all he has to do is tear down tear down the president\nI said I'm here to build up I'm not here to to talk\nEven to tear down the Democratic party for the most part I'm here to tell you the solutions that I have for your community and you know what it resonates with people because you know what people see in the ... just like the president and I know that you love that about the president I Love that about the president\nThat he's an authentic guy and what he says is really what he believes whether he says it right all the time or he says it wrong he says what he believes and that's how I Am I'm just going to tell you straight and not going to try to\nPaint it you know just to tell you what you\nParty should be going into these areas with solutions and that's what we haven't done the past and that's what I'm doing I Need to do it but you know what I'm a unique candidate because I have a hard to do it and I'm Nicky qualified to do it as a pastor I've worked with the African American community\nReally my whole career and ah as a social worker I worked in public housing I work with at risk youth a mentor to African American kids we we rented taekwondo program with the police department so I have credibility is not like I've just come lately you know I've been there I've done it\nAnd are they see that and they know that and we're going in African American churches same thing and um so it resonates because you know what\nI think African Americans are very sensitive they they can they can read people and uh I think they they I think most of them can read where I'm coming from and my heart and so a lot to me we're getting traction what's your website Ryan McAdams for Congress\nDot com primary jams for Congress dark comedy the Mike Pence coming in for a rally seven forty five PM or at sun trust building enrichment on Saturday October twenty Saturday October twenty that will be on his website one of the bank rhyme McDonald's for being with us Denver Riggleman coming up things right here\nFor an authorized by America First policies in corporate and joining us now Denver Riggleman [noise] you know just when you started when get worse after big but Leslie Coburn his Democratic opponent in the fifth district when it crazy campaign this has been because\nUh I guess when you're down so big you gotta like pro hell marriage or something but luckily Coburn on that debate Monday Night a week ago she went after Denver's military service on the ground zero three thousand miles away from Afghanistan\nAt NATO support facility Diego Garcia while he works on plans as you know for a bombing missions um apparently applying that they didn't play a big role which of course we know we did and I'm Mr ... leads a coauthor\nHusband are dangerous liaison said that uh he was snorkeling I mean this is a really crazy campaign that ... running [laughter] I mean how are we going to like say Denver like didn't serve okay what else are they going to make up joining us now do it again it's the truth\nIs Denver Riggleman here in the Republican candidate for the ... district in Virginia that the Lynchburg area through Roanoke\nAnd Denver a is running for that seat to replace the retiring Tom Garrett generally given great to have you know hey good morning John how are you okay so uh luckily coverage has been saying no you didn't put any bombing\nMissions or after the\nGo Garcia\nYeah I mean I'm you know maybe I think um I think the co burns have a problem with tweeting and they seem to they seem to to get angry and lash out on\nTwitter but that's how they run their whole campaign there's they may say disparaging things and make up things whether it's big foot erotica or white supremacy and you're making fun of military service or saying I don't care about women are taking things out of context and then they rushed to Twitter to the Hollywood friends\nAnd they try to make it national news because you know they have such extreme\nPolicies um and I think they're true believers but they're just so out of touch and for a Andrew Coburn to get involved to talk about my military service for somebody who's biggest service has been you know making a fantasy books I tell you almost get to the point you just start shaking\nYour head it's hard to take them seriously I'll tell you that and and you know they they just ... it's a lot of veterans to and by the way John Diego's not the only place I've been and and that's the other thing I just I don't have to defend my military service to the likes of them\nWell uh it was throwing a desperate attempt I mean you've got a very very well documented military service and you were the one that was the end of the group that was the other thing yeah the\nThirty four desks expeditionary bomb squad during on how to Diego which you know what I mean you talked about many times before and you know like I always told you you know they're you know I I've been in situations\nEl harm's way there you know I wasn't I was supporting a bunch of just um awesome individuals I'm never going into battle and when you talked to some of the people you know the guys who objected over the Indian Ocean\nOr I was trying to keep them safe with death threats in Afghanistan and they're going after the caves and also all kinds of other things\nThat I Can't talk about honesty then yet um you know it's just funny because they don't understand\nAnything about military service everything they've always done is going about themselves and now they don't understand they enjoying war against the war fighter and they thought this would be a walk over when I came as a new candidate and they're finding out right\nNow that I'm an outsider and um plus you know I mean I I've had a gun stuck in my chest so you know with the Coburn sorry I don't think they understand\nThe gravity of what they've done and they made this personal level I never thought somebody would\nWell they're desperate or do you what are some of her you you mentioned in the beginning of the segment Denver Riggleman you mentioned that some of their positions were extreme liberal or can you just name several several of them for\nSure I mean I mean everything they are extreme you know with a Medicare\nFor all you know I'm for giving us all student you know there's one point for a trillion and stood in line to a debt free community college um the fact that they she called 'em I stick to stop 'em there's other things that we have that we're going to roll out I'm open borders um my goodness\nUm you just go down the line everything that Ocasio Cortez says is pretty much what largely Coburn beliefs and and that's what's scary about this is that\nShe can't come across as moderate now she's trying to run to the middle or she knows her positions are extreme so that's why she stays in Charlottesville she doesn't really go outside the district much anymore she likes to stay in\nNow what I got to respect that I mean she's a true believer in east causes but I'm I'm a true believer unconstitutional you know policies but also an individual liberty so it is truly a war of ideas now and uh I just hope that the Republicans get out and vote because she is dangerous for the ... district\nWhere were the Denver Riggleman Republican candidate for Congress in the fifth district is running against\nHis Democratic opponent Leslie Coburn uh she's an author has a lot of friends in Hollywood\nAnd a Denver running for the seat him to retire on retiring Tom Garrett Denver let's get to a number of the pressing issues on the world scene today that I Want to get your\nOpinion on a let's start with Jim al ... the a so called a\nJournalist if you were living in the United states living in Virginia doing a column for the Washington Post very critical of the Saudi Government goes to the consulate in this day and both for routine paperwork to get married and it's like the older\nRoach Motel he went in but he'd ever came out a hurricane\nUp never came out so it's like the the Saudi Roach Motel\nNow the stakes get elevated because President Trump said over the weekend um if he gets clear evidence that the Saudis were involved in this cold blooded murder within their costs what and he's in his tent bowl\nHe said there would be severe punishment than a prince Mohammed bin Salman MPs thirty three years old turns around on Sundays fires back\nAnd says if there's any ah sanctions against us or any retaliation or we're going to double down and we're going to affect the economy's in world markets and\nPull our sovereign fond and raise the price of oil and a ex cetera I we bought this arms deal with them a hundred and ten billion dollars but they've only spent Fifteen billion\nWe've also were backing their war their civil war I'm with the Emirates in Yemen where we go with it\nWell number one I think I'm shallow used to have in Saudi Arabia to have a lot more leverage uh but now the United states is the number one oil and gas producer in the world\nUm it's very difficult for them to I think it's a you know sort of exert that kind of leverage on us as far as President Trump's concern I think he's very serious I mean if it's found out that the\nSaudi Government sanctioned um this type of behavior I don't I only think gee I don't think you're just to spend hours payments I think you're talking about pulling any type of support\nI'm against the tea in Yemen and I you know and that is that's that is something because you know we meet him really do not like Iran they are our enemies are back to you I'm just really interested\nTo see because it is eight to try to extract Iran from what they're doing a state sponsor terrorism is a very important goal the United states government but on the other hand um if the salaries are doing this type of behavior now you're talking about things that we just can't get done\nTheir arms sales I think you would ignore the trend on oil and I think she would start to extract support for any kind of military stuff that they're doing a over in the middle east in each other military exercises or or any type of operation so it's it is serious\nDenver the other side of it is that uh some people are saying
