little bit early I think it's turned off in the eighth inning and that was it looked like there was a it was wrapped up there this is Chris\nAccident I Am a cell and I do this occasionally I'm I'm a former member of the Virginia house of delegates I surf from two thousand two the two thousand ten and currently I'm the executive director of Virginia free the foundation for research and economic education Virginia free\nIs a nonpartisan underlined\nNonpartisan totally non\nPartisan or a visitor pro business out of the advocacy organization here and the comment there not\nFor Thirty years I'm not really a pro business we're also very much a working towards responsible pro business government because as we heard in the in the news updates Mike we heard that says China's economy is slowing down its growth and that's a problem they have a significant debt burden and their economy\nYou know you're trying to like be be that guy and that has that has devolved to where we are today largely as a result of several factors\nI'm One of the Iraq War out to the collapse of the economy and two thousand and eight and\nA and that has led to this massive worldwide suspicion of government or what's going on today this unsettled place that we are in this world is not just manifesting itself in the United states we are not alone in this in this in this cultural shift as manifesting itself in politics\nIt's showing up in Hungary in Poland and in Germany over the weekend in Bavaria which is actually I ran into a [laughter]\nThe German political vision of awaken fancy that right you're going to exchange program I didn't want to go to the vet and my wife somewhat like I really don't want to go watch football I Want to chill out Sunday night it's a great game on or off oh go you'll have fun okay fine subsidies to German teachers trying to have a conversation\nAnd thinking I don't know any German right so what are you gonna do jog you know your voice [laughter] how's Hitler\nYou know [laughter] you know what do you go with that conversation well it turns out they speak beautiful English they probably better than than we do structurally\nAnd um and I and I said so how are the electricity in Bulgaria because they're very they're lectures on Sunday it was a very important election in Germany\nThat's the kind of guy and that's what I followed and well this one teacher was up or a teacher of politics so then we went down a rabbit hole two hours later at the dinner table we just we're just we're chewing up politics\nAnd what do you tell me about the very was is that is extremely successful economically it is the richest region of Germany for falling point\nLike three percent unemployment youth unemployment is extremely low\nUh their school system is set up to get people to work straight away um if if you're like a tenth grade and you're not you don't really want to go to university you don't have to take it to make it you can go right into a a a trade school and the print is program and you're getting a job and you get a diploma so they get um really it's a very work intensive area they\nThey pride themselves culturally on work and productivity an organization and good government right there it was like a it's not like a shining example of how you would want to have a state where a region actually be everyone's employed there was a job you have any functions\nThe very intellectual and he goes what are you upset about what what could you possibly be that concerned about\nThat you basically blow up this I don't know if they blow it up but how does major upset in the ruling party that had been it has been in control for decades last probably the ... the ruling majority in Bavaria and\nIt was stunning to me to realize that we're not immune from that here in here in America so people say\nYou know the economy republic Israeli comedies going so great vote for us people don't vote on yesterday's news they don't vote on today's news they vote on the future where are we going where what is going to be happening that's my fear that's my concern because things are going well you know with Donald Trump got elected gasoline was about three twenty five\nA gallon now it's around two eighty a two thousand eight was four dollars a gallon or better but are we getting better are we getting worse you know we see here that China news today about their economy is slowing down its growth rate of growth and that has a factor on the human psyche about how\nHow's it going to manifest itself in my life you see these commercials\nThey're not all about you know skills and here's my dad says there about\nThis guy off all she's horrible there ... there but there's no big overriding issue like here's what we're going to do in the future it's just that the other person's really bad therefore they're not going to be good for you um and therefore because the economy's going to say well they're gonna hurt the economy I guess this is what they strap elation isn't the subconscious\nBut I'm going what is the big driving issue other then obviously Donald Trump and it's a fascinating time in American politics but what are reasons why I Do what I Do because it's so interesting but also to teach people\nAs I used to tell my students I really don't care I really don't care [laughter]\nWhat you think I hear that you think if I can encourage people to be more interested about what they're talking about to read another article to dig deeper to challenge themselves\nThey will in turn create a better outcome for the rest of us now you tell my students I don't care who you vote for I just care that you both but if you don't vote I understand that's also a vote in itself because you were saying I'm not I'm not doing this I vote none of the above\nAnd it's and that's and that's the tabulation in aggregate itself just like the vote and that people do that doesn't make any sense\nActually it does if you don't show up for something the two political parties going to try to get you to show up next time we're trying to reach out to you in some way shape or form that data point will register I talked to a a a family I was at a baseball game\nAnd they were so upset or you just can't stand going and I've been talking about if they haven't earned your votes don't vote and tell them that you don't put it on social media like he would anyone else anything else so I'm not voting you haven't earned my vote you haven't got me off my couch\nOff my job is to go down and say I'm voting for this person you don't register it'll aggregate data\nAnd that raw data collection and is dissected by the political class to determine what they want to do 'em and they ended up in every election swings on the undecided voter right the independent voter in October is like oh we're going to stop talking about these issues that motivate our base to degrade\nIn certain cans I work with the president's wife shows up the polling independence they might not like President Trump but when they agree with something you'd better work with them to get 'cause that's the thing because you know all politics is personal not just walk\nAnyway this is Chris accident filling in for John credits if you tuned in to hear me drawing on about politics go who is this guy a I'm a former member of the house of delegates I'm filling in for John products as I Am one to do\nA as John is on vacation with his son down in Florida in a baseball tournament a John is a baseball fan probably like in his words but he was a pitcher in college and his son Joe Joes a picture of you want to call and ask me some questions love to hear from you\nEight eight eight four to five six four six eight eight four to five six four six eight eight eight forty eight oh five six four six four you can taxidermy straight away five four zero to nine four zero six zero five four zero\nTo nine four zero six zero I'm gonna have some great experts on later today quaint kid CRISPR Newport Jack was simply Republican Party with congressman Rob Wittman\nA doctor Robin McDougal from Virginia Commonwealth university Wilder school and Jesse Harris from Iowa was a political operative and is on the Democratic side and it's in the Republican side from New Hampshire will hear from Mike data he answers a slacker or my good friend from the Central Valley uh we're I'm\nNo Susan for you know gosh\nEarly nineties I think\nWell I certainly aging yourself there's there isn't a Democrat a chair a chair of the Democratic party Virginia from highland county to county I used to represent and they've known citizen for for decades and so we have we have the great friendship and I am looking forward to having all these\nCosts calling today and stir up the conversation a little big go a little deeper we're going deeper today\nIn politics we're going to go deeper dive in not just you know the public polling you're talking about numbers but how those posters got to those numbers who are they listening to who are they calling why are they calling because it's a very different when a university does a polling like CRISPR Newport you'll hear quitting you're talking about this\nThey start with a very broad universe um and it keeps coming down to a smaller University of actual likely voters minutes and we'll get to that we're getting to the nitty gritty will be able to get you take you do a deeper dive so when you look at the polls when he got like a real clear politics which\nWhich I spend unfortunately way too much time\nOn 'em but I guess it's healthier than other websites right [laughter]\nThis is this is a healthy Internet ah it's a ... you look at these different polls and and you got like let's just take a look at the uh the the polls on um the generic ballot it's insane\nWhat uh what what we're looking at here caught up its it's fascinating like generic ballot follow this track plus Democrats plus ... Democrats plus five Democrats post a lot of Democrats personal habits Democrats plus one what how do you get there you say\nThe polling is wrong well poems always right it's just data you're collecting other people call what the differences isn't the methodologies\nWho you're going I talked to one leading I'm democratic source and\nDemocrats are around ... low thirties thirty four thirty three percent or two that rage Republicans we've never seen self identification for Republicans is while it's around twenty four percent and what used to be you know thirty four thirty four is now thirty four twenty four and independents are up around\nThe load of mid forties because Republicans\nHave never been lower on self identification but we haven't picked up any of those voters they're all self identifying now is independent that is huge and when you get down to it with people when they understand what's really going on that's when they get more excited mortgage\nEye blessed that wants to have it in my life but also\nA what a what a blessing and it's just to be alive right to be able to\nAh just to be experience at all and I'm Wondering I enjoy coming in during his radio show as I get to hopefully get people excited about politics I'm against it does governor lives it is important you know we can't\nBreak down we have to work with each other to get good things that we should have the debate though we should have a vibrant vigorous debate that threatened moves the country\nForward um and we shouldn't be afraid to have that debate but we should have in a in a civil manner and I think today we see is a lack of civility more and more than a difficult in my professional life I Am the executive director for junior freeze the foundation for research and that kind of education and uh so we're five oh one C. three see sex and\nWere nonpartisan which is a great lane to be in these days because everyone is so\nYou know red or blue and I'm like okay for you well you know aren't you might not really I don't have to be actually\nPay nachos [laughter] even get healthcare so [laughter]\nWhat we did was we represent businesses and uh we have membership and what we try to do is educate them on politics and as a former teacher and a former business person my family in a bottle water business for years old a couple of years ago a blessing um you know I I like getting people excited about learning about politics seeing it differently\nAnd what that makes me there was aren't even deeper like you know when you when you go to teach a subject you better than other subjects you have to really get engaged in the subject so it's an every day I get to learn more and more about politics it's\nIt's a it's a deep interesting topic because it brings in culture and a economics and history that was a history major so I I get to bring out altogether because it manifest itself as Andrew Breitbart said in the last segment\nCulture is down politics is downstream of culture so if you want to impact culture or their politics impact culture first and foremost suffer your culturally it'll\nLeader you'll be you'll be a political year give us a call it eight four five six for six we got some great just calling in today are not just congressman Rob Wittman but also the leaders of the two major parties here in Virginia posters Clinton kid and Robin McDougal\nAnd then two operatives one from Iowa and one from New Hampshire we're only I hate to say this because you're probably second tier the elections already in the midterms we are four hundred and Seventy two days away from the Iowa caucus\nSee now it seems like a long time but let's be honest as soon as this election is over you're going to start hearing reports back from Iowa and New Hampshire and we're going to be at the forefront of that we're going to get calls here we're going to shoot up there with us of operatives that Republican and Democrats\nTo see what's going on the ground I think Trump Scott the lock on the nomination you never know you never know you never know goodness knows you never know what Donald Trump because\nUm that that that that's that's who knows who's actually does what he says it says you can do it but you never know what's going to happen around it\nAnd I think that's one of the more interesting parts about politics things because\nHe's brought that dynamic of ... uh what max and that sort of it was if you remember from your\nUh days in school or work you know the leader changes and it's like a substitute teacher what is going to be like air you know you get you get a new boss oh what the it's a it's there's just the newness and from\nSince June fifteenth of twenty Fifteen this has been a very different political dynamic are not necessarily unhealthy because it has made us think and react differently and respond differently and I don't think that's necessarily on healthy\nAh but we do have to be ever vigilant to make sure it does not become too unhealthy and I think people are recognizing that we have uh some some discourse in this country\nThat can be improved we can get better at that as a people and how we do that is every day one on one with each other you want to impact politics if you want better representation be better people sort of comes down to um they represent us and if you want them to be better it's up to us to be better [noise]\nSo it was called an eight four five six for six we'll talk about polls goodness knows was more polls and I don't want to do with these days\nThe generic ballot what I pay attention to first and foremost is what I check every day I'm On the real clear politics they give you the um average of all the different polls and they break down the individual polls\nI'm now post should be looking at what are called Elvis likely voters polling companies should have an understanding of who they imagine are going to be showing up on election they should have a pretty good handle on may ... began in Virginia about a month ago so that we should know who's actually voting\nI'm In Virginia in or you can always tell by Arlington [noise] 'cause they're the tabulation their uh their absentee ballots are some friends of mine who are tracking that to see what kind of um who's voting relative to the last round of elections to see what the intensity is\nBut when you look at the er the averages of the generic ballot them and this is why I Do this is why I Do that\nIn twenty Seventeen when governor Ralph Northam defeated that Gillespie he won by eight point nine three percent a point nine three points the generic ballot on that day was nine\nPoint one if I'm trying to instruct the class what do you want to follow\nNews Reuters Rasmussen CNBC Emerson Maris Quinnipiac Wilder pool poll a crystal Newport which one do you follow follow generic ballot right now because that that is fairly products\nAbout twenty sixteen\nIt was very close it was like Todd and Republicans are performed on election day by about a point and they want and the generic congressional ballot I'm obviously Trump lost by about three points a nationally three million votes\nUm so that's something to consider when you're saying okay we're just going to go I think I think the the objective view here is look at the generic ballot look at the average and you can pretty much extrapolate where it is right now\nIf the election day were held today because on that basis it it takes away the the the partisan lines you might have or a would be inclined to it at nine point one percent the dams won by any point nine nine point one point nine that's very close\nAnd they are at seven point six right now\nIt is safe to assume that they will not perform as well as they did in twenty Seventeen but still will win and likely when the house of representatives given the dynamics in the Senate it's very different because of individual races\nLikely that Republicans a hold on to the Senate what's the dynamic that\nIf the Democrats have a house and Senate Republicans have the Senate\nWhat's gonna happen the next two years and that's how you can sort of figure out where this thing is going so that you can understand what you need to do or not to like myself I don't watch\nCable news I don't watch broadcast news every papers in the morning ... times Wall Street journal and I get mine on information what's going on in the economy and politics and culture and whatnot\nAnd then I'll leave it alone don't listen to\nYou know the uh the national talk radio shows I go to work right you know I I've dealt with my eyes I see what's going on and I think most voters do that if you look at the the aggregate numbers of\nYou know the Fox news of the world and the MSNBC and it's a very small subset of the American population but they're the they're the most active\nVoters they are the their the activists so those shows are pretty much you're broadcasting to the activists\nAbout what they want to hear about the all the messaging points that they they they they're supposed to repeat so when you're watching when you go to Facebook\nOr Twitter or Snapchat or Instagram or whatever they're very different social media platforms you see the replica repetition of the message and you're like wow I'd I'd go to a town hall after I got like a congressional town all my friends get up there now Congress there were statements of mine\nI watch them and take questions from the audience is like where did people get the information is fundamentally wrong but they're really upset I mean angry not pleasant not understanding but what do they show up for [noise]\nDo they show up because they're angry they are concerned\nBut more importantly like anyone else in the world they just want to be hurt right how important is that in a conversation to hear what the other person is is really feeling get down to okay what is up what what is what is making you got to say oh 'cause that's\nThis fear and when you get down into the to the nuts and bolts you ... you really can understand why people do what they do and hopefully get them to a better place than station in life and it's not easy to do but it's a it's it's what we do it in a democracy and the public and form a democracy which we have in America thank God I'm\nSo we can just live more peacefully amongst each other governors self self governance I think it's really important a historical concept and I think we've lost sight of that a little bit it's easy to\nUh but more importantly interrupt for for folks to point out to me was like what we can do better we can do better calm down we got this I mean are are have too many TV channels at night do you have too many options are there are too many restaurants and grocery stores around you\nIs it too good are you afraid of going to lose all this mean it's it's crazy how good life isn't suburban America um rural America has a lot of challenges growing challenges urban America has a lot of

products call in any of eight four five six for six right now we've got on the line\nA doctor Clinton kid from Chris renew point university Washington Center for public policy call and ask a question eight eight eight four five six for six were going to be calling talking about his polling CRISPR Newport university\nUm I think one of the most accurate or posting pulling operations in the commonwealth and can do a great job Clinton they're\nRight here is hey Clinton how are you man\nRight and that's and that's what that's what campaigns do they follow but that means they followed that you you look at the\nThe cross tabs in the in the polls and they go okay I've got a problem with um women the Tunisian twenty five I'm forty five you don't go there on crime let's just say you know and then they structure their messages according to be or if they have high positive for their opposition to try to attack the tack to bring down\nThe positives and bring up their negative to have an outcome in the election are you having more difficult time getting people because the cell phones this is a question from a from a from a texture short but\nWe're not we're not having any more difficult time then we had been having 'em in the years leading up to um today so Virginia is about two thirds cell phone mostly or a cell phone only users and so our sample\nWe we actually drop samples of cell phone numbers and so we do quotas on her cellphone versus wireline sample so we basically go into the field with the batter to third one third\nCellphone landlines split already um and we haven't found our response rate on cell phones to be any different than it has been which is not great um you know people typically aren't taking cell phone calls to do surveys like they were landline calls in the seventies to do surveys show we're not\nFinding it any more difficult than we were already um\nMore on them and and it's driven by this um all of this fishing that's been going on with our cell phone numbers lately\nThat I Can't remember what my phone number you know the money's recall from Idaho we're in right\nIn ... we did it they were two things that we do to try to help us with that we're done it by ourselves as Chris rooting for a university so we're not we're not an anonymous number or we're not unless the number you don't see who we are when we call and then um if you say look\nPut me on your do not call list will put you on our call is that we won't call you back or we don't have to do that because you know according to the federal regulations were doing research academic research we're not working we're not getting paid to\nDo this we're not making a profit show were considered um researchers so we don't have to comply with the do not call is do we do keep our own do not call list and if somebody says don't call me I don't want to do surveys then we'll put them on our do not call it so we try to be transparent getting that way as well\nThat's fascinating because most people go ah yeah I'm On those on those do not call was to me they are because because you are academic nature interesting so your turnout model is showing forty to forty five percent that's interesting because people I talked to the campaigns are they're hoping it's going to be around forty ...\nWell that's so that's so it depends on who you talk to 'em it could be forty eight um it could be higher I mean so here's the real sort of question\nThat I have in my head right so if there is a big blue wave if there are a lot of voters that are engaged right now who didn't even vote in twenty Seventeen\nThen we're missing them in our survey were not capturing that right and that some of the pushback I got back um when we went and put out our second district poll showing Taylor leading Luria some Democrats push back and said well you're not even capturing some of the voters that were newly registering in and they're going to vote okay fair enough\nBut we have the luxury in Virginia in in that we had a twenty Seventeen election that we think captured\nThat surge pretty well it it ... it brought Ralph Northam into the governor's mansion Ralph Northam on the second district by four percent first time a Democrat or one that district in about a decade so we think we twenty Seventeen cats that search pretty well\nBut it may be even bigger than and also Republicans have responded\nBy by engaging their base voters already know if they've done that we think we've captured them because they were already voters anyway but it turned out is higher I think it's going to help\n'em I don't know that helps one party over the other all the way it might be helpful to Democrats because it might be that extra surge that we might it might be a lot of new voters were not capturing\nSo you you you saw the surge I called it through suburban tsunami I'm twenty seven to ... you saw that you saw that coming in\nI I think you had to name your yeah we knew we were we were modeling\n'em in twenty Seventeen\nWe're modeling the same way but we were also looking for new the registered voters\n'em in twenty Seventeen because of that was that was that search that was the difference between twenty sixteen Seventeen with a lot of those new suburban voters um and so\nWe did see the surgeon twenty Seventeen we all know what it looked like in Virginia and so\nThere's nothing says to me that that's going to be any less this year than it was an twenty Seventeen and there are things to say to me it might be a little bit bigger than it is that it wasn't twenty Seventeen and by the way in twenty Seventeen the Republicans were as engaged as as you would want them to be insured for Democrats were a little bit more engaged\nSo you'd think it might be even bigger this year\nIt very well could be I don't think it can be much bigger but it's very well could be um Democrats in particular are trying to register new voters or they they were until the deadline and Republicans\nI'm weren't trying to register new voters as much as they were trying to mobilize their their base voters that are already there so I mean look at both parties it's not likely to be because we don't have a really robust statewide race going on 'em and we have ... competitive congressional races some places and not in other places so\nThat's part of the reason I'm thinking forty five\nBut if it ends up being forty eight it's because there were many there's massive turnout going on and some of these really competitive congressional races um I don't know\nIf you're a if you're if you're looking for a competitive state wide race to drive turnout we just don't have that this year and so that's part of the reason I'm hesitant to say it's going to go as high as forty eight but look I've been wrong many times and I'll be wrong many times in the future\n[laughter] goodness that's what I'm Talking about this new one not close\nClose um\nI you know I did what I find interesting\nAbout the statewide races that um it's not close yet you see Tim Kaine campaigning\nIn his ... his campaign campaigning as if it were close he's running ads on on every in every television network in in the commonwealth he's campaigning like he's got a a more for a bit of a formidable candidate that he has and I think there are two things going on I think Tim Kaine\nLeads to send a statement that I've moved beyond twenty sixteen um and and and sort of the difficulties of being the vice presidential candidate on the ticket in twenty sixteen but I think he's also recognizing that in some\nOf these are really close congressional races\nUm if he can pull any coattails um if you can rent out any ... tales\nIt could be really helpful to the Democratic candidates downtown and so I think oddly enough Tim Kaine is running a campaign to get re elected to the U.S Senate and running several congressional campaigns to elect Democrats um in in in some of these competitive races at the\nSame time um and he doesn't really have a challenger that has a lot of money but Corey Stewart is all over local talk radio which is where his voters are going to\nTo run to give voters out given um how difficult situation he hasn't had a little money is\nSo you're you have a statewide poll on that\nWe used we pulled the Senate race several times and then decided it wasn't going to be competitive to Poland um throughout the final stretch from Labor Day on instead decided to pull these congressional races because\nReally for the first time in probably decades in Virginia if if if a hundred and some odd years we've got a lot of a lot of really competitive congressional races going on so we decided to pull the congressional races instead of\nContinuing to pull what doesn't appear to be a very competitive Senate race\nBut we are we're wrapping up here in the segment with which you know final call here on what the Senate race is going to look like in the day\nWell probably somewhere Fifteen Fifteen ashes mine is where am I I'm at right now it could be a little bit higher could be a little bit lower if it's a little bit lower it's going to some of these congressional races are going to look really good for Republicans are going to be really tight if it's if it's higher if it's closer to twenty\nThan some of these democratic congressional candidates are going to have a better night I think\nFifty sixty seven fifty that range yeah OK anything moving a libertarian front and let me get an impact and all you\nKnow in in in in we we anticipated they might given that you know a lot of the country club Republicans might not be interesting Corey Stewart but at the end of the day\nWe're gonna we're very tribal period of our politics and if there's an hour by your name a lot of Republicans are going to vote for that and not actually give a libertarian or their vote so we don't see any uptick among libertarian candidates either state wide or\nIn each congressional races um there's a libertarian in Tempe this libertarian seven we're not seeing any uptick with either one of them\nOkay thanks Clinton kid recalling in looked like an opportunity last the Libertarian Party they had a chance to to crack the crack the marketing or a little bit in Virginia and they might have fallen short this is Chris ... filling in for the vacation and John products come on back\nI'm doing great hope you're well that is our third day this week we've seen each other on your stock stock and you know I haven't figured it out yeah\nLet's not go there [laughter] you're the elected got right now they don't yet so ah you know if you heard the last second was Clinton kids from Christopher Newport or are you seeing anything different than what Dr kids seeing out there\nWhen I heard back an interview [noise] sort of got this from the discussion\nThere for more of a way I'm seeing in regular contact with congressional campaign throughout the commonwealth and frankly most of them are doing really well [noise]\n\nElection night to just to which too\nI I see Santa or can they can clearly are either to\nBattlegrounds right now I think the other ones that perhaps people are looking out for themselves but I think Denver regularly is clearly running a far superior campaign there and start saying Denver um\nWill allow will be fine come election night on there has been some talk Scott Taylor's race scotch really working hard um I mean if perhaps we'll be closer to family otherwise would hope but I think at the end of the day Scott should be fine as well so that's where it comes back down to Barbara\nComstock in the town I'm Dave Brat and establish this way I see it at this point\nTo act as a conductor kid he didn't mention Nebraska spanberger racing I live in a district I see it every day at least in western in Rico county and there's a stark difference in what's going on the ground at least but I I pulled back and trying to do the objective follow the data you follow the data the Clinton kids writing falling what you're saying\nUm the Taylor and ... are the ones that are most in place bars you know changing I'm changing party right if they're accurate or you've got to interrupt my seven and Tom struck down by nine times like that\nSo if that's consistent and who's pulling your accurate\nUm it would probably show up if you if you do one on bread Stamberg and imagine that would but what he also pointed out obviously the quality of Kansas important local issues are important\nBut also what do you pointed out was he didn't see the big Kavanaugh kicker a that everyone in the talking about this is going to have this big search for Republicans or is it is it's pretty quiet people make up their mind just going to vote and she said Republicans would show up in midterms well\nAnd and I sort of see the latter I mean obviously what I'm looking at is totally um during a prior to the to the judge now justice Kavanaugh hearings um there was some um\nPerhaps apathy on the part of the Republican base um but that changed almost immediately or with those hearings sense\nRepublican base in Virginia and I think the Republican base around the country saw what a Democrat majority in the United States Senate and a Democratic majority in the house representatives under Speaker Pelosi would look like\nConstant um investigations calls for impeachment set of presidents investigations of justice calving off and so what I saw it as a state party chair was clear up\nTech and enthusiasm responsive to emails fundraising jump significantly as a result of that [noise] um as it's been step before somebody is going to write a check or\nSend some money to the party or a candidate they're more likely going to vote for that person as well so\nIt may not be showing up in the polls quite yet but I Believe that there is a renewed and as soon as he asked them they're clearly wasn't enthusiasm gap between the Republicans and the Democrats prior to the Kavanaugh hearings but I think that gap spin eliminated so now it's just a matter of turning our folks out\nSo you're seeing the enthusiasm chicken I talked to Morgan Griffith\nOne to ten ten being you know absolutely out of the month showing up no matter what\nHe said you know Democrats are around Ninety in my folks around thirty sit but my folks are now up\nAround ... or so he he he sensed that he felt on the ground inclined told me the same thing or so from the anecdotal standpoint I Do think there is a renewed a server in the in the Republican base but quite frankly getting a lot of what they want to know why selection as part of the hard thing in politics you know\nWhen you get what you want your show up are you satisfied or you know you're fat and happy new stay home because things are going pretty well what what's the point but I think the the cabin on things that are re energized refocused or at least the Republican based on a wanting to come out\nAnd vote but you're seeing that throughout the state\nI Am and I and I think\nYou're getting a lot of folks realize you're right I mean we've got what they wanted and twenty sixteen we have the president and acting tax cuts for\nThe economy was booming and\nOn for decades and certainly what price I'm complacency in that but then I think now the Republican base seeing all that can get done very quickly with the Democrats control the house and\nSenate and so I think Republicans are saying we've got to roll up our sleeves and if we want to keep what we've got we've got to go to the polls and vote for it\nUsually the cycles Baltics right so what has the new chairman of the Republican Party in Virginia or what is the next step for ... where are you all go on what's your Republican in Virginia but you only got\n... you look at Virginia and Maryland you have to give to very strange electorate you have a democratic Maryland with a Republican governor who looks like you're going to win three Fifteen or twenty points in Virginia which has been a battleground trending now towards a blue state\nGym chain Clinton just thinks he's gonna win by Fifteen offers probably maybe twenty points as well you didn't really have this dichotomy don't you across the Potomac were were then the dynamics in politics the change in Massachusetts has a Republican governor is\nA result polling are the leading Democrats in the state you know Charlie Baker you have a governor governor of Illinois\nUm is is is the ... other Republicans in Virginia writes for the electorate\nWell I I think what you're saying obviously I don't know that in our current climate in Virginia whether any of the three candidates you mentioned governor Hogan and others who work with securing the Republican nomination\nIn Virginia right now but I think what we're recognizing than I Am sort of sense to perhaps a more pragmatic approach among Republicans I'm again coming out of the Kavanaugh hearings I'm somebody here six months ago had mentioned you know Susan Collins and Lindsey Graham the I'm\nSort of the star wars for the Republican Party people to laugh but now I'm getting requested how can we bring Lindsey Graham speaking Virginia for candidates and and have a feature speaker and places and so I think the Kavanaugh hearings may have shown\nThat what we need to do is have a broader based in the Republican Party that can bring conservatives together around core principles and perhaps\nStart winning again [laughter] again the cycle because look both parties are having their\nTheir ah ... in the next time battles right I mean there are the Democrats have their own battles Republicans are having their battles were going to have some posters\nNot pollsters uh some operatives from Iowa New Hampshire calling in at nine o'clock Irish should listen to that we have one calling in from a Democrat from Iowa Republican mantra is going to tell us what's going on there are said to the national caucuses because that's really what they are really\nOnly I say I don't have time to worry about that I got there we got us holding out for things up for re election but they're not worried about twenty twenty after we went in to preserve our best Jordan's in the house next year in Virginia and\nGenerally push back here because the dominant theme in American politics is what's going on in Washington DC and it's being reflected back in in the states and in the local to the districts because Trump is the issue right now since\nSince June fifteenth of twenty Fifteen\nThat man has driven the conversation every day in American politics and if you know four hundred and Seventy two days away from from the Iowa caucuses people going to be focusing on those issues\nBut it's going to get very retail very quickly why all the Virginia races are going on and that's the beauty and the dynamic of Virginia politics isn't it because we are we are the polls\nWe take the temperature all the time\n... that's exactly right and I think um for a congressional candidate this year I think our last year gave them sort of a wake up call and they can see OK perhaps around to roll up our sleeves and work much harder than we thought we were going to have to and so\nUm you're right this year will sort of perhaps give us a preview of what we can expect and twenty nine teams but that will be a sort of a pulse of the of the country as you say\nBecause we have the entire general assembly up\nIn this time next year ... all one hundred and forty members the or the district to the general assembly are going to be up for election and there's so many issues at play and what Clinton kid was talking about when he's sitting in his polling is that quality candidates matter and local issues matter I got an email last night from a former colleague of mine\nTalking about Corey in northern Virginia and basically local development and he was engaged and you also thins out emails on traffic patterns and potholes and I'm like this is not what you're doing the general assembly but if that's what the voters want they want someone talking about it right\nBut I I think that's right people are really looking for results from their elected officials and the things that are impacting most people today\nWith a booming economy [noise] job I'm\nStrong and what do you just grow and people are looking at some of those other issues that impact them on a daily basis traffic and tolls up in northern Virginia and as you say bottles and and and more rural areas of the country those are things that people are focused on now because their kitchen table issues are doing great\n[noise]\nThis is our town hall dot com or Thomas [noise]\nPresident Trump says it's one of\nThe

just like ... are you able to maintain that\nYes you know I I Am you know I'm blessed to represent great post and the the first district you know I get my energy from there they are they're very happy\nTo work hard every day and die do do great work so it's hard not to be motivated by that but it it's hard not to be motivated to by the by the cruise\nBeen in that position and like the office and going back and get re energized but are you a worn down by Washington at all\nPlayed out I mean I think at certain times it it it does it does\nGive you pause as to you know where we are in the country and the divisions that are out there but but I always work everyday to try to find places where we agree I think I think today it takes a little more effort to do that but you know I'd been successful in finding places where we agree and working out and get those things that I think that's\nIs that you have deadlines are constitutionally a enacted that hold the line on these things you can go to continuing resolution that's an awful term\nA awful but they also I I Love the single object rule in places where you where do you deal with one subject and that's it so you don't have the big mash up coming back from the other from the Senate or vice versa\nThat just blows up the whole deal\nNo I agree and and you know be a good good good is that\nIn the in the U.S house we operate the same rules that you are on during the general assembly jak or you're not do that is the\nSpeed you figure out the rules about how things are happening on the Senate has different rules so it's kind of get combined together and you look at how to address is related in\nAny way shape or form and the the the\nThe the most highlighted example is where a political act passed the title of the bill was gone the horrible act they they\nThey took they took a Senate bill ... all the language out of it kept the bumper and the title of the survey or the house version of the Affordable CARE Act so it it it's that kind of\nProcedural stuff that's just shakes her head why how could that happen\nBut I Would argue that you know sticking with the logic of systems like you see in your business manual is the way to make sure that you keep debating our track you make sure you don't have a lot of you know aren't related to a piece of legislation people go how did that get in there and it's like\nYou know throwing everything on the last train leaving the stakes are so I\nKnow that stuff doesn't doesn't belong or there are a spot related strictly views you know as as as a vehicle to pass things that aren't aren't related so I agree that that's one of them I think the problems up here is that it doesn't it doesn't require the necessary debate in ...\nWhen you're using that mechanism when you have unrelated aspects of legislation language to bill people just you know look at it and go how how could that happen\nWell I Hope you're well we'll take a look at some of the rules and get more coverage in your way of governing up in DC because I I one of the things that are when you pull back from politics and watch sports\nPeople get upset when they see rules violations because they know the rules risk I mean last night there was just in Berlin or through as a slider\nThat that is a pitch it when you are warming up there you put your mid down and say grab Patel I'm done that's a perfect pitch and it was it was called the ball and the next pitch the Boston Red Sox guy in it for a home run\nAnd as a as a stand your ground that's outrageous only because the the the teleprompter had on there the strike zone so you knew you could see that that was a real violation right you saw that that was wrong\nAnd then what happens when people in in politics people got they don't know the rules to get upset about that's just not cricket you're not doing it the right way guys you know we deserve better and so they pulled back behind the ... they they shrugged their shoulders they throw their hands and\nYou know it's just it's just not working on on on my on my behalf you know I I don't get it right in the distance and or anything you can do to to to change that up would be for the benefit end of my rent let's get back to the absolute let's get back to the congressional district what what are your voters telling you\nBut you know are you a hug stay well I think ... that they're very interesting how do we get\nA continual I'm In queens that our economy people are very positive about what the topic is just a big push a wet sponge Bob Palmer's lessening regulatory burden\nAnd

that we're looking at potentially providing incentives for a certain kind of their community and the return on that\nCome back and provided them that actual economic impact if they went forward with a business and the impact that it had on the community with everything from revenue to job creation\nOther aspects and that way out we've done valuations of um you know criminal justice programs there the implementation of a mental health program or a drug treatment program on reducing recidivism for local jail or a community partner we worked with a non profit\nFrom everything from their valuation of the programs in projects that they do to coordinating and combining the\nActual help they need with regards to our students and our staff\nAre in their community program and then we've done some work with the public sector and private sector as well on the business community looking at\nA third party evaluations of programs in projects for the private sector are looking to pitch to the general assembly and need an actual\nThird party non biased evaluation of that work being able to provide that report for that company for the general assembly to look at legislative impact so we're we're any continual partner every single day with our local and state governments around the commonwealth um\nAnd it it really is what we live and breathe in the wild or school specifically um reviewing it at a much more um cars to get our private sector counterparts if you will\nBecause it really is our mission in our vision and it allows us can bring to our academic experts he says well

going there because I think it's so important for people to understand the totality of a lot of things and governments especially hunter users which has the bulls on his back around the country but in Virginia we've got a great time\nAppropriate to hold them accountable and ask some questions but\nA lot of things you're talking about art free\nThey are exclusive of of usual operation and they are a
