doesn't matter it's embarrassing\nAnd um there's other polling that we trust that showed that right now it's a toss up but\nYou're you're you're not going to hear from anybody in the fake news that it's a toss up\nYou're going to hear from everybody in the fake news push poll now are first agenda driven propaganda media that the Republicans are going to get a lambasted and pillows are going to be speaker and the going to lose the seat center to sue nominee is a blue wave and they're probably going to win the Senate chew and\nTrump is going to get impeached and you might as well stay home closed windows in the blood that same thing they said in two thousand sixteen uh I'll never forget going on with Bob Beck hold on Donald lemon before the election and Bob Beck oh\nTelling me that he's got polling numbers showing that Clinton was pulling ahead in Texas right there I said to myself you know there are there is no poll anywhere with any legitimate state that has Trump losing taxes so you'll live you just make this up you get a push poll\nAnd you put it on a TV to the press Texas Republican Trump voters that's all you do and of course the president won Texas handling\nThis is what they do and they do it right about now twenty six days that when people start focusing and it's all coordinated and the soul in lock step\nAnd it's all going to be the same nonsense and that's why you attorney and every day so I can balance it with some authenticity of this race in the house is right now the people that have a legitimate polls are telling me it is a toss up democratic\nInsiders are telling me it's a toss up and the Republicans are going to gain five seats in the Senate no they're not going to win Arizona they're not\nGoing to win North Dakota they're not going to hold Indiana they're not going to win Florida they're not going to win any of these like they're they're not going to hold West Virginia they're not going to hold Missouri they're going to lose them\nAll oh we're gonna have a big night on November ...

I forget the name of the book I'll look it up in a minute I read the book I Can't I Can't remember the title of it but a whole big you know multi hundred page book about the incredible data operation of the\nObama campaign right they went out there and they were using Facebook and they were using digital technology and they had you know all kinds of cool bells and whistles\nThat they were able to target voters right down to the individual level\nOf course when Donald\nTrump did this became a huge scandal oh my God they ripped off our private information but when Obama did it it was this huge great leap forward there were that were the shore of the Democrats electro superiority or forever for the rest of the end of history [noise] um I expected a similar book\nIn a similar investigation after the polling fiasco were all the polls got it so wrong they want to you or not a word not a peep\nThese pollsters they got it wrong and twenty sixteen you never seen a single word from them explaining how they got it wrong\nIf they haven't explained how they got it wrong how could they fix it answer they didn't\n[laughter] [noise]\nWhat would you if you went into the supermarket\nAnd you bought a brand of ground hamburger meat and took it home and found there was a rat in it or you go back and buy more hamburger meat from that same store now I don't think so\nBut but you're you're going on the you're going under presumption that these companies and the pollsters are trying to do a legitimate poll and they just had bad\nOr they had a near methodology was wrong that's that's your premise of the conversation or that's what we believed basically in two thousand sixteen right in December I changed my position now because we know better you'll learn too much\nThat they know the methodology is wrong they they do it wrong on purpose\nSo they can drive the narrative I mean look I saw it in Virginia with the Christopher Newport university poll that came out I must have been for the Virginia election\nSaying that Trump was it thirty five percent and was getting beat by Eighteen like Clinton that's going to lose like Eighteen but the poll was done in a way to this spirit well supporters and voters in Virginia\nSo was it was produced contrived push poll narrative there's right and it was false methodology in order to in order to disappear it my entire\nDoors on a Sunday in a Saturday when he got other things to do when you see when Christopher Newport university is putting a poll out\nSaying that we're down by like John Wayne exactly right that's what they do know what\nThey're doing the doing it wrong they're taking these are junk polls polling with a purpose the purpose is to spirit the spirit of stirs feared our side and suppress the vote suppressed enthusiasm suppress the vote suppress turnout\nAnd that's exactly what they're doing they that's why they didn't want to do the articles\nThat it really comes down to the grid methodology they found the methodology the day before they conducted the poll shows that are exactly what they're doing and where you go\nTo suppress search results make it harder to find information about the Trump the pro Trump candidates [noise] Google is becoming useless\nI Do searches on Google I get the same story for three four five six pages [noise] used to be you get a whole bunch of different stories on a given topic are given a subject they get a whole bunch of different search results I get the same same darn thing and it's all from the Washington Post\nAnd then every newspaper that repeats the Washington Post rise service gives you the same story as ridiculous\nFake news and it's now say pole and the polls working injunction or the state polls put out a fake poll to drive in a propaganda narrative and then the fake news picks it up and then propagate to the polls with the fake news and all they coordinated effort to drive down Republican enthusiasm\nAnd tell Trump voters hey look you're really too stupid to have a job anyway so stay home and have a beer\nI mean that's the purpose of these Curtis I talked to John McLaughlin and this all came clear to me maybe it was three days ago I I don't know what's today Thursday or friday Thursday I talked to John McLaughlin Sunday night bright you and I go back what John I Know I go back within thirty five years\nI went to college with them or in in in in in in New Jersey I ...

were going to win two hundred and two there were thirty seats up for grabs\nAnd uh without attribution he said we need to win sixteen states and below sea will be speaker on those thirty\nNow that makes sense to me and I told him what are the odds on it and he said fifty fifty so how do you need to see CNN saying the Democrats are going to win sixty cents how do you how do you do that\nWell

[noise]\nI think we have a lot of [noise]\nWe're at a time thank you Barbara for being with us a Republican congresswoman Barbara Comstock representing the temperature ... district of Virginia she's up for a third term on November ... Barbara people want more information or did they go\nTo work hard time getting a lot of State Clinton oh wait a while you are not in it that way [noise]\nThat you're hearing\nOn the\nWebsite again Barbara Congress\nAre trying to sort of the state from getting on the information that they can get it down as well\nI just want to remind our listeners that uh everybody knows that listens to me I was a vehemently opposed to Patriot Act one\nSon of Patriot Act when it's sunset it you were a lonely voice in the U.S Senate I remember you did\nThe filibuster for some time in opposing in questioning\nOr the ... the Patriot act you were right and then you are right now I was right than I Am right now and just so my audience knows\nThis whole wiser thing a quarter page and a huge dropping on the Trump campaign and the phone he finds that Warren none of that could have happened without the shapes your act that set that up and you were the one that said you keep covering ... giving government is unlimited power\nOf surveillance and its eventually got to come around and bite you in the bud center that's exactly what happened\nBut I had the same very saying the conversation yesterday with the director of the art because I asked point blank argue gathering information including the president's phone calls and of course he's butter and said oh that hurts without setting\nAnd the answer for it and I sent me answer yes there was an article about two or three years ago saying the recording Fifteen hundred of President Obama's don't call the membrane men in my hand which means ... markets and loud but I have to tell when President Obama or President Trump is talking to a foreign leader here they're\nHaving their voices [noise] even if your men in March or in a parked out the names that you can't tell who the oysters are but we shouldn't be doing now we're listening to members do Congress's conversations were listening to journalists conversations businessmen\nCan search this data without a warrant\nAnd my client him was and I think he didn't understand it or to the standard is if you're recording things on potential terrorists from overseas the cost of government roll your car but if they're talking to Americans who are just random people are talking to American we do get constitutional protections because\nMany phone calls are discussions with terrorists in fact the vast majority are innocent international phone calls\nAnd so we have had this discussion with them and uh it should be protected by the cost cutting back some say the Fourth Amendment John Adams set of the spark that led to the revolution because when you're like the British soldiers coming into our houses you know breaking down there to see if we pay our Sam tax [noise]\nUh we really wanted protection that we wanted to say the government and never come at your house or take any progress\nConversations are belongings without talking to her first\nWell and that's a that's why you were so adamantly opposed to when you were a predictor of the future with this whole thing\nSenator uh you've also been a very strong voice on the disappearance of\n... to ... there's a lot of talk about what should be done and we want more information and like I get that but as a member of the Foreign Relations committee you're the only senator that has proposed action which is until we get answers on his disappearance because\nCenter the thing is we haven't videotape showing that he went in there was nobody on tape showing that he went out and I'm a crown prince MPs Mohammed bin Salman sent a the camera footage once corrupted or the battery went dead\nThey can't really only by that is like\nThe dog ate my homework or I didn't get ever ready battery and so the battery died now you have called for an immediate suspension of the arms sales to the Saudis until we get some kind of a satisfactory answer can you elaborate on that sir\nI think everybody should remember that Saudi Arabia is the largest state sponsor of radical\nIslam around the world what I mean by that is the hip and the funding for\nMcGraw authors in Pakistan in the Philippines\nEven in the United states teaching career the west bank of Christianity and teaching radical violent jihad disappear the salaries are we shouldn't be telling a weapon simply because of that Fifteen of the Nineteen hijackers who carrying here were from Saudi Arabia\nSaudi Arabia is a big part of our terrorism problem they have fun or sort of terrorism and teaching of radical Islam around the world their latest episode\nUh actually no way that this could have happened without the Saudi Government being your thought too crowded planes were cleaning the guys on on some of them have been linked to Saudi security services in intelligence I'm now it doesn't pass the smell test and\nYou know we just wait it out to the president this morning he described arms\nSales to halt the arms sales at sea\nOf thousands of civilians killed in Yemen\nThey're doing it with our bombs\nWhen we're refueling they're flying in there and it's a big flyer and two weeks ago or three weeks ago the great they kill the school bus full of children if school children were killed by a year ago they killed a hundred and fifty people in a funeral procession and we wonder why someone in Yemen wants to drop a bomb on and kill or either Saudi are killing American\nBecause they climb the fragments of the bombs or say American American guy and so we have to realize there are a reaction or something and and that's a blowback\nFrom us being involved in some ... gotten civil war is one that we actually create more terrorists but here's the other possible thing that's going to happen\nAgain or what happened in Libya when we toppled Gadhafi we've got chaos and more terrorism it became a breeding ground for terrorism market here is that there is some remnants of fairly fairly strong record of alligator India but we're not fighting them that were mentioned are stricter civil\nWar between the ... and the Saudis and also within rainy and influence as well but my fear is that it sends it off and that you get to ride out there it's the same thing happened in Syria as their\nCivil war and we got involved in standard into chaos you got the rise of ISIS\nWell actually uh the network that I go on June near a a couple of about a month ago was reporting that al Qaida fighters were actually given safe haven or by the by the Saudi forces in Yemen in ... in in order to fight the Houthis so\nWouldn't it wouldn't be surprising because who did the Saudis support in Syria they supported out on the news round which is essentially an offshoot\nOf out so the Saudis are always poor people who hate America will have a western wires and yet retired regard as the president says I Do it\nFor a job or creating jobs that's not something that we are considering what we argue arms deals we need to be considering our national security not trying to have some sort of Keynesian jobs cook\nYou're on the John triggers radio network truck in the truth across America we're with Kentucky Senator Rand Paul Republicans on the Foreign Relations committee a he's been the strongest own voice in the U.S Senate on\nHow we react to the uh Jamal ... disappearance\nSo have you recommended this to the president\nCenter have you on a direct conversation can remember a look since I was an original Trump supporter everybody knows day when it came down the escalator he campaigned on getting out of these entanglements not staying in the have you had a direct conversation with the president on how we should react to this\nNonsense going out of the journal asked um he does you know my feelings are talking about once every week or two and when we have our conversation as a general ours by saying\nThat uh he has the same landscape says that I Do that with the Afghan or to log in Iraq was a mistake you sit there on a million times [noise] your condition instincts on Syria\nOut in the that's the real problem as I can to presidents instincts are good I'm sort of in the crowd at what the president bigger president right and
