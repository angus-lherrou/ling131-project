great to have you been good morning John\nOkay what a great speech the president yesterday I Know you saw it you know starts out\nApologizing to the American people for the debacle for the clown show the Democrats put on\nWhich was a great opening and that was their lives and\nI was always for roe was back in the media so it was right near front and center and I was kind of shocked by it and I thought it was great and then he also apologized to judge Kavanaugh and his family for having a job through the nonsense and a lot of polls showing Korea now that the Democrats overplay their hand backfiring\nThat Trump voters are wired up one using on the ground\nTrump supporters are concerned and nothing will change within the White House nothing will change with Trump's enemy at the same thing will go on that the only way you're going to get changes they lose a when\nYou still get in there and clean house answer that question\nJohn the answer is yes and if the Republicans win or lose you know historical precedent has said that after a midterm election there are changes in the ministry and whether that cabinet members\nWhether staff members in the building or whether it's senior member of the different departments that historically has happened I think will happen again regardless of the color of the election that will happen but when we predict what's going to happen in my opinion\nRosen tea leaves in four weeks off for a month or two years or whatever it is he will go out and he will do exactly what Jim Comey\nExactly what McCain did what all these guys do go out and they write these books they got these massive advances and then they say about their time in the White House or their time in the department of justice [noise] ah you know that everyone could save America from this president that's what they're going to do that's my prediction I'm certain that will happen\nI'm certain there are other people who are inside the administration\nWill have served in Mr ... who are going to do the same thing this is a game plan now John we've seen it for two years great people go in there they certainly\nThat capacity and then they go they write a book with Jim ... book so a lot of copies Jim very very wealthy\nAnd that's where these guys want to do the kids' book comes out in early December ... McCabe who is the director of the FBI who was\nFired for most other reason you know what the lying to the FBI under oath on three occasions he was fired for that book is coming up and get the all profit off of Donald Trump\nAnd settled in the book world stories about Donald Trump we've seen it now it's\nBut my guess is Robert Robert Rohde when she was going to do he will use his perch and number two person at the department of justice\nTo refineries whether he's firing quits to go and write a book and just you know be screening against this president because that's how these guys stay alive and these guys stayed you know in the public arena and it really it's a terrible terrible thing to be honest with you\nAgree with the new allegations out now that the rosters seen comments that he was going to attempt to wired wired shape the president\nAnd they do with the tape set him off and then go to the cabinet to invoke the choices to get them out I get to FBI has to be a senior official saying they believe them and they thought he was dead serious\nThey reported that to a shelter James Baker he thought it was serious McCain sort of a series of the planets away now just to information\nAre old that's off I mean why doesn't the smartest guy now\nLooking at I think I think you're exactly right I think the president wants to get through this election cycle doesn't want anything to distract the Republicans have momentum on their side but I Do think you have to look long term at\nThe ability of Rod Rosenstein to stay in that position what it wants to leave the position he can do that anytime he can resign if he wants to but I think you have to call into question does he have the ability to continue in his capacity\nAnd the deputy attorney general based on the information that we're hearing from other members other senior\nMembers that served with him in official capacity in the department of justice or the FBI they're saying that their accounting for what McCain said\nTo be true that she was very troubling to everybody and we do know unequivocally that Rod Rosenstein you signed one of the fires that application renewable which allowed them to continue to spy on American citizens on us soil application\nEver been made available to the president is not on redacted that we need that we need to see that we need to see the three other choose which are the FBI's milk after they talked to Bruce or at the department of justice to see what's in there and we have to understand what the insurance\nPolicy wise to keep Donald Trump from being elected to the FBI was\nTalking about and what role if any Rod Rosenstein how to him that because at the deputy attorney general he had the right to sign\nThat fight application and from what I understand and what is becoming widely known now\nNot by application was riddled with mistakes and and it was based on the premise about the dossier that last renewable what should we decide when Donald Trump with the president of the United states and the American people deserve the right\nTo see what was in that renewal applications that Rod Rosenstein\nSo would you recommend to the president's Robin does November\nAnd look at what I Would recommend to the president is declassified all the documents looking\nBecause of what Jim combing and Amy McCain and now James Baker and Peter stock and Lisa Page and have done that organization is just devastating it will take decades to recover from what they have done jet organization\nTrying to use their positions people with a party people when badges going after American citizens spying on American citizens\nBecause they didn't like the political affiliation of their opponents everything that our country has been against centers\nInception and giants like Peter Struck\nWho are the head of the counterterrorism unit\nHad more ability than anybody he was one box to the Clinton email investigation he's\nThe one who led the team that was called a crushed by hurricane that said hey there's nothing is being these extra six hundred thousand mail there are all part of me when there's a long time and he's the one who said hey let's go after Donald Trump ... investigations we've seen\nIt now with the text messages between at least a page and Peter Struck and they were at least minimum complicit with what Jim Comey and McCain and Jim Baker and potentially steam want it done and the question is John and this is a very very big question how did this go\nIn the U.S government we know that the director of the CIA\nAnd the DNI director of national intelligence and others were aware of their spine going on on domestic soil against us since but exactly how high gear to go to the biggest untold story of the last two years and get this could lead right up to the very top of the government\nNeeds to be which leads to Jeff Sessions what happens to Jeff Sessions I mean he's not doing anything\nLaunching any of these special counsel to investigate would you alleged to be the biggest scandal in the United states history ever spying on people for political gain\nAll the way up to do you know and everything else where Jeff Sessions\nWill look this whole investigation has been by and large turned over to the ige the inspector general of the department of justice to find out if there's been any wrongdoing and we've seen some of that report already because it's been released publically the report that recommended\nThe number two person at the FBI and they're only be fired but charged criminally\nWe're waiting for that to occur uh we're waiting to see what happens to be struck and Lisa Page and and and Jim Baker the general counsel from the FBI we're waiting to find out what happened to the gym combing because\nIt is very possible that Jim Comey has brought up on charges of potentially perjury in front of Congress leaking of classified information even though Jim said he didn't think it was classified that's not an excuse\nWouldn't do that he gave his notes his work product which was he was not allowed to do to Z a law professor to make sure that get leaked out to the media there's been no accountability anybody at any level of the government for what they've done which was tried it a try\nBy and large and they did not want to see Trump become President Trump and I don't understand what kind of it and why and how they come out yet\nNovember seventh or are we going to clean house or not\nI Hope so John I really hope so and I and I and I hope for the president's take on that he has a tune that\nFocus on helping him achieve all over the result\nWhich he's been able to do by and large almost singlehandedly if you look at what this president's been able to accomplish what three point seven percent unemployment the lowest unemployment rate for African Americans and Hispanics down some of this ah with the help of its athletes in lieu of staff quite candidly and we've seen\nIn the Woodward book or the staff tried on multiple occasions to stop him from doing things and\nStopping trying to stop them from being successful but he's persevered guard down and counting historic\nLevels chips for a second it's [laughter] that's surrounded him actually wanted him to be successful thinking how much more he could accomplish so much already but there are still people who don't want to see him be successful there are still people who serve\nAnd the government or whether they're bureaucrats elected officials or people who have taken positions that didn't support him in the campaign and they're still trying to stop\nAs a gender at every turn and all of the success that he has had in the first\nIn the administration working uh supposedly on behalf\nAnd various physician who's goal is to undermine other presidents agenda and if you if you think this is not real\nThank you get this has got to be the blockbuster buck is one of\nBooks when the when the excerpts come on it's it's got to be absolutely stunning Washington because all the other stuff was here say this is gonna be here's a list of the people that are undermining the president who put on a badge everyday and going to the west wing or\nAnd they're basically a ruse are guys they're spy if you will and they're working for the opposition and they're never truckers and they were put there by treatment that's what's going to happen\nIf the if the Republicans could somehow\nManaged to hang on to these midterms fasten your seatbelt because that's present a clean house and he's got to bring people in there that actually believe that it's America first agenda that will work tirelessly in order to pursue its goals and you ain't seen nothing yet\nIf you look at the if you if you look at President Trump's accomplishments in the last twenty months it Johnny\nEspecially in the face of opposition within his own staff I mean forget the other party forget policy and Schumer forget the Democrats forget the never Trump present Congress forget them\nHis team that come in their everyday in council had entered taking things on his desk\nAnd manipulating information and fighting\nHim and a slow walking things installing things\nIncluding his treasury secretary ...\nThe other one from Goldman Sachs who tried to undermine every single trade deal that the president made by a free trader and his friends on Wall street and Goldman Sachs they want they want cheap goods and higher profits they don't care if you have a job or not what they'll\nLay care they haven't cared about us thirty or forty years old they care about is how big your bonuses and how much profit can they drive in the business schools now teach that they teach equity for ownership workers are commodity\nYeah Gary Cohn and they're fighting them I mean it goes on and\nSo I look forward to that and I I look forward to finally the president being able to get in a position where we can actually get some things done\nEven though we have gotten things done but imagine how much more effective even if we can get to a point where the people surrounding him actually believe that his agenda\nAnd I for one hopes that a court goes in there and some senior capacity because I think it'd be great\nJohn treasuries radio network truck the truth across America [noise] so we have a a resignation\nAmbassador resides Nikki Haley now I'm not a Nikki Haley fan I don't like her I never did sorry she was the never Trump or we for run a campaign she embarrass herself by\nA joint one of those uh uh ... what do you call it response speeches to Obama and trashing Trump instead of using it to respond to the president she spent half a speech trashing Trump She was the never Trump or from the beginning\nOkay Trump is unique ability of being able to pick enemies that he thinks they're confident she has been a top of that\nA U.S ambassador and she's had to embrace Trump's policies but she's also publicly different with the president\nOn a number of issues and deep down she doesn't believe any of the stuff and so I don't know why she left I mean she says she's tired or she needs to make more money I Know her family's in debt I mean you think about it I don't\nI don't know I think your husband was military but you got two children teenagers she lives in New York City you don't get a stipend for that you get a hundred and Seventy nine thousand dollars as a UN ambassador and you've got to live in New York City oh good ... good luck with that\nYou have to find all that I mean it's a lot of money and so she's been governor [laughter]\nAnd so she broke and I I get that\nI get her leaving to make more money in the private sector and why not\nNow where you can make millions of dollars and get rich because that's what everybody does do serve the government get out get rich becoming a millionaire then go then go back then serve again then get out make\nShould the government swamp way and everybody's involved in both both sides of the aisle and all you only have to do is get a get appointed to a government position and you're guaranteed to have it makes a mansion in northern Virginia or a\nYou're guaranteed you got to make millions of dollars by doing nothing except serving the government writing a book going on TV and a funny way and I'm sure that you know Nikki Haley will write a tell all book about you know how Trump's socks 'cause that's what they're going to do\nThat's what sells I don't\nI never did and uh she was certainly a competent UN ambassador but I had no interest\nAnd why don't you leave it at this time\nWhat ... have been better if she could have hung out for another twenty nine days twenty eight days now until November seventh and then decided to leave shark because it's another day\nNot talking about the tremendous economy while the accomplishments that Trump is having Kavanaugh\nIt's another day we're not talking about the success of the America First agenda it's another day we're just changing the subject talking about something else and it plays right into the Democrats hands that don't want to talk about\nAnything that has anything to do with the economy period\n[noise] you know now that the ...\nNow the Democrats big push is Obamacare now the running I'm On that health care or they can't run on Medicaid for all because it's Twenty one trillion dollars [noise] excuse me so they can't run on\nThat so what are they what are they running on\nOur pre existing conditions that spent everything they found in some polls someplace that people are concerned about getting rid of Obamacare because that would get rid of pre existing conditions so if you voted for a\nEvery place whatever that monstrosity was that Paul Ryan had 'em\nThat still had preexisting conditions but the judge companies could raise your rates so that's the one issue now\nThat it's come full circle preexisting conditions and a Trump sucks that's their that's their that's their campaign platform who's going to replace Nikki Haley well the front runner\nThere's two front runners and then there's um two choices I've got\nThe front runner right now is Dina pile she was um in the national security division she is a bushy um and it never Trump or but\nAnd the family likes her and she was just on vacation last week in South Carolina with a ... a day to power and her husband so she is the front runner\nI Would say right now I Would suppose and certainly the establishment pick to replace Nikki Haley a month two choices do include being a ... I'm sure she'd be fun uh\nGrinnell\nExperience who's been in the state to apartment who's been at the un\nWho shares Trump's America First general with a lot of enthusiasm especially at real as it relates to foreign policy or that will be choices number two my choice number one would be his daughter Ivanka Trump hands down she would be the best choice no doubt\nI don't think it's going to choose or he's afraid of being accused of nepotism especially before the midterms I don't see it happening but she's in my mind she'd be the best choice\nBut if I could put a statement out yesterday saying that she's not interested in in the position that doesn't mean that can happen\nBut if you had to walk in there at least you have someone who actually believes in the president's agenda I'm sure Dina power will be fine\nThink a record that would be a better choice\n\nI mean at some point you have to start to reward the people who are with you from the beginning like record now you know he was a high profile gay Republican who came out for Trump very early Nikki Haley for Trump the hallway\n\nSo at some point in this administration you have to start to reward the people who believes in you know what the beginning who stuck by you went to a beginning who never wavered like right now and actually believe in the things that you're that you're saying and don't have to\nRetrofit their own policies to tell your lot\nNow there's no sense of urgency here John Bolton was in charge of it he was there and he was UN ambassador he knows what he's doing so it's not like the bridge and how to get to chill tomorrow when you've gone through the uh annual United Nations general assembly meeting so that's over\nBut those would be my choices are but if I have to select somebody if I had to protect now I just got to be getting a pile\n\nAnd he was also very\nMuch liked\n[noise]\nThat's our town halls on job nominates Thomas [noise]\nGusty winds and driving range profiting parts of

in twenty Fifteen\nIn the manufacturing town of eerie Pennsylvania\nThe president will campaign for representative Lou Barletta\nEarly supporter of ah the president suit trails badly against Bob casey junior\n[noise]\nSay she's always tough to beat in Pennsylvania and he was a pro life Democrat\nUm he basically presents himself as a moderate but a liberal either way behind there and I liked Lou and I'm Sorry he ran for Senate because I didn't really think he was going to win and\nAre really going to miss him in the house so I'm very disappointed in and this and although Lou looks like he's pretty much a lost cause a\nTrump's visit there could help House Republicans who are facing a what some Democrats are saying a bloodbath in Pennsylvania during the redrawn congressional district map\nSo Pennsylvania is where the Democrats are going to get a lot of states that have Republican retirements and redrawn maps and it's all bad so they're going to gain a ton of seats in Pennsylvania and CNN has got to say that Pennsylvania has slipped back\nTo ... to ... have a flip like\nWow flipped back\nBlow is what the pundits are going to say on election night even though it's a direct result of maps changing so we'll say\nAlso the generic poll that was out by CNN yesterday showing the Democrats are by Thirteen is a complete fraud\nI mean he took about fake news CNN is beyond fake news now they're just a propaganda machine it's a joke CNN is a complete joke\nGym do you know the people in my industry that talk to you off the record thinks that CNN is like a clown show it it you know they've had to complete shows a with Stormy Daniels talking about the president's\nPenis do you realize that I mean how far this network has fallen\nI mean this was the original brainchild of Ted

Bernard ... there and the bombs were going off I mean it was like nothing ever seen\nAnd it is now granted itself down to a comic book CNN is a comic book it's really a joke why people spend a dime advertising on them I don't know they've got the Democrats\nProbably Thirteen I talked to John McLaughlin\nLast night of McLachlan online McLaughlin polling on line\nAnd the Democrats applies strict well I said to them what's the difference fix the Thirteen I mean that's a huge spread\nHow can CNN said Thirteen and you'd say sex you said it's very simple we use a likely\nVoters model so we look at likely voters CNN just cause people up they don't call likely voters they called voters so what do they voted it or not there in the mix\nAnd that always skewed towards the Democrats and he said it also they they manipulate the question [noise] so he said seeing that doesn't do a poll they do a push poll the push pull means we want to get a certain result so we can spread that\nIn the news and the press Republican voters so they won't make phone calls work each cetera nobody wants to put time and for a lost cause and so when he was telling me is the CNN polling is fake news it's a push\nPoll is designed to set a narrative in order to influence a result that's why the network is a complete and utter joke that's where I don't want it anymore\nAnd I hung in there a long time I saw

then you start with diplomatic pressure I I don't think you\nJump immediately economic pressure but I think you start with a diplomatic pressure and then if you get no answers then you start working

conditions Democrats are saying that even a failed\nSo could become a potential political weapon against Republican candidate in the fall and the final uh twenty seven days here\nAnd all polling shows that a majority of Americans the one thing about Obamacare they really like is the fact that you can't be rejected for pre existing conditions nor can your prices get jacked up how did the Republicans responder\nOn him and I haven't seen the Senate bill but I Will tell you that the bill that we had in the house that we pass this is what House members can say\nHey protection for pre existing conditions go right into the one that we sent over to the Senate the language is very clear Democrats have been you know trying to mislead people by saying that you know\nIf you stood on one foot and lean to the left in the heavy when it might not ... I mean it's just not accurate the pre existing conditions were there I was in Johnson City\nThe mission and I think that's what you respond within you know a lot of it is smoke and mirrors that the Democrats are just playing politics with just like they did with the Kevin I'll situation 'cause that's fresh and the voters' minds and we're not going to do anything to pre existing conditions that one in favor of the Republicans prior\nTo Obama and the Democrats take control was they never dealt adequately with that and we are not going to make that mistake again we're going to make\nSure I wasn't there and then but we're going to make\nSure that people with preexisting conditions are taking care of in the house bill created these little risk coals\nSo the government picked up that cost of a difference between the the people with preexisting conditions regular costs you never know if you were out in you know Dr getting the insurance card but the government picks up that cost and that lowers everybody's coast because now the insurance companies aren't having to put it into somebody's family who doesn't have a pre\nExisting condition doesn't have to put those rates in their spread it around to everybody so\nThe people with a condition or taking care of and it's better for the people who don't have a pre existing condition because they're not paying that additional risk pool\nOr the Democrats line but [noise]\n[noise] well there certainly ... barricade and trying to you know make it appear that it's something that it isn't\nA they're playing a lot of clever word games and all but but you know there Ninety nine percent wrong there is under one scenario like I said if you stand on your left leg and then there was a heavy wind blowing that somehow\nA state if they could get a waiver could figure out a way to get around that uh but you know I just don't see it to build a very clear and I think they'd lose in court but that would be the Democrats attacking\nThe very issue that they think are that they're claiming that they are the champions out and you know is there a legal case that maybe somebody could challenge it under certain circumstances maybe but\nI think it was so it's pretty close to a lot but not a hundred percent they do have one little threat but taken hang on for some legal case somewhere in the future um that nobody believes will actually ever

and he's got polling gonna get money five people there and a meantime this just in hurricane Michael getting stronger hitting Panama\nAh but the good news is it's not going to linger it's there to go so it's going to hit about one o'clock but ah [noise] the terrifying powerful category for hurricane is set to make a record breaking landfall on the panhandle and about one thirty\nSo we have a lot going on here in the John for these radio network Matt boiled coming up Breitbart\nHe's got a breaking story to do concerning Trump's wall I'm so excited to get them out today and he's going to be coming up here\nMomentarily under John Frederick radio network hey this segment is brought to buy our good friends in America first policies you know judge Brett Kavanaugh was just one in the other

America First policies dot org America First policies dot org this message paid for authorized by\nAmerica First policies in corporate joining us now bad boy he's the political editor and writer for Breitbart News you can follow Matt go to Breitbart News get their act and he broke a story yesterday or\nThe majority leader of\nThe house of representatives congressman McCarthy who is from California and\nUh would be the leading candidate for speaker provided the Republicans hold the house wants to make Trump's wall campaign referendum this story broke yesterday by Matt boil and he is with us now Matt ... great to have you back man\n\nKevin McCarthy is going to be introduced a bill or later you that you actually go on a ... at the border [noise] do you mean by that\nAssessment brief saying from our border patrol agents and law enforcement officials down there but then when he gets back to Washington DC later this week he's going to introduce a bill that fully funds to the border wall so all the rest of the money go for the border wall and it should have at our has a number\nOf other enforcement measures that Kate swat which has already passed the house that has an ending sanctuary cities where he was already passed the house or the ... as well as going after criminal alien gang members are contained in the bill\nI'm so all those things and a few more or other things like standing on privacy agents and going out fairly good and I am voting would all be in this bell and the important thing here is is that there's been no does have the votes to pass the house of representatives\nI with Republican support at this stage though with only fifty one senator as it doesn't look like it would pass the Senate and this has been the reason why we don't have the\nThe wall money yet right leg and this has been the whole thing right is Senate Democrats have been holding it up because they you need sixty votes in the Senate so it looks like based off of these mid term elections are Republicans are going to get a few pickups in the Senate\nSeats right like so it looks like based off the latest polling and everything the public in may get to ... for fifty\nFive fifty six senators the question is whether or not\nThey're going to hold the house so if Republicans do hold house majority them this kind of a bill that fully funds the boardwalk can pass both the house and the Senate and we didn't get into the president's desk and actually fun to walk\n[noise] so what is the amount of money that McCarthy is advocating in this bill for the wall\nA twenty four billion dollars approximately four billion dollars that's that's what they say they need\nAnd so we get the whole gun gotten so he's got the right funding and a twenty four billion dollars now the way I read your piece McCarthy wants to make this a campaign issue a referendum if you will a wall referendum for the midterms truffle\nYeah that's exactly right and so again if Republicans hold the majority in the house and they add a number of seats in the Senate then they're going to be able to get the wall funding before wall funding to President Trump next year [noise] if\nI if they lose the house and the Democrats take it that the the Democrats are going to be able to block the wall and from the house just like they've been doing from the Senate so that was the point is is that what McCarthy's build dies it didn't make the entire election uh mid term\nReferendum or this this entire mid term election a referendum on the wall that any votes for a Republican is a vote for the wall of oh for a Democrat is a vote for open borders vote for illegal alien crime it's the vote for him as Thirteen right like it's a ... I mean the Democrats are the party of illegal alien crime and MS\nSo if you want the wall and the water you have to show up and vote for Republicans with simple math with this whole fight lays out right like it's it's really it's become a referendum on and many other things to talk of the wrong I don't think this election is just about immigration\nBut it is very much about immigration\nRate like swords and very much about immigration ends many other things as well including the economy including\nA the ... you know what kind of country that we want to be including do do you support the craziness of resistance that we've seen all these people that have gone off the rails with this whole cabinet our situation right like where the Democrats have gone nuts but the point is is that a ... it's\nVery much a referendum about immigration as well\nAnd so again I if you want a border wall you got to vote for the Republicans if you don't want a border wall if you want\nA a lawlessness if you want illegal aliens committing murder if you want in a MS Thirteen running around if you want drugs spreading through your community or they're brought here by drug cartels vote for Democrats by all means right and I guess that's what you want but I don't think the vast majority of Americans\nSupport the opioid crisis I don't think the vast majority of Americans support a MS Thirteen committing crimes in their neighborhoods I don't think the vast majority of Americans want MS Thirteen that their kids' schools by so fast and the fact of the matter is if the way to stop that those are all about what's going to get the war\n[noise] so this is gonna be a national referendum", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The John Fredericks Show", "city": "Portsmouth", "day": "10"}
