that in the media and especially watching David Ignatius white washed the Muslim Brotherhood in the article he wrote um it it makes me irate because the one thing I must\nSay from here in the middle east of why they might say the only thing I say it's the Muslim Brotherhood is not good and people in the U.S has supported it in the past I won't say the name of the president before President Trump did or the CIA director for for President Trump could get so\nBut I think the public should put their foot down\nAnd we don't want anyone supporting this group\nOr the Muslim Brotherhood has been behind as you pointed out Edwards Iranian uh a lot of bad things that go on around the world and you're right or you have to do is look to the Arab Spring in Egypt and\nWhat a mess that was now there are Muslim Brotherhood people that are elected in various situations are there to actually hold office in in a democracy and various parliament and so you can make believe they\nThey don't exist best

about this with the Marines in manner\nIn which was executed I mean if they really wanted or something like that if they wanted this guy I think there were other ways they could do it but this was pretty brazen I mean we are their allies we have done a lot for the Saudis I don't like the fact we're involved in\nThe Yemeni civil war as you know I think we need to get out of that and I have since the first day of bomber kind of thing but it was very brazen and it was like basically you know we can do whatever we want because we made a deal with\nBigger Trump supporter in the country\nThen the

serious\nKilling was record go Hariri the Lebanese prime minister they set up an international tribunal to judge the culprits are no one really has been punished and one of the people we think uh got

that montage Rand\nA response to the question about the president's tweet or making fun of a Stormy Daniels or was it about the best response that I've heard which is ah my response which is I don't really have time for that there's too many other things going on in the world\nTo be concerned about these uh about that particular a tweet and Rand Paul hear Lindsey Graham there's a lot of senators that we have a lot of respect for that or raising alarm bells and so you have to take what they say uh with all seriousness is\nMy only point in us\nAnd let's get to the bottom of it I think the president response here so far it's been spot on a it shouldn't affect the arms sales I disagree with the senator on that one\nBecause of the president said they're going to buy the arms from somebody that was so it really doesn't matter but there's gotta be some kind of response and the president said that they will be a response but he's not going to make response until all the facts to read I think everybody would agree with\nFor eight oh John ... for eight oh five six for sex [noise]\nUh but I really want to thank Edward uranium for that very thorough discussion we had\nYou know you're

like it didn't do thousands sixteen at Trump Tower at the Hilton when he wants to be fun so I'm really looking forward to it and ah anyway joining us now Barbara Comstock hey Barbara great to have you with us\nGood morning here\nOkay so let me ask you this um barber the Democrats are saying that you voted for President Trump Ninety eight percent of the time and they're trying to tide you in that\nI Wish I think is a good thing I voted for him a hundred percent of the time he voted for Ninety eight I think that's pretty good but the majority of those votes were non partisan vote right so explain that\nYeah well you know the proud thank you for asking they say funny every time we talked with depressed about this we say how'd you get the votes regard to how you feel about the president or not what you really do is look at what a good pilot for the American people and certainly from Mike in situ in\nEighty two percent I been filtered bipartisan eighty two percent you're less haven't heard that now I sit there\nFor the first time they get the practice covering that and so what included in marriage but first there are six pills to cut your taxes don't you think that our bipartisan because we know Democrats want to raise your taxes\nAnd cut them will make that departure that I Am going to cut your taxes my opponent has already promised to raise them take away that child tax credit of two thousand dollar raise rates out and everybody\nYou know that would be devastating to our great economy that you know going so well right now but the other though on that score card including formed down on the opioid crisis but I Would catch working out last night with our local loudly sheriff\nCommitments red tape and I thought that was ... Carter\nAnd our military the funny thing is like the opioid crisis is tiny medical research at and I said you know what we're dealing with that great amount of funding for our Congress can't certainly search diabetes because their investment\nIn the Republican Party nor the president or getting credit for and that results that we've done on a bipartisan paid you know it also has things like might stop 'em you get to a criminal alien gang members out of the country after they've stopped by writing down you know the people want\nSomething done dealing with school highly my opponent has failed on everything else it's\nPut on weight on that issue when you've had three that the president has signed that here that are stopping qualify like you know I Hope they get the background check system updated in my project safe neighborhood down on you know there are things that my opponent opposed\nTo a party and the credit that want to report they throw out that number and they just want to read that\nAnd the tax and saying no to everything but the good policy making our country economically their national security and it came from place to live [noise] he's a policy in the ... the great thing I resent\n[noise] so let's let's make the comparison congresswoman the Jennifer ... who was one of the most liberal state senators are in the novel\nRated number one ear and liberal and you know raising your cat that I have a burger Jennifer ... is supporting and they play a scene out of that and I said\nWell look at the end of the day they're all supporting your because like you know spanberger has taken six hundred thousand dollars over money\nYou're not going to take a half million dollars over that and then say oh I'm going to vote for somebody else and by the way there is no one else to\nTalk about the whole thing is a ruse if the Democrats take over and blows you said this over and over and over and if they take over by one vote she has the votes in the talks to be speaker and the whole thing about not voting for her if you're a Democrat is a complete ruse\nSo let's get to let's get to your record which is really what are the ... campaign is challenging now are saying look a Barbara Comstock runs around saying she votes independently she votes in favor of the districts are but look we look at the record she's voted Ninety seven point seven\nThis the times for Trump but now let's give a couple of examples where you went the other way let's start with salary increases for federal workers explaining that\nBut they've gotten the rate of federal employees there was\nTalk of the Trade Center they target you know\nIn our budget for federal employees which I happen to think it's a good thing when I taught for it and I mean I'm not in my district follow where on him and that's what hurt our [noise] our soft little either a hundred and fifty million dollars\nIt's going to be in the White House\nBipartisan leadership in the Washington area for the first time in decades if I'm not there to fight or are we going to be a Republican straight and I think it's going to pay me any house majority\nAre we certainly know according to being it's gotten a majority so\nAt least one Republican in there fighting for Dallas Airport offering got made sure the airport restrict access by not somebody helping with our federal employees but also our whole defense industry my opponent has\nNot had any relationships with our than um fitness centers and\nThis is such an important part of our economy but also on national security at the attorney to predict the primary\n... Democrats she said well yeah I really don't know much about that [laughter] so that's certainly true vital part of our local economy and I have decades of experience there I think we generally tend to be able to have\nSomebody who had relationships with the direction as well as relationships with are very diverse economy including including science technology in our agriculture which nor the western part of the district which has a large agriculture sector also\nRuins Barbara Comstock congresswoman construct she represents tend to disregard Virginia that's the northern we're going from a Westerner Fairfax to Winchester she's running for third term her democratic opponent Jennifer Wexton one of the most liberal state the most liberal state senator\nOr in the common well they will not come on our show extended were afraid to answer a legitimate question I suppose I don't I don't really have any idea but you can't find her anyway or Barbara let me think\nShe gets a little Westchester they major political event you know for decades um hot now in the valley which sits same skipped nod of\nAnd this is something that you know Democrats and Republicans alike all gone to their local Democrats city council people when children were very frustrated that they need a didn't turn out put that sort of just\nTo me that you can join the crowd you know there's you know she didn't show up at any of our county fairs where you really\nNeed with chocolate our agricultural community and get these or if you have to understand the entire district not just on her part is that she spends her time that there was no resistance but you know they're the ...\nThe rate rise in ... in college you know it's getting right threats segment tax you know we've got people who are getting signs nose down in their front yard where people trench thirty Oregon's Dr over a sign and you know they're afraid to put up this tiny Arab neighbor\nHere regardless of what Hillary Clinton by the way in quite a long way you know they are appears to have a miserable Jim how to pick a life partner thing crowd and when you have some high parties and later start here in our region\nWell congresswoman there's no question of the angry mob mentality that are going around the country right now is very concerning to a lot of people\nAs you said tonight Collins from Maine getting death threats rape threats are now we find out that somebody allegedly sent a poison powder to her home in Maine where family live I mean all this stuff is just beyond the pale it it's it's it's it's beyond the pale\nAnd that isn't going to stop because there's you know until until until the Democrats are condemn this that and Bernie Sanders kinda like halfway stern was not a good idea\nBut you know you got to Hillary Clinton coming out and saying look we're fighting for the Republicans so we we got to get rid of all these Republican so you can be on the whole\nI mean as long as they can do it it's going to keep happening until they stop I mean it's ... it's I Know you're a student history it reminds me of the sixty eight campaign Humphrey Nixon and walls and you were probably too young to remember like me a much older than you\nBut black in that campaign Richard Nixon had a big lead because the Democrats had all the resist urging the protesters and the mob", "show_name": "The John Fredericks Show", "year": "2018", "city": "Portsmouth", "day": "17"}
