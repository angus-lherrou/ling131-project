I'm a stop to let you talk now no\n... that's how I mean I'm\nNot sure how\nThere's like one or two stories on him and his health might not be you know he may be kind of hit the golf course and retire\nOr be he's severely compromise and can't do anything I think it's the ladder to be honest with you also where I'm just before on this flight doubt congressman from um Arizona extended the investigation he had a call or met with one Ron\nRosenbaum state kind of strange that happened that it just seems like the fixes ban from the state behind network of Obama because all the bread crumbs of all of their corruption lead back to heat and one Hillary Clinton and they're going to do\nWhat ever they can they find the waters\nThe Democratic party traders within the Republican Party to protect these kids and the only way we get to the bottom of this is to turn a light on and get ugly and John that is why\nThe Supreme Court nominee is suffering so badly in public now because they realize if this man gets on the court that he will have the ... the Supreme Court will be able to\nProsecute these criminals do you suffer flavor I'm a businessman look up the executive orders of one former president for rock Obama giving themselves um executive powers\nThree extensively to well investigate what they see fit and those powers transfer writes them one Donald John Trump\nThese people are afraid because they realize at the end\nOf the day they're gig in overthrowing our government and overthrowing our way of life is almost over all we need is a few more dominant was in place because we do have a president who cares about the people in our country\nWho is willing to make hard choices and be on how to write to ship out sort of had to do a little bit of research on a couple of those things that I mentioned because it's worth noting that smoking executive orders that have been issued under blockers any amount of and under Donald Trump\nGive him the power you're the presidency the executive branch knows how to work [noise] well let's just say prosecute some of the above the law or individuals we've seen those far\nWell uh let me read a couple of other tax return Richmond a colonel Mike number two in Virginia Beach as a mentor your quarter Rick\nHe's spot on people are waking up and their pets Eric enrichment your neighbors says I agree with your caller Rick I was about to say it when the president going to get rid of sessions or the D. J. can get to work or the answer is after the midterm shorter Newport News says\nWhat's the over under four new accusers this week\nPot is the answer to that five Rick thank you [noise] ... thank you look I'm you're going to hear the Democrats\nAnd you know give it a a straight they can keep doing that\nBut let me give it to your straight the treatment of Brett Kavanaugh has been so abusive and so beyond the pale\nOf what regular Americans believe is the right thing to do at the end of the day when you get rid of the partisans on both sides and you look at middle America the people\nWho elected Trump they have a sense of fairness and they think with this man has been through all the polls are showing this is beyond\nThe scope and they're horrified by it\nSo I'm telling you that this controversy I Believe has woken Trump supporters and conservatives up that would have otherwise I stayed home they don't like the Republican Party\nThey don't like ... you know like any of the Republicans are Trump supporters they believe in the sky but they were not going to come out in the midterms they just they don't even know they don't care but then you have little match under Trump voters\nLike and I've said this I'm saying that again there's nothing the Trump campaign could have done that yet these people out like the mistreatment that people are saying of Brett Kavanaugh and\nJosh Holmes who is the chief of staff or Mitch McConnell\nSaid\nLooking at some point in he tweeted out\nLooking at some polling numbers this morning it's impossible to overstate how important the Kavanaugh hearings have been\nTo voters it's like dropping a grenade into the electorate teams in red states are not going to like these numbers they're all going down you know Americans have a sense of fairness and it cuts\nBoth ways it's not partisan if everything was flipped and the Republicans were doing that they would get punished by the electorate Americans have a deep sense of fairness that's why they reacted to the kids being separated from their families and\nAll that they don't like that Americans don't like unfairness they don't like people not treated well I mean it's it's the American way they don't like it and so just before the midterms they're experiencing this you cannot get away from the cabin are\nHearing I think this has been our major topic the last what three three weeks I don't even remember when I talked about something else so everybody is talking about that even people that are not involved in politics and there's a sense of fairness in this thing is going to blow up and the\nDemocrats face like you've never seen that\nAnd there's going to be I predicted there's going to be a massive turnout of Trump supporters and Republicans and in the country on the metro you're going to get\nAnd that favors the Republicans are they going to keep the house and the good of getting five or six seats in the Senate\nAs a result of the Democrats genetic hits and they can't help themselves they're going to keep doing it it's got to go on all next week again\nAll next week\nAnd they have a litter match it's like there's a gasoline can that over somebody overturned and the Democrats took any book on the matches lip the book on fire and talk to that John truckers radio networks there with us we'll be right back [noise]\n\n[noise]\nI mean the

grandma was one of the prosecutors during the Clinton impeachment hearings when he was in the house right you got to go back there and it was he was pretty tough back then I was opposed to that I thought it was a dumb thing for Newt Gingrich to do but uh they went ahead and impeached Clinton of course he couldn't get a beach in\nThe Senate they couldn't get anywhere near two thirds I'm not even sure they got fifty percent and that was the end of that but uh and it costs to Republicans a lot because we didn't make any sense that was just me though back that I don't believe it was a good thing to do\nJohn traders radio network truck mushrooms across America a day for a though John\nEight eight eight four five six or six or calling number\nYou can check stuff seven five seven six nine

A. saying that you voted no I I Want you to respond to this\nNow you actually voted a in opposition to\nThe VA end to military spending when you voted against one of the budget and you've been criticized by that by the spanberger team\nSaying look you're saying you are back in the VA you're backing the military but when push came to shove you voted no on that how do you respond to that congressman\nWell I mean that's just you know simple politics that most people don't follow this stuff in detail so they could be anyone wants to go look I always voted for the military propped up that's all we want to write the Democrats\nWon't do that and in order to get the budget last year we plug up the military and nothing else that's the house budget that are voted for and at the end of the year in order to get a budget the Democrats insisted that we plots up government spending on the social side by four hundred billion dollars\nThe military park up was Seventy billion in social science plants up and everything\nElse in the in the mix with four hundred billion dollars the tax cuts also for example where a hundred and fifty billion dollars they're paid for it now if you're grown at three and a half they're totally paid for and the four hundred billion the Democrats won it in God and that we should\nNot have allowed to happen I just go on to the kids right there that there is Twenty one trillion\nAnd so we're trying to preserve a principal a bunch of states flat\nIs exactly wrong as always right they're trying to say I vote against the military do the whole point is if you keep up the social spending you won't have any money for the military [noise] and so it's very clever trick that's what the Democrats do because they cannot\nTell the truth I don't [noise] you know the the spanberger campaign the the curiosity there's no one knows what she's running I I seriously don't know what she's running around she came all laid on health care\nAnd then when she found out the price tag was thirty two trillion and would double our tax rate and she backed up health care\nAnd then you know I I don't know what else I mean should against the tax cuts she said they were dangerous and so what is she for an immigration she won't name an upper bound so I guess it open door to seven billion people open borders\nI Know she's for sanctuary cities that protects and Thirteen gang members\nSo I mean it's I don't get it I I don't I don't know what she's running and so if you ever had around after you know with everybody would love to know when she won't even put a full biography ... on the on the campaign website it's fairly shocking well\nAll I ever on thirty AM on Thursday and I will ask her just that also\nUh we're trying to get the debate that worked out the debate that we're sponsoring and between yourself and Abigail I'm Still trying to get that day that I should get that in the next couple of days I'm told by a political campaign managers\nDream I Want to ask you about something you put up the other day you said that and they are in the mail or that is a promoting the spanberger campaign that\nYour kids found something in your mailbox for somebody had written on it or on the mail or dating a rod in hell and you turn it over to\nThe authorities and your kids found that it says right in the hell Dave I'm\nWhat it was turning over I mean did you actually feel at risk or do you think that something might come of that\nWell we we don't know if someone puts right now on your door I think usually that's not a good natured thank right so yeah if you have kids or at home and you get someone put a bomb card from it but on your door yes everybody has turned\nConcerns these days whether it's heated political rhetoric God and and that and so of course\nWrote in hell yeah that I wouldn't I wouldn't think that would be a fun thing to find on your door no um\nIt's it's it's not\nI mean it ... well I don't know why the spanberger campaign people keep doing this kind of stuff just just run your campaign run on the issues you have your debates and one of the parties is going\nJust pointing out if you're spanberger supporter out there this is not helpful it's not helpful to your candidate is not helpful to anything it's just it's just horrible just what is your campaign or they are\nThey're folks are strip and they ... percent when we're giving big signs out they had people coming steel big science they say I I'm I've signed\nUp to put these up for a day if they stole sign they take stickers off people's cars I mean they have the science placed illegally all over the place we found this is a law enforcement candidate and\nShe doesn't follow the law mhm and so that's a little striking right and so we we follow the rules I always tell the kids that are folks at the door to always be underground savior always be positive to everybody you know negativity at all and\nDid for the seat of retiring Tom Garrett and going up against allegedly Coburn and that will be decided in the midterms on November snakes rhythm and the favorite there Denver died doing\nGood morning thirty days in a wake up and then November sex\nIs that what is that what it is now thirty five days\nIn a wake up you have thirty thirty six days a year tomorrow I Believe is Tuesday so I think it's five weeks out [noise]\nWhat is the most surprising thing so far you heard on the campaign trail like something you've heard from [laughter] put ten through constituency voters and you've been wow that's a shocker\n[noise] um [noise] gosh a shocker for me [laughter] and it's probably something that's a little bit minor comparatively but almost everybody I talk to him about infrastructure so I had one town I I Can't remember\nHe was down there but for Victoria [noise] and I think it was a Victoria at one of the city managers or you know come up to Maine and goes eight Denver and I said hey what's your biggest issue and\nHe sort of looked at me and he said sewer lines not replace since Nineteen oh wait\nI'm like you got to be kidding me [laughter] years yet not good [laughter] I said sewer lines at break she I'm like oh my gosh that's crappy but [laughter]\nIt's amazing to me the things that people are dealing with on the trail and and just some of the things you hear really amazing or [noise] you know the one in ... county I had one of the mother come up to me and she goes I'm really sick it driving my kid [noise] you know to do our homework every night where I could get wife by right or\nThey're just they're things that people are listening to CNN or MSNBC or Fox News they got real problems and\nHe really get to hear all the real problems on the trail [noise]\nFood isn't this interesting because the district that you would represent is very diverse\nIt's a real issue for for people in today's environment that\nReally doesn't help when when when you talk about the the urban and suburban districts\nLet's get to a new president when on Canada last night Kennedy caving\nIn to the president's demand NAFTA which I think is now dead or I Would never be seen again\nAre replaced by us and the U.S Mexico Canada agreement now here's the reality the Canadian dropped every single demand they had before midnight because the president was going forward alone at the cameras on Wednesday\nHe said he was done negotiating with Canada he didn't like their negotiators you didn't like their attitude and he said he told them stay out\nHe was done with him he was going forward without them then uh they acquiesced on every demand this is a good thing for the American worker in a good thing for your district tell us why\nWell I mean the first thing in the first thing you see is that they upped amendments over the TPP right on the\nActual dairy exports um I mean\nWe're talking about you know the import export daring with Canada we can now ship\nMore dairy products into Canada they open that up and for the ... district I mean that's just amazing [noise] um and I think that's where it but I've been saying on the trail and you've heard me John of the farmers weren't screaming they said we believe that there has to be some short term pain for long term gain [noise]\nUm they they have supported Trump they should've at some point it's probably going to be too much to bear but they understood that they had been unfair
