sure you're on your calendar\nOr well your early one way or the other you've got to get out there from either party wherever you're like OK so the Christopher\nNewport university releasing a new poll on the seventh district hits the final week\nVoter model Democrat\nAbigail Spanberger Republican incumbent Dave Brat or in a statistical Janice [noise] forty five for forty six spanberger now let me tell you why this is great news for the ... campaign every\nPoll average on every single one favorite the Democrats they over sample Democrats because it was part of the fake news network that tries to do fake polls in order to get a result and they can only go so far\nIs that is good news for me what you had your tired your rich good shape\nSpanberger Seventy eight percent\nAre very enthusiastic about voting versus sixty two percent of Republicans were that's what they have to deal with\nCory store on the top of the ballot which is hurting brat\n\nBecause nobody is excited about Cory Stuart\n\nNo ... well let's go vote for Cory store oh let's see is there a Confederate flag\nThat I can take to my voting booth with them [noise] unbelievable [noise] wild forty seven percent of voters in the seventh district to prove of the job the President Trump is doing fifty one percent disapproved it's not that big of a cap\nIt really really isn't in the Senate contest\nCain ends up by far not that big of a gap either\n\nBut certainly hurting brat now here's the good news for proud of this race he's got there's two pizza goodness number one has got an eight point lead among independents ... point lead that's not going\nThat's the only going to get bigger so they're simply if you have an eight point lead among independents and you get out to Republican base in the seventh district you win that's why\nSpan burgers going to be something about this poll but then when you look at the cross tabs I think this is great news protect that would've been better if he was up by Fifteen yeah\nBut see and you told from Clinton kid who will be joining us in about twenty minutes are only ... to the Democrats no matter what they said they over sample Democrats and you always get\nRepublicans always outperform their poll regardless of where it is always\nSo this is a good news for breath\nThe race we got to be very very close and we've been saying that it said one or two point race from the gang here's the other hand there's a there's a libertarian in the race\nJoseph ... who has four percent\n\nIf you're voting for Walton what the hell are you doing things votes for Walton in this race and they vote for Abigail Spanberger period now if you want to vote for spanberger\nPuncture spanberger\nIf you want to vote for David ... vote for Dave Brat but and vote\nFor a walk in\nThe libertarian at four percent you might as well hands that district to the Democrats if there is that if that's what you want to do and that's what your four percent vote for Walton is now here's the other good news for Brett\nLibertarian votes in grad school districts collapse on election day because at the end of the day you're going in there and you're saying why waste my vote now you were sent it as a little bit different\nThey just can't do it there are Republicans that cannot vote for Cory stored because they just don't like the guy\nAnd so what was going to get a big vote but that's a little bit different\nYou get down to the district level and Joe ... can't win and so four percent for Walton is a problem for brat because take him out of there Ninety nine percent of those ... are going to de Ninety five percent\nBut again if you if you want to vote for Abigail have added\nAt least get at least vote for somebody in that district who could win this ... this makes no sense so if the woman vote collapses to the typical one percent that libertarian gets in these races or two percent\nOf that other to present you go to Brad so uh that's why there's some good news is but look this is a this is a very hard fought district now\nAre we going to be doing on election night show here at Dave Brat headquarters or I Will not be there\nI'll be calling again every so

mean these people are just I\nDon't know what happens to them but uh it's a sad state in the United states when it seems like we can't go sixty days without one of these it's really sick it's we're\nIn a very sick time in our society no question about it John treasuries radio network truck the truth across America live in the swat I'll be right back Dr quitting kids seeing you coming up

[noise]\n[noise]\nDr Quentin Kidd from Christopher Newport university is the chairman of the Judy Washington center\nOn politics at a critical Newport university now doing some very extensive polling they pulled the ten the second and now with the seven at the end Dr kid great to have you with us\n[noise] are you there I mean can you hear me okay yes\nDrink your new polls down it's pretty pretty interesting\nYeah I mean we have it's you know we do when we've been pulling these congressional races around Virginia we've been\nPutting out two models a likely voter ... committed voter mile and the difference between those two miles is\nHow enthusiastic um some uh uh respondents are and how uh how much they say they're likely to go vote and so the the likely voter model is people who have a history of voting but they but they may be very enthusiastic and they may not be not very enthusiastic and then they committed voter model is that\nSame history of voting but people who say they're very committed and they're very likely to go to vote and a likely voter model we have it on in both models we have a statistical tie in this race\nIn a likely voter model we have spanberger\nForty six Brad at forty five and importantly the libertarian go so far on taking four percent of the vote in a committed voter model\nWe have a brat at forty five spanberger at forty eight and ... and the libertarian taking three percent and so this may be a race where on the third party libertarian candidate actually plays a role if it ends up being you know within a point or two at a uh on election night\nFour percent vote for Joe Walsh stunned me as I look at your whole uh when it first came out of these I haven't seen it all the clubs to have Dr King I'm only\nHour here and I've been on the air but\nWhen you get a libertarian no money there's nobody sort of getting four percent in a district that is so hot like this was just so hotly contested knowing that all the majority of those voters are coming from Dave there and they're not going to vote for Abigail\n... why why Joe Walton\nFour percent well there could be that there could be a number of reasons um in the most likely reason could be that this is a place where disgruntled Republicans were parking their votes um because they're for whatever reason frustrated as Dave Brat um if you\nIf you happen to be a liberal or a sort of a country club business minded Republican you might not be happy with\nWith Dave Brat necessarily but um you know at the end of the day they committed voter model he drops and drops down to three percent\nA year on on election night\nUm if it's a close race in ... is the decide or it'll be one of the rare congressional races in Virginia where a third party candidate is able to swing an election essentially um and so it'll be interesting to see an election night how long does um if he does as well as ... percent\nThat he's clearly going to have an impact in this race if he doesn't then you'll have less of an impact\nWhat normally happens with libertarian congressional races in that their vote collapses on election day because people that's either going to vote for him because they're mad\nWhen they actually go into votes or like\n... when my my vote because it's a low profile race it's another thing when you get to Matt waters in the U.S Senate it's higher profile and look there's no clue\nStewart on November sex regardless of the situation because they just can't stand the guy\nThat's just re out okay so I kinda jets\nBut brush to race like this ... I it's it jumps out to me I Would be jumps out and\nReally if I'm walking got four percent\nYeah well look I think a lot of conventional norms are being turned on their heads right now during this um during the Trump\nEra I mean one of the conventional norms would be the incumbent it'd be above fifty percent right now and if they're not above fifty percent they're in trouble um you know we have bread at forty five percent I mean by conventional\nNorms I Would say that he's in deep trouble but I'm not convinced that at the end of the day he couldn't pull out a really ...\nA narrow win or he could lose by a really narrow margin and I'm In a district where clearly you know there are a lot of energy but there's a lot of there's a lot of disgruntlement also\nWell it's ... ... what does it come down to a doctor didn't when you looked at these cross tabs what is this really comes down to if you're just spent I\nOnly get a little deeper partners if you're under spanberger campaign and you're looking at your poll right now they do their own internal we we all get that but then there's your independent poll and they're looking at it now as we speak what message to the spanberger campaign take from the poll you put out\nCertain so the reason the racers where it is there a couple of factors for why the races where it is Democrats have a sixteen point enthusiasm advantage over Republicans in this poll there's a massive enthusiasm advantage\nThat is overcoming one is structurally I'm a Republican district or you know ed\nGillespie wanted as you noted Donald Trump beat Hillary Clinton\nBy six points in twenty sixteen you know it's\nIt this is a Republican district but apply sixteen enthusiasm advantage is able to bring it to the statistical draw 'em there's a massive gender gap advantage on the female try for spanberger in the mail tried for Dave Brat Dave Brat has a plus Fifteen\nI'm male advantage spanberger has a plus fourteen female\nAdvantage that the twenty nine point spread on gender um and then there was an age difference um spanberger has a plus nine advantage for voters on forty four and under Dave Brat as a plot six advantage for older voters and shows that I think that this ... I think\nWhat's making is so close\nThat democratic enthusiasm advantage that is being driven that is driving that female that the gender gap in span burgers a favor on the female side\nYou're on the

I mean we we put out a poll last week and a second congressional district we should Scott Taylor up in that race and Tim Kaine was leading by five almost six in the district\nUm and in this district Tim Kaine is leading by\nFive these are two districts by the way there that are tough for Democrats the second to seven seven is really difficult for Democrats\nSurprising to me look when Tim Kane a random two thousand twelve he lost his district by eleven points um when he you know this isn't it historically democratic district so\nFor him to be leading at a Republican congressional district by plus five is probably right given that there are other districts where he's leading by bigger margins are that sort of driving a statewide totals\nYou're on the job for radio network\nWith us for

I think Republicans can actually hanging\nOne or two or maybe three to five is out for what is\nIts five to be talked about that the Republicans you know and again this [noise] what do you talk about on national\nPoint one doesn't translate directly arranged to run but I I think most people and I certainly would say if the Republicans hold a\nFour point their favorite to take out the five points are six points during you started and toss up territory and then you move up to seven points at higher but [noise] the credits are clearly been written that or I should point out you know we're talking about uh being close right now with all of these writers\nRepublican turnout has been hired they have a chance to hang on to the house but the other side of the Democratic turnout [noise] higher than projector up a Republican stay home the Democrats forget twenty three I have a chance to get something like forty\nForty five seats bond very good turnout nights so this coming out this idea of what I'm how close races are is something very important to this outcome\nRight because uh when you said what I'm going to\nHat on here is twelve are gone right we all know that you're so that that just look look into the mess twelve or God so that leaves I eat a little ... haven't seen you know they need to learn\nMore to win control right than there are just over thirty races that are too close to call right now no good they're highly competitive and if the Democrats when liberals thirty one they take control so clearly they have the edge then I should also point out that if\nThe Democrats don't win control it does to pick up significant games will be thirty one competitive races twenty nine of them are held by Republicans\nRight so they they would have seen it in ... and if they run the run the table right then that's where they get that's where they get to forty forty five seats blue wave pick up right and uh\nBut so if you choose a mask for those listening to us right now how tough it is for Republicans would hold the house\nIs uh they can only lose eleven of the thirty seats that are right\nThat are tied right now actually can they can only lose ten of the dirty after one twenty of this already um three of them right here in Virginia one is tied won the Republican is slightly ahead in the second district struck Taylor a day brat Abigail Spanberger tired and then\nWatch than it had a top stocks in northern Virginia so in a blue wave Danny dirty the Dems pick up all those if the Republicans have a good evening or they can win two to three are all three let's get the final word in from Elaine Elaine\nAh it's all according to Scott it's all about Republicans turning out right\nThat's that's eight eight days\nWe we we we we have a couple of races in Virginia specifically where the libertarian is tanking votes away from the Republican\nThat gets ... when I went to your message to those voters away\nFrom the earth Robert ory economy that we're hearing is that is great do that [laughter] [noise] and her regular ... on the second straight year\nArticle healthcare affordable person all day and put them on a level playing around with corporations on and be able to spread the risk among the thirty nine ... out there that I don't\nKnow what the thing that they are absolutely valid to repeal and first of all on everything that we have been feeling years All right\nAbout to take funding for the wall liberals want to abolish ice and\nIncluding criminals in big business well they want cheap labor Goldman Sachs there ... there are salivating\nThey see these illegal come in they know wages are going to go down and people are gonna have to rent so rents go up there all excited 'cause they don't care they just wanted to make moral\nBonuses that's the unholy alliance of all time Goldman Sachs lower Manhattan and the ... and\nThe liberals we can't let them have their way Congress needs to hear from us who don't want certain germs this is our country called Congress tell them you build the wall now too old to two to four thirty one to thirty one Twenty one to two two to four three one two one for more information America\nFirst policy start or this message pay for unauthorized by\nAmerica First policies incorporated joining us now um to talk about\nTopics we're going to start with the horrific anti Semitic hate crime at the Senate gotten in Pittsburgh just one one of the most disgusting things I ... I don't know what this country is coming to\nBut these crazy people just go into what people are praying and they just kept massacred on a Saturday morning unbelievable [noise] joining us now for that and many other things Liz ... from New York you can follow Liz atlas peak she's also a contributor to the hill lizard great to have him\nFor me I\nWas eight days to the midterms um a lot at stake here all of us were just shocked and dismayed and saddened and sickened by another massacre at another place of worship Liz ... what is going on in the United states\nAttitudes um I think there's anger everywhere and I think you know look I don't think it's new with Donald Trump I think Donald Trump was elected in part because of the anger that\nUh has boils up against what people refer to as the ruling elites or however you want to describe it um and I do think that's true to some\nDegree I think that there's a real feeling amongst a lot of people in this country that they have been ignored brushed aside a as people who run these big businesses and big institutions have benefited from globalization\nAnd I'm really not stop to think about what that meant for some other people in the country\nBut you know it it is alarming because we're about as you point out uh to have\nAnother election and I'm afraid that you know there's a good chance that the Democrats are going to retake the house of representatives and the progress that has been made under President Trump and writing some of the wrongs that have prevails\nA you know it's going to be rolled back I mean I I really think that there's an incredibly dangerous situation by the way for anyone who thinks that the Democrats might be modified by taking back the house that the firestorm of political activism and hate speech and everything might calm down\nForget it because we're going to have Nancy Pelosi as speaker of one of the most dishonest politicians out there and one of the most ruthless competitors\nAre ... you know you have people like Maxine Waters going to be taking over the house financial services committee and Adam Schiff taking over the intelligence committee\nI'm not making these things are not those are the ranking members and from all appearances those are the people who are going to be running these committees and what we're in for John in two years at least of endless investigation subpoenas into\nEvery aspect of Donald Trump's life and finances and business organization it's going to be an incredible mess when I think honestly I think people are just going to get angrier and angrier as this goes on\nTo censor Georgian it is what's interesting\nShift and the Democrats\nThe CEO of the ... of this horrific crime\nI just beside myself with what happened to Pittsburgh to believe we're still having to get out the next thing and they go on TV they blame the president I mean what is the matter with these people\nWell I I found more blames throwing after all the bombs that were sent to Democrats favorites I'm like [laughter] like Maxine\nI I I thought after this particular event there was left without really because this guy was heated Trump as much as he hated Jews apparently um you know you and I have talked about this before I think after the Parkland school shooting\nThis ranting and raving on social media have access to an Eighteen forty seven if it's really unconscionable and\nI don't know how to change that but it does seem to me that it should be changed because without that kind of weaponry he could not inflict the damage that he did but I Do think this country has been trending more violent for Twenty years I think it starts\nIn the entertainment industry which has taken no responsibility whatsoever for the fact that they're constantly spinning out ever more heat to spin\nOld and violent movies the video games you know John it there's just too much money on the table because you can produce a new popular video game that is horrifying and detailed\nMurder rape or all kinds of themes that you know really are not healthy and they make a billion dollars for the day literally that's possible and in some of these games that are coming out uh there's no will to roll that back\nI and I I Do think I mean studies have shown that kids particularly young men are desensitized by all of this material that they're exposed to and that they engage in I mean they sit behind a little computer\nAnd spend their days mowing down women babies are I mean it it I don't know if you've ever looked at and they stop is horrifying it in terms of its graphic detail and the violence that encourages\nSo I don't think it's all about Donald Trump I Do think the country needs to take stock I Would like to see I actually would like to see the president and the leaders of both parties kind of come together and say okay we get it\nThis is not helping the country to old there's blame blame game stuff and hurling epithets an insult to each other let us try to elevate our discourse I don't know if it's possible because\nYou have people like Michael ... who has decided that his greatest shot at fame is being chest is vulgar and a aggressor and hate filled as he can be that is his that's his mom truck a and it's working I mean he went from\nBeing an absolute non entity a year and a half ago to now having millions of followers and social media

people in Mexico from\nUh South America in a caravan expected to be ten thousand hits us bummer rushing the border many Democrats are saying they have a heart letter man it's all good they want better jobs\nAnd the federal life however when they step foot in the country they break the law because they have the paper or so there are legal so they didn't go through the system however when the second footsteps and\nThen there's three other laws that protect them that basically say if they claim asylum you can't throw them out you have to process so you can only hold it for twenty days you can't separate their children after twenty days or you can't process subset of simply released and they disappear into the interior of the country\nAnd congressman on a caravan\n[laughter] yeah well my my position is that cannot happen I think one of the readers out in the day after we one of my big electric four years ago there was a huge amnesty\nBuilds up through Congress center went down in flames the next\nDay and so my stance are fairly\nClear on it ... the last thing that we're talking about pillows you might have public in a commercial with polo see back in the primary both of them together promoting a progressive agenda together and that's what you're going to get right with the Democrats my opponent doesn't want to say that in the seventh district but she does everything except uh\nThe main terms right she says just let everybody\nHere and we got to have a legal pathways through here as long as people work et cetera that means the caravan income and she'd open borders she won't say otherwise she won't give it up or balance sheets for sanctuary cities which is even worse as she won't come out and say that instead she phrases in the negative she says we should enforce\nFederal law just left localities deal with caravans coming in to the country went under the Constitution's the federal government\nHas given that specific authority there and so I\nI don't think people get the severity of what she's actually saying\nShe's not only saying don't follow federal law she\nSang it nor the law of the land based she's running as a wall or forced many candidates saying let's not follow the law of the land and that's probably why I have the support of the fraternal order of police down here and if you go talk to the sheriff's they're horrified right they have to deal\nWith the massive in flow of drugs three hundred million lethal doses affecting\nAll came across the border just this year\nGetting the doom and trafficking\nUh basically a human slavery and prostitution combined into just dead air human\nEvil that's coming through the border and all of our fears know about it and not the people are starting to see the real impact most apparently to base a terrible scenario with a loved one with the drug addiction opioid heroin in ...\nKnowledge cetera and it's spreading through the ... district and he every sheriff will tell you that and so\nYou couldn't have a more stark comparison right the Democrats open border and the new players all the costs who pays education emergency rooms welfare score on the taxpayer does\nAre Democrats promote everybody to come in they want to get more votes on the American taxpayer pays the bill and and now that there should be construed as being anti immigrant we're\nA nation of immigrants [noise] we we have a legal system for a million immigrants per year\nIn this country is a melting pot all the people that\nWant to come are all children of God but that it has to be not legally the reason they're leaving Guatemala and Honduras El Salvador's because of the rule of law has broken down and if you look at the blue states that people are moving from blue states to red states the reason they're leaving blue states and blue cities like San\nDemocrats precincts they are not good rule of law they say they are and they're not all the evidence shows it's very clear where people are moving they're moving to red states and then a\nLot of those folks from blue wants to change the red states turning blue so it it makes no sense that I think the American people are starting to get a real handle on how all these things are hurting their lives and they're demanding change\nSo congressman specifically what should be done to stop the care of and you say you want to stop it what specifically should we do is to stop it from entering the in the United states\nYeah well it like you said the catch and release is incredibly problematic once you put one foot here under US law you're given a certain legal status you got
