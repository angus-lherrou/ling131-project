caravan of in bathing illegal aliens and that's what this says this is an invasion\n\nThis is an invasion coming to the United states\n\nI I'm not going to call it anything but what it is an invasion\nYou would think that that would motivate people to get out\nAnd vote for Republicans so that you have some kind of a security on the board of what other people think it's actually going to

no such thing as an economic refugee because there's four billion of them\nWere they all just kind of come and ask for asylum because they can't get a job in there to Crumpet corrupt country\n\nThat we give billions of dollars to these people and it's the corruption be on the pale\n\nYou would think that this would motivate Republicans and independents that come out and saying\nLook this isn't

for people that the Democrats won in and then was ready but I don't really understand it\n\nThis is a real issue\nThere's no answer to this and ...\nMexico\nI mean think about think about think about what what would happen in the U.S if these five thousand a caravan of invaders said well we really want to go to Canada so as we can you let us in the United states and give us just a a a sixty they are status here so that we can\nGo up the highway and ah get to Canada and we can invade them I mean what what what would they Canadian today well sure you know I understand I understand that's our problem no they'd be like well why are you doing it this is just a logic\n\nAnd open borders crowd is relentless and they have Wall Street Republicans behind them\nYou would think that this would be the major issue of the day and because of Goldman Sachs says salivating and looking over their chops at the prospect of more cheap labor nothing is going to be done at the end of the day they're all going to stay because the Republicans hands are tied\nJudges will overturn whatever their what whatever ... Jeff Sessions decides to do judges will overturn it\nAnd you can't separate\nAnybody now from their children especially before the midterms that the\nDisaster\nEven though if somebody today in the

they will get separated from the child the child doesn't go to jail with them that the laws that we have in America and you want to change it I guess change it but that's the current law but laws don't matter now\n\nI mean if you ever had more evidence why there shouldn't be a wall this was it\n\nSo the Republicans are attempting to make this a\n\nA election issue where they're putting a built together for thirty two billion dollars to fund the wall but they're not getting their message out as far as I'm concerned\n\nI mean you you really think about you really think about how any other country would handle an organized caravan of illegal immigrants coming into your country and expecting a phone expecting that they will be allowed in and taking care\n\nIt's crazy\nAnd uh you would think that this one issue alone would think the Democrats in the election but many people think it's going to have the opposite effect\nSo you know you just start scratching your head\n\nI mean I think that the bait over this issue in this country should be whether or not you want to border or ... ...\nCheap labor and we have a big heart and we'll take care of anybody that comes in and eventually when the country collapses\nThan it is what it is I mean that's one argument you in the meantime the elites will continue to profit on it and then obscene fashion\nAnd the gangster benches and make more money and Wall Street executives will get more wealthy than they are and if you worked at Goldman Sachs you'll be able to buy an island I mean I guess that's the plan and you continue to fund the Democrats\nWho will then have unraveled unlimited power\nIn perpetuity and remember it was President Obama who said ah my goal was to transform it America transform it you transform it by changing its make up its\nDemographic makeup you change it by allowing 'em unfettered illegals to come in and change the culture whatever the American culture is those who want to change it want it to be something else so I'm really don't know what they want it to be or what you think that that's the\nObjective of this whole thing unholy alliance of Democrats want cheap votes Wall Street Republicans\nAt want cheap labor and the third in the\nOpen open borders one world government or is that want to change and wipe out cultures they want to wipe them out so they don't exist they just want a land mass and the free movement of people and\nGoods between land masses that John Frederick radio network in your heart you know I'm right there's no argument to oppose what I'm saying but it

with one count of unauthorized disclosures\nOf suspicious activity reports in one count of conspiracy to make unauthorized disclosures of suspicious activity reports both of which carry a maximum\nOf five years in prison\nI mean if this person did not go to jail and prison I don't know what the deal is here because I don't care what you think of anybody's activity you cannot have people in the

charged with acting illegally as an unregistered age into the Russian government or we're not really covered it that much but um\nI mean it's really unbelievable\nThe alleged leaking out Wednesday would be the second major suspected breach of clients that reported this year after a federal law enforcement official\nTold the New Yorker and may that he league stars on his show companies set up by Michael Cohen Trump's former attorney after two similar bank records appeared to be missing from the fights and database\n\nEdwards is also accused of sending the ...

I mean in the lame duck I was talking about at all or how money issues are that are out there um\nMajor categories of government before the September that was good\nThat the one I'm item well we just did a continuing resolution to early December for continued discussion is on the border hunting area so yeah we're going to La Guardia between the election\nIn early December will have a major discussion with a question about that and he wants to border security money which we can really devote oil and we want reforms as well um and I will will will get into office national next month or so\nThis caravan get through Mexico and get to the southern border of the United states senator Kaine watch authorities do what should we do\nWell well first I mean let's look not wait I'm getting to the watchers or not to the watermelon Mexican border yet so we need to work with the\nGovernments of Guatemala and Mexico I'm On yes and you know I Hope that the president's especially you know often talk about Mexico et cetera it's not hurt our ability to reach in accord with Mexico on that so I think one of the issue that's important interests you gotta have allies in the world and\nIn when you have allies you can work together on joint solution they've got staying as for the Caribbean or people in Honduras or or not even get to the border with United\nStates but that would involve the U.S having a cooperative relationship with Mexico for example and not spending time crashing Mexico which the president an awesome does so\nI Know that a U.S military north commander which basically is everything north of the Mexican Guatemalan border\nUm our own we we do have the eight chefs and other a U.S president in Mexico I Would hope that we would work with the watermelon and Mexican government's to uh to have had caravan of folks remain in place I I\nKnow the president hunger is always point out no country wants to export its yawn\nUm there are also things that we can do to help\nPromote stability in Honduras Guatemala El Salvador\nAnd if we do that we can reduce people who are leaving those countries to come to the United states\nYou know senator um you spent time with the young man and missions in Jesuit mission and I really like what you've done and your\nAh your work and that and now\nWhere do you think about these these violent left wing moms that are going around chasing people out of restaurants reading I'm Lindsey Graham's sending a packages and and horrific emails to Susan Collins\nAnd go and make it make what it is it's so discouraging\nJob it really is\nI had an event last night I'm Out in Fairfax County where there were sort of a disruptive protester is just a happy hour for young Democrats you Fairfax disruptive protester try to get on my face with a camera and light up and yell at me hoping I think that I Would say something in that part that they could then put on video and\nWhether it's somebody doing that to me whether it's\nBeing a cop in a restaurant um and it it it really really\nI don't know it's just it's just sickening [noise] um and you see a you know an escalation of all kind of violent that have Europe we saw Nineteen swastikas painted across on of a Jewish community center in Fairfax two Saturdays ago that was very shocking\nSo I think we have to those of us in elective musicians what we have to do it to maybe try to be better role models bring down the temperature bringing down the rhetoric you can disagree with somebody without being you know in temperature on civil\nTo them I I really try hard to do that and everything I Do I disagree with the president on a lot sign Seventeen and my bills you know that that I've been able to put on his desk [noise]\nUm I I Try not to get into the name calling saying but you're right any violence has to be in downtown whether it's probably once on the left on the rise violence that you know not political in nature I'm asked to be condemned one of the great things about our constitution you know\nYour your favorite part of the constitution is in the first amendment freedom of the crafts and my favorite ... part of the constitution is in the first amendment to which was the right of the people to peacefully assemble the writer for people to petition the government for redress or created says we we give citizens the right to peacefully assemble\nBut it's got to be peaceful or to you know write letters to congressman but it it's got to be peaceful and I think that the framework realize that engagement was necessary for a democracy at work but they understood that the engagement had to be peace or any kind of disruptive or while okay that he wants to be involved\nWith dinner when when your former running mate Hillary Clinton on civility acceptable under environment that they had the fire I mean we're like a democratic society and they very much\nYeah I disagree with that sentiment I think well I think you got to maintain civility especially at the pop 'em let me just let me use to role models on my\nSide of the al ... some role models on your side though nobody would say Bobby Scott is not a very progressive Democrats very progressive Democrats dairy farm in his point of view points out what he thinks is right points out what he thinks is wrong but Bobby Scott as headache political career where nobody thinks of Bobby Scott\nAs an uncivil person or a name caller Don buyer would be another example in Virginia I'm very progressive Democrats\nPoints out what he thinks is right that in mind calling at something that he thinks is wrong but nobody called non Byron name caller nobody thinks he's on several [noise]\nSo I think I can look at examples of luck I got colleagues on my side I can take their Senate colleagues on the Republican side more\nAlexander Mars my chair of the health education labor pension committees very much a Republican and he's going to say what he thinks he's going to point out of

that what you're talking about Senator Tim Kaine on the other hand you know just a very sober assessment of the reality of what happened and\nUh you know those of us to believe that all these

ballot for how long has it went through and I\nBelieve it's five years five years up here like in his five years and then they basically they become a third political party in Virginia so the stakes were wars in the libertarians are very high mountain let's shift gears a minute let's go to\nThe caravan now five thousand people make his way up through Guatemala if you are in the Senate or what would your vision right now on us\nWell I sort of I wouldn't I wouldn't you take a little differently I mean first of all there's no doubt there's a crisis in Guatemala Honduras and El Salvador writers there's\nA there's a refugee crisis people are fleeing that country\nAnd I think we need to have\nA Latin American from it we need a sit down to leaders of those countries and the conversation I have to put Mexico in that mixture because they're coming right through Mexico um yeah I think it starts to I I Would I Would I Would rather than um you know taken approach\nI Would almost feel and I approached to this ... and very angry or killed approach why Trump is going I Would take it much more diplomatic approach and say how can we solve this problem rather\nWell that's a very long term mental ... center and interrupted you know ... that's a very long term view let's all sit down and I guess it ends up getting more money\nTo uh to these countries that you just said you would cut off so no money's going to get involved according to Matt waters for thousands of five thousand people are coming right now there's going to ask them when they're coming out now tomorrow or next week now they're coming\nNow their objective is goes it makes it go get the southern border five thousand of them cross thousands will be apprehended we ever hear about twenty percent the other eighty percent you'd never find them again and up to twenty percent we do operate in eighty percent of them\nUh end up not returning for whatever piece of paper they give them\nTo go back to court or whatever and they can't separate them from their children we've already been through that kids in ... right before the midterms are going to happen so basically they all get scot free if you don't do something what would you do\n[noise] yeah and I returned to our role party I mean some of the door open borders\nAre constantly I don't share that I Believe they hire a border security we needed to stop illegal stress right you can't tell you what would you do to get anything I mean you need to have anything either\nAdam Germany and put them on the southern border point out that you can put him on the southern border poked twenty eight down south southern border we'd have a pretty good for our money in this country rather than the companies around the globe\nNow we're talking about now we're talking see that's the\nPlan ... let's get or a troops out of Germany Japan\nAnd world South Korea south rarely get them out and let's put him on the southern border that solves your problem and there's no increase costs now there's an argument that you haven't been in South Korea for water reasons but why we have twenty thousand troops in Germany and all those troops Japan\nMakes no sense whatsoever to anybody except those that want to perpetuate the military industrial complex and make money off supplying these troops over the globe because the other day Matt\nCountry from reaching the U.S on Twitter the president blaming Democrats\nFor what he described as weak immigration laws that have allowed undocumented migrants to enter the U.S the Republican controlled Senate and house this year has rejected multiple immigration bills\nIncluding one backed by the president that would have combined border security funding with other measures short by the Democrats as I discuss with a Senator Tim Kaine to keep cog in their\nChain migration the Democrats can do\nFor DACA and they can go for a wall and they can go for the funding but they absolutely want chain migration because that gives them democratic votes and the Republican donors out Wall Street back that too because that brings of cheap labor along with the illegals\nBut the president says I don't want chain migration because that puts a lock on the American economy I'd want migration that is based on job skill and job needs to win the immigrant comes into the U.S they have a job and they can contribute to society\nJust like Australia does and the man child trigger do doesn't Canada if the man show to do it so can weigh\nThe pros and goes out to say today I\nAm watching the Democratic party led because they weren't open borders assault on our\nCountry by Guatemalans doors in El Salvador whose leaders are doing real just stop this large flow people which I'm calling it an invasion that's me not Trump\nIncluding many criminals from entering Mexico to the U.S the president wrote industry porch week he said in addition to stopping\nAll payments to these countries all payments which seem to have almost no control over their population I must in the trunk of terms ask Mexico to stop the onslaught and they've been able to do so I Will call up to you as the military and simply closer\nSouthern border close it means no one will come in and they'll be fifty thousand troops there you simply are not going to come in and there'll be a stand up for days and they're going to have to figure it out and then there'll be cameras on the other side seeing people starving I mean this is what's going on here\n\nPresident and it that the border security is far more important to him than that\n\nNow a a spending package passed by Congress a month ago put off the debate over uh getting the money for the for the wall and effectively pushing back fights the Republicans want to avoid before the midterms\n\nA record number of asylum sticking families from Latin America have recently overwhelms our corn border agents\nAnd immigration authorities or having another surge of illegals coming in border patrol facilities are crowded with newly arrived families bed space that family detention centers in Texas was at a premium\nAnd immigration court backlogs are growing because they keep coming in and we simply can't process to and we can't arrest them and send them back we already tried that\nAnd went through kids in cages and you're Nineteen days for the midterm so they got to be no more pictures of kids separated from their parents so all you have to do now before that night Nineteen days is up and grab a child if it's yours because it doesn't matter\nGrab a child in your family and you're going to get an answer to the United states because the politicians are now on the Republican side petrified of kids in cages\nSo they're going to win again\nAnd the president knows he can't combat that politically because the PR the PR the disaster Nineteen days were the midterms so he says well here's what I'm going to do I'm going to deploy them military here's a problem with that here's the problem every solution right now Nineteen days has consequences\n\nIf it was November seventh there would be easier to easier to do you're going to get the military at the border to are going to be with guns confronting moms with babies that's gonna be all over the New York times\nBecause these people in the fake news media they want open borders\nOpen borders even though it means that it's the end of their jobs and their businesses and they'll have no money in the country will collapse they don't care\nBecause they know that there will be the elite and there'll be fine and then they will\nRule over the rest of us pours slobs the pro terrorists\n\nBut I mean I I don't even know how to even put this in in the logical terms\n\nMean what if they didn't even want to ask Tim Kaine he had\nTo admit I'm not for open borders I'm not for these people coming over I mean but you know that the Democrats are going to defend it and there are now calling them economic refugees oh we're not accepting refugees we you know we're the richest country in the world is not and then it'll be saying that CNN is not who we are\nIt's not who we are all here who we are we're broke our
