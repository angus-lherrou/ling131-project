put one foot over and there\nAre laws and our so porous and there were so many loopholes they can't do anything about it\nI mean you can't when Trump says I'm going to close the border excuse me Mr President that would mean cutting off all trade it's just like you can't just\nClose the border for the migrants you have to close the border for everything so you were knocked out all trade that would all be gone and it would it would it would cause economic habits so you can't do that\nThat's just the reality of it you can't do it and so the problem is that there are so many loopholes\nThat is the problem in the law\nYou know fifty percent now of of of where migrants are coming from Central America fifty ... percent\n\nThere was a time when almost a hundred percent were single males coming from Mexico looking for jobs like everybody got that\n[noise] in two thousand one\nLess than one percent of illegal aliens claimed asylum now thirty percent claim asylum\nAnd we have a law\nWas passed in two thousand Fifteen called the forest floor with the law says if you were apprehended on the border if you're ...\nPeople for twenty days if you can't get your paperwork process than twenty days the federal government the border patrol has to release them this is our last the Democrats like the law\nBecause once they're released its over they get a piece of paper that show up on this day which is not weeks out years out years\nSo then they just disappear into the interior of the country they only have twenty days and now obviously you can't separate the children from the parents\nSo the parents and the children or whatever the children and the guardian wherever they are they can be detained\nTogether but only for twenty days at the end of that twenty they they have to be released they get a piece of paper\nAnd then they just go wherever the going\n\nAnd they say they're coming clean persecution I'm certainly that some are countries that are ... are not doing that well but four billion people would like to migrate to the United states and get welfare and education and fish is on the back\nSeat that stuck in effect the elites are the rich they they it has no impact on them they send their kids to\nPrivate school and he has no impact on this is a burden on middle and lower income Americans because schools get over Ron the welfare system explodes and I told you the story of my own son when I moved to Chesapeake, Virginia we\nPut them in school I guess it was what third third grade and or the fifth fifth grade or fourth I don't I\nThird or fourth grade first day of school twenty five kids in the ... I get I get that\n\nTwelve of them don't speak English don't speak English and the school that I was in twelve or Thirteen kids don't speak a word of English all migrants now what are you going to do how can that be satisfactory\nLearning environment you can't so the teacher was going to go down to the lowest common denominator we pulled them out instead of the St Matthew's Catholic school I didn't have the money for that\nSo we have to give up a lot of different stuff so you pay your taxes for an education that is worthless in some areas up you're living in a mansion in northern Virginia in orbit that that you know as a five million dollar lobbyist for the federal government you don't care\nThey're going to private school but if you have to send your child\nTo a public school because that's\nWhere your economic means land and half the kids in there can't speak a word of English you tell me what kind of ...\nAbout learning environment is that for your child well it's not it's no fault of the children but it's a part of the system ... I mean this is an invasion\nSee they're flying around the Honduras Guatemala flags\n\nAnd their boss basically taunting the president to stop them because they know that as soon as they get in the United states they're saying they won't get released and twenty days\nBecause their cases are years away so they simply disappear in the interior of the country\n\nAnd all they have to do in the first asylum hearing is meet the basic threshold see there's three why show something asylum\nThe first one is just claiming it eighty percent of people meet the first asylum requirement so they're released anyway and the other twenty percent get released also because they can't get processing twenty days so they all get released this is the problem these are the poles\n\nOf the people that are detained that actually show up in court when they're supposed to Fifteen Percent so eighty percent of people are not apprehended and\nUp to twenty percent only Fifteen Percent actually go to court when they're supposed to so you know the math like Ninety five percent of the people that put one foot in the border of the country state it's an it's an incredible number\nAnd they're coming for either economics or for family reunification\n\nAnd we don't even who is in this caravan human traffickers drug cartel malls bad people some say some say that there's even terrorists than in in there from the middle east no one knows\n\nWhat does the president to we tried zero tolerance that was a public relations fiasco\n\nSo I tell you what are the images on TV Now and what the what the caravan has done is they've pushed all the women and children to the front of the line so the cameras catch only women and children on TV so you see children crying and moms [noise]\nCrying for food for their baby while they made the choice to combine it doesn't matter\nThat's the images that the fake news wants to play they don't want to go deep into the caravan of find out who these other people are and who's funding\n\nHas anybody asked that question me this is an invasion it's like we have no laws we have no border we have no laws we have nothing\n\nSo here's why the Republicans are going to win and hold the house because suburban women that the Democrats have been counting on heavily to give them victory because of whatever reason are looking at two things\nAnd caravan angry mobs an agri caravan\n\nI don't think that's conducive to getting votes for Democrats [noise] if you look at the early voting right now in the trends in early voting Republican turnout and Republican areas is through the

answer is as Peter said what\nWas the first person you would never send a cast the first down\n[noise] I think the difference here is that it happened in the consular and\nIt was such a blatant disregard of the relationship that the president has attempted to build with the Saudi kingdom and especially NBS I'm using the White House and things like that I think that's the real issue for the president and\nI you know he said there's gonna be severe consequences I Do believe that President Trump's along with the Congress is going to do something because the big difference here it happened and I'm In an embassy which there's an international order right I mean you go into an embassy\n... you're not expected to get your head cut off with the [noise] chainsaw or boats or whatever they had so it's kinda gruesome and I think I think that's what a feeling the outrage imminent and this this is an ally of ours and\nAnd there's going to be some challenge for that what the consequences are I

[noise]\nI Know of course not um you know the kinds of things that every country makes such a political mistake and in addition\nTo the moral consequences of brokering I Want I don't want to discount that are but you've got countries like Saudi Arabia is rivals are which are trying to profit from this political mistake and I I I don't want to downplay it too much like yet\nThat's what it is and the people that will profit from\nThis once again or the Muslim Brotherhood's once again Qatar Qatar which is supporting terrorism all across the middle east or do we want the Muslim Brotherhood the proper\nTerm that's that's my bottom line and I know the Congress\nIs going to force President Trump's hand on this I'm fairly certain that that you're right you're very breed of the domestic

Muslim Brotherhood and I knew your market joking and I'm Sorry he died on sorry was brutal\nAnd I'm not going to defend Mohammed bin Salman man but you don't go rewarding your enemies with geopolitical gaps because your friends made a mistake like that\nSo what do you think the United states should do or say anything\nWell I I Would hate to be in President Trump's hands\nPlace um I I Know he's got he's surrounded by some good people secretary Pompeo and the vice president who is a very strong moral person uh what do they come up with I mean the king is not\nGoing to get signed he's not going to throw into the walls a lot of people inside our foreign policy establishment hectic trying to ...\nPossible I suspect it's not but perhaps there are a lot of princes that would love to do that\nPeople lamenting that had been mammal became for maybe ... years they don't like\nSomeone like that I think we have geopolitical objectives of dividing various therapy countries I don't say we but I mean the the deep state the foreign policy establishment\nAnd that's not a good thing in\nThe middle east on fire wrecked the economy and puts a lot of young people out of work and create lots of refugees and you see people like George Bush\nIt was like the refugees we don't want to see if we get one or the articles on sending more Europe it's the Muslim Brotherhood that it's been doing this from turkey and come from Libya\nAnd they continue to do this because they're trying to work\nWith refugees and people are doing the same thing with our borders in South America coming from Honduras and Mexico or wherever else are we don't want to see that it's a mistake\nBecause it is it possible and were you rainy and that may be NBS just isn't particularly effective leader\nBecause right now everything the guy touches has turned a crap right I mean uh the Yemeni civil war that he's conducting their or the money that he spent has been a disaster the public relations fiasco of\nThem are rushing all of his rivals and putting them in a sense of the highest regency or what whatever you did the ... hotel there and then torturing them is what some of the allegations were I'm not sure if there was ever been\nProven out the blockade or the gang of for a blockade against dictatorial whenever you think of of that government of that government of that change them\nOr were the

mean the get the guys and now this um this alleged murder is a complete a screw I mean I it's beyond a screw off I mean it's like it's a let the Keystone Cops them know what I'm saying is ridiculous\nI mean the guy screwed up everything so I mean maybe his father is looking at this and saying look you thirty three years old and maybe he's just not particularly effective right now\nYou know we have a law in the United states or if it's that says that you can't be president or ... or a thirty five years old I mean there's a reason for that\nAnd you know maybe me you know maybe it's possible that he's just not ineffective leaders that a reasonable conclusion for people to make\nIt look like the drama of King Lear or as I pointed out the other [noise] who is given his ... his other son was ambassador to the United states some people are wet spring you shouldn't be the king or the\nGround friends um and I you know\nAbout King Lear but at the bottom line here I think in the middle east thing is to move on to the phones I don't believe he's going to choose his other signed\nThis is his favorite son unless he has a rebellion of the major print inside the kingdom which I also don't think it's going to happen\nOr he's not going to be replaced and if you want to know what the scenario as to how it plays out if we sail boat\nSaudi Arabia [noise] talk a lot of that newspaper this threat mentioning that Saudi Arabia is also aligned with Russia and also that\nRussia would like to see the kingdom cut oil sales and that states like to do that in order to raise prices are saying and this is just a veiled threats\nAre the things would\nRecreate another Nineteen Seventy three three and where are the oil's\nA blockade on the west was enforced and prices went up and we were all standing in gas lines I don't think theoretically pull that off again but they were certainly threatening um I guess Mohammed been Taliban were threatening um so\nDo you want to get into a really ugly scenario over the oil market given that Iran is going to be going off line on November fourth we probably Donaldson that electric started on November sex I\nMean well how does that tell there and start pumping oil um November porous at prices would go off and people would be going to the polls and saying prompted turns everything typical material so\nOn FM in short pump in ...

...\nThe day but the president has spent the past twenty four hours on loading on this migrant caravan which began his travels\nAs a group of now eight thousand uh the caravan reached temperature or Mexico on Monday about eleven hundred miles from a gallon Texas and it continues to strike north towards the southern border\nBut the Democrats they want to keep the focus on health care\nBecause uh the polling shows that as the number one issue on people's mind and joining us now to try to understand why healthcare is such an important issue and it's on so many people's minds during this upcoming election and beyond\nIs my good friend del bell as soon as the executive director and founder of liberty healthcare now um my self and my family have been proud members of liberty health share forget this seven years\nIt is the best thing we have ever done\nYou know all the health care debate we have to debate it and we talk about it and ah we analyze it for you on the air but I'm not personally involved in it because my family got out of this a long time ago we got out of the whole\nObamacare healthcare rat race and we went to liberty health share which the services phenomena oh
