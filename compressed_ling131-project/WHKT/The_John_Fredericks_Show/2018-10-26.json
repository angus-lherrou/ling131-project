incompetent capable of running the country everything he touches turns to crap whether it's the Yemeni civil war that's a disaster the gang of four\nEmbargo against the state of guitar that backfired and blew up in their face guitars better off today than they were now he's got this thing where they changed their story night time what do we do here\nJohn as you point out it's clear that show was brutally murdered it's clear that it was premeditated it's clear that\nUh that I think the crown prince knew about that a NBS Mohammed bin Salman is I think have a lot to answer for and I think they have to be held accountable so I Do think that there has to be significant penalties that they suffer\nI Do think to the question has to be asked is I guess\nChip with Saudi Arabia which I Do think we need to but can that be where the crown prince I I\nThink that's a pretty compelling question I think the\nAdministration is going to have to ask that I think Congress will eventually addressed that an asset to you know what will be the penalties are to uh to Saudi Arabia I listen I understand the impact of those of those contracts\nFor what we're doing to supply a military uh equipment to Saudi Arabia I think Saudi Arabia I can be a a a force that\nIs is a is a is an ally to us in the in the middle east\nBut I don't think that it can it can be that type of ally that we want him that we need if this is how they're going to operate I mean we asked you know we have principles in the United states that we\nThat we stand by and our allies have to have to abide by those and I just don't see Saudi Arabia during that you know you you pointed out the issue with Yemen too and you and I have talked about that before I those are all questions I think that come up\nAnd how we see Saudi Arabia operating in the region house policies being played out and are are they are they doing this thing's necessary in that region that create stability and that and that are\nWorking in the in the best interest of all involved not just Saudi Arabia but ah other allies in the middle east and listen I I I understand what they're doing that to push back against the Iranian but are are they doing things that in the long term by moving in the middle east at the right direction I\nThink those are questions that we have to ask them apart foreign policy standpoint and I think that U.S policy toward Saudi Arabia you know needs to needs to be directed by those I think very I'm very sobering\nIssues that we have the forest [noise]\nSo it seems like congressman Whitman\nWe're in total agreement and it seems like what you're saying is the best way to solve this is a four crown prince NBS Robert ... to maybe a step aside for someone else had his father put somebody else in their final question only\nHalf a minute and I've got to get your wasn't out so very quickly um is there going to be a vote in Congress on our involvement in Yemen's civil war and backing the Saudi Emirates coalition yes or no\nI'm John I I I I Can't can't predict that because I don't know where the discussion is going to go over all the Saudi Arabia but I Would say that it won't it won't be part of the debate in Congress about what our policy is a wish Saudi Arabia and the conflict there in Yemen\nOr to go to go more information Rob Wittman dot com\nElection mid term election ever in the history of the United

news you've got fake polls movies\nThat are fake poll yesterday from the Washington Post is unbelievable\nI mean the Washington Post like what are they gonna learn like they don't want to learn people say well what are they going to change a pony methodology to get it right never because they don't want to get it right because it's not about\nAccurate poll it's about the poll driving fake news to get a fake narrative to draw the conclusion that's all it is it's all on\nThe Washington Post actually putting out a poll yesterday actually putting out a poll showing Barbara Comstock trailing Jennifer Wexton in the ... district by Thirteen points now there is no way that western has a Thirteen point lead over Barbara coms like every\nIn journal pull that I have seen on\nTop stock every internal poll that his pay four and a lot of money shows is raised a dead heat or\nCops are slightly ahead in the Washington Post has got cops are down by Thirteen this is a complete and utter lie it has to be on fake news [noise] it is and it's beyond the onion it's beyond the national Enquirer\nWhat they try to do they have cops not so much they want that seem so bad they want the liberal do nothing Jennifer western in there so bad\nThey can taste it they want their\nLeft us in that seat so much that they will\nActually conducted poll make things up doing in such a way to get results that they want so they could put it out there and say the races over don't give Comstock any money and don't work for her it's a lost cause so they do a fake poll in order to do think now\nIt's unbelievable nobody in that district\nIs going to look you in the eye and say that they think Jennifer Washington as a third gene point lead this racist tied and I think Comstock is gonna win but the Washington Post doesn't care they'll not own up to any of this uh neither one of the New York times or ABC News already seen or MSNBC\nOr any of the polling companies that are in cahoots with a fake news and that's what they are so it's it's I think it's the fake news network and it's designed to drive\nIn conclusion to make you not want to do anything to help her\nIf you're in an attempt district go volunteer\nCops like she is going to win this race\nAnd that's why the president says it's fake news he says it's an enemy of the people when you live in the people and masquerading as a legitimate news network with a legitimate poll is that not\nAn enemy how would you define that\nThis poll from the poster so\nAstronaut that even westerns most staunchest supporters think it's a joke\nBecause they know it's not true so let me just let me just ask you a question\n\nIf they're putting out purposely putting out the information driving it so that it's fake is that not an enemy of the people it's certainly an\nIt's an enemy the truth maybe the president needs to change one where it's an enemy of the truth it's certainly an enemy of fact it is unbelievable they're doing it again\nThey didn't do thousand sixteen and they're doing it again then nothing you know when you get with the Democrats have\nNothing from two thousand sixteen the legacy media had to learn nothing in fact what they're doing now is they can't believe they were wrong\nAnd so they're doubling down and here's the thing if the Republicans don't relinquish the house\nThe legacy media after two elections in a row going all in for the Democrats and losing them both on a federal level will become irrelevant this one of the states for them are so high there'll be relevant\nI'm more\n'cause I simply tell you the truth 'cause that regularly there'll be come a relevant they are doubling and tripling down on more lies\nOn more fake polls and more fake news again to drive the result they want on election day again and it's going to backfire\nOn them and get\n\nI mean they actually think that somebody semi pipe bombs that don't go off it's like a change the trajectory the election the general life we're going to get an economic report coming\nForty five minutes that it's going to show another over four percent GDP Growth\n\nAnd their banking on hatred of the Trump and somebody sending pipe bombs or don't go off targeted at Democrats had already been influenced the anything right now it's very bizarre it's very the whole thing and it's very suspicious and it's very bizarre\nRight now if you're\nA national Democrat here's what you have to deal with mobs and caravans and you're running against Republicans who are for jobs and country mob is versus jobs and country versus ...\n\nAnd if they really think the caravans crossing the United states and bum rushing the border\nAnd a clip of Fifteen thousand or just\nLet's just open up our arms if they really think that having tens of thousands of illegal storming the country is going to help them get elected know see what they were hoping for is a couple of thousand with kids and babies and they'd be separated and it would be

FM one hundred and twenty five Richmond groups that started yesterday Joe Morris the following me at\nAfter the forum the other night between myself Leslie Jennifer Lewis and mean big Klein and Jennifer Lewis and lives in Coburn there now he has some of these same questions and um I\nI find it amazing um that they're doing the exact same things and also I also finding amazing that lately issues have taken\nA backseat on ... campaign now it's all personal it's taken Halloween pictures from my face look now she's doubled down you know now it's not big but it's you know they're trying to portray me as crazy based on I guess Halloween costumes and you know me John I have a good time so it's ...\nIt's just it's amazing that last week she pretty much apologizes for marginalizing veterans says she's going to stick to the issues then she puts out a commercial or calling me an extremist\nAnd trying to make fabricated things up again this is what the left does their own hands it's desperate ploy by desperate candidates and that's why common sense is back that's why conservatism is back and that's where I'm going to win the fifth\nCommon sense back in\nOf commonsense Dennis ... with us\nRunning for Congress fifth district Virginia let's get to the caravan I'm the president with my leading today\nSaying you're going to deploy a thousand troops you go to a series of executive orders that would stop the caravan from coming into the United states the problem is as soon as they step forward and say the word asylum\nWe can't do anything are lower than the loop holes in them Denver are written in such a way that all they have to do was get at tell when get their hand grabbed and say asylum and then we can't do anything they cannot do back\nWhat you've seen the president's proposed action here if you were in Congress now what would Denver Riggleman proposing on this terror that\nWell you know the rule of law and\nAh we're we're we're a nation of laws and we believe in the rule of law and the way the law as written written right now you're exactly right John I don't know you know how we we don't honor that based\nOn what we believe us conservatives in rural and and people who follow the rule of law however I think Congress needs to start fixing these immigration laws as soon as possible and I also believe once that happens are vetting\nProcess for any of these people that are coming through has to be extreme vetting\nUh we do have some of the technology in place now but we don't play time limits on this if there's that many people that are headed\nTowards the border uh we don't know what's in better than those in John my biggest fear um it's easy you know it's like a Trojan Horse right\nSign them um those that\nYou know our hearts sort of go out to and with compassion however if you have people inside there that are bad actors and they're able to hide you know within this caravan we have to a fair amount and my guess is this going to be sending some pretty healthy intelligence assets down range I think we're going to be monitoring and my guess is\nI can only speculate right now my guess is we'll have joint operations but Mexico on monitoring this caravan of seeing any type of emissions that are coming out of there talking about radio emissions or any kind of been told that we can glean this is not a good situation this is not good and at some point I think we have to fix our immigration laws in a way that again\nAre are much more common sense than the sort of sort of ridiculous 'cause we have now are going on on the border [noise]\nUm\nI think the concern that everyone has Denver is that okay there's twelve or Thirteen or fourteen thousand people we have to deal with it and uh everybody wants to be concerned everybody's concerned about the humanitarian aspect but a lot of my color here's what their concern\nWas okay if they get in is is Fifteen thousand gets in\nThe next one is going to be a hundred and fifty thousand and you're not gonna be able to stop that either\nBecause we'll never get a wall up in time and even if you have all you got a hundred and fifty thousand people I mean it's just a lot of people so um are you in favor of the president taking action now to stop these uh this um mob caravan\nFrom bum rushing the border and coming in are you in favor of stopping them from coming in now\nYes yes I mean it's this is a this is a matter of national security or it is a matter of precedent um and again this comes back to that was a normal American will say hey\nYou know we understand people want to come to the United states but there is a legal process [noise] um and we're gonna have to we're going to have to follow that legal process you know and we we think that legal process used to be applied all immigrants and you and you're exactly right John\nThis would set a precedent that could really be damaging to the United states' security to our policies and to our rule of law or you're right if the if we just about everybody in we're actually sort of acknowledging that open border is what we want if we don't follow the rule of law and we don't stop these these migrants sadly we we have to stop them from coming in\nAnd set a precedent Denver\nAbout five or ten minutes the U.S government is going to release the new economic numbers or GDP expected to grow again this quarter\nSo over four percent could be four point one four point to for twenty three a bomb is timing was chugging along in about a half a percent growth\nI mean this growth unprecedented where do you look for in that report in ... which can close and you might draw out of it on the economy gender recommend\nWell the thing up first I'm going to look for [laughter] and it's just because I'm a geek out on the stuff is I'm going to look at the specific whatever\nFor genuine but also see what we're going as far as employment but GDP gross I'm going to look at manufacturing them look at agriculture I Love looking into the numbers this year that growth is\nAnd we're continuing on this line John if we're continuing with the lowest unemployment claims and forty nine years if we're continuing with low sign or the unemployment if we're continuing which he grows four percent of every quarter which you know is amazing\nAh it's a new normal was too I mean this is pretty incredible or if you're looking at all these numbers I think right now what you're saying is that the tax cuts where are the jobs are format works opportunities zones can be LeBron's here in the ... in the commonwealth a ... and opportunities on investments\nAll the things that we look at to encourage opt entrepreneurship to encourage people keeping their own money is working and that's what I'm going to look at it this report is is this just a continuation of this amazing amazing search\nOr are we seeing and even more positive future for the people in the fifth district but also in the United states and then the commonwealth of Virginia I think we are I think we're just seeing the beginning of this economic boom and um I I'm really just really excited to see what those numbers say based on where job growth sectors are growing right now\nWell kind of interesting to see these are coming out momentarily we expect that that we're going to get over four percent growth and it's really really tough for a Democrat\nRight now to talk about economics the economy or any of the issues that pertain to jobs and prosperity in America\nSo they'd rather talk about something else that's why your opponent Leslie Coburn is talking about your Halloween costumes because she doesn't want to talk about the economy she doesn't want to talk about jobs she doesn't want to talk about growth should want to talk about kids moving on to the basement she doesn't want to talk about\nThe boom and small businesses just want to talk about the deregulation she doesn't want to talk about the number of investments that are going on because of the tax cuts especially\nAs it relates to one hundred percent deduction of capital investments Rob doesn't even understand it and so she doesn't want to talk of any any of that she'd rather talk about your Halloween costume in two thousand five\nYeah and I mean which I Will not take down off the net by the way so here's what you would rather talk about she'd rather talk about forty million dollars in spending\nNot only for Medicare for all but also for forgetting student debt right which is one twenty four trillion dollars right now free community college crawl or free college for all everything she said and even a debate she's like I Want to give away this she\nDoesn't understand the taxpayer money is what you're using I get so livid based on what I thought for you know in government overreach she says she loves government I fear government I think government should be limited I think government should be a fishing she's also the taxpayer money for the middle class is nothing more than confetti\nShe compared eyes to the Nazis I mean I I find that stunning John ... anybody would vote for Leslie her views are great for San Francisco and\nMaybe a three square mile area there or somewhere up in Georgetown right in DC but for the fifth district it's absolutely appalling that she thinks these values are actually a political bow to the people the fifth is about every day and work for a living\nAny of these other foreign left and they are now they're just they're just propaganda machines and I think at some point that's going to break through that you have comments you have this mission of common sense I guess progressive pander is and I think that's what's happening in the ... district and we're going to witness John because I represent American\nValues I represent conservative values but I represent what the fed wants to do right now and that's why we're going to win this\n[noise] Denver Riggleman I Want to thank you for being with us what's your website\nA
