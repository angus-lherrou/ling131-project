wants to be lying in the New York times and the Washington Post some kind of the Republican hero\nOf our time and so you're going to write a book and the whole thing and make a lot of money he's going to vote no it really comes down to Collins and Murkowski does every now and it was that this is no secret and um I Would personally shocked if there's\nNothing in this report and columns voted no I I just could\nNot even seen her getting on TV and trying to explain it\nBecause she never says anything stupid I mean if you follow suit cause like I Do I Love following her because every time she speak just like okay that makes it even if you don't have you with her I I think\nYou're right I don't think she'd have any grounds for doing it and she has kept an open mind from the start and she has basically said unless something's surfing says you know there's no reason not to vote for him what do you think about Murkowski\nI could not imagine if college the least she's going to vote yes yeah that leads Lisa Murkowski all alone in Alaska sinking this nomination and sticking the fate\nOf the last two years of the Trump Administration are up to twenty twenty\nBecause it'll it'll destroyed the Republican Party as we know what I Can't jak Trump voters out and you can anybody else if this guy goes down with no weapons no evidence that's different than the agreed with him being so all that is\nKnow how you take somebody down where there is no evidence because and then you basically read ward the Democrats the Asia\nYeah that I think it's almost the most offensive part of that scenario I totally agree will show boating self promoting a heinous behavior the lack of decorum the lack of decency Dianne\nFeinstein putting on information simply because it made it for more potent gotcha moment does that\nReally is that behavior that Republicans are going to condoned I sure as heck hope not and\nI think I agree I think Mitch McConnell and the other a card in this stack Mitch McConnell has been absolutely ferocious about getting judges on the Supreme Court and lower court he has made it his heart he has basically we're here to put\nThrough a lot of other a senior administration officials who are awaiting confirmation because judges have been a priority and I think he's very smart to do it\nI think he's ... I mean Republicans across the country should be applauding us because nothing more than the judicial branch needed to repair it\nUm and I think he will get Murkowski and the ... center Ron and promised them the moon politically or if they go along with this and I don't mean that he should have to because as you point out if there is no evidence to support any of these chargers shame on them\nFor even wavering mean\nWhether you've got drunk in high school or not what we know now is Steven briar was arrested for underage drinking that didn't seem to stop his confirmation and yes it's not necessarily equivalent but let's get a grip here folks and look at what we know about this man what we know is it for Thirty years\nHe had to have good unbelievable dignity integrity decorum he has had no charges ever leveled against him like anything like that as an adult so on the other side of that nature we have hundreds of opinions that people things so highly of that they are frequently used as a reference point\nIn other judgments and other arguments legal arguments this man deserves a place on the Supreme Court I really hope we get there\n[noise] okay we're we're listening to seniors country tribute or to uh\nThe the newspaper the hill and also the hill on line and also Fox News she has a new column out called Trump's America First policy scores a big win with a new NAFTA deal also I Love your new website I Love the light blue\n[laughter] me in a good mood you're really\nLucky and I answered saying it's the kind of thing that you know you put off doing for like years because it's just too much trouble but I appreciate that thank you know I like it it's\nSo weird I I also like I don't know if I can say this on the radio I guess I can just give me a feedback was were were friends but I\nAlso love the way uh your name is at the top in what is that called when you're writing it much thought it was a script script yeah not a script and it's very soft and it also matches the dress\nYou have on that is on you're saying it's the same um like blue so it just works that's all\nWell and they ... and I appreciate that more that you know I work I'm going to\nPass it on my helper who basically pushes me to do everything that's constructive and pushed me to do that so much for that\nWebsite told them that John Frederick\n[laughter] well thank you [laughter] [noise] but\nThank you for having me on um I got to run but it's always fun to talk to you appreciate it\nLet's pick thanks for being with us Steve Bannon coming up at\nFive right here on the John Silver's radio network good to have you with us and also sheriff Clarke will be joining us seven thirty five plus your calls I got a couple of text year that I can read a real fast I got about well\nA half a minute and let's get to this uh Jeremy in Chesapeake says with all this has shown me is that we have an issue with using the justice system to legislate\nCabinet so it was written opinions are not use it's a scorched earth policy that might be the plan\nI don't think it matters what's he's confirmed it doesn't matter what you think of it it doesn't matter I mean you saw that with Clarence Thomas is a former church from Newport\nNews [noise] you'd never passed out drinking beer because you drink rolling rock it's a cheap beer drinker real clear he says and you will blackout rolling rock star brand John from radio network truck the troops there with\nIt shouldn't be about showing it should be up and it should be about the constitution the show like ...\nWhen a plane they need to be on the middle east to point for other if they did that cabinet [noise]\nFor him it's like really bad at it I guess which I don't think there will be at least at least you know a lot [noise] [noise]\nYou know that's a great point Mac where's the Bush family wears George Bush wearing the Laura Bush where's all the places where Jeb Bush nowhere to turn nowhere to be found now one of them you're right\nWhere where's the Bush family does anybody know\nYou know that there's there's certainly not shy about criticizing President Trump when they don't like something he does write they jump right into that ...

you're right to\nGo to the show came back\nAll right joining us now former sheriff Milwaukee County as senior advisor to America First policies action sheriff David Clarke Hey Shankar great to have you back man\nTakes a lot in Elizabeth again\nSheriffs um I\nI Try to get your comment\nJust said from Richmond one of our callers you just heard that he said look this whole conference\nWhy is where is the precious what do you think\nWhat we're talking we're talking about politics in politics don't expect anybody to have your back you can't trust anybody in this political environment stress the Washington DC so when you ask where are the bushes hiding somewhere on you know is hiding somewhere trying to figure out how to hate on Trump some water that's what's going on with them I think it's shameful but\nYou know like I said you know expect this got sort of thing in politics you do you have to have your own back don't expect anybody ever yours\nOkay so\nLook some of that some of the topics that are being made by the left are appalling of course it doesn't get any play in the media you can imagine sheriff Clarke if Republicans were saying any of this stuff but um you know we we've got this one\nA leaning in Georgetown here in Washington DC where I\nSays that white GOP senators deserve miserable that's after Kavanaugh like hearing\nThat she did a profanity laced Twitter tirade against Kavanaugh\nCalling him a rapist and to perjure she described the Republicans as I'm a death coal and Chelsea swine and she's teaching at Georgetown University what's the deal his share of\nYou know what the deal is here to get away with whatever they want and then when something mild\nSitting by somebody in our side they are they going to throw me look at this associated assistant dean at Catholic university says something between some things he got suspended by the university university has a right to do that\nBut at the same time what she was not near nothing close to what you know some of the language used by the people on the left\nAnd you know our site when I say our service qualify that conservatives\nThere were tired of the tactics used by the left but instead of sitting back\nAnd whining what we need to do it you know in in getting outrageous what we need to do is to find better counter measures counter strategies to deal with this stuff more active once when I see different counter strategies because to sit back and pointed out\nIs one thing and that needs to be done because\nThe line with appropriate won't do their job um but when you know individuals see some of the things that they do like we're talking about somebody called the other day um Mrs Ford Mustang get there was the guy from Fox News who got fired that was called the gang\nGot a little bit lower cop there's no doubt about that fire but then you look at the New York times higher that one woman who said she hated white man you know what I'm gonna get away with whatever they want the ... one of the ways that we can counter that at\nGround level in fighting back\nIs to make sure that we get this judge Brett Kavanaugh confirmed this job what many people to stay focused on the task and it's getting just Kevin all come from a new one he's been put through and he said it best I think what he said this thing it turn into a joke\nThe Democrats don't want them to proud of themselves as to public conducted this search and destroy mission which is another thing another crazy\nThat took Kevin argues that's what it's become you know this man has been put on his family's been put through enough this cruel and unusual punishment is as far as I'm concerned that is prohibited by the eighth amendment to the constitution to all these constitutional issues that are involved in this um you know guilty before\nProven innocent\nOn the roof of due process is trash the rule of law has been thrown out we live in a country where you don't have to prove your innocence but all of a sudden now when it comes to judge counter you got a crew he's innocent these charges so this\nWhole thing has been after dies I say enough is enough I was disappointed when Chuck Grassley initially more that date from September twenty fifth and you move to the Thursday and then they moved it again you know trying to appease the Democratic nominees for the peace them you see what they're doing now the Democrats\nCome up with a list of twenty five people they want interview their job I don't know if if if I Know Mitch McConnell understands and he said it in the Senate the other day but\nThe thing the Democrats and why John think about this three senators Frank\nMurkowski income was reportedly went to the president said hey we need political cover to hold why don't you just do this this uh FBI investigation so we can get by this when ... why would you need political cover to do the right thing but see that's what politics in the swamp has become ...\nDoing the right thing would have just been holding the vote but in any political cover I think the sick\nSheriff Clarke uh I really appreciate what you're saying and sharing that perspective because I hadn't thought of it that way and you're right\nHappened here's the problem with being in DC all the time like me is you take that for a grain of salt because it is kinda the way to swap is\nSo uh I never really reacted to that but your one hundred percent I target why would you need political cover to vote for somebody who has false allegations against them and they say they're false\nBecause they're not proven they're not corroborated there's no witnesses and the witnesses that were um\nThat were identified either denied it or refuted it so you're right sheriff Clarke what political covered you need for that\nThe only thing that you just need look there's there's no evidence and it's incredible and\nYou know now I'm I think Jeff Flake it's kind of vote no he he's he's got some\nI said this earlier today he's got some imaging his head where he's going to be you know why and I got to be the darling of the New York times it will be you know featured on CNN has some great free thinker or something\nSo it really comes down to a Collins and Murkowski I mean that's what it comes down to what do you think they're going to do on Saturday sheriff Clarke\nThey don't vote their conscience it's really hard to say I mean we all go to John McCain made some rest in peace was going to vote to eliminate\nObamacare and he came in there and cast\nThe deciding vote to keep it alive so it's hard to see these these politician you don't know where they're coming from and it's all of them are in the swamp and and you know the St Martin by the minute so in terms of Collins and Murkowski probably whoever gets to where we are going to vote\nYou know that that that might be a very well be it so I guess you could say if the FBI read for Israelis we think about it and it could be this evening early tomorrow\nIf there's nothing in it than they have the whatever it is political cover they needed and you would think this nomination would go through 'em let me just ask you this if it doesn't go through what happens is that do you think that's going to have\nSheriff David Clarke on Republican turnout on November six only thirty three days away\nIn fact because political fatigues setting John you know that

renewable sources of energy in the Washington DC greater\nMetropolitan area today I've eighty too low a sixty five partly cloudy\nAnd rich Vegas high of eighty eight low sixty seven very sunny skies Hampton Roads a beautiful day which I was there today at the beach instead of them in the swamp\nBeach or swap pick one I think the beach high of any ... blue sixty five was sunny skies oh man\nGoodness gracious I should be there today right south West Virginia Hi Vinnie five below sixty five partly cloudy that's your weather report for more information\nJoining us now is Erin ... media relations manager with Jimmy and energy and he also currently serves as spokesperson and chief communications strategist for the Atlantic coast\nPipeline and sixty million dollars six hundred mile interstate natural gas transmission pipeline that is owned by a number of energy companies [noise]\nWe're going to get an update on where we are because I Want my pipeline Aaron great to have you been\nMorning John are you doing\nFired up today Aaron I'm very excited 'cause I was getting there and I want to get to talk about energy and jobs good paying jobs by the way all these pipeline jobs average salary Ninety five thousand dollars these are great jobs man\nAnd they were asked all wrong time but then after the pipelines up you get manufacturing and you get more jobs that's what the whole thing is about now\nWe've had a stoppage for well give us an update\nRight so just to remind folks just as the Atlantic coast by bond as you described some new natural gas transmission hide behind that's going to bring new supplies of cheaper\nNatural gas and Virginia North Carolina this was all about as you talked about this was all about growing the economy bringing manufacturing back to eastern Virginia Hampton Roads lowering our energy cost\nThe businesses can grow family is going to have more money in their pockets and it's also about making our electricity cleaner so obviously we've been shutting down a lot of coal plants over the last several years because of tighter environmental controls\nAnd regulations and will replace that with Clinton burning natural gas solar wind and all the things that you talked about before so this this project is all about growing the economy creating thousands of new jobs rebuilding the manufacturing\nSector um we started construction earlier in the summer and we made a lot of progress in West Virginia North Carolina or haven't started yet and Virginia we're still waiting on one final approval from the state environmental agency are but we expect to get underway in Virginia here I'm pretty court by a\nYou're right that for about six weeks or we have to stop work or the fourth circuit court of appeals\nAre ordered a couple of agencies the post and Wildlife Service the national Park Service to revise some of their permanent the agencies were able to do that relatively quickly and suddenly got back to work once the permits will re issued a few weeks ago when we're there going full steam ahead and in West Virginia North Carolina and I'm\nHopefully starting in January of pretty soon\nSo the six week holed up what is the barriers now is just getting this John in Virginia just put it in layman's terms for listener\nCharles so we need we we we've got all the state and federal permits we need for West Virginia and North Carolina this is a free state project [noise] ah we have one more permanent that's still outstanding and Virginia and the it's the permit for erosion and sediment control basically Virginia Department of environmental quality\nAnd so that you get much water in the streams and rivers [noise] um the agency has done an incredibly thorough job of reviewing every single one of the pipeline's path through Virginia all of our roads and incitement control plans I'm paid been reviewing our plans for\nHer more than a year now [noise] um but we expect to get final approval on those plants here I'm In the early fall for will will be able to get underway in Virginia [noise] and then we'll be working continuously through the end of next year so it's about a year and a half to two year construction project which started early or\nLate in the spring or early in the summer [noise] um and we'll we'll finish up and up next year and John\nThis is all that you know once this project is built\nPeople are going to see a significant improvement in the economy particularly in the eastern uh area in Hampton Roads um they're gonna see lower energy costs\nYou know the problem with God and Virginia is we haven't read the old car or natural gas infrastructure for decades and so the infrastructure that we have is in keeping up with consumer demand several using more and more natural gas to generate cleaner electricity heat hers power the economy\nBut we haven't built more infrastructure to bring in\nThe additional supplies of natural gas that we need so what's happening is three of laps or winners the pipelines were so over strain that serve our region that businesses have their service shut down for several days hundreds of major industrial companies have their their natural gas service shut off\nAnd consumers pay hundreds of millions of dollars for an energy costs than they would have if we are the Atlantic coast pipeline it's it's simple law of supply and demand you have\nMore demand and supply your your prices are going to skyrocket so until we get the Atlantic coast pipeline\nBill consumers and businesses are going to pay hundreds of millions more energy costs
