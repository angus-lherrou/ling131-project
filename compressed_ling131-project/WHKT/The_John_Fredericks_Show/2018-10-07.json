right down the middle at this point\nIn which is the worst in history but we get Supreme Court justices are never done that we're worried about down the matter because we're just talking about the electoral repercussions when during the year kicked the hornet's nest\nThe Republican base that was kind of depressed at this point in what you see now in in terms of the energy breaks that both parties the enthusiasm gap is closed\nAnd that's going to cost Democrats a couple of times\nAt least I mean I guess when you look nobody wants to have a company that are doing sexual has a sexual

than they were used corrected look I don't know who's telling the truth either but I think the mere allegation enough if that's now the standard to take somebody down I think we wanted\nTo I don't think this is an issue I mean I I I think we know if I think that when you look at you know I'm ... people have put a lot of holes in the story of the the third accuser um and I think that you know you obviously have to hear both sides of\nYou know when an accuser comes forward up their credibility this this it's user everything she has said you can cooperate with what she had done with how she has lived her life\nWith the notes from her therapy sessions\nBut we're working on it is accurate long\nHave you do not early in the notes from earth or the operator you get them to the she offered

couldn't recall or what but thinking about what they say everything that she said it's ... I don't even know what's true anymore yeah arsenal why I I\nDon't even know I think her testimony was a compelling testament but I Will give you that everybody who watched that but I thought he was

probably be the best result for the Republicans skills are going out more intense\nI agree I I think that the enthusiasm gap um I don't think it's not as much as the Republicans are claiming that has I think that there was some I'm gonna ... you know they're not you know in our internal polling sure as you as you know like you know pulling motion noise in the wilderness is going on there was at

I'm Still kind of my ship 'em but I'm the one path or a Democrat there isn't an right to in Chesterfield with the suburban women\nUm and I think Abigail the match for them and I think that the Republicans are doing everything they can to lose that block naturally right now um and so I haven't it's tough\nI think bin Laden this Kavanaugh's nomination in terms of I mean I enter let me just say yeah in in terms of what this is doing politically and I think we\nAll live in our own echo chambers and we all have our own perceptions of how it's done but what this was done in the ... and some other polling demonstrate this is the Republican base is now activated enthusiasm gap which is favored the Democrats\nFor the last year and a half is now closed substantially and I think that works to perhaps paper they bred has two two issues though outside the demographics the district in the DNA that district is Republican number one he is not close the deal with some of the campers people and they were just as soon\nThrowing him under the bus to rent that she'd out for two years and bring back or ... you know somebody it's more in line with their thinking\nAnd and even some scores and secondly Tim Kaine is going to be exceptionally strong in that district he was mayor of Richmond if he has a political he's widely ... he's\nMy why didn't speak pretty well regarded enrichment where he was mayor he run I think that had to Mark Warner there that that the I think that's right this this jacks up that democratic turnout there so you got a factor that into this thing I still think\nA close race in Democrats would nominate ... she's\nVery under or whatever happens you're talking about uh somebody that's got to be involved in democratic politics for some time I think I think Abigail Spanberger is going to happen or be somebody's got to be reckoned with a in a democratic circles for some time which I\nDon't know I you know I don't I'm not I don't know a ton about the district uh uh you know I Will say I was driving down the south side Virginia to go to an event last weekend and going through some of the rural counties and it seems like if Brad can pull margins outta those counties are but obviously the critical mass of the district is in a gesture feel man right go so\nYou know I I Would probably say you know robotically it's a Republican district but obviously if it's a wave here than it could be one that the Democrats deal than would have to defend a twenty twenty\nOr let's get to the second district Taylor react or what ever happened with a tale of the other day I had him on my radio show or the ... campaign put my [noise] my name and their two TV ads so three shaped the PR for that what's going on in that race but\nThis is my first chance to respond to Scott right after he had his meltdown on your show yes and that went viral yet I'm Upset about our analysis last time I'm announces has not changed he's still ... [noise] um and\nUm I don't think I don't believe in New York Times poll I think it was you know I I ... up to this point I stopped nutritional are pretty good at at the last week they've they've not been um I think there's some noise going on\nUm but I think there is going to win and she's gonna win going away [noise] um so I think she's going to win going away things can be a [noise] a secular up until two months ago I was doing everything right um and he's really blown it\nAnd he's not going to win reelection and so are you saying because of the whole the validate Israel's signatures issue in the way he's handled it and remember that this district is one of the few in the country\nThat not only sits in the ... side a media market but is in a media market that doesn't really stretch too many other districts\nSo the media has been all over the course on the evening news every night you know if Barbara Comstock at a petition scandal in Tempe district it would've made D.C deeper forty five seconds one night or maybe a week later they quickly re mentioned that you know because what\nYou you cannot get away with something\nThe tide water it's been on the roads here so let me let me look I think are the New York times poll property rights taken is fixed that district very well\nOn you know it was a Navy SEAL all kinds of structures issue matrix and he has chosen I think you're in line with that district he's not a far right kind of guy you understand a suburban Virginia Beach in those areas\nSo we have all that going for him now this petition scandal has a little bit of a smart on him or Democrats have a very good candidate and you have a year that favors are Democrats ... what's ... as a Republican what scares me about this is the fact that if you look nationally\nWe get that megaphone just can overwhelm at this point and exaggerate these things I think I think they were trying to ... correct hunting painters up today a again if are betting I I I think he wins\nBut in this environment with the kind of money Democrats put down a you've got to be nervous about this here to watch this on election night if the Democrats win this seat it tells me it's going to be a pretty good year farm in terms of we're talking thirty five forty yeah either the thing about [noise]\nThat I was a thing about this district is different than Comstock and it's definitely different than a brat\nIs the turnout model a totally different and I think it's hard for Democrats to win the seat in non presidential year I just based on who vote democratic and Virginia Beach Norfolk\nIt's you know that the typical democratic voters it'd be a minority down there and in less you get an outsized performance it's not I think it's tough for the Democrats to win that seat I mean Glenn Nye water two thousand and he got flushed down the drain and twenty ten\nAnd the reason was democratic book came out in the presidential year for Brock Obama it wasn't there the next cycle for Glenn Nye 'cause nobody knew when I was\nUm I think God's got an advantage is that the turnout I remember back when I was in the house carcass we'd look at the turnout bottles and the numbers and [noise]\nYou know Virginia Beach in Norfolk the numbers are just forty percent of what they are in other parts of the state so it's just it's you got a lot of people that lived there that are you know enlisted men or women that are registered to vote elsewhere so it's just it's hard you know to to bring people out in that type of environment even though was bench correct you have one media market and\nYou know they could possible Scott from now till the end of the time but there's going to be a conservative there's going to be a conservative votes is going to come out\nAnd whether I'm I'm Maria I don't know how to pronounce it ... whether or not she can get people out based on her name as opposed to you know Tim Kaine is not as big a magnet there as he is enrichment um so I I still think it's a pill for the Democrats even though I agree that looks like God's kind of watch this one issue\nNineteen Ninety six and Tom Davis one remember this well um we had a we have scandal um statewide where John Warner put a television ad up against Mark Warner who is John Warner was far ahead and um he photo shop Mark Warner and do a picture\nI remember who's in the picture and I can't remember who he ... he put us up at Clinton I think yeah you ... with Clinton was while her\nDuring ... there was a racial aspect to it too I Can't remember what they did but they told her shop Mark Warner into a picture he wasn't in and um ended a television ad and it was a huge but national scandal for John Warner who had a moderate brand and was a a guy that you know everyone looked she likes either what you're trying to say Scott Taylor is\nThere like had a friend okay and and and that people you know like respected John Warner much higher than Scott Taylor them [noise] and and his numbers collapsed and more wonder was going to win that race because of scandal and I will say those\nWhich I'm Wondering did was he walked out and he said on the needy person and I'm the captain of my ship and I'm responsible\nI was I was worse campaign chairman that year and it was a it was a close race much worse than fourteen million dollars to his own money that year that may just really a much closer race than it might have been otherwise could strongly when it was either don't beat of course we'll put them out the kind of earned it after running a close race there but I remember it out and I really fired\nThe people that were involved in the ad and everything else and you broke it in that it was an issue for a week or two and then jumped accountability and he took accountability said he's mishandled this thing I think it just kind of destruction in having his people take the Fifth Amendment doesn't help it just keeps it in the news\nIs that enough to bring down somebody but they good reputation just done a good job in their first term or not\nUm and also I think the the ... when you turn around and they talk about a blue wave I think you're really talking about ... [noise] that's really what's happening with the Democrats is that the in the suburban female voters have swung radically or to the Democratic party that\nWe're going to take off or get our predictions rolling back the next segment we have got to get to the reds games yeah I\nUm answered you know in Thirteen were there but not that popular when they're running and libertarian broke five percent and libertarian the automatic ballot access to the next five years in Virginia which ... which are the Republicans that was going to expire this year 'cause nobody granted not crack five percent again\nNow they're taking a course where there'll be another five years of libertarian automatic ballot access loud they're\nGreat and why is that that is a good point and then a fact waters and I get over five no no question probably seven partners here to tell me what if you think do you think it's going to win or lose\n[noise] uh what what uh what about Scott Taylor\nMaria [noise] you know what's going on [noise] and I see you were yeah\n[noise] well\n\n\nAnd [noise] spam a terrorist got nothing but negative publicity from a over the last several months and I don't see a climbing out of that ... could be wrong\nBut I don't see that and I also do I mean there are a cop stock can talk about her internal all she wants that's not what people were picking up going door to door [noise]\nSo what have you heard of that risk I can I just I mean you know what our parents when the Democrats have gone to independent doors I'm not talking about you know they're going to try to bolster the Democratic votes are going to democratic doors\nThat those people are telling her food they're worth it and when they on occasion they've asked\nWe're talking about it since then [noise] uh it was the n._r._a. [noise] those ads have been effective but this capping off thing I mean that's all you know I go to the door and that's all I get\nThat far back this for shops go we've we've got to get to the reds yeah we've got to be getting a Monday Night right Carolina right let's start with where the earliest [noise] right you have to be happy so far\nYeah generally happy I think the defence like I said a month ago yawn with fast a [noise] good and and they're going to get better I think their defense will get better\nUm I I think they need to give a couple of guys more snaps a couple of guys less naps but by and large I liked their defense to be a top ten defense this year and for the next few years going forward like to play\nI think they do they have one issue they need to solve and I can solve it if they listen to me they are weak on the ends they don't have any big play receivers that can go down catch the ball you know catch eight balls for a hundred yards\nAnd you need to have that too when consistently in the NFL you can't just keep throwing too you're tied into your backs especially with a\nTight end like Jordan read the genetically gonna get injured some dance\nDesert is on the street [noise] he's bet on the street I in you know Bruce was my from Brazil I emailed him literally within twelve hours if there'd been cut by Dallas [noise] begging begging them to pick up desk I have repeated it every time I said um [noise]\nThe day he sets foot are rich gets park you'll be their number one receiver\nThey could get rid of Josh dachshund yes I said it they could keep Jamison in crowd on the slot they can get they keep that keep records and that there are number two receiver who's fast\nBut then you need a big receiver who can pull down AIG non temples a game for a hundred yards desk and do it and so if they put him on the team they will be the best team the NFC East and will make the playoffs sweating [noise]\nDallas like losing um I think it's [laughter] I Know they don't like to when they like to lose a why did you know why do they do what they do what do they keep Jason gear to head coach you know I mean\nWhy do they get rid of Tony Romo and it's just I I think somewhere Jerry Jones just decided he was tired of winning the waters start losing for a while and so that's that's why does what he does\nThat what it what do you think that I mean it's the answers dependency\nYeah I'm I'm favorable and dance and I can't believe we're talking with a red skins are not referring to them it's the first place [noise]\nYeah that's true first place and a phrase for it or like the first place type\nThat's right I I'm going to say at this point a lot better than I thought they'd be this year still very very tough schedule the next five weeks I'm going to say nine and seven and that may be enough to make the playoffs because the eagles are struggling and the cowboys and the giants are not good for all this year so I'm not in the ...\nOr one of the things it's always heard that over ... you know go into the game since Ninety four and one other thing\nI Can't remember the last time I'm sure I probably missed something but I cannot remember the last time I've seen the Redskins a Redskin return upon or kick off for touchdown and a while and it's been a long time\nAnd I remember a one of the hallmarks of ... ... ... was that he always had pets he called it more burn [noise] whether it was you know on your nerves whoever I mean it was he always had at least one burner\nAnd we don't have that and uh it it shows\nHow many how many ... when they're broken yet that meant\nTo Tom I got fired last one I Know benefit from five to\n... yeah [noise] they do two things [noise] maybe three and one [noise]\nAh they beat New Orleans at the superdome and on the way to an eleven o'clock season or not [noise]\nAll right I'm going to go in the middle I think they're going to win ... games I think you gotta make layoffs and here's your here's the thing about Alex [noise] I'm not a fan of it because you can't win big gains in the playoffs and so we got an exciting quarterbacks but I've watched him now three weeks I'm not a fan one way or the other but they're on TV [noise]\nBut I mean he managed the games I mean he's never going to be you know he's never going to be themselves and\nI could see more than I can see why\nHim I mean he does fit the kinda fits what they're\nThe whole crew in a philosophy is now that I don't win games [noise] and I think that I think it seems kind of winter games are they they could get in the playoffs or be dangerous [noise]\nI got I got to sign off I got to be in court today okay thank you thank you [noise] let me just quickly add the unemployment down to three point seven percent the lowest since Nineteen sixty nine votes since Nineteen [noise]\nWhich you know I can federal employees are not going to get a raise of what can I just kind of comment on this really quickly John [noise] this is it's an amazing that but not for the reason the Republicans wanted you to be an amazing that [noise] because [noise] people say nothing sticks on Trump\nAnd I think it's the opposite I think everything sticks on Trump the fact that you have an economy that's as good as it is and he's having a going to have a bad I'm an election that he's going to have everything is sticking to him because you should have with the economy [noise]\nOne of the first time for the president picks up see if it was an economy election [noise] um the Republicans could actually be gaining ground in the Congress\nAnd the areas where you're having the best economic performance in the biggest gains in the high income areas are the ones turning against in the fastest so for people to say nothing sticks to Trump everything sticking to ... well I think he\nAnd I think that mitigate so against the law says they take just because of the ... the cycle but these coalitions are basically cultural coalition if they're not economic coalitions\nAnd as I said the Democratic enthusiasm and the independents wanting to balance the government is really what hurts the Republican point people don't trust the Republicans to have the ... they want some kind of check on Trump be doing okay they may vote for him in two years but in the mid term they want to put a check on [noise] I I Will say this do I think Democrats take the\nHouse is I think it's more likely than not ah I I don't know how they don't impeach the president when it comes down to you got the Democratic\nBase right now is rabbit they want to impeach him now before motors a commission and when you [noise] I I don't know how Democrats going back to their primaries in twenty twenty can't not to impeach Trump\nI I just think that happens in rent for tonight was not the kind of on the issue of whether they have any any reasonable evidence or not because you like it I don't think they have reasonable evidence now I don't know what more is going to say that you know what he's going to say [noise] um but I just think you look at the base and you look at the fact that the primary elections or what most of these members worry about that it's politics\nAre going to do it I'm not argue were shut down to earth and\nBased on Capitol Hill yeah well I\nHappens is it changes the dynamic for twenty Nineteen it was one thing that twenty Seventeen Trump than Republicans controlled everything to put a check on him when the Democrats come in Congress like our class of Republicans in Nineteen Ninety four it kind of members you know it's the under Clinton never played off against the Republican\n... yeah she did better than they would do it yeah and I have some of that\nDynamic in twenty Nineteen that's the way that the Democrats had it for you in that window there back in twenty Seventeen you won't have that same level of wind and twenty a Nineteen now there are other factors", "show_name": "The John Fredericks Show", "year":
