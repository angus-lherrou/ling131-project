dissenting view I was disappointed if they did an interview judge cabinet\nOne judge Kavanaugh confirmed probably don't want to confirmed because a perception that the ideologically against them or because they really believe\nThe allegations against him now have more ammunition and more data to say why would the FBI held back\nWith the FBI you said it's a political instrument yet again why

in\nPreparation for tomorrow's procedural vote in that Saturday's big vote a judge Kavanaugh the White House saying well we went through this report and guess what nothing no ... he was free and clear that's what the White House saying but until the senator your chance to look at\nIt are going to hold judgment metro coming up in a few moments of Sigmund Freud you by our friends that job creators

thing you know what it is\nBecause look do have a proven model just just just just credit last you know shake things up yet somebody making uncorroborated done substantiated claim and you're done and then eventually you're going to roll through people look at it\nIt gets blasted somebody do a story on him do something else they did this and they just send it to Paris for the other day did this I mean eventually CNN it's not going to have a single person to come on to represent the [laughter] they just take them they just take them out one by one and so I mean it's crazy\nIs literally need the opposition party they do the opposite which is like I mean the media part of the Democratic party wing of the Democratic party that's what they are aren't\nInterested in telling the truth then this whole New York times story on this all the taxes that we saw so unremarkable within the demonstrators\nThat President Trump's falls go whoa it's like he didn't come up with some crazy things to break the law on taxes or anything like that they demonstrated they didn't follow the law\nThis whole thing that the media the it's just another one thing after another after another after another brand gets its ... son stopped when they report this stuff about what President Trump is actually\nGone to the economy or anything and I I don't think they're going to do that or do they report stuff on the successes edition insurance and they are interested in doing that and the reason being is is that they're using the power of their media platforms to push their agenda the difference between them and us\nThough is is that we're sending a Breitbart by the way it regulates Israel's point of view were very open about it though that's the difference between us and CNN or us in the New York times or the Washington Post they ... they\nClaim that their objective they're not they push a certain point of view and that's fine they have every right to do that okay they're private companies just like we but we on but we are honest with our audience we tell our audience were would point of view are coming from you know what they're getting when we're talking today and I think the fact\nThat he's media companies are lying to their people or to their audience is is discussing and despicable and I ... I I think it's the biggest why in the last forty years in in the American media or that they claim to be objective because no person\nIn this country can be addressed you are you just can't every decision that you make in media from what had mine to use to who interviewed a what stories you cover to which one do you do and so on and so forth\nAll play into a all play into a a a everything has the opportunity for these ... by\nRate like instill a everything every decision you make is informed by your beliefs and so as you're making these decisions on\nA used to be honest with your audience about what you believe is so that they know what they're getting when they get there and then you can still tell the truth you still have the opposite accuracy rate but the point is is that\nAll of these media outlets claim to be objective they claim to be sold truth but they're not they're coming from a perspective where they're all trying to take down Trump and that's their choice\nRay like CNN fine your mission is to take out President Trump just how the people that just be honest with\nHonesty is the best policy twenty three times and the John struggling radio network where with Matt boy leads to political editor of Breitbart News joined a miss Breitbart News just download the app Breitbart News and then you've got to go So Matt\nThese midterms coming up if Kavanaugh gets confirmed on ... on a Saturday and I and I think he will uh we've just got a new generic poll coming out by quite a pack and it shows that\nThe enthusiasm gap that the Democrats enjoy plus sixteen has been taught to plus four\nWe ... that the generic ballot a\nCongressional house ballot was Democrats plus fourteen three weeks ago that's cut in half its plus seven is there a comeback in the making for Republicans I think\nThere is and by the way there was a Maris for ah for NPR and PBS out yesterday that I think it was something like back in the summer it was the Democrats had a ... point\nA I'm a enthusiasm gap a advantage and now\nBeen knowledge it's statistically tied it's only two point advantage to the point is that we're seeing lots of evidence or in a more also senior in particular races right like so in North Dakota it looks like Heidi Heitkamp isn't coming back to Washington okay there's been now to\nPaul as there was one poll the other day or that had her down ten point there is a poll that came out last night that had are down ... points to Republican Kevin Cramer we're seeing a in ... in Tennessee\nMarsha Blackburn is now pulling away the latest poll last night from Fox News had Marsha Blackburn\nPulling five points ahead or we're seeing Senate race Senate raised the Republicans are gainfully Josh holidays tied up with Claire McCaskill in Missouri were seen Mike Braun tied with a Joe Donnelly in Indiana that we're seeing Matt Rosendale hybrids Jon Tester in Montana\nSo if you do it I think what will happen it and there's plenty of other ones across the country as well the point is is that at when judge Kavanaugh is confirmed to the United States Supreme court it's going to a in a way that we haven't seen even in these this latest energy\nOn the Republican side it's going to electrify\nThe nation so much so that all these ties are going to start turning into five point Republican late spring like I think you're going to start seeing the energy on the G O P side ah um their interest electrified after a\nAfter drought a judge Kavanaugh gets confirmed people it's going to fire people up and it's going to deflate the Democrat days that I\nI don't think to get the Trump they fired up which I Am very familiar up because that's the basis of my listeners there's nothing I could have done there's nothing that there's no big enough\nTo light a match under Trump voters like just Kavanaugh saying did I mean there's so many people just watch this an absolute horror and just believe the shenanigans in the clowns show that went on in the Democratic districts many I think as far as people up and\nYou're right you know there's there's one poll before they started high camp was what you were saying that she was like tied down by one and it was like\nShe was only down by like a couple of points now three now he's down ten to twelve\nYes every pulls you down by twelve she's done or she is going to get reelected mansion was way ahead ride was not by twelve Fifteen now is that my great and more she's going to beat him I don't care what matches dust because Trump voters have been fired up so they're going to win that they're going to win North Carolina\nThey're going to be Donnelly and they're going to be dominated the Indiana to going to beat me to ask you all in Missouri [noise] she's going to lose a the astronaut in Florida he's going to lose\nI could see the Republicans have Kevin ... wins that I can see the pick it up five seats or even six in the Senate five or ...\nThe way to map works right now Republicans could come out the other end with anywhere I think fifty four to seven seats in the U.S [noise] uh depending on how things go they've got a whole force so they've got to hold Nevada Arizona\nTennessee in tactics and I think they're going to do that you are and then I think and and then\nThen there's a bunch of other seats that are by like a sack Indiana or a Missouri Montana\nI West Virginia or Florida or North Dakota are and and there's several others on the on the map as well in fact even in New Jersey isn't quite as we've seen a number of calls and then you ... Senate race them every week in fact there was one yesterday that had a Mendez\nThe Democrat only up one point I so the fact\nIs is that there's an Ohio is on the map\nA ... a Michigan or Wisconsin there's plenty of opportunities for Republicans I could conceivably into the high if they if they play their cards right now\nIf a if Kevin I guess you're from Saturday the Republicans can pick up six seats and run the table I'm never can look up from New Jersey I\nI don't believe in the polls there and then there's going to win the Democrats are always went in there but you know maybe I'll be shocked but I think I think they're going to run the table and everything else and uh it's got to be a fun night but he's got to get tougher because if he's not the opposite happen if he's not just from\nThat I have talked to on my show says there they're going to be really pissed\nAnd dampen the Trump voter enthusiasm so there's a lot of states boil always good to have him in and get your perspective you can follow Matt or just go to play for news and that's the after you want to download their that for every day just pop that out and they get all the top stories\n... political editor thanks for being with your calls when I get\nI got thrown out of a tournament one time as a junior and the first game ... ...

just want you to spend two minutes on this and then we can get to the specifics of the deal I was in New York on Wednesday was at the president's alive\nPress the towers that was fascinating because somebody asked him about his negotiations there with Canada and one of the questions was prime minister Trudeau asked for meeting your turn it down is that true and he said absolutely and then he said not only did I turn the meaning down\nI've instructed might trade team just stop negotiating with Canada they're not negotiating in good faith I don't appreciate how they're going about this they don't understand the stakes here and so I've told them we're going to go into Mexico and\nMaybe they'll come back to the table some other time but I stopped negotiating with them where\nThat was when Sunday night you get a deal what happened [noise]\nNinety nine percent of the deal was done based on a framework lay down with uh the Mexico deal member um some weeks ago\nWe entered into a bilateral with Mexico and that he had all the high notes it hit sample or in the manufacturing space a strong domestic content and the cars we build\nEarning it hit market access for agricultural products that hit the notes for protecting digital trade and so called biologics which you're pharmaceuticals [noise]\nUh at at the modern the end of the spectrum that we were still a little a little part on a couple of things like Gary and some dispute resolution mechanisms\nAre and I like I said this on the air on TV and radio you know I was puzzled why I was taking so long to get to 'em in agreement that really benefited all three countries so I mean at the end of the day\nMatches over now and this is all three parties raised up their hands in and try him and I'm like that thing that that that abomination that they signed in Nineteen Ninety four for NAFTA [noise] um this is actually good for America what a concept I Know\nRight where it is I mean it is I'm telling you you know this better than I Am in NAFTA was a bad deal for America to\nChina getting into the WTO and two thousand and one which was pushed by by Clinton in Congress that deal for America\nTwenty twelve South Korean deal I mean we lost over a hundred thousand jobs for nearly auto industry that deal for America I mean for the president is lining things up a well like uh the pins in a bowling alley and knock them down and it's beautiful thing to watch\nIt really is where we're feeding of arrow he's assistant to president for trade in manufacturing and the west wing he's also a senior economic policy adviser Peter Navarro let's get to some of the she items in this new deal the U.S and see U.S Mexico Canada\nSome of the differences some of the changes if you could go through some of the bigger ones that would be great\nSure let's start with the easy stuff which is the modernization make agreement back in Nineteen Ninety four there were some things that didn't exist and therefore did need a provisions are one of them obviously is digital training which is the protection\nOf of copyright Perino actual property to transfer to do within that something as simple as a\nAs an electronic book you might might buy and really have\nStrong provisions or for that there's a there's these things called biologics which is a reference to a gig complicated of pharmaceuticals are that are very research intensive that had resigned\nA overtime to cure or things like cancer rheumatoid arthritis or whatever and uh we got a strong protections for that up to\nTen years why is that important is because unless companies have protection or so that they can make some money on these things over a period of time or they won't put in the money for the research and development so so that's that's all good uh so so innovators and taking care\nOf a digital trades taking care of now um\nAnother a small but important thing relatives the scope of the whole deal uh we were able to resolve some of the dairy issues with Canada and so uh that's good news will have much more market access there as well as for other types of products like chicken and egg things like that so that's\nGood for me as a director of the office of trade manufacturing policy or the ... the big white whale here that we actually got was a bringing back the supply chain to North America\nParticularly for the auto industry when NAFTA did in Nineteen Ninety four is create a set of incentives to\nManufacturing auto plants into assembly plants performed parts and that didn't just happen here in the U.S it happened in Canada and Mexico as well so the key provision is Seventy five percent of the of any car that's that's a name has\nTo have a a a U.S part Seventy five percent and then to ensure that the u._s. gets its fair share of that regional contract and uh there's a strong provision for\nLabor in their strong provision for the environment so you can't have sweat shops and pollution haven south of our border grabbing that business\nSo that's going to dramatically change\nThe structure and supply chain of the global auto industry in a way where we is is the largest purchaser of vehicles a per capita a will benefit from that so that that's that's that's the big deal it's it's great news for this country\nAnd you didn't have our or they're also safeguards that\nWould discourage China for instance\nFrom jumping into Canada\nAnd then bringing them into the U.S by a third party which have been great\nTennis crushing yeah yes there are a and I'm ... and they give you enhanced border for a review and things like that but there's also a couple of provisions in there which which are going to be part of any agreement that we sign that that are directly\nOr aimed at\nThe unfair trade practices that China for example there's in the jargon they called disciplines they called the disciplines on state owned enterprises being able to enter enter the zone\nAnd uh China is kind of the leading purveyor of state owned enterprises that engaging unfair trade practices but he's also a provision in there\nFor currency manipulation a and again there's a lot of countries out there that purposely undervalue their currency is way of boosting their arch for discouraging our exports to them the trade deficit so\nIf you look at this ... this agreement um we see it uh both as a great deal in and of itself but we also see it\nAs the most sophisticated cutting edge template for future agreements in by the way I'd bury the link here it is the largest at one point you trillion dollars is a large is trade deal the U.S has ever entered into and the fact that it's a good deal for America", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Joe Walsh Show", "city": "Portsmouth", "day": "05"}
