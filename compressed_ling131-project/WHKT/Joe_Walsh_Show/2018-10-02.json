Murkowski [noise] about it and that should also show you what profile in courage what ... what we used to work\nYou should have just come out herself she was only have done it if she Murkowski Collins had gone out with her as well because they're both males and wants to tank columns showed\nHere and I had a lot of problems with her um although I I you know maybe in hindsight I don't anymore because then it died she didn't want to play the genitalia cars and she white tapping outlook she look here's the other thing that Merkel here's the other thing and they keep saying well\nDetroit won't get power wouldn't get confirmed the president would have only one choice if he polls if he polls candidate now it would be a dominant power\nAimed right\nBecause people like me who are calling for power from the beginning because [noise] uh the way she signed signed it already attacked her fate [noise] her life\nI Would say no you you gave us ... you know what I mean we would have said I we heard from the smartest people in the room with her from local roads [noise] although I Know Don McGahn really push up through we've heard from everyone you know they have to be the book she no no no no you're giving us what we want now\nAnd he would have been amenable to that the president [noise] so I think she was also saying to Murkowski that she was confident when I'm ... now in terms of the way that even with the job so she wanted\nTo get unless you get to Robie ways you tell me when the state is going\nTo make all over abortion illegal and Robie way would be overturned and then we'll see you know that I\nWas never been out for them to see him that one so I'm really out of your tactics that will never happen\nAnd it's it's really a straw man argument but I agree with you a hundred percent on Kavanaugh as it relates to an even kill me I was also in favor of made me kill me ... that was my first choice and just like be careful what you wish for right\nBecause if something happens that when Kavanaugh nomination goes down don't you agree with me that President Trump will nominate combing Barrett the following day\nI Would hope so I think he should nominate or even during the next vacancy that he has hopefully the next ... next year yeah but she she\nShould be as as well but it's just kind of an hour let's just talk about though he is a very good nominate yeah he's very young and the president will nominate it with him I Believe right now I'm sixty three and a college course of course I I forget John but of course it\nDoes make a list that you want to you like\nThe one okay see you know better than me and then if you go to our\nEconomy and look you have you have ... either already remains the banks for Thirty years so I so I think that but I think that you should be the next nominee I think that\nBut I think that look the um I think the surprising that have really plays this well I like the fact that the president look I'll be the first one to tell everyone that sometimes Donald Trump believe it or not is not play three that I mentioned all chats sometimes sometimes when you hear people aren't like certainly networks day you don't understand\nOn this day and then she did it because when the Ford allegation anything for four or five days materialize out [noise]\nAnd then he started it started attacking process mhm you started attacking the process and I thought that that was smart in some states are very good about\nThis um [noise] we ought to be very loyal to cabinet [noise] I Hope that this is George Guy we don't get through after all this we will lose sight of the one thing is showing up at all polling Republican [noise]\nBecoming more engaged now and they are furious about this\nWell I think he's gonna backfire on the Democrats because\nWell ah there's nothing that you went awry or Steve Bannon or ... or anybody else that's part of the Trump now for camping or political action committees or anything else nothing we could have done\nTo motivate Trump voters more than the Democrats have done with this cabin or clown shall\nI mean people and I talked to were coming out of the woodwork they're pissed off and they're going to turn out on November six and I think as a result of that\nThe Republicans are going to win and when Nancy Pelosi wakes up on November seventh and she's not speaker you know she's gonna do blame Dianne Feinstein but this whole mess that's what's going to happen\nSam I've only got a couple of seconds make your prediction will the Kavanaugh all vote be delayed for a week or more\nI I think it's going to be away from the seven days I think that's so whatever that comes home we just [noise] delays what was ... I think\nI think that what the engagement I think that also the reason why because it's been a while the Republican base so upset about it rank and file\nAll right so it's going to be a week and that would be a this coming friday and then again\nNext week give me on that we got a cabin or justice Kevin on the bench for the Yankees are struggling to find\nNo well I'm Talking about that first they have to get by Okla no in uh the the problem was Oakland is if you're traveling in the fifth inning they get like Nineteen closures on that's the problem\nAll right Sam Nunberg thanks for being with us by the when Sammy seemed visor for check this out citizens for the American republic Steve Bannon's brand new pack\nAnd uh he's got Sam and they're making some hey so Sam thanks for being with us men thank you sir I've had my best to your puppy [laughter]\nSimms dog Winston judge reference radio network group you're right\nSo I don't know what's gonna happen the next week here or what we do know is that the FBI is going to do another background check it's like kind of like any rectal exam and put scope up there see what's going on and so is that sticks with these now many number seven I don't know what they're going to find out in\nThe FBI would understand ABC News read\nPorts that you're talking to a different ... says we don't know if that's true because the fake news are so that might be true might not\nYou know you used to get a news report from ABC NBC CBS or Washington Post your who your tops or whatever you know some major outlet Chicago Tribune things like that [noise] Miami Herald\nYou'd get a news report and you don't know whether to believe it or not now except for the Associated Press a pie that's probably the last thing and probably if you're in if you're traveling international algebra Sarah right other than that you're in the U.

nobody called report you know he was the\nDirector and nobody called the Trump campaign they just\nYou know Corey Stewart linked to the full story after he got fired and NBC just went with it because if it their narrative that the Trump keeping it was falling apart\nAnd they were pulling out of the battle cramped space [noise] and I went on thirty seven interviews and five days and still couldn't stop it I remember my son in Reno\nCollege professor jak at the University of Nevada calling me up three days later and saying hey dad what happens you campaign in Virginia I heard you guys pulled out did they fire you that's what my son said I'm like oh don't tell you talking about\nOh I just saw him over the Las Vegas NBC News scroll on the bottom of my TV screen it's unbelievable thinking is\nSo

air\nIs younger washed debate between the story and [noise]\n\nUm I did not know\nOkay a reason why I saw it on Facebook or they got a little clip Stewart's a Facebook\nPage I assume that he can't even say you know want to release the names of of of the senators and congressmen who who paid off\nTheir shoes or [noise] ... yeah and and so he says and then they cut it off on paintings response to that and I wish there were kept it out because that that would tell you a lot\nAbout it off to dumb it's dumb question because uh you can't do that to legal\nSo that can only be that can that that can't get done and that can only be done by the that committee so that can't be done like like teen can't release out right that that can only ... ... by law right that can only be released by\nThe full congressional committee so they wouldn't have to vote on two teams of anything is doing it so that's a that's a dumb question\nRecording [noise] say that he wants he sat released\nSure but he's not on the committee I can say I want to release also but I don't know if you don't want to watch that video camera\nOn the air in and said that that would put some pressure on the today\nShow I guess so you know so there may be Cory gets thirty nine percent instead of thirty six percent I mean [laughter] who cares\nYou know and and I and I just am terrified that raiders response\nAnd that's good to know that you know that he couldn't do nothing but\nI still think that if it's if we started putting some pressure on me as if it started getting out and everybody started coming in and I think there would be forced to ... ... and let the chips fall where they you know there's certainly some Republicans in there too\nBut just let the chips fall where they may look split springing out in the

details of that here was a beer warm or cold ones are back then thirty seven years ago I don't even think they had on light beer\nSo what what type of deal with it I mean\nIt was quite shocking to

Republicans in the ...\nThey can keep doing that\nBut let me give it to your straight the treatment of Brett Kavanaugh has been so abusive and so beyond the pale\nOf what regular Americans believe is the right thing to do at the end of the day when you get rid of the partisan ends on both sides and you look at middle America the people who elected Trump they have a sense of fairness\nAnd they think what this man has been through all the polls are showing this is beyond\nThe scope and they were horrified by it\nSo I'm telling you that this controversy I Believe has woken Trump supporters and conservatives up that would have otherwise stayed home they don't like the Republican Party they don't like ... you know like any of the Republicans there are Trump supporters they believe in the sky\nBut they were not going to come out in the mid term they just they don't even know they don't care but this you have little match under Trump voters like and I've said this I'm saying that again there's nothing the Trump campaign could have done\nYet these people out like the mistreatment that people are saying I'm Brett Kavanaugh and Josh Holmes who is the chief of staff or Mitch McConnell said looking at some point in it he tweeted out\nLooking at some poll numbers this morning it's impossible to overstate how important the cabinet or hearings have been to voters it's like dropping a grenade\nInto the electorate teams in red states are not going to like these numbers they're all going down you know Americans have a sense of fairness and it cuts\nBoth ways it's not partisan if everything was flipped and Republicans were doing this they would get punished by the electorate Americans have a deep sense of fairness that's why they reacted to the kids being separated from their families and\nAll that they don't like that Americans don't like unfairness they don't like people not treated well I mean it's it's the American way they don't like it and so just before the midterms they're experiencing this you cannot get away from the cabin are\nHearing I think this has been our major topic the last what three three weeks\nI don't even remember when I talked about something else so everybody is talking about that even people that are not involved in politics and there's a sense of fairness and this thing is going to blow up and the Democrats face like you've never seen it\nAnd there's going to be I predicted there's gonna be a massive turnout of Trump supporters and Republicans in the country on the metrics you're going to get the biggest percentage\nKeep the house and the good of getting five or six seats in the Senate\nAs a result of the Democrats shenanigans and they can't help themselves they're gonna keep doing it it's got to go on next week again\nAll next week\nAnd they have little match\nIt's like there's a gasoline can that over somebody overturned and the Democrats took a book of matches let the book on fire and talk to that John triggers radio

they couldn't get anywhere here two thirds I mean even sure\nThey got fifty percent and that was the end of that but uh and it costs the Republicans a lot because it didn't make any sense that was
