we're we're going to buy a week and you know recruiting to me and my very unique and it takes a little bit of time to learn it and I think the staff and I am you know kinda figured out the\nBest way to go about our business on the road recruiting and we've got some really good young players that are contributing you know out\nOf high level I think we're a plane and exciting level of often football or it was definitely my goal to do so um [noise] I don't know if you follow Mike Leach on Twitter you know he had a great quote on balance you know balance is not ... percent Ron it's about fifty percent pass\nIt getting your skill players all five of them the ball in a in a balanced manner and I think we do that and then he acquainted with ... all kinds of doing that and it's true you know in the ... often quarterback pulled back the half\nBack and forth receivers a chance to touch the ball and and are more often the running back in the for receivers and of course quarterback I'll get a chance to touch the ball and we've got a lot of guys catch the ball making plays and they know the Balkan come to him in any way so they're playing at a faster\nLevel and we like to play fast and now the ball a bunch because we thought the advantage we have in your mind as we can be mentally and physically better condition than our own and spoke claiming a hundred played the game is that just blew up often [noise]\nOkay so in last week's gay and there was another\nYou're young quarterbacks you didn't ski throws for another four hundred plus yours four hundred and thirty yards\nAnd you're twenty first first thousand this game Nineteen and I'm coming on the parents but you got you got nine first sounds on the ground so I mean you can't see the team's not balance you can get tough yards when you need them but um [noise]\nThe level of sophistication in this offsets um as you as you you run your various schemes is pretty impressive and\nAnd that the other thing is you did skiing is throwing everybody right I mean you've got like six or seven receivers involved in this involving assault that's\nCorrect yeah that's the design is to take the defense gives us again it's very similar to triple locks in football it's just you're throwing the ball to spot purses reading it died pulled back in\nPitching the ball I think it's more exciting for the fans because they see the ball the whole time and it definitely helps us\nIn recording because uh we can find a lot of guys that like the running catching a lot of guys like to throw the ball\nBiting running quarterbacks that can also growing up and keep the depends on us because it's very difficult nowadays because everybody's looking for that guy with you know all the R P o teams end the old regime so the guys that are kind of get left out or the guys like Reese that\nYou know maybe a little bit of light maybe there's one or two deep facts that have Clemson or somebody doesn't want 'em but they're ... and we can find those guys and the I think it's playing dividend that seasonal ... [noise]\nUh there's no question a let's get let's get to the game coming coming up this week\nThis is a winnable game no question I mean Sam France having their good team but they're having some struggles also are there are always pretty tough at home though going Alabama Alabama I'm how are you preparing your team for this game anything different\nBut we got an open week this week John So we're not we're not playing Saturday and we got Sanford and then we've got the citadel the following week so\nEverywhere else I'd been on an open we take the next two opponents which you're going to play and you kind of divided up the practice time so we gave the young men on Monday all other than don't study and lifting weights was very impressed one of our receivers gig on lower on the\nPlane Ninety five ways having a hundred and fifty yards and the touchdown on ten catches a went in there and set a new PR for squad max on Monday by ten pounds [noise]\nJordan more did as well Austin brats\nOr did so we had three guys that are you know during in season on on squads which is a testament to the job the foreman is doing it in our weight room but we're taking this week working on being the best are getting better hey what do we need to improve and they're putting in a neutral schemes against Sanford and spending bill\nEspecially defense against it at all because there are trip Watson attack\nWhich I think having played in it\nGo to the fans are the big game at home you've got San for next\nWeek or Saturday until researching then you come home against the Senate down on the twenty that's always the big game for you chatter chatter Chattanooga then you're going to road runner right after that\nA lot about your defense I mean the little tough on the last couple of weeks if you look at the\nMercer game Mercer gain I think I'm doing this my memory about seven and a half yards of play um that's just unacceptable I mean you can't you can't win that way how are you would

some degree a privacy for people in this so\nNow in contrast Senator Cornyn of Texas said there does need to be some sort of public statement\nIf not the reports themselves well it's kind of leak out\nBecause the Denver the Senate Democrats or does anything negative in there like you had fifteenth ears one day and that's that's gonna lake [noise]\n\nI don't think making the file public is a good idea [noise] corn and went\nOut to say that since the accusations have been made public just seems to me that people are not going to be satisfied until some public statement about what the FBI\nInvestigation showed it doesn't matter what it shows that the that the Democrats are going to criticize the good that they're going to interpret it in a different way it doesn't matter the whole this whole thing doesn't matter\nIt doesn't matter what the FBI comes back with unless they found corroborating evidence beyond doubt and that's something nomination what ever they have in that report the Democrats will refuse it it's not long enough it's not big enough in an interview enough people there's other people to interview the other witnesses they haven't done it\nThe White House managed it it's a sham we need another week it doesn't matter what it comes back with you know with the Democrats are going to say a cabin on\nThe bottom line is just tries to die every single accusations every single one so the question becomes then where do you go from here [noise] so this report is going to come out today or tomorrow\nIt's going to go to the Senate Judiciary committee or they're trying to go to the full Senate because everybody has to see it in order to vote on it and McConnell said you got to have a vote on Saturday and on about what you do not a moment to sell\nYou're on

the fact that he got he got a bum rap\nHere forget the fact that uh people jumped on him and uh we have no corroborating evidence but he should go because we just think you should go and we should move onto\nAnother Supreme Court nominee like how 'bout Merrick Garland is that's not right he says ultimately this is Corey Booker ultimately not whether he is innocent or guilty that's not a trial we have enough questions have been raised we should not\nWe should move to another candidate move onto another kind of okay so now if you're just raise questions\nAnd make false allegations that certain\nEnough in order to sink candidates and destroyed their lives that are going on that have been nominated by president to go on the Supreme Court\nUnbelievable [noise] this is Corey Booker speaking during a press conference on Capitol Hill you said the partisan rancor\nIs enough to derail the nominee\nTo say cabinet I like to drink [noise] okay so cabinet or drinks fear therefore he

was knocking question to get a handful of people that say the opposite\nAgainst Fifteen hundred who signed letters\n\nAbout his his temperament is integrity is work ethic and everything else but that's a [noise]\nApparently for Cory Booker that's all you need a it's just [noise] I got to tell you what I'm telling you if the Republicans don't a\nCut from him on Saturday they don't deserve to have a party and they won't get crushed in the mid term\nBecause Trump voters are going to say you know what they can go to hell they are not going to come out because they will have stood for nothing\nAnd the problem is they're all going to get lumped that Jeff Flake structure vote now I told somebody this last night\nJeff Flake is going to vote now that leaves no room for error all the

of them may not have been true and took quote Richard Blumenthal\nAstonishingly one untruth does indeed undermine a person has credibility and if she lied about the polygraph if she lied about travel

men and confirmation because it will indeed impact our country\nThat liberal progressive agenda that has merrily written along with the Supreme Court for many years it's about to end and I think that is why you have people really debasing themselves trying to make sure that this nomination doesn't go through\nIt obviously it comes down to\n... Collins and Murkowski I think both Collins and Murkowski will vote for Kavanaugh if there is nothing in that report Frank I have no idea he is so compromised\nBut at the end of the day he portrays himself and in fact his ratings than voting records show he is a conservative who is he really willing to squander that possibly unique opportunity to put a conservative on the court and guarantee as I say quite a few years of conservative bias on the court\nIs he willing to throw that away or because he's so eager to be the loved by the left I have no idea the man is so full of hatred for Donald Trump than it appears he'll go to any lengths whatsoever to confront him but honestly I Would be shocked if he votes against him\n[noise] well uh we differ on that he's going to vote no yeah it would be the opposite where he wants to be lying in the New York times and the Washington Post that some kind of a Republican hero\nOf our time and you know go to write a book and the whole thing and and make a lot of money he's going to vote no it really comes down to Collins and Murkowski does every now and it was this this is no secret and um I Would be personally shocked if there's nothing in this report and columns voted no I\nI just could not even getting on TV and trying to explain it\nBecause she never says anything stupid I mean if you follow suit because like I Do I Love falling because every time she speaks of like okay that makes it even if you don't have I Know I think\nYou're right I don't think she'd have any grounds for doing it and she has kept an open mind from the start\nAnd she has basically said unless something's surface you know there's no reason not to vote for him what do you think about Murkowski\nI could not imagine if callers to tell the least she's going to vote yes yeah that Lisa Murkowski all alone in Alaska sinking this nomination and thinking the same\nUp to twenty twenty because it'll it'll destroyed the Republican Party as we know what I get real voters out and you can anybody else if this guy goes down with their weapons that's different yeah I agree with him and his wavering so that is\nOlder than her hands and I don't know how you take somebody down where there's no evidence because and then\nYou basically read warn the Democrats\nYeah that I think is almost the most offensive part\nOf that scenario I totally agree we'll show boating health promoting a heinous behavior the lack of decorum the lack of decency dining find science sitting on their information simply because it made it for more potent gotcha moment does that\nReally is that behavior that the Republicans are going to condone I sure as heck hope not and I think I agree I think Mitch McConnell and the other a card in their stack Mitch McConnell has been absolutely ferocious\nAbout getting judges on the Supreme Court and lower court he has made it his ... he has basically refused to put through a lot of other\nA senior administration officials who are awaiting confirmation because judges have been his priority and I think he's very smart to do it I think he's ... I mean the Republicans across the country should be applauding us because nothing more than the judicial branch needed to repair\nIt more than that and I think so I think it's incredibly important that he was doing that um and I think he will get mccaskey and Collins in her room and promised them the moon politically\nOr if they go along with us and I don't mean that he should have to because as you point out if there is no evidence to support any of these charges shame on them for even wavering mean whether you've got drunk and high school or not what we know now it's even briar was arrested for underage drinking that\nDidn't seem to stop his confirmation\nAnd yes it's not necessarily equivalent but let's get a grip here folks\nAnd look at what we know about this man what we know is it for Thirty years he is behaved with unbelievable dignity integrity a decorum he has had no charges ever leveled against him like anything like that as an adult so\nOn the other side of that ledger we have hundreds of opinions that people things so highly of that they are frequently used as a reference point in a other judgments and other arguments legal argument and this man deserves a place on the\nSupreme Court I really hope he gets there\nOkay we're we're listening to a tribute to\nThe newspaper the hill and also the hill on the line at all so far and she has a new column out called Trump's America for Paul scored big big win with a new NAFTA you're also lists I Love your new website I Love the light blue\nOh [laughter] that's what got me in a good mood really\nMuch travel but I think you know I like it it's\nSort of weird I I also like and I don't know if like I said is on the radio I guess I can just give me a feed the factors were were friends but\nI also love the way uh your name is at the top and where is that called when you're writing it my son always script script yeah not for like script and it's very soft and it also matches the dress you have\nOn that is on your thing it's it's the same um like blue so it just works that's all well\nAnd I appreciate that why they are now I Want to\nHave it on my helper who basically pushes me to do everything that's constructive [laughter] for me\nAnyway yeah whoever does your website tell them that John Frederick club [laughter] well thank you [laughter] [noise] I have to walk it\nBack thank you for having me on I gotta run [noise] always fun to talk to you appreciate it\nLet's take thanks for being with us Steve Bannon coming up into\nFive cubic right here on the John Starbucks radio network that have you with us and also sheriff Clarke will be joining us seven thirty five plus your calls I got a couple of text year that I can read\nA real fast I got about where we got about a half a minute and let's get to this Germany in Chesapeake says what August is shown me is that we have an issue with using the justice system to legislate\nInstead of the legislative branch doing the job that might be the point to great cabinet so it was written opinions are not use it's a scorched earth policy\nI don't think it matters once he's confirmed it doesn't matter what you think of\nIt doesn't matter I mean you saw that with the Clarence Thomas here so we hit a storm or George from Newport News [noise] you'd never passed out drinking beer because you drink rolling rock it's a cheap beer drinker real here he says and you will blackout\nRolling rock that's my brand John from radio network truck that she will stay with us [noise]\nWe sleep they need to be on the\nMiddle East to point out that they do [noise]\nFor them it's like really bad\nYou know has a lot of merit to it [noise]\nYou know that's a great point Mac where's the Bush family wears George Bush where's the Laura Bush wars all Bush's words Jeb Bush nowhere to even know where to be found not one of them you're right\nWhere where's the Bush family does anybody know\nYeah there there there are certainly not shy about criticizing President Trump when they don't like something done right they jumped right into that ...

DC where I\nSays that white geo piece senators deserve miserable that's after having a hearing that she did a profanity laced Twitter tirade against Kavanaugh\nCalling him a rapist and to perjure she described the Republicans as I'm a death cold and filthy swine and she's teaching at Georgetown University what's the deal if sheriff\nWell you know what the deal is really get away with whatever they want\nThey go for the world I mean look at disassociate are assistant dean at Catholic university said some think tweeting some things you got suspended by the university and she has a right to do that\nBut at the same time what you said was nothing near nothing close to what a you know some of the language used by the people on the left and\nYou know our site when I say our service qualify that the conservatives were tired of the tactics used by\nThe left but instead of sitting back in and whining what we need to do it you know and and getting out where he's what we need to do is define better counter measures counter strategies to deal with this stuff more effective ones but I see different kinds of strategies because to sit back and pointed out\nIs one thing and that needs to be done because the lying liberal media won't do their job um but when you know individual see some of the things that they do like we're talking about somebody called the other day M Ms\nFord Mustang got they was the guy from Fox News who got fired that was called the ... and I had a little bit of a little over the top there is no doubt about that he got fired\nBut then you look at the New York times or that one woman who said she hated white man you don't say get away with whatever they want to one of the ways that we can come to that at ground level and fighting back is to make sure that we get this a\nJudge Brett Kavanaugh confirmed that job one on the need people to stay focused on the task\nAnd it's getting just to come from a new what he's been put through and he said it best I think when he said this thing it's turned into a joke I Want it the senators on\nThe Senate Judiciary committee and I'm Talking about both GOP and a Democrat that one of the proud of themselves as to how they conducted this search and destroy mission which is another thing another crazy Kevin argues that's what it's become you know this man\nIt's been put on his family's been through enough this cruel and unusual punishment and I'm as far as I'm concerned that's prohibited by the eighth amendment to the constitution to all these constitutional issues that are involved in this uh\nYou know guilty before a proven innocent or the rule of law due process is trashed the rule of law has been thrown out we live in a country where you don't have to prove your innocence but all of a sudden now when it comes to judge Kavanaugh you got to present a\nInnocently these charges so this whole thing has been passed paradise I say enough is enough I was disappointed when Chuck Grassley initially move to date from September\nTwenty fifth any more attuned to the Thursday and then they moved it again and you're all trying to appease the Democrats nothing's going to use them you see what they're doing now the Democrats\nCome up with a list of twenty five people they want interviewed their job I don't know if if you're an old Mitch McConnell understands and he said it in the lower the Senate or the other day but\nYou know piecing the Democrats and why John think about this three senators flake Murkowski income was reportedly went to the president said hey we need political cover to\nWhen ... why would you need political cover to do the right thing what's you know what politics in the swamp has become the doing the right thing would have just been going to vote but in any political cover I think this shit [noise]\nSure Clark uh I really appreciate what you're saying and sharing that perspective because I hadn't thought of it that\nWay and you're right\nHappened here's the problem with being in DC all the time like me\nIs you take that for a grain of salt because it is kind of the way the swamp in\nSo I I never really reacted to that but your one hundred percent on target why\nWould you need political cover to vote for somebody who has false allegations against them and I said are false because they're not proven they're not corroborated there's no witnesses and the witnesses that were um that were identified either denied it or refuted it so you're really\nSheriff Clarke what political covered you need for that\nBut you don't you just need look there's there's no evidence and it's incredible and\nI think Jeff Flake is going to vote no he's he's he's got some and\nI said this earlier today he's got some imaging his head where he's going to be you know why and he's going to be the darling of the New York times it will be you know featured on CNN is some\n... great free thinker or something so it really comes down to a Collins and Murkowski I mean that's what it comes down to what do you think they're going to do on Saturday sheriff Clarke\nWhy I don't know what to think in terms of what they're going to do this people it flip flop around they don't vote their conscience it's really hard to say I mean we all go to John McCain made it so rest in peace was going to vote to eliminate\nObamacare and he came in there and cast the deciding vote to\nKeep it alive so it's hard to say these politicians you don't know where they're coming from it it's all of them are in the swamp and really change their mind but in a minute so in terms of Collins and Murkowski probably whoever gets to where they're going to\nYou know what that that that might very well be it so I guess you can say is the FBI ready for it is released we think it'll it it it could be this evening early tomorrow if there's nothing in it then they have the whatever it is political cover they needed and you would think this nomination would go through\n'em let me just ask you this if it doesn't go through what type of stuff do you think that's going to have sheriff David Clarke on Republican turnout on November six only thirty three days away\nAnd I said it would affect because political critique of setting John you know that yes we've done everything we again conservative voters the base with everything we've been asked to do we elected Donald Trump president
