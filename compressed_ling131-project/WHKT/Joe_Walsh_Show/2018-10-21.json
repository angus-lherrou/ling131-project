a part of\nOur educational approach here I'm an executive director Virginia free foundation research economic development economic education a is to better inform\nThe electorate in Virginia it's elected officials and business leaders and a part of that is our next guest who is joining us from\nYeah how do I I uh I have way too much coffee in the morning\nYou and me both me and I go through a pot I'm I'm Down here and I'm no I'm just ... ready to go to Mike what's going on in New Hampshire these days\nWell I'll tell you what we've got a we had a couple of presidential candidates running for twenty twenty already here in the last week so are things are wrapping up\nSo this is only from the Democratic side no Republicans have gone up there right\nNo well you know this is talk of course about John Case sick and or Jeff Flake running against Donald Trump for the Republican nomination\nI actually wrote 'em and bad for uh the statewide paper here in New Hampshire just last week and it's pretty silly to take on Donald Trump I'm a ... you know she is a it anytime a in a Republican primary\nWhere a sitting president has been challenged it's been on the right job and these guys are be running on the last day really wouldn't have a prayer\nFeeding the presidents and the Republican primary\nRight now right now that's that's right now anything can happen goodness knows who have had anything\nCan happen any thing of course and especially you know God Forbid the economy collapses\nRan that's when I was like no one like that but if what if what if mother drops a big one things can change All right let's let's shifted the Democratic nomination credit primary where I think we're four hundred and Seventy nine days away something like that from the Democratic primary hamster [laughter] who's counting\nRight but not that I think it's I think it's smart crushed for you to to be talking about just stop and ... because the the presidential stuff you know there's there's all kinds of things happening behind the scenes right now\nThis is where it happens right the pro pro isn't that right bro frozen them then [laughter]\nAnd come the day after November's election candidates start doing things in a more public way but like I said senator or Joe a branch from New York was up here yesterday campaigning\nSo she's laying the groundwork she's ... and you know she's doing that all across the country and um [noise] ah so she's starting to to put things together I'm Alec Baldwin I Know it may seem showy I'm sure you've heard about it to the guy\nHe's making round he made his second trip to New Hampshire just this past weekend real\nTwice in the last six months Alec Baldwin Alec Baldwin and he has said he has not ruled out running for president\nWow thank you Mike we're making news this morning this was my comment in my producer the show looking at we're making news this morning Steve ball like this one that was\nA young talent Alec Baldwin has um a spoke at the largest fundraiser for the Democratic party in New Hampshire to um I just last week that\nWow see the rain is old out Goldman is Jack Ryan you know it's kind of my guy yet but [laughter] that was back in the Cold War you know hundreds of October [laughter]\nThat's right yeah so who else you've seen up in in New Hampshire and who would you get asked to be the front runners in the New Hampshire primary today likely to win a the twenty twenty primary in the February next year you're up in\nIts Bernie Sanders ... Mr President he will be the front runner okay just no doubt about it now a New Hampshire no doubt about it ... it seemed to I'll take a down a little bit Warren will likely be the front runner\nOkay so how about what recently happened with Senator Warren in New Hampshire how does that play with her I mean fumbling of the DNA ancestry ball this week the disaster\nYou know and democratic circles I actually don't think it does much a liberal Democrats are going to be looking for a liberal Democrat regardless of facts\n[laughter] you know they they think they serve their choices in in possession primarily on emotion and in a\nJesse Harris from Iowa just going to do if you heard that a very a veteran democratic operative in in Iowa\nWas describing a seat um cos team but the reality in the in the Democratic voter in the primary motor but they also want to win and they might go you know I don't think seniors can win nationally I think\nThat's probably not a I'm\nA Republican I think a list of the war would have a similar problem\nI don't think she's electable in that in the\nGeneral election nationally nationally okay yeah I ... you know for that using DNA issue as an example I'm ... and so\nI thought one thing I Will say though it's a I I don't think it affected her here in New Hampshire I Do think it affected the again the behind the scenes operation a and then you know the\nAll the maneuvering going on behind the scenes among potential democratic candidates for her to actually take over a news sites all before the election the way she did was uh\nWhy why would I mean if you knew the results of the DNA test and it was counter to your narrative that you're trying to look after you put that thing up midday on Christmas [laughter] have you been married for them right away you\nKnow I don't understand it so how do you think okay so you got Sanders worn just because this New Hampshire but the other guys have got to go up there and compete or do they have to they might say just say\nYou know and I think they do I think they do because there's always going to be opportunities and that's as you probably know Chris ... the um don't Clinton made a name for himself by doing well in in coming back\nTo to win at a time when she was losing so you don't have to win the New Hampshire primary to make to make waves across the country\nSo especially as Elizabeth Warren is the proper she's from Massachusetts neighboring Massachusetts the candidate who comes in second and even third ah I can get momentum as a result\nYeah because I think Clinton finished third right yeah that's right yeah so\nSo but you have to win points for show in New Hampshire to advance do you have to yeah that's right that is correct and I ended up with I don't think people understand about the the democratic nomination process this cycle is that California\nHas moved up yeah and they're going to happen that's expensive state and Kamala Harris McConnell Harris is going to have a big lead there\nYes and that's the I think that's going to be an interesting thing I didn't hear if you guys talked about this will put on the Iowa\nA conversation but what she does in the early primary states will be interesting given the California moved up we'll see try we'll we'll try and a ... and pick a state to do well land well should try and do well in all of them and um they don't cause they're so different types of early primary states compared to California\nWell again I think you have to at least try to compete in somebody's because\nThe reality is even though you might not win New Hampshire you won't matter the the uh the nomination legitimately so you still have to win in the in the electoral college that tracked personal you can't you can't just blow past\nIowa New Hampshire because those are those who have gone in either direction we especially with Trump won in Iowa last time that's right no doubt about it what issues are driving New Hampshire voters these days what's going on up there\nWell ... uh uh the economy is\nThere's still the number one issue\nUm the governor here a is a Republican Christian new a new and he's\nAnd uh uh with what Donald Trump's been doing it and governor Sununu the economy's booming we have the second lowest unemployment rate in the country than John I'm part the Democrats don't want to talk about that they're trying to talk about anything but the economy with\nA family ... paid leave issue ... they're just trying to make up\nAn issue that might connect with voters authors in the economy so that's going to continue to be number one the second issue here Chris I I don't know how it worked in other states you've heard Donald Trump even talk about this is the opioid epidemic or which is pretty ... pretty severe in New Hampshire so that's the second biggest\nWe've had we've had the we've had that disease in our family as well and it's a it's a scourge and the number of people dying as a result of that is the doors or anything else to go to our country and it has it's going to get a handle on it and I don't think that's part of it as I\nSay it's not a partisan issue Mike a final protections what do you think coming out with got thirty seconds punch it when he got\nFurther the Democratic nominee the Democratic finishers in New Hampshire twenty twenty\nI I Can't going to go a little bit Warren a won't win or if she she's going to win the New Hampshire primary um I think they're going to be I I think there's going to be kind of dark\nHorse like a um a Cory Booker I expect will be somewhere in the top three um and then and then you know what I Would not be surprised at someone like Michael\nBloomberg doing like is it as well because I got a democratic state we need we need or the bank or all of a business man\nAll right Mike Denny joining us from the Granite State of New Hampshire four hundred and eighty days plus or minus out of the New Hampshire primary thanks for joining us we'll be back on the John Frederick sure this is ... filling in that respect my heavy\nHow how do you know we're not all that ... doesn't hold a lot I mean the nor nor should you nor should anyone involved in this country but how do you how do you compare the intensity this year to last year when he was the same similar not as intense when he says well\nSimilar but I think we we're we're very proud particularly in Virginia last year when we send a message to the country into the world that you know hate and bigotry have no place here and that we were open and welcoming for business\nWith the election of governor Northam and his team and then you got that jumps first set of a house candidates that guy across the finish line that just beautiful tapestry of of of of of our our\nOur candidates that are women and a diverse women and I just it just eat up so that was that was really great but I think what's happened is\nPeople realize we hey we can do this we can do this and it's just helped doubled down and we see for example the surge in the absentee balloting I'm In Fairfax\nCounty in Prince William county which our number one and two right now in the state or requests for absentee ballots you know that's good for us that's that's all I remember when I think we're just added you know adding more excitement and enthusiasm\nRight like Clinton kid was on earlier the seven o'clock hour he said he's he thinks the turnout is going to be forty to forty five percent that's a large and it's a large a range and there but we're projecting turn out right now\nWe're just going out there looking for every single vote\nWe start [laughter] I Know where do you think the terminals\nYou seem to get out there is a lot at stake and um and a sandwich going to be better than your average that turned out it you know I'm not in the business of of that we're just gonna we're we're just reaching out or we can you're just ... ... yeah we're in a G. O. T. V. now famous and we are just trying to get out of us\nAnd Britain were anybody else that wants to ...\nI've been impressed with your with your crop of Kansas this year in Russia they they definitely worked hard what struck me as a sort of an obvious one is that your the predominant of female candidates nominees\nBut it just is definitely the year the woman I like to talk about our women candidates and then I got an Anthony\nLack of anti landmine [laughter] I mean for\nWaxed and is is I mean and they're all they have a different kind of experience and diversity but it is also good at all will be a good refreshing\nBrass um ah for Congress and across them across the Potomac several states that are in general for West End up there in the attempt congressional district that we're really excited about what we see up there\nOn the volunteers are just showing up on non stop\nAnd the Washington Post\nEndorsed or which is something that on a you know\nAnd Barbara Comstock got endorsed every other time when they're very disappointed at her that she's going to stand up to Donald Trump and that proved not to be the case so ah her contract cheerful west so it's going to be on a congresswoman and then\nDown and I'll just run through a real quick if you want to ask me something about him but we will go out on the line at lower yeah and the second district a retired navy commander in the small businesswoman and\nOf course Scott Taylor got he's on his own problems with a\n... you know trying to cheat and quite frankly and on\nAnd and and having a staff are put have fraudulent ah signatures on the ballot I mean that's you know that's unheard of stuff that's pretty safely and not I mean 'cause I didn't want to reject that but but even that we you know without that we still have a fine you know it's a credible candidate\nWell when I when I've seen in your in your tennis yeah those are the obviously a female but when I think it sends regardless of the outcomes that we can talk about polling and they'll come in November and you know when kids got the Taylor up and\nHe's got washed up and Coburn and and and then the Williams was in the in the six uh when I think it's sending a signal though is that you're going to see even more women in the future running for office regardless of party and I think it's a very unhealthy dynamic\nYeah yeah and I wanna I Wanna I Wanna say two things on that real quick we were really excited that Leslie cover just got moved into a red the blues um program for the D triple C but the thing I think you're exactly right about women women have always um um\nWomen have always and studies show yes but you know been the one that would end up with your mom would agree with me on that would have\nBeen all over my heart so hard to say don't go [laughter]\nI'm going away I got raised my kids I got to get my degree and got to pay off my line and you know a man can do it\nTwenty six teams was one of the fat it will not waiting anymore we're going to step up your own life mom yeah something to offer and I\nDon't I think that you we will just seeing more and more of that because someone sad is that what I'm saying and I don't know who was you know if you're not to table you're on the menu and if you look at what is it state this year with women's health care law with families\nAh with just health care in general you know women have a lot to add to that and there I Would I just don't think we're going to step back anymore\nNo no no I don't I don't think you should and I think having the frankly it's not just that they're women but they're but they're in a certain age range to relatively speaking to me a couple of little bit older a little younger but for the most part you're you're center cut on mom's right the suburban mom is this is a strong voting I won't say block but a market\nBut I I think your party is obviously intentionally trying to attract\n... correct correct and um those suburban moms some of them who voted for Donald Trump\nI think you have seen the ramifications of that vote and we are reaching out and talking to them and particularly when you take something like the Kavanaugh's nomination where you know set aside the fact\nOf whether you didn't they didn't believe Dr for this was a man who is temperament we saw back his temperament that does not fit to be a judge and then add on to the fact of you know her very compelling test to test the money and arms\nAnd and they you know Republicans decided not to ... to ... there's going to be some ramifications from that\nWe've got um let's talk about mostly Coburn moving from into the three D. triple C a red to blue program\nUm then you're you're making the news here in the drawing Frederick radio show this morning we had the other folks make news about ethanol in Iowa and Steve bullock is a potential outsider and how we're bombing in New Hampshire with some [laughter] so you're you're ... three for three but my colors here\nSo this is news was recovered is moving into this special category of funding from the triple C talk about that\nWell we just we just got the information ourselves and that just shows you know that's an open seat\nWe've always thought it was very competitive and are we we're pleased to see that on the inside the beltway group recognize that as well she's Seventy two thousand dollar car you know the ... district is really really dig it goes from up in a faulty accounting all the way down to the north Carolina line\nIt's got a lot of different you know Raul that you know it's got Charlottesville area in it too it's got you know and then you've got sort of the D.C suburbs lift off here so you got a little bit of everything but she is really a campaign in every part\nOf that district and ah and I think that you know here you're sharing it towards the end they finally you know solve the value in investing more in her\nWell it also says hey they have the resources to do it\nRight well that's a good point too I think that is and if you've seen the articles that is you know our candidates are actually\nSaying I'm a Republican incumbent psyche looking Dave Brat versus Abigail Spanberger I think she got raised him three don't want to maybe this last um gets gets weaker selling records on 'em and and you know that that's just what we're seeing all across the board\nI think a lot of them are small donations to which is like really gratifying to see that as small diners are the ones that really invest in you and show up and knock on doors and time day care and uh and put the ...\nWell I think that's showing up obviously in the polling generic ballot is a little behind where are you all were last year at the end of the day\nAnd if you just followed the if you just follow those those numbers and the data you probably do quite well election day maybe not as large as the nominee that happened in Virginia last year but you know showing up on the ground um I I

delegates I surf from two thousand two to two thousand ten and currently I'm the executive director of Virginia free\nThe foundation for research and economic education Virginia free is a nonpartisan underlined nonpartisan boldly non partisan\nOr a visitor pro business out of the advocacy organization here in the comment there for Thirty years I'm not only a pro business we're also very much\nA working towards responsible pro business government because as we heard in the in the news updates Mike we heard that that China's economy is slowing down its growth and that's a problem they have a significant debt burden and their economy is slowing its growth down there\nYou know you're trying to like be be that guy and that has that has devolved to where we are today largely as a result of several factors\nI'm Wondering the Iraq War or to the collapse of the economy in two thousand and eight\nAnd a and that has led to this massive worldwide suspicion of government or what's going on today this unsettled place that we are in this world is not just manifesting itself in the United states we are not alone in this in this in this cultural shift is manifesting itself in politics\nIt's showing up in Hungary in Poland and in Germany over the weekend in Bavaria which is actually I ran into a [laughter]\nGerman political picture of a weekend fancy that right you're going to exchange program I didn't want to go to the vet and I was like I my wife I'm like I really don't want to go and watch football I Want to chill out Sunday night was a great game on Bob oh go you'll have fun okay fine subsidies to German teachers\nTrying to have a conversation and thinking I don't know any German writer what are you going to do ... you know young boys [laughter] how's Hitler you know [laughter] I must have been you know where do you go with that conversation well it turns out there\nAnd I and I said so how are the electricity in Bulgaria because they're very has their elections on Sunday it was a very important election in Germany\nThat's the kind of guy and that's what I followed and well this one teacher was up or a teacher of politics so then we went down a rabbit hole two hours later at the dinner table we just we're just we're chewing up politics\nAnd what he's telling me about the very was\nIs that is extremely successful economically it is the richest region of Germany for full employment like three percent unemployment youth unemployment is extremely well ah the school system is set up to get people to work straight away\nUm if if you're like a tenth grade and you're not you don't really want to go to university you don't have to fake it to make it you can go right into a a a trade school with apprentice program and you're getting a job and you get a diploma so they get um really made so it's a very work intensive area they\nThey pride themselves culturally\nOn work and productivity an organization and good government right there it was like a it's not like a shining example of how\nYou would want to have a state where a region actually be everyone's employed everyone has a job the evidence functions ah and it works well they had this major upset in the very election Neal what are you upset about what what could you possibly be that concerned about\nThat you basically blow up this I don't know if they blow it up but had this major upset in the ruling party that had been it has been in control for\nDecades last probably the ... the ruling majority in Bavaria and it was stunning to me to realize that we're not immune from that here here in America so people say\nYou know the economy Republicans are the economy's going so great vote for us\nPeople don't vote on yesterday's news they don't vote on today's news\nThey vote on the future where are we going where what is going to be happening that's my fear that's my concern is well things are going well you know\nWhat Donald Trump got elected gasoline was about two twenty five a gallon now it's around two eighty or two thousand eight was four dollars a gallon or better but are we getting better are we getting worse you know we see here the China\nNews today about their economy is slowing down its growth rate of growth\nAnd that has a factor on the human psyche about how how's it going to manifest itself in my life you see these commercials they're not all about you know skills and here's my dad says there are about this guy's off all she's horrible there ... there but there's no big overriding issue like\nHere's what we're going to do in the future it's just that the other person is really bad therefore they're not going to be good for you\nUm and therefore because he counters going so well they can hurt the economy I guess this is what the ... and the subconscious\nBut I'm going what is the big driving issue other then obviously Donald Trump and it's a fascinating time in American politics are reasons why do what I did because it is so interesting but also to teach people\nAs I used to tell my students I really don't care I'm really don't care [laughter]\nWhat you think I care that you think if I can encourage people to be more interested about what they're talking about to read another article\nOutcome for the rest of us and I tell my students I don't care who you vote\nFor I just care that you vote but if you don't vote I understand that's also a vote in itself because you were saying I'm not I'm not doing this I vote none of the above and it's and that's and that's tabulate in it'll aggregate itself just like a vote will and that people do that doesn't make any sense\nActually it does if you don't show up for something the two political parties going to try to get you to show up next time we're trying to reach out to you in some way shape or form that data point will register I tell a student or a family I was at a baseball game\nAnd they were so upset or I just can't stand voting and dump out if they haven't earned your vote don't vote and tell them that you don't put it on social media like he would anyone else anything else so I'm not voting you haven't earned\nMy though you haven't got me off my couch off my duff to go down and say I'm voting for this person you don't register it'll aggregate data\nAnd that raw data collects and is dissected by the political class to determine what they want to do 'em and they're in an ... swings on the undecided voter right independent voter in October is like oh we're going to stop talking about these issues that motivate our base to a degree we're going to focus on these\nOh I'm really happy to work with the other side received this now and in certain cats I work with the president what shows up at the polling independence and they may not like President Trump but when they agree with something you'd better work with him to get 'cause that's just you know all politics is personal not just walk anyway this is Chris actually filling in for John FedEx if you tuned in to hear me droning on\nIt up politics go who is this guy\nA I'm a former member of the house of delegates I'm filling in for John ... as I Am want to do a as John is on vacation with his son down in Florida in a baseball tournament a John is a baseball fan by looking as well but he was a pitcher in college and his son Joe Joes a picture\nOf you want to call and ask me some questions love to hear from you\nEight eight eight four to five six four six eight eight four five six four six eight eight for eight oh five six for six or you can text me straight away five four zero to nine four zero six eight zero five four zero\nTo nine four zero six eight zero I'm gonna have some great experts on later today Clinton kicked CRISPR Newport Jack was simply Republican Party with congressman Rob Wittman\nA doctor Robin McDougal from the Virginia Commonwealth University of Wilder school and Jesse Harris from Iowa who is a political operative and uh it was it was on the Democratic side in from the Republican side from New Hampshire will hear from my dinner heat and Susan slacker or my good friend from the Central Valley\nUh we're I'm known citizen for you know gosh early nineties I think\n[laughter] I start aging yourself there's there isn't\nA Democrat a chair a chair of the Democratic party Virginia from highland county I Can't I used to represent\nAnd they've known citizen for for decades and so we have we have a great friendship and I and I'm looking forward to having all these callers calling today and stir up the conversation a little bit go a little deeper we're going deeper today in politics we're going to go deeper dive in not just you know the pope polling the top one numbers but how those posters got to those numbers who are they\nSo he does a polling like CRISPR Newport you'll hear quitting to talk about this they start with a very broad universe um and it keeps coming down to a smaller University of actual likely voters\nGermans\nAnd we'll get to that will get into the nitty gritty will still be able to get you take you do a deeper dive so when you look at the polls and he got like a real clear politics which which I spend unfortunately way too much time on 'em but I guess is healthier than other websites right [laughter]\nThis is a healthy Internet\nAh it's it's a a ... you look at these different polls and you go like that just to just take a look at the uh\nThe the polls on the generic ballot it's insane what the what the what we're looking at here hold up its it's fascinating like generic ballot follow this track plus Democrats plus a Democrat suppose five Democrats plus eleven\nDemocrats plus a lot of Democrats plus one what how do you get there\nSo you say the polling is wrong well poems always right it's just data you're collecting other people call what the differences isn't the methodologies who you're going\nI talked to one leading I'm\nDemocratic source and I said okay what's your polling showing me he said Democrats are around mid low thirties thirty four thirty three percent for it to that range Republicans\nWe've never seen self identification for Republicans is while it's around twenty four percent and what used to be you know\nThirty four thirty four is now thirty four twenty four and independents are up around the load of mid forties\nBecause Republicans have never been lower on self identification but we haven't picked up any of those voters they're all self identifying now as independents that\nIs huge and when you get down to it with people when they understand what's really going on that's when they get more excited more engaged this is Chris X. men selling for John Frederick it eight four five six for six stay tuned come on back\nHappy birthday to have a beer you know put a picture of his of his or her brother with this with the Budweiser tell 'em just reminded me so much of my friendship and I'm a black how blessed that wants to have it in my life but also\nA what a what a blessing and it's just to be alive right to be able to\nAh just to be experienced at all and I'm Wondering is I enjoy coming in during his radio show where they get to hopefully get people excited about politics I'm a good that does governor lives is important you know we can't break down we have to work with each other\nTo get good things that we should have the debate though we should have a vibrant vigorous debate that frightened moves the country forward\nUm and we shouldn't be afraid to have that debate but we should have in a in a civil manner and I think today we see it or a lack of civility more and more and that's difficult\nIn my professional life I Am the executive director Virginia freed the foundation for research in economic education and uh we're probably want to see three see sex and we're not partisan which is a great lane to be in these days because everyone is oh\nYou know red or blue and I'm like okay\n[laughter] even matter right oh yeah [laughter] get healthcare so [laughter] but what we did was we represent\nBusinesses and uh we have membership and we tried to do is educate them on politics and as a former teacher and from a business person my family in a bottle water business for years old a couple of years ago a blessing um you know I\nI like getting people excited about learning about politics seeing it differently and what's that makes me do is learn an even deeper like you know when you when you go teacher subject it better than other subjects you have to really get engaged in the subject so it's an every day I get to learn more and more about politics it's it's a it's a deep interesting topic because it brings in culture\nAnd a economics and history that was a history major so I I get to bring down altogether 'cause it manifest itself as Andrew Breitbart said in the last that last segment you know culture is down politics downstream of cultures so if you want to impact culture or their politics impact culture first and foremost suffer your cultural legal\nLeader you'll be you'll be a political leader give us a call an eight four five six for six we got some great guest calling in today are not just congressman Rob Wittman but also the leaders of the two major parties here Virginia posters Clinton kid and Robin McDougal and then two operatives one from Iowa\nAnd one from New Hampshire we're only I hate to say this because you're probably second tier the elections already in the midterms we are four hundred and Seventy two days away from the Iowa caucuses [noise]\nFour hundred and Seventy two and now it seems like a long time but let's be honest as soon as this election is over you're going to start hearing reports back from Iowa and New Hampshire\nAnd we're going to be at the forefront of that we're going to get calls you ever get a chewed up but there was a sub operatives their Republican and Democrats to see what's going on the ground I think Trump's got the lock on the nomination you never know\nYou never know you never know goodness knows you never know with Donald Trump because um that that that that's that's who knows who's actually does what he says it says you can do but you never know what's going to happen around him\nAnd I think that's one of the more interesting parts about politics today is because he's brought that dynamic of ... or what max and that sort of it was if you remember from your uh ... days in school or or at work you know when the leader changes and it's like a substitute teacher which is going to be like your\nYou know you get you get a new boss or whether it's a it's there's just the newness and from since June fifteenth of\nTwenty Fifteen this has been at very different political dynamic are not necessarily unhealthy because it has made us think and react differently and respond differently and I don't think necessarily on healthy\nAh but we do have you ever vigilant to make sure it does not become too unhealthy and I think people are recognizing that we have\nUh some some discourse in this country\nOr that can be improved we can get better at that as a people and how we do that is every day one on one with each other you want to impact politics if you want better representation be better people sort of comes down to um they represent us and if you want them to be better it's up to us to be a better\nSo give us a call at eight four five six for sexual talking about polls goodness knows was more calls and I don't want to do with these days\nI'm On the real clear politics they give you the um average of all the different polls and they break down the individual polls\nI'm now poll should be looking at what are called Elvis likely voters polling companies should have an understanding of who they imagine are going to be showing up on election and she had a pretty good handle on may ... began in Virginia about a month ago so that we should know who's actually voting\nI'm In Virginia in or you can always tell the Arlington because they're the tabulation their uh their absentee ballots some friends of mine that attracted me to see what kind of a who's voting relative to the last round of elections to see what the intensity is\nDo you look at the at the averages of the generic ballot them this is why I Do this is why I Do that\nIn twenty Seventeen when governor Ralph Northam defeated at Gillespie he won by eight point nine three percent a point nine three points the generic ballot on that day was nine point one\nIf I'm trying to instruct the class what do you want to follow\nFox News Reuters Rasmussen CNBC Emerson Maris Quinnipiac\nWilder pool poll a Christmas Newport which one do you follow follow generic ballot right now because that is that is fairly proximate to what happened last year and the year before and twenty sixteen\nIf you look the generic ballot in twenty sixteen\nIt was very close it was like tied and Republicans over performed on election day by about a point and they won in a generic congressional ballot I'm obviously Trump lost by about three points a nationally three million votes um so that's something to consider when you're saying okay we're just going to go I think\nI think the the objective view here is look at the generic ballot look at the average and you can pretty much extrapolate where it is right now if election they were held today and because\nIt's on that basis it it takes away the the partisan lines you might have or a would be inclined to\nIf at nine point one percent the dams won by eight point nine nine point one point nine that's very close\nAnd they are at seven point six right now it is safe to assume that they will not perform as well as they did in twenty Seventeen but still will win and likely when the house\nOf representatives given the the dynamics in the Senate it's very different because of individual races likely that Republicans a hold on to the Senate what's the dynamic that if the Democrats have the house and the senator that Republicans have the Senate\nWhat's going to have the next two years and that's how you can sort of figure out where this thing is going so that you can understand what you need to do or not do like myself I don't watch\nCable news I don't watch broadcast news every papers in the morning off to publish the Richmond Times Wall Street journal and I get my information what's going on in the economy and politics and culture and whatnot\nAnd they're even listen to you know the the uh the national talk radio shows I go to work right yeah I I've dealt with my eyes\nThe numbers of you know the Fox news of the world and the MSNBC it's a very small subset of the American population but they're the they're the most active\nVoters they are the ... they're the activists so those shows are pretty much you're broadcasting to the activists about what they want to hear about the messaging points that they're they they they're supposed to repeat so when you watch when you go to Facebook\nOr Twitter or Snapchat or Instagram or whatever they're very different social media platforms you see the replica repetition of the message and you're like wow I I go to a town hall after I got like a congressional panel was from my friends you know if there is now in Congress the receipt made semi\nI watch them and take the questions from the audience is like where do you see them getting information it's fundamentally wrong but that really upset\nI mean angry not pleasant not understanding but what\nDo they show up for this show up because they're angry they are concerned but more importantly like anyone else in the world they just want to be heard right how important is that in a conversation to hear what the other person is is really feeling and get down to okay\nWhat is that what what is what is making you got to say oh 'cause there's no no no\nThat's that's the operative subject matter [noise] what is triggering this fear and when you get down into the nuts and bolts you ... you really can't understand\nWhy people do what they do and hopefully get them to a better place in station life and it's not easy to do but it's a it's it's what we do it in a democracy in the public and form a democracy which we have\nIn in America thank God I'm so we can just live more peacefully amongst each other governors self self\nGovernance I think is really important a historical concept and I think we've lost sight of that a little bit it's easy to uh but more importantly it's tougher for\nFolks to point out that he was like what we can do better we can do better calmed down we got this I mean are are you have too many TV channels at night do you have too many options\nAre there too many restaurants and grocery stores around you is it too good are

trying to attack the attack as to bring down the positives and bring up their negative to have an outcome in the election are you\nHaving more difficult time getting people because uh\nWe're not we're not having any more difficult time than we had been having 'em in the years leading up to um today\nSo Virginia is about two thirds cell phone mostly or cell phone only users and so our sample we we actually draw samples of cell phone numbers and so we do quotas on her cellphone versus landline sample\nSo we basically go into the field with the batter to third one third cellphone landline split already um and we haven't found our response rate on cell phones to be any different than it has been which is\nNot great um you know people typically are taking cell phone calls to do surveys like they were landline calls in the seventies to do surveys show\nWe're not finding it any more difficult than we were already um I Do have colleagues around the country who are finding cell phone number is being blocked more um and and it's driven by this um all of this fishing that's been going on with our cell phone numbers lately\nI Can't remember what my phone number is recall from Idaho we're in right\nAnd we we do there are two things that we do to try to help us with that we have done it by ourselves at Christopher Newport university so we're not we're not an anonymous number or we're not unless the number you'll see who we are when we call and then if you said look put me on your do not call list will put you on our callers that we won't call you back\nOr we don't have to do that because\nYou know according to the federal regulations were doing research academic research went up working we're not getting paid to do this we're not making a profit so we're considered um researchers so we don't have to comply with that did not call it\nBut we do keep our own do not call list and if somebody says don't call me I don't want to do surveys then we'll put 'em on earth do not call it so we try to be transparent in that way as well\nLet's fascinating because most people go on on on those do not call as they are because because you are academic nature interesting so your turnout model is showing forty forty five percent that's interesting because the people I talked to some things are they're hoping is going to be around forty eight\nThat's so that's so it depends on who you talk to 'em it could be forty eight um it could be higher I mean so here's the real sort of question that I have in my head right so\nIf there is a big blue wave if there are a lot of voters that are engaged right now who didn't even vote in twenty Seventeen\nThen we're missing them in our survey were not capturing that right and that's some of the pushback I got back um what do we want to put out our second district poll showing Taylor leading Luria\nSome Democrats push back and said well you're not even capturing some of the voters that were newly registering in and they're going to vote okay fair enough but we have the luxury in Virginia in in that we had a twenty Seventeen election that we think captured that surge pretty well it it ... it brought Ralph Northam into the governor's mansion\nRalph Northam on the second district by four percent first\nAnd that surge pretty well but it may be even bigger than\nAnd also Republicans may have responded 'em by by engaging their base voters already know if they've done that we think we capture them because they were already voters anyway um but if turnout is higher\nI think it's going to help 'em I don't know that helps one party over the other all the way it might be helpful to Democrats because it might be that extra search that we might that might be a lot of new voters that we're not capturing\nSo you ... you you saw the search I call it the suburban tsunami and I'm twenty seven to ... you saw that you saw it\nI think you had an aunt yeah we we were we were modeling\n'em in twenty Seventeen like we are likely model this year or what we were doing and twenty Seventeen as we were we were modeling the same way\nBut we were also looking for new the registered voters 'em in twenty Seventeen because of that was that was that surge that was the difference between twenty six year twenty Seventeen was a lot of the new suburban voters\nUm and so we did see the surgeon twenty Seventeen we all know what it looked like in Virginia and so there's nothing that says to me that that's going to be any less this year than it was twenty Seventeen and there are things that say to me it might be a little bit bigger than it is that it wasn't twenty Seventeen and by the way\nIn twenty Seventeen the Republicans were as engaged as as you would want them to be it's just that Democrats were a little bit more engaged\nSo you'd think it might be even bigger this year\nIt very well could be I don't think it can be much bigger but it very well could be um\nDemocrats in particular are trying to register new voters or they they were until the deadline and Republicans I'm work trying to register new voters as much as they were trying to mobilize their their base voters that are already there so I mean look if both parties\nIf not likely to be because we don't have a really robust statewide race going on 'em and we have ... competitive congressional races some places and not at other places\nSo that's part of the reason I'm thinking forty five\nUm but if it ends up being forty eight it's because there were many there's massive turnout\nGoing on in some of these really competitive congressional races um I don't know if you're a if you're if you're looking for a competitive state wide race to drive a turnout we just don't have that this year and so that's part of the reason I'm hesitant to say it's\nGoing to go as high as forty eight but look I've been wrong many times um in all the wrong many times in the future\n[laughter] goodness knows that's what I'm Talking about the state not close\nClose um it I you know what I find interesting about the statewide races that um it's not close yet you see Tim Kaine campaigning\nIn his ... his campaign campaigning as if it were close he's running ads on on every in every television network in in the commonwealth he's campaigning like he's got a a more for a bit of both formidable candidate that he has and I think they're\nBeyond twenties sixteen um and and and sort of the difficulties of being the vice presidential candidate on the ticket and toys sixteen but I think he's also recognizing that in some\nOf these are really close congressional races um if he can pull any coattails um if he can write out any coattails\nIt can be really helpful to the Democratic candidates down ballot and so I think oddly enough Tim Kaine is running\nA campaign to get re elected to the U.S Senate and running several congressional campaigns to elect Democrats um in in in some of these competitive races at the same time um and he doesn't really have a challenger that has a lot of money but Corey Stewart is\nAll over local talk radio which is where his voters are going to be and so I think Corey Stewart running the kind of campaign that he needs to run to give voters out given\nUm how difficult situation he has a little money is\nSo your state wide pulling that\nWe used we pulled the Senate race several times\nAnd then decided it wasn't going to be competitive to Poland um throughout the a final stretch from Labor Day on instead decided to pull these congressional races because really for the first time in probably decades in Virginia if if if a hundred and some odd years\nWe've got a lot of a lot of really competitive congressional races going on so we decided to pull the congressional races instead of continuing to pull what doesn't appear to be a very competitive Senate race\nBut we are we're wrapping up here in the segment with which you have a final call here on what that is going to look like in the\nDay well probably somewhere Fifteen Fifteen ashes my is where my ... I'm at right now it could be a little bit higher could be a little a little bit lower if it's a little bit lower it's going to\nSome of these congressional races are going to look really good for Republicans are going to be really tight if it's if it's higher if it's closer to twenty than some of these democratic congressional candidates are going to have a better night I think fifty\nSixty seven sixty eight yeah anything moving a libertarian primarily making an impact and all\nYou know and and and and we we anticipated they might given that that you know a lot of country club Republicans might not be interested in Corey Stewart but at the end of the day\nWe're in we're in a very tribal period of our politics and if there's an hour by your name a lot of Republicans were going to just vote for that are and not actually give 'em the libertarian their their vote so we don't see\nAny uptick I'm I'm among libertarian candidates either state wide or\nIn these congressional races um there's a libertarian and attempt this libertarian seven we're not seeing any uptick with either one of them\nOkay thanks Clinton kids Conan looks like an opportunity last Libertarian Party they had a chance to crack the crack the market here a little bit in Virginia they might have fallen short this is Chris ... filling in for the vacation and John ... come on back\nI Know I think you're talking to your arms talking you know I haven't figured it out yet\nLet's not go there [laughter] you're the elected got right now standing joke so uh you know if you heard the last second with Clinton kids from Christopher Newport or are you seeing anything different than what Dr kids seen out there\nWhere I Know I heard that the the back and out here it's um interview and I yeah I I sort of got the sense from the discussion that perhaps he's seeing more of a blue wave that I'm seeing I'm you know I'm In in regular contact with\nAll our congressional campaigns um throughout the commonwealth and frankly most of them are doing really well um and I I Will be a\nSurprise to put down really come down to perhaps just two congressional districts being really in play when we get to the election night\nTo just to which too\nI I see you know the seventh and the town's clearly are the two battlegrounds right now I think the other ones that perhaps people are looking at a fast but I think Denver ragle man is clearly running a far superior campaign there and so I think Denver um\nWill uh will be fine come election night on there had been some talk that Scott Taylor's race\nScotch really working hard um I mean if perhaps we'll be closer than we otherwise would hope but I think at the end of the day Scott should be fine as well so\nThat's where it comes back down to Barbara Comstock in the tens 'em and Dave Brat and establish this way I see it at this point\nBecause Dr kid he didn't mention that Brad spanberger racing I live in a district I see it every day at least in western in Rico county and\nThere's a stark difference in what's going on the ground at least but I I pulled back and try and do the objective follow the data you follow the data the Clinton kids writing falling what you're saying\nUm the Taylor and ... are the ones that are most in place as far as you know changing I'm changing party right if they're accurate or your guts Taylor up my seven and ... down by half a day or night tens of like that\nSo if that's consistent than his polling is accurate\nUm it would probably show up if you if you were doing on brand spanberger imagine that he would\nBut he also pointed out obviously the quality of the candidates important local issues are important\nBut also what do you pointed out was he didn't see the big Kavanaugh kicker a that everyone in the talking about this is going to have this big search for Republicans or if it is is pretty quiet people make up their mind just going to vote\nAnd as he said Republicans are show up in midterms\nAnd and I sort of see the ladder I mean obviously what I'm looking at his anecdotally um but\nDuring the prior to the to the judge now justice Kavanaugh hearings um there was some um perhaps apathy on the part of the Republican base um but that changed almost immediately\nOr with those hearings and I think the Republican base in Virginia and I think the Republican base around the country saw what a Democrat majority in the United States Senate and the Democrat majority in the house representatives under Speaker Pelosi would look like\nConstant um investigations calls for impeachment set a precedent\nState party chair with a clear up tick and enthusiasm response or the emails fundraising jump significantly as a result of that\nAnd I'm as it's been said before if somebody's going to write a check or send some money to the party or a candidate they're more likely going to vote for that person as well so it may not be showing up in the polls quite yet but I Believe\nThat there is a renewed and enthusiasm they're clearly wasn't enthusiasm gap between Republicans and Democrats prior to the Kavanaugh hearings but I think that gap spin eliminated so now it's just a matter of turning our folks out\nSo you're seeing the enthusiasm kick up I talked to Morgan Griffith about a week and a half ago and he said the same thing you know it was a if you were doing the scale of one to ten ten million you know absolutely undermine showing up no matter what\nA he said you know Democrats were around Ninety and my folks around thirty said but my folks are now up around the the uh so he he he sensed it he felt on the ground inclined told me the same thing a ...\nFrom the anecdotal standpoint I Do think there is a renewed a fervor in the in the Republican base that quite frankly is getting a lot of what they want to know why so actually as part of the hardest thing in politics you know\nWhen you get what you want your show up are you satisfied or you know you're fat and happy new stay home because things are going pretty well but what's the point\nUh but I think that the cabinet things sort of re energized refocused at least the Republican base on uh wanting to come out and vote but you're seeing that throughout the state\nI Am and I and I think you're getting what I think folks realize you're right I mean it was got what they wanted and twenty sixteen we have the president and acting tax cuts the economy's booming lowest unemployment and and decades and so there was a price on complacency in that but then I think now the Republican base sees\nAll that can get done very quickly with the Democrats control the house and Senate and so I think Republicans are saying we've got to roll up our sleeves and if we want to keep what we've got we've got to go to the polls and vote for it\nUsually the cycle of politics right so what as the new chairman of the Republican Party of Virginia or what is the next step for our people worry all going what's your Republicans in Virginia but you only got because when you look at Virginia and Maryland you have to give to a very strange electorate you have\nA democratic Maryland with a Republican governor who looks like he's going to win three Fifteen and twenty points in Virginia which has been a battleground trending now towards a blue state Tim Kaine couldn't get things who's gonna win by Fifteen uppers properties maybe twenty points as well\nYou didn't really have this dichotomy don't you all across the Potomac were were then there's the dynamics in politics have changed in Massachusetts has a Republican governor\nUm who's up pulling a the leading Democrats in the state Charlie Baker you have a governor a Republican governor of Illinois um is is is the ... other Republicans in Virginia sit right for the electric\nWell I I think what you're saying I obviously I don't know that in our current climate in Virginia whether any of the three candidates you mentioned governor Hogan and others who worked with securing the Republican nomination in Virginia right now but I think what will recognize and then I and I'm sort of sense to perhaps a more pragmatic\nI'm a somebody you know six\nMonths ago had mentioned you know Susan Collins and Lindsey Graham being I'm sort of a stalwarts of the Republican Party people to laugh but now I'm getting request is how can we bring Lindsey Graham in to speak in Virginia for candidates and and have him as a featured speaker and places it was so\nI think the Kavanaugh hearings may have shown is that what we need to do is have a broader based in the Republican Party that can bring conservatives to gather around core principles and perhaps uh if we can agree on eighty percent of the issues we can disagree on the other twenty later on after we start winning again\n[laughter] again the cycle because look both parties are having their their ah ... battles right I mean the Democrats have their own battles are Republicans are having their battles were going to have some posters\nAnd that pollsters are some operatives from Iowa New Hampshire calling nine o'clock hour as you listen to that we have one calling in from a Democrat from Iowa Republican mantra is going to tell us what's going on there are states or the the national caucuses because that's really what they are really\nOnly I say I don't have time to worry about that I got you got to hold out for now I guess the state Senate up for reelection but there's nothing that worry about point Tony after we win and preserve I bet you're already in the house and Senate next year in Virginia and the\nGenerally push back here because the dominant theme in American politics is what's going on in Washington DC and it's being reflected back in in the states and in the local to the districts because Trump is the issue right now since\nSince June fifteenth of twenty Fifteen that man has driven the conversation every day in American politics and if you know four hundred and Seventy two days away from from the Iowa caucuses people going to be focusing on those issues\nBut it's going to get very retail very quickly why all the Virginia races are going on and that's the beauty and the dynamic of Virginia politics isn't it because we are we are the polls\nWe take the temperature all the time\n... that's exactly right and I think\nUm for a congressional candidates this year I think uh last year gave them sort of a wake up call and they can say OK perhaps ramp to roll up our sleeves and work much harder than we thought we were going to have to and so\nUm you're right that this year will sort of perhaps give us a preview of what we can expect in twenty Nineteen but that will be a sort of a pulse of the of the country for as you say\nBecause we have the entire general assembly up\nIn this time next year ... all one hundred and forty members of the districts in the general assembly\nAre going to be up for election and there's so many issues at play and what Clinton kid was talking about what he's seeing in his polling is that quality candidates matter and local issues matter I got an email last night from a former colleague of mine talking about Corey in northern Virginia\nAnd uh basically local development and he was engaged on also thins out emails on traffic patterns and potholes and I'm like this is not what you're doing the general assembly but if that's what the voters want they want someone talking about right but I\nI think that's right people are really looking for results from their elected officials and the things that are impacting most people today with a booming economy and job I'm strong and wages growing people are looking at some of those other issues that impact them on a daily basis trafficking holds up
