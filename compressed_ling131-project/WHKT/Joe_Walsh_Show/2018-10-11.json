Milky Way national headquarters where my studio where the most corrupt\nTowns in America right here you know it's amazing the disappearance of juvenile cause shockey and um\n[noise] we're getting very little press on it other than me and a couple of other people yelling about holding the Saudis accountable for that\nUh you don't hear people out of anybody except the Washington Post\nIt is unbelievable that an eight journalists should go into a Saudi chocolate and their stand bowl who was and he basically in political exile self imposed exile in the United states self oppose in the

present gotta get directly involved and say look a\nShield these arms sales you got going on you know what I put a hold on it right now until I get I get I get an answer no planes for your Saudi

needs to do but will ... will be a a [laughter]\nWhere we watch to see what happens joining us now there was a Doberman and\nWe'd love to get Vanessa Newman on a show because she knows everything about South America she's a Venezuelan American business owner\nA contributors to the John Frederick radio network she's also the president of a company called asymmetrical she spent a lot of time in Brazil she knows what's going on down there we've got\nA an election that's there that we need to know about and uh she has a written on this uh extensively and she is with us now are just returning from Brazil where we were following her work their Vanessa Newman asymmetric ... great great to have you with us we're not\nGoing to be on again John thank you so much always a pleasure to be with you\nKnow I don't think there's anyone in America\nThat the media that it's more knowledgeable about what is going on in the Brazilian elections than you are can you hear court Hansen overview you were there for what you just got back ... what's going on yeah\n[noise] yeah so I'm doing something in common and why Britain and Argentina are a lot and I I've been to spend a lot of time in Brazil this year [noise]\nAnd I was so basically what's going on as we have the ultra right wing ultra conservative has just swept through the first round of elections so the way the Brazilian electoral system works\n[noise] any party can run you know you know it's it's a different system from the American system choo choo rounds\nOf elections right [noise] so they had Thirteen candidates running and\nBut they should myself it and good but analysts don't [noise] I'm not I'm not really sure I mean it is controversial detectives doing that's what I was going to do something but it has you know you do have people protesting that these are extrajudicial killings\nThing you know without due process of law\nThey kill more people [noise] [laughter] I'm not saying that you often not the right\nPerson so that you know that\nIt gets in town here in the fact that they get pretty quickly right I\nAm sure why it can work I don't know because I think Mexico but seems to be basically became an arms race I mean in Mexico the cartels world ratings so well armed\nThey already have military grade weaponry or that they could out quite a bit in the military now the question is will not succeed in Brazil because they're already using the military in Brazil in the ... which is the arms of Rio\nRight which is the ... you know it would have required presidential order [noise] and they don't always win you know when they fight the drug cartels they're often out gun\nShy and he's saying that don't do more of a shame and the rest of the country a lot see whether whether you know they have the Philippine success sit you know so called six hours\nOr the fear of Mexico but I think they did it too late or how do you have too much corruption and the problem is all of a sudden you have the local police or the local governors\nAh had too much corruption now you have a similar political system in Brazil where it's what they call it an average of ... which is the local governors like in the U.S write the local governors have a lot of power or it's not\nIt's not old rule from the top it's a lot of local governments are a lot of local enforcement and that didn't work and Mexico and\nUh let's see what it works in Brazil\n[noise] well I think that there is a difference and you pointed out and all the\nExperts that have studied that it said that the the Mexican military was way behind it arms that were done in the biggest problem they had\nAnd you just now but if they would go in pursuit in areas and the local authorities were being paid off by the cartels so they were jumping off the cartels are about all of the military operations where they were where they were going to hit\nA where their movements were and they had they had they had better better weapons and they and they had the intel uh being sent to them by basically despise that were part of the local law enforcement apparatus that we're all in the tank to put the Mexican military which is not that\nBad it's not like they were confident I mean the the way they're rated it is about in the middle of the military in the world I mean they're pretty well trained but they didn't want to\nKnow that if I got a significant amount of training and intelligence officer for us right you don't hear about it but there's you know there has been a great deal of collaboration between the U.S and Mexico\nBecause this is a common problem for both countries so you know there's there is you know and it's very complicated in America you don't want to broadcast [noise] you're working with the Yankees you know too much because it looks a little bit like you can't run your own affairs and taking orders\nThe court trials I mean they'll set that they are and drug cartel basically\nFound from former special forces\nRight so these are former military special courses that spins off got paid more by the cartels they were the Sikh audio which is the staffers were different cartel and then they said hey we can do this time around and establish their own cartel so these guys really know what they're doing you know\nReally unbelievable so uh it seems like false scenario was tapped into the what you say the the desire for changing the status quo for Brazilians and ah you know it looks like you're looking at people people forget one in four\nOut of every Brazilians voter is an evangelical and uh yeah I understand I think I I read eighty five or Ninety percent of federal lawmakers or even a joke to this very Christian nation and I think the heart of this I\nI don't see how the workers' party candidates overcome a overcomes the deficit I mean that would be shocking to me when when you get forty six percent of your closest rival is twenty nine percent of that\nOf the other people that voted for the other candidates there's at least five percent of their who just don't like the dog and they're not voting for them a show like if a\nFalse narrow just as people are getting together with\nYou Brian very interesting point there because there was another changing dynamic in American politics right to the issues across the region I mean I don't want to paint every every\nCountry will stay brush but if\nTo generalize there are some things you can generalize on corruption and security right so those are the two issues\nSo aside from that you hear on the other important issue which is the rise of the ... voter so a lot of these countries most of them I I in fact I I'm I'm hard pressed to think of one another in Cuba or are we mainly very Catholic\nBut now we're seeing something else which is more evangelical it's a form of Catholicism a but it's very much about\nSpreading the word of God it's quite problematic it's it's even John Call 'em you know adults being baptized in rivers and all of that\nAnd that can dynamic that we're seeing in Latin America you'll always kind of harm box and it has been the sort of smaller local villagers 'em and you'll see it and you even see the importance of the U.S if you go into very much for your hobbies\nAnd our local church in the news and they called themselves the animals as opposed to cut costs right so they can Christian rather than ... [noise]\nUm but it's kind of next door to Catholicism [noise]\nWe're seeing that in in Brazil was the biggest example because it's the biggest country so it stands out the most and as I said we had a hundred and forty seven million voters on Sunday [noise] um\nBut you are seeing it across the region you also saw it in Columbia out in it you're going to get his presidential run\nAnd that's part of what's driving the shift to the right is the rise of evangelical practice is also driving the anti Iraq and the and the return to very conservative values um but it's also another way of spreading the same type of\nPolitical ideology sort of getting very intertwined the politics and religion\nAnd they view themselves as being on a mission you now are on the mission to purify the political system\nBy bucking the system they're going they're becoming was forced to themselves [noise] and um and it it it it's it's gonna be interesting to watch um I'm not sure exactly how this you know how this days out of Latin America teachers if anything is that the pendulum away swearing as\nWell as swinging now we're going to see how this turns out when is the run off of that so what is the day [noise] October twenty October twenty October ... showing him so in a couple of weeks so we don't know where I quickly\nAnd every country when you have like a first round and the second round election\nThe second round is about three weeks later write checks because you want to bring it to a resolution that gives them because their party's enough time to do better you know a messaging and a bit of I support that sorting out that one into formed a coalition but it you know you want to get resolved quickly so\nI think that by the end of October where we're going to have\nA boat so now into an office and he was going to take a hard right now he's also going to take a hard line\nAgainst Cuba against going to swallow um they also have a problem with this one is on migration coming across a you know and and they got refugee camps in the jungles in the Amazon jungle there are a lot so now those gonna\nYou gonna wanna crushed that problem um I mean he was literally that's ducks the terms of what she\nSpeaks of\nA you know the U.S who's going to have an eye on that front but he was going to need to get a lot of advice and you know maybe there's a possibility to see it is to make a friend out of hand if possible we're we're going to see but see where we stand because he doesn't have a crime policy we can do that it was an opportunity\nGoing to be very interesting we're going to\nNext week and a week after that to keep following this this is a fascinating election and certainly the time of change and in Brazil and as you as you're surfing or across South America and that's if people want to follow you are and get more information where did they go\nOh thank you so much well first of all [noise]\nWine and T.

going to do the same thing and this is this is the plan now John we've seen\nIt for two years right people go in there to serve in that capacity and then they go they write a book but Jim ... book sold a lot of copies gyms very very wealthy and that's what these guys want to do this book comes out in\nEarly December Clinton who was the deputy director of the FBI\nUnder oath on three and two and he was fired for that book is coming out because they all profit off of Donald Trump would sell in the book world insulation stories about Donald Trump we've seen\nThat now with fire and fury in Woodward and all the other you know tabloids that have been out there and published but my guess pretty accurate Rod Rosenstein is going to do evil use his perch and number two person at the department of justice or took when he finally leaves whether he's firing quit\nTo go and write a book and just you know be skating against this president because that's how these guys stay alive and how these guys state or you know in the public arena and it really is a terrible terrible thing to be honest with you\nWith the new allegations out now that the rock and seen comments that he was going to attempt to wired wired to the president\nAnd they do with the tape for this animal and then do the cabinet to invoke the twenty cents and then get them out and I get to FBI has to be a senior officials saying they believe them and they thought he was dead serious they reported that to their\nShelter James Baker he thought it was serious McCain started with the origins of the way now to information\nThat's off I mean why doesn't the smartest guy now\nLook I think I think you're exactly right I think the president wants to get through this election cycle doesn't want anything to distract the Republicans have momentum on their side but I Do think you have to look long term the ability of Rod Rosenstein to stay in that\nPosition look if he wants to leave that position he can do that anytime he can resign if he wants to but I think you have to call into question does he have the ability to continue in his capacity as a deputy attorney general based on the information that we're hearing from other members others she remembers\nThat served with him in official capacity in the department of justice or the FBI they're saying that their accounting for\nWhat McCain said to be true\nThat's very troubling to everybody and we do know on a quickly that Rod Rosenstein who signed one of the fires that application renewables which allowed them to continue to spy on American surveillance\nOn us soil application has never been made available to the president's not rejected that we need that we need to\nSee that we need to see the thrill choose which are the FBI's milk after\nThey talk to Bruce or at the department of justice to\nSee what's in there and we have to understand where the insurance policy wise to keep Donald Trump from being elected to the FBI was talking about and what role if any where I was in that because as a deputy attorney general he had the right to sign that fire application and from what I understand\nAnd what is becoming widely known now not application was riddled with mistake and it\nWas based on the false premise about the doctor that renewable was actually signed when Donald Trump was the sitting president of the United states\nSo would you recommend to the president's Robin Jones' November\nAnd look at what I Would recommend to the president is declassified all over documents let the American people decide and see what has actually transpired the FBI's credibility because of what gym called me and Amy McCain and now James Baker and Peter shock and leads a patron of guns that organization\nIs just devastating it will take decades to recover from what they have done jet organization trying to use their positions people went to the party people badges going after American citizens spying on American citizens\nBecause they didn't like the political affiliation of their opponents everything that our country has been against censorship inception\nAnd guys like Peter ... the head of the counterterrorism unit has more ability than anybody he\nWas one box the Clinton email investigation cute little one who led the team that it was called crushed by Hurricane Sandy hey there's nothing to seeing these extra six\nHundred thousand Clinton was in the mail they were all part of his laptop and he's the one who said hey let's go after Donald Trump he's the one that investigations we've seen\nIt now with the text messages between weeds a page and Peter Struck and they work at least minimum complicit with what Jim Comey and McCain and Jim Baker and potentially Robert steam one and done and the question is John and this is a very very big question\nHow did this go in the U.S government we know that the director of the CIA\nAnd the director of national intelligence and others were aware of this spying going on on domestic soil against us in a sense but exactly how high did it go I this is this is the biggest untold story of the last two years because this could lead right up to the very top of the government\nNeeds to be which leads to Jeff Sessions what happened to just not doing anything he certainly not launching these special counsel to investigate what you alleged to be the biggest scandal in the United states history ever um spying\nOn people for political gain all the way up to do everything else where Jeff Sessions\nWill look the whole investigation has been by and large turned over to the ige the inspector general of the department of justice to find out if there's been any wrongdoing and we've seen some of that report already because it's been released publically the report that recommended\nThe number two person at the FBI and they're only be fired but charged criminally\nWe're waiting for that to occur uh we're waiting to see what happens to Peter Struck and Lisa Page and and and Jim Baker the general counsel for the FBI and we're waiting to find out what happened to the gym combing because\nIt is very possible that Jim Comey has brought up on charges of potentially perjury in front of Congress leaking of classified information even though Jim said he didn't think it was classified that's not an excuse wouldn't do that\nA law professor to make sure that could lead to the media does that no one count ability\nBuddy level of the government for what they've done which was try they try to influence the outcome of a U.S direction because we're Clinton supported by and large they did not want to [noise] Trump become President Trump and I don't understand what kind of beer and wine and hasn't come out yet\nNovember seventh are we going to\nHouse or not\nSo John I really hope so and I and I and I hope for the president's take\nOn that he had to focus on helping him actually [noise] [noise] which will to do by and large almost singlehandedly if you look at what the president's\nBeen able to accomplish what three point seven percent unemployment the unemployment rate for African American and Hispanic [noise] downtown of this\nAh we're out of its staff quite candidly and we've seen in the Woodward book or the tried on multiple occasions to stop him from doing things and stopping trying to stop him from being successful\nBut each person has gone on and done things that historic levels [noise] just for a second\nIt's surrounded him actually wanted him to be successful\nTo how much more he could accomplish so much already but there are people who don't want to see him be successful there are still people who serve and the government or whether they're bureaucrats elected officials or people who have taken positions support him in a campaign and they're still\nTrying to stop it as a gender at every turn and the success that he has had\nIn the first two years of history and I can only wonder how much more he\nThank you get this has got to be the blockbuster book is one of\nBooks when the when the excerpts come on if it's got to be absolutely stunning Washington because all the other stuff was here say this is gonna be here's a list of the people that are undermining the president who put on a badge everyday and go into the west wing\nAnd they're basically a ruse guys they're spy if you will and they're working for the opposition and they're never truckers and they were put there by trade but that's what's going to happen\nIf the if the Republicans get somehow managed to hang on to these midterms fasten your seatbelt because the president's got to clean house and he's got to bring people in there that\nActually believe that it's America first agenda\nAnd you ain't seen nothing yet if you look at the ... if you if you look at President Trump's accomplishments in the last twenty months [noise] it is stunning especially in the face of opposition within his own staff\nI mean forget the other party forget policy and Schumer forget the Democrats forget the never Trump present Congress forget them\nI'm Talking about people in the government and people in his own staff\nHis team that tell me there every day in ... and are taking things off his desk\nAnd manipulating information\nAnd fighting him and a slow walking things installing thing including his treasury secretary my notion is another one from Goldman Sachs who tried to undermine every single trade\nDeal that the president made by a he's a free trader and his friends on Wall street and Goldman Sachs they want they want cheap goods and higher profits they don't care if you have a job or not what\nLay care they never cared about you in thirty or forty years old they care about is how big your bonuses and how much profit ten they drive in the business schools now teach that they teach equity for ownership workers are commodity yeah Gary Cohn in there fighting them I mean it goes on and\nSo I look forward to this and I I look forward to finally the president being able to get in a position where we can actually get something done\nEven though we have gotten things done but imagine how much more effectively ... if we can get to a point where the people surrounding him\nActually believe that his agenda and I for one hope that a court goes in there and some senior capacity because I think it'd be great John triggers radio network truck the truth across America [noise]\nSo we have a a resignation\nAmbassador resides Nikki Haley now I'm not a Nikki Haley fan I don't like her I never did [noise] sorry she was never Trump or we for on the campaign she embarrass herself by\nA joy your nose or a ... what do you call it response speeches to Obama and trashing Trump instead of using it to respond\nTo the president you for half a speech trashing Trump She was the never Trump or from the beginning\nOkay Trump has unique ability of being able to pick enemies that he thinks they're confident she has been a top of that a U.S ambassador and she's had to embrace Trump's policies but she's also publicly different with the president on a number of issues and deep down she doesn't believe any of that stuff\nAnd so I don't know why she left I mean she's a she's tired or she needs to make more money I Know her family's in debt I mean you think about it I\nI think your husband was military but she's got two children teenagers she lives in New York City you don't get a stipend for that you get a hundred and Seventy nine thousand dollars as a UN\nSo you have to find all that I mean it's a lot of money and so she's been governor [noise]\nAnd so she broke and I get that\nI get her leaving to make more money in the private sector and why not leave now where you can make millions of dollars and get rich because that's what everybody does do serve the government get out\nRich become a millionaire then go then go back then serve again and get out make more millions produced nothing but make millions the\nWashington government swap way and everybody's involved in both both sides of the aisle and all you only have to do is get a get appointed to a government position and you're guaranteed to have it make a mansion in northern Virginia or a\nBesides the Maryland You're guaranteed you're going to make millions of dollars by doing nothing except serving the government writing a book going on TV and\nYou know Nikki Haley will write a tell all book about\nTrump socks 'cause that's what they do that's what I don't like her I never did and uh she was certainly a competent UN ambassador but I have no interest and why don't you leave it at this time\nWhat ... have been better if she could have hung out for another twenty nine days twenty eight days now until November seventh and then decided to leave sure because it's another day we're not talking about the tremendous economy all the accomplishments that Trump is having Kavanaugh\nIt's another day we're not talking about the success of the America First agenda it's another day we're just changing the subject talking about something else and it plays right into the Democrats hands that don't want to talk about anything that has anything to do with the economy period you know now that the debt that\nBig push is Obamacare now they're running on on that health care or they can't run on Medicaid for all because it's Twenty one trillion dollars [noise] excuse me so they can't run on on that so what do they what are they running on\nPreexisting conditions that stern anything they found in some polls someplace that people are concerned about getting rid of Obamacare because that would get rid of pre existing conditions so if you voted for a\nCan't replace whatever that monstrosity was that Paul Ryan had 'em\nThat don't have pre existing conditions but the judge companies could raise your rates so that's the one issue now that it's come full circle preexisting conditions and a\nTrump sucks that's their that's their that's their campaign platform to who's going to replace Nikki Haley well the front runner and there's two front runners and then there was a two choices I've got\nThe front runner right now is dean of how she was um in the national security division she's a bushy um and it never Trump or but\nLast week in South Carolina with a ... a problem with her husband so she is the front runner\nI Would say right now I Would suppose and certainly the establishment pick to replace Nikki Haley\nOf my two choices German including a ... I'm sure she'd be fine\n[noise] uh but I think better choices or\nRecord now the ambassador\nTo Germany also happens to be gay who have the experience who's been in the state department who's been at the un who shares Trump's America First a genuine old with a lot of enthusiasm especially at real as it relates to foreign\nPolicy or that will be choices number two my choice number\nOne would be his daughter Ivanka Trump\nHands down she would be the best choice no doubt\nI don't think he's going to choose or he's afraid of being used of nepotism especially before the midterms I don't see it happening but she's in\nMy mind she'd be the best choice but if I could put a statement out yesterday saying that she's not interested in in the position that doesn't mean that can happen\nGot to market in there at least you have someone that actually believe in the president's agenda I'm sure Dina Powell be fine\nRecord that would be a better choice I mean at some point you have to start to reward the people who are with you from the beginning like Rick right now yeah he was a high profile\nGay Republican who came out for Trump very early Nikki Haley for Trump the hallway so at some point in this administration you have\nTo start to reward the people who believed in you know what the beginning who stuck by you went to a beginning who never wavered like right now and actually believe in the things that you're that you're saying and don't have to retrofit their own policies to tell me a lot now there's no sense of\nUrgency here John Bolton is in charge of it he was there he was UN ambassador he knows what he's doing so it's not like to have to get the show tomorrow\nWe've gone through the uh annual United Nations general assembly meeting so that's over [noise] but those would be my choices but\nI had to elect somebody if I had to predict now I predict this kind of be in a pile and Dina problems also very much liked\n[noise] [noise]\nNo says our town hall dog
