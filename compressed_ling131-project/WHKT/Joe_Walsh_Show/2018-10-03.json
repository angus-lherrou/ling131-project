reason to disappear in our troops in Virginia and it's really stepped anyway this is what it is\nSo this one Julie sweating it seemed to walk back and offer conflicting accounts of some of the accusations she and her attorney Michael lab and daddy watched against judge Kavanaugh or the NBC Kate Snow\nNoted that the network has not been able to verify sweating claim some of which differ from a written statement here's a little snippet here [noise] now what we want it to years lay out all that she said\nAbout her story are reporting we want to be transparent because these are very serious allegations of course they could get sued for ...\nForce\nThe president said they questioned her credibility and NBC News for the record it's not been able to independently verify her claim [noise] these are things that you told us on camera\nThat different from a written statement last week we've been trying independently to reach out to anyone who remembers attending parties was sweating and Kevin ... we've been asking her journey for names so far we've not found anyone who remembers that she's also unclear\nAbout when she first decided to come forward [noise]\nSo here's what's now ask Julie sweat on live TV [noise] you know what I'm\nTo ask everyone is wondering\nHere sweating censor I cannot specifically say that he was one of the ones who assaulted me [noise]\nThis is a witness I cannot specifically say he was one of the ones who assaulted me [noise] sweating basically said she doesn't know if Kavanaugh spite punch at parties like she earlier Clinton's statement so she doesn't know if he was there she doesn't know if it was him she doesn't know if he's like the punch she don't even know he was in the same\nState [noise] but it must be him because he's evil [noise] it's just it's just unbelievable I mean it's like we we are living room\nAnd Broadway ... a Broadway circus play\nEvery day this gets more and more bizarre and Kennedy's right it's totally grotesque [noise]\nWhat is going on here [noise]\nAnd how does this man is just getting it's getting tarnished crazy right\nI mean she has no information [noise] hey that that was that was a good part it gets worse [noise]\nSnow from NBC went out to say a\nExcuse me was sweating there are some differences between your one statement ah\nOf efforts by Kavanaugh in March judge despite punching parties in our interview she said she saw them near the punch but did not specifically say she saw either man spanking [noise]\nThis is unbelievable [noise] this is like saying hey bank was robbed and you live in a neighborhood therefore you Rebecca [noise]\nSpike was touched I never saw them strike it but they were [noise] they were wandering around [noise] ah it was a pardon [noise]\nSays well I sort of given red tops to quite a few girls during that time frame and there was great punch those parties I Would not take one of those classes from bar Cavanaugh\nA Brett Kavanaugh excuse me I saw him\nAround the punch containers I don't know what he did but I saw a bind them yes\nOr maybe he was serving French because he was a gentleman I mean when you've got to be kidding me this is the evidence and\nHe served\nTo leave all [noise]\nSweating claim that statement ... Kevin on others waiting in line to participate in a gang rape but she she she says she came to this conclusion\nBecause it high side it was in hindsight it was too coincidental that he was standing by a judge or what the other boys [noise]\nSo snow said standing in line outside of rooms sweat next not lines but ... by their doors and I didn't understand what it could be snow and you describe British Cabinet and his friend mark\nJudge standing by a door yes with other boy so you're suggesting that in hindsight sweating and yet you think he was involved\nI Would say yes I didn't see him but it was too coincidental [noise] okay so they were\nA party they served punch and they stood around\nI mean this is really unbelievable [noise]\nThis is unbelievable that we're even talking about this [noise]\n\nThen she goes out to say well I'm quite a shy person [noise] and quite a private person and it wouldn't be here today except for about six weeks ago I happen to learn about Brett Kavanaugh becoming one of the people who were short\nList to go to the Supreme Court [noise] show snow says this is in July ...\nA sweat that I don't really know it was sometimes [noise]\nSweating provided for names to NBC who she claims attended a party of that was for once said he does not remember sweat next one is dead\nAnd the other two I have not responded [noise]\nSnow ended by saying this morning sweating provided for names of friends she says what the parties with him one of them does not read call a Julie sweating it doesn't know who she is and now there is deceased [noise]\nThe other two we haven't heard back from that is the evidence if you don't think this is a circuits clown showing like Senator Kennedy says it's grotesque what they're doing it as a man with no evidence that you're living under a rock you're on the John ... radio network ...\nTonight NBC News has not been able to independently corroborate sweat next claims and when we asked to have an audio for any witnesses who could backed up her account\nHe provided for names of friends sweating says went to parties with her one of them says he does not recall anyone named Julie sweat Nick another of the French you name is deceased NBC News has reached out to the other two and it's not heard back should Brett Kavanaugh\nYou know some United States Senator Warner who is on the underside who's pretty aggressive I've seen that person in very very bad situation somewhat compromising and you know\nI think it's very unfair to to bring up things like this\nThe president refusing to elaborate on that charge tonight no word whether Kavanaugh has been interviewed so far Ford has knocked the [noise]\nHave your guts of the truth you're gonna get no ... no nonsense just real maybe it was great to have you on this phone lines open just for you this is where America\nComes to talk in the morning it ate Frito John\nAnything for you know five six for six coming to your life is always from your nation's capital in Washington D.

FBI\nSynopsis it's got to be a rundown of what people say it's so far nothing has come out there is no new evidence nothing is corroborated and they and they have to go and vote and I'm the point right now where just just vote just go vote on friday and law if you're Lisa Murkowski you want to\nVote no and you want to end your career so be it\nSenate in a ball of fire by bringing down Trump's nominee for the U.S Supreme Court if you want that to be a legacy have\nAdded you know whatever he'll nominate someone else this is so asinine it's beyond even now reporting it was even a straight face [noise] this is how absurd this clown show for the Democrats has become [noise] and so let's go vote and\nI'm willing to let the chips fall where they make\nAnd Lisa Murkowski she might vote no from Alaska she'll get a challenge she'll get beat in the primary she will not win another write in campaign she won't Andrew career if that's what she wants to do I don't\nAnd a quarter or seems to bankroll or math or and the Iranians don't have a lot of money to bankrolled them but they said they train them\nHas a lot to train them they've uh they've given them arms\nSurreptitiously through ... and um I think they want to keep that conflict going in Iran has said repeatedly that they think Israel is an illegitimate state so they bleep it has no right to any territory anywhere so so long as they repeat that position you're ... you're not going to get anywhere\nRuins and we're already in here to Josh Ritter radio networks he's alive in Cairo, Egypt he's our correspondent for the John triggers radio network in the middle east is also with the\nVoice of America and he's with CBS News correspondent for very long time covering a Middle Eastern affairs [noise] so let me ask you this and we're Hamas\nWhy would the Hamas not being favor of some sort of a two state solution to give the Palestinian people their own nation why would they be in opposition to that what's the alternative just perpetual war\nUm I think many a radical militant Islam is a the the ... the Muslim Brotherhood and they ultimately believe that they're going to vanquish Israel anyway um but what they're aiming for right now is\nTo have their own little independent conclave enclave in God's law bomb and they are are they were going to sign a deal with Israel for a long term truce\nAgreement which I think since Israel because they don't really want to see Israel doesn't really apparently want to see a two state solution anyway so they would be happy to see God's the guy's a stand and West Bank is than and job\nHave those two sides not reconcile a but God or the amount of people found that to Egypt was pushing them to come to some sort of an agreement with a with a ...\nThe long term truce deal with Israel so I think they're willing to have a long term truce deal with Israel but just not to have a um a two state solution [noise]\nSo it sounds like what you're saying is that the president's grand plan here to bring peace to this region um which they've not unveiled other than we know that involves two states because they link that\nWhat you're saying is that are in your estimation your analysis that Jared Kushner plan is going nowhere whatever that might be\nI don't want to be that pessimistic I mean it looks that way but I mean you know the very unpredictable anything could change in a matter of moments I think what we've seen over the years is\nThe change on the ground that's mostly been the result of complex and I shudder to think that that's going to happen again but it could very well because the\nMiddle East is the tender box in the dark on any minute in any particular place ... people keep organizing their their protest on friday and they keep playing the Arab News stations that there are people are getting killed after they marched them into the\nInto harm's way um\nAnd the Israelis are not budging inch on a two state solution so I don't think either side is willing to make\nThe necessary um moves towards a peace deal and as I said once again we could see a conflict that would set the whole place up you know a conflict that could ultimately have results on the ground\nWell the only hope here is that I think what the president has done in moving the embassy to Jerusalem the U.S embassy in the gangs Israel the biggest chip they wanted right at the outset and he got that done and of course a President Abbas was saying at the un in his speech that based on that\nHe doesn't want us to fall we can't trust them he doesn't have their best interest he said there one hundred percent aligned with Israel so why would our negotiate with them\nBut the other side of the coin is that the president now a is a in a position where he can ask the Israeli government for a number of concessions\nBecause he's already given that the ... the one big thing they want to write so that I think that's what the strategy is now whether or not Edward that's got to play out I have no idea but\nIt's look it's a plant right I mean at least it's a plan and we'll we'll see what happens but\nI think your analysis is spot on President Abbas says he's really in a lose lose situation because Hamas is not going to sign off on anything he does so then the other question becomes in is how are you better off getting a facilitator and they're just\nUm just to go ... when it's a mosque or you better off\n\nI think that they they are\nAnd a bath isn't a bad position a internally with respect to his own party and if he made concessions ... with his party could could toppled him and he's an old man I think he's eighty three now ready for getting close to eighty four\nHe's had heart problems and uh\nI I I I think with all the pressure the Egyptians are put on him I think he would have come up with a deal that he cut out\nA so I think logistically a with respect his own party he's not able to come up with a deal never mind with him on 'em so you've got a lot of players here that are unstable um I don't want to analyze the Israeli situation because Everytime you you you turn a there are there\nPeople who are trying to pull down prime minister Netanyahu is well um and you remember of course a prime minister Rabin who was shot 'em so ultimately or if he were to making a deal make a deal and they work to agree on it to God God only knows if there would be someone out there to shoot him as well so um [noise] there's so many\nSo many such factors in this kind of a a situation that it's difficult to see how you could move it forward but President Trump is the merits of trying new things every time you look at him so I mean I I give him credit for that and who knows you might think of a new a new plan [noise]\nWell look at least she's trying we're trying to do something [noise] um so I I I\nReally do like the fact that the president at least that he was he was a he was going towards a two state solution because many of us that really want to see the solved that don't have\nUm some of the viruses that go with either side you really can't see this ever getting solved without without each country having their own state I mean you just can't see it and I said the president was spot on\nWhen he says the Palestinian people have a right to be self self rule they certainly shouldn't be\nYou know under the sound of the Israelis and I think that makes I think that makes it a lot of sense and we're only got a couple more minutes I Want to get very quickly to um the circus situation [noise]\nWhere do the Turks play now in in this whole thing like in ...\nI've only got two minutes but to find\nTurkish foreign policy right now as it relates to the Gulf and Syria and it'll up where where where where are the\nTurkey is divided because they were trading main trading partners are Iran and Iran is in trouble so they need to you know they need to find new outlets the countries there are there other many now I have a president\nOr the one he's a a an Islamist he's a Muslim Brotherhood guy um and he's in a corner of being in a bind because he he's a he needs to come to an agreement with the Russians I despite the fact that there\nThe comic world in general um he had to walk the line a cut cut deals with a president to it and that's what they sort of dining in Lebanon north of Syria a Seventy\nStraddling aligned with everybody he's making compromises while at the same time putting out harsh rhetoric um so I think\nAre under the surface he's trying to come to terms with both of us are because they keep saying that they're going to be you know patrolling the north of Syria together it hasn't happened\nUm I suspect it may not happen but I think they're trying to repair those bridges they try to repair bridges with Israel despite the fact that they're bad terms that you've been opposed to each other on a lot of different issues um so\nI think he's in trouble I can honestly I'm with his currency in trouble with its trade with with uh with Iran and a lot of people wanting to putting gas and oil pipelines and so he sort of trying to cut deals here and there are the ship afloat [noise]\nAll right

Spanberger by the way uh with us on Thursday an Abigail\nOr she her staff put out a statement saying that the ... campaign had cancelled all the debates and they weren't having any including mine the ... campaign that responded to that and let me\nRead their statement this is from the Dave ...\nNothing more than the spanberger campaign trying to distract from the real story\nThat spend burgers own volunteers were caught harassing Dave Brat and his family\nIt was our campaigns understanding [noise] that we weren't in the midst of negotiating the second to debate with a spanberger campaign we simply want honest terms with both candidates having equal opportunity\nTo present their arguments in a fair for um [noise]\nSo here's what happened and I got under the [noise] the spanberger camp paying told me that\nThe ... camp agreed to the first debate on October Fifteen which will be covered by CSPAN and colpepper they said the second debate which was October twenty fifth in Richmond by CBS [noise] uh\nThey had not they had backed out of that commitment\nAnd I was pushing for a date for my debate and the spanberger campaign was saying we can't get a date from day [noise] so I called the ... campaign and here's what they said they said the fifteenth is good [noise] we never\nAgree to the twenty fifth\nAnd we've never agree to a date for Frederick says radio debate that's what they told me\nThey agreed to have it but they didn't agree with that that's true and what the ... campaign told me is they were going to do the first debate and the Fifteen and see how it goes and\nThey were also criticized the spin burger campaign they said they were negotiating in bad faith [noise] and that they wanted to dictate the terms [noise]\nCell and that's where we stand right now so both camps claiming blaming the other [noise] um but the ...\nCampaign absolutely denying that the TV debate on the fifteenth has been cancelled they said that are still on and that they wanted to go forward and see how that debate goes on what they were concerned about is\nThree things the spanberger people stacking the audience with anti brat\n[noise] I'm liberal moderators not giving each candidate a fair opportunity\nTo engage and express their views and uh basically biased format that turns into a sideshow [noise] so that's what they the ... campaign said they were concerned about\nThe spanberger people basically said that's just not true we don't want to dictate anything [noise]\nI can only talk from my experience in negotiating the format of mine debate\nThe spanberger and they had a number of changes they want it [noise] so\nI can only go from my experience I don't know what happened with these other the other debates but I have a format that it's proven successful on the radio a center to Katie Price [noise] campaign manager brat\nShe had she said five signed off on it then sent it to spanberger\nI'm Justin Jones or communications director and they had certain revisions but there are victims were not a big deal I mean the only thing that I'm not agreeing to but that doesn't work on the radio\nIs questions from the audience I that that just that that works on TV like I've been through a hundred of these that simply does not work in a radio format so we're not doing that now they you know we'll have something where the audience can submit questions but you know giving people microphones instead standing up you can't follow it on the radio\nSo we're not doing that so I reached are rejected that other than that I think they had a few minor changes I mean they were cosmetic a time and things of that nature was like an hour Fifteen minutes anyway\nA debate or both camps signed off on it with minor revisions and that was that so I don't I don't know what went on with the Richmond debate with CBS I've no idea although I did try to get CBS engage with me and they turned it down\nAnd said they had this whole big set of a debate rules so I'm not sure how that how that wet but um\n[noise] here's my general position on this [noise] right that's a very competitive race a very upset by the way it's been dumbed down from\nPeople writing go where the hell on cars and putting it that David George to forty a request to substitute teaching to town hall meeting the whole thing is ridiculous I mean these are very intelligent candidates with a lot to say and we should be debating the issues", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Joe Walsh Show", "city": "Portsmouth", "day": "03"}
