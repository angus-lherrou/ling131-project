related world central banker of international terrorism since Nineteen Seventy nine and from other terrorist groups\nBolden says and the struggle to break down terrorist networks the key is to target ideology\nPerhaps the most important news the conceptual framework is if we recognize that there is a terrorist ideology or that we're confronting and I think it's a long banned the president's view that without recognizing the word and ideological struggle\nThat we can't properly addressed the terrorist threat\nIt's the first us strategy on ...\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOne goal in life goes out of the stadium because we've seen it happen\nOver and over again we're living in a fire right living in the big game and and and the whole the whole right at the\nEdge media jets um I've never seen an arena just goes so last year game seven against Pittsburgh in ... when we when we went out the ... in in twenty sixteen and um they went down one nothing and it was like you know one nothing that hockey is rough nothing and and\nI mean it was like you're in a funeral there'll be already lost the game because they were there for a short head\nThat you could just [noise] right [noise] and and and and and that's and now it's like it's lifted and and and you could feel the playoffs last year once we got through Pittsburgh it didn't matter if we went down and again people could still believe in a team and the team to believe in itself I think I think the\nThe the caps in their history was Wayne on the players were they were believing when they went down a gold at the the games where you from and how they because the fans blamed for\n... for every everyone believes in once Pittsburgh got the last year everything changed you could feel the change their I'm Thomas season ticket holder honestly ticket older we set\nOut for sections away from each other sometimes to each other in the Dunkin' Donuts line in between factions [noise]\nUm but um [noise] this is going to be a great Arabs or the cap now I don't think this was a one year thing I think that you look at because that's often is young I'm obey is in his you know not in the mid mid thirty ... thirty three thirty two\nUm [noise] he's gonna make a run a Gretzky for the most goals scored of all time the regular season is over six hundred grand is eight Ninety four he's going to make a serious run it being the number one goal for an inch on history and the capture of an incredibly bright future um\nAnd I'll just end up saying that my dilemma right now\nI put a thousand dollars and the cats last year when the Stanley Cup in Las Vegas Fifteen the one\nWe want to in Vegas got the cash for tickets Fifteen thousand dollars when a cash for ticket the person at the counter told me the biggest payout she's ever paid at the sports book\nOr when people will take about like that and roll it over for two or three seasons and she said you know if the caps three feet and you're all this money over it'll be two million dollars by the time they have a three feet so I'm Still having this dilemma for the rest of the season I have not done anything with the money that because it may be that like you know it was just a thousand dollar initial investment\nI might need to roll it over a couple of times because I think the cats are legitimate threat not only to repeat this year potentially be a repeat I'm only after all day every year by year so that's my dilemma but I'm leaning towards the right now I actually think this team is a special team and one that um is going to have a lot of successful important [noise]\nWell uh I hear what you're saying I bet the Astros last year to win the world series a check and one as you know because you put Tibetan I think that in for you right back to ... we did we didn't just to take it as that we didn't roll it over but ah what I did that\nA several others I mean you know we're not going to spread it all out all over the state [noise] um if\nYou have to know you know you gotta play where your ... your ... your strength and it would be there I think a Ralph one uh [noise]\nI think we're out one by twelve points twelve to Fifteen points I got an ear a in a blacks district in even more I think in ... district\nAnd uh you know the dynamics are changing in this and it's not just so much a matter of of Trump or anything the demographics in the state or changing and they're changing almost daily [noise] and\nAh it's obvious which way you know they're moving are we going to be like Maryland that we're not going to be like Maryland\nBut we um northern Virginia is beginning to look more and more in northern Virginia suburbs more and more not totally but more and more like the Maryland suburbs\nNational it's not just reached let me write happening naturally in the sky various\nRight as I said New Jersey suburb send things going on everywhere out of sight and everyone but you're seeing this you're seeing this an awful lot and um I think we have an excellent chance\nAnd no question we're getting help from the guy in the White House whether he will be there or not you know a ... I was joking was Mark Warner and I said you know when you well we we need them they're just one more election [laughter] you know but I mean it's you know\nI'm a generally speaking we've done better generally speaking when there's been a Republican and the White House have their print exceptions yes\nGenerally speaking the Republicans have done better one Democrat spending the White House has there been exceptions yes but the trend is there\nAnd it was a mistake up all kinds yeah understand and I\nI Would be surprised if we didn't know you know get to a Twenty one in the end of the election Adam minimum\nI think I I I tend to agree you know you still have to defend a couple of feet you got a couple of comments he got one over on the eastern shore that this\nIs in play I think Republicans can hold with the black sea and they don't have the black I I think that he is far weaker today it didn't come back then probably anybody else because he has some personal proclivities and\nAnd and things that I think that hurts him among some of those voters we have some strong candidate or black\nOr I don't know what happens there he's got a hundred and fifty thousand in the bank so I didn't sound like he's ready to go away very quickly but I Will do my advice to him and he got nowhere to hold on one of the phone and you want to go out to undefeated not indicted if you could do that and they lost before in mountain when here\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI'm item that timetable hair and these are still nationalized races I don't care how you slice it the national environment plays Baltimore that you have to have a messenger more help right there especially when you're turning down for Thomas writes the\nThe I mean it that that national scene where he's very heavily you know which is why you've had you know the the patterns that you've had\nUntil McCarthy Cuccinelli I mean you know what happened for almost fifty year\nI'm gonna I'm In that I've been here about the surveys like let's take for example that started in the ... seat was not driven by national politics and twenty fifth and it was driven by local politics in Chesterfield versus Richmond and I'd like to be democratic\nUm and I think that we and we were you there for you to have more rest of Canada but we don't have we enter the campaigns don't matter you know I don't think we had to I don't think we had a great message or that I think it'd be rerun that same race in twenty Nineteen and you had Ralph Northam auntie\nI'm In that district Ralph would put that on another because they are they all vote the votes of stardom and it's chaos is going to create problems for them\nI think that's a greater problem is that he's he's he's not harmonious with the district on some of this hot button issue I just say this rap working good governor I think it's a wonderful man but he gives a fireside chat in the FARC as you put him on TV ... it's it's not the same kind of rally the team but he\nAnnounced it to them and make it does seem to have to use that I don't know if that's the kind of governor you actually need this you know and he picked up not a fiery he picked up Fifteen states I mean I think\nYou're telling the color things it's fiery and I'm at a carnival Barker one and and he doesn't he doesn't pick up seats Labour Northam did\nWell north of didn't pick them up Trump picked\nHim up for him yes if Trump would have been president and twenty Fifteen we'd be in\nAll right let's look I I yeah I I decided on Ralph Northam disagree however I think he's been very much to say the\nChemical upon by three points and rapport with him on by eight and ... picked up the receipts and Al Cross and picked up so high point difference was not the team's offense are either but it was also a hotel different let me tell you the\nWhite House mistake about it Trump okay was a driving factor sharp last November on top of that\n[noise] um [noise] you had a ... and spilled over into everything [noise]\nAnd keep in mind Gillespie was not good you know\nI mean he was very polarized [noise] but um I just think people keep underestimating as governor oh I don't think anybody on the rest of the ... [noise]\nI don't think anybody under estimate same but make no it was I mean you know what's driving politics in Virginia right now is not a Ralph uh it's it's what's going on across the Potomac River\nIt's negativity is driving politics on both sides right now Iran and the one thing about roughly one he doesn't have any negative [noise] doesn't have many many he's a very like about ...\nI'm not you know I've now go you know been knocking on doors since may I have not gotten one negative comment about morale\nA likeable person exerted NATO is not the problem is you know I I agree with that he is an asset but he's not a fire reader that gets my vote out for\nYou know I I think Tom Davis was on a fire leader that got to build up for the Republicans but for Twenty years\nEvery single Republican Lippi she would have thought the person was married to Tom Davis because the Republican candidate had a picture bigger than their own picture with a quote him saying like here's why they'd be great for your time sometimes with rich and um so I mean having a messenger is important and democratic not had good ... north of me is the first time in a\nYour arteries right I agree I agree but now he's taking our income but that was going on in there that\nI don't know I tell you what man I I that's the joke joke on her feet or ... you can't underestimate or see and I'm telling you\nWhat he had a disastrous for us to offer I wasn't there and it was a disaster of all time so we had a disastrous press conference it really hurt them all kinds of underhanded things going on but you know after that\nMorsi's man and a and [noise] you know the the thing about Joe is he's an independent thinker he's got to go is the only way to you know he's not he's not a whole bunch of any of the establishment caucuses or anything like that\nI think he's gonna play very well in that district and I think a lot of friends there that don't think that he got screwed by what they did to him and and\nThe gym or see that the smartest thing I've ever seen anyone doing politics when he when the when I think it was the mceachin ... he won mceachin the on the eastern moved up I think and in that primary people in think he was going to win that primary crowded field\nAny more than a landslide networks people are asking what do you weren't around and after he knocked on doors at you know and I wrote a handwritten note to every voter he spoke to the data that for\nA week and a half before the election in the context that he had remembered the conversation\n... kept these postcards for six months and send them all out ten days before the election with a handwritten note from him talking about how their conversation and you know I met your dogs ham or you're a teacher here and I remember that conversation and do you know hope I can count on your support next Tuesday and\nPeople came out in droves I mean for him to go do that though and I I I've seen people write posts which but I've never seen one posting them to make it appear as ... months later okay well Tony I'm Tom Davis has everything better than anyone in politics libraries but [noise] but he did that to anyone in a landslide and like it's\nBeen done before it ruined but no I don't underestimate Joe I'm just saying taken\nThere's not going to be four or five people in that race either gonna just to I'm not an expert on that the big difference you know if we had you know there's a whole lot of people have gotten to the general assembly because we don't have run on purpose in the state a whole and and you won't have that you'll just have to people in there\nAnd she's well why [noise]\nI don't think I if I had the gas and I I can be totally wrong with the live in that district I guess that round dance has extremely low name id pardon I Would guess that route dance with extremely low name id and that if you test it they were more seats are named me not to say that it's ... I'm just as but like in terms of I'd name id\nRichard Nixon had our name on\nIt [laughter] I just like I don't think rises like the superstar in the Senate\nDriving a car you know Joe and I know Joe\nAnswers gotta get out out work something like Fifteen or twenty to one okay Joe was out there knocking on doors and making phone calls now well this is\nBetween the basketball primary too in that primary like Dick with them to put a district for Twenty years before he got drawn to have the right thing actually has a concept of campaigning and knocking on doors and doing the things that you do when you're in a competitive political eighth\nGrade and Seventy percent of the vote in my district against Mondale\nYeah rockets has never been a kind of recent lights on for ever Confederate says she's never been\nOut of and you got to ask you before and she's got to get out of work I just got out worker he's fighting Joe he's gotta he's gotta worker and\nThe other thing there is I don't even get I'm telling you he was going to get a tip if there is a step of the vote out there for the fact that the power banks enrichment screwed this guy out of his livelihood\nAnd that's that's real I mean he got screwed I mean what he did the polar long life it looks senator Stanley told me the whole thing is I ... it was blown it okay [laughter] what happened there was a total bologna\nAnd it was because uh if there was it was the cause he challenged the Richmond system that's what happened and that's why they pulled them and so I I just I don't remember that\nIt's like you know there are a lot of people in that area that have and and this is the loyalty the job or see the reason he does well there's a lot of people there that he has represented and when families\nHave had a time of need you know the attorney they went to the criminal defense attorney to help out someone in their family in India was Joe Morsi and that created in level of loyalty he has a ...

was\nLike here's a here's been consistently had I think I said I'll give you I'll give you that and I said but I think a no vote\nHere changes the dynamic there was a poll earlier before all this controversy that showed that if you voted against all suddenly numbers change on\nThis was the coach I don't I don't dispute the fact that the numbers would change [noise] um but from\nFrom my perspective I think Kevin on confirmation to is probably the terms of the Democratic convention and plane that's five to ten sheets maybe a Senate seat or two I mean well I think it helps in house in

Wal Leon I'm actually last night among the winter and the Senate Judiciary committee to show account of the Senate Judiciary committee is tweeting about Democrats do not understand the definition of pumping\nThat would be a Senate Judiciary account this thing is so off the rails and and and I feel like\nYou know people are completely missing the point with all this process crap\nYou know the reason the judiciary committee's tweeting is that the Democrats have the definition or on the book it's all process and none of it is actually on where people are on it and where voters are on on this is the Kavanaugh only has the support of the conservative base and the message that women are getting around the country\nIs that you know people are OK with sexual assault\nNo I think that that is that the measures they're either they're getting is you're now a pronounced wrong doing or where do you do this this is the same democratic\nParty to try to Bill Clinton tactics accusers ma right especially the one that got raped well\nI went to the ... the allegation\nDuring the impeachment process do you remember that woman came out a week after on national television that whole process is so when you say the Democratic party rallied around him whatever that allegation was out there at the time I Will say second thing is fear\nThat was why he lied he was\nTalking about ... jobs where LBJ Jones is different than ... then that was not right after ... ... has been really cannot after\nThat was ever catch one interview was a week after the Senate in the Senate about that you had to sequence Catherine really with the St Thomas ball a job or that you're thinking about the I'm the one you might need a Bible abroad for the first one of the persons who were not retaliation anyway the point [laughter] the message that\nWomen are getting around the country is that this is okay and Republicans are now into a debate about the definition of the things I mean to have a trend and doubled struggle I mean it is a this is only official Senate district ... look everybody knows the Butina\nArt or not but you got the first of all I don't know I I've\nSeen is losing its inserting drugs in your ... instead of taking them down your throat because your body will pocket passer ...\nAnd you're going to Iraq because you believe that I learned during the eighties right without putting one\nKnows what that means I didn't know what I did okay I'm going to be a very\nVery interesting very innocent crowded here that have no idea what that word means you're not and then and then you know kept on going to go on national television taking notes and be like oh it's a party in jail I mean this is so ridiculous and absurd wasn't embarrassing nominee that talk\nAbout the process a Democrat\nAnd let me let me give banned the world are you guys are talking about polling calling on their way for\nHolding on businesses very [noise] with the ... this is not overwhelming pulling against scout wrong this is right down the middle at this point in which is the worst in history but we could Supreme Court justice or never done that or what whatever down the matter because we're just\nTalking about the electoral repercussions when during your kicked the hornet's nest the Republican base that was kind of depressed at this point in what you've seen now in in terms of the energy base of both parties the enthusiasm gap as close and that's going to cost Democrats a couple of times at least\nI mean I get when you look nobody wants to have a family that are doing sexual has done sexual assault get off of that we want people to come up with Keith Ellison it's okay you have probably for the double or like a thousand or\nOr the guy who's the guy the ravens speed up his girlfriend and ... by the hair and they they pay them more money\nJust for for whatever it's worth I mean I I totally concur on the dolphin I've said that publicly I campaigned for his opponent you know on line when he got into the primary for attorney general said this is not right the way he's doing it um and\nYou should you should be that's the end and not you may remember his name but it it it ... and ... and it is bad because a lot of people will look the other way 'cause any should not be the number two person on the Democratic\nNational Committee right but this is the Supreme Court and you have a guy who\nBut I think Dr Ford is an extremely credible accuser but she has new corroborate that [noise] would understand a lot of your cooperation what's her corroborate her claim thing
