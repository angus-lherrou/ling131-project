tell us about the experience and Canada capturing the\n[noise] it it was incredible and um [noise] I don't know how to put it into words you know being a ... fan my entire life and [noise] the amount of I'm anguished shutting it all caps fans have have had over ... over that time\nUm and the number of times that we were right on the cusp and just couldn't couldn't make it and um it was a great night and a great ceremony and then seven nothing when and yet the cats can repeat I think that actually gonna be better this year I think a cloud\nOf pessimism has been lifted from that team you know John one of the things that I can tell you the season ticket holder that was just so frustrating but you just couldn't break it was in the playoffs you know the the\n[noise] they go down one goal in life goes out of the stadium because we've seen it happen\nOver and over again looting and apply them right in the game and and and the whole the whole ... admitted jets um I've never seen an arena and just go so\nLast year game seven against Pittsburgh in ... when we when we went out the ... in in twenty sixteen and um they went down one nothing and it was like you know one nothing hockey is is nothing nothing and and\nI mean it was like a funeral that we already lost the game because they were there for a short haired\nJust right and and and and that's and now it's like it's lifted and and and you could feel the playoffs last year once we got through Pittsburgh it didn't matter if we went down and again people could still the leading a team and the team could believe in itself I think I think the\nThe the caps in their history was Wayne on the players were they were believing when they went down a gold at the the games where you can hear that and how they because the fans believe because every everyone believes in Iran once Pittsburgh got the last year\nEverything changed you could feel the change their I'm Thomas he's taken hold on a season ticket holder we set\nUp four sections away from each other sometimes see each other and the the Dunkin' Donuts line between factions [noise] um but um [noise] this is going to be a great era for the caps now I don't think this was a one year thing I think that\nYou look at who that's often is young I'm only in his in his you know not in the mid mid thirties I think when you're thirty three thirty two\nUm he's going to make a run across the for the most goals scored of all time the regular season is over six hundred grand is eight Ninety four he's going to make a serious run it being in the number one goal scorer an inch on history and the caps have an incredibly bright future um [noise]\nAnd I'll just end with saying this my dilemma right now\nI put a thousand dollars in the capital last year when the Stanley Cup in Las Vegas Fifteen the one\nWe want to in Vegas that you'll catch the tickets Fifteen thousand dollars when I catch the ticket the person at the counter told me the biggest payout she's ever paid at the sports book\nOr when people will take about like that and rolled over for two or three seasons and she said you know the caps three feet and you wrote us money over it'll be two million dollars by the time they have a three feet so I'm Still having this dilemma for the rest of the season I have not\nDone anything with the money yet because it may be that like you know it was just a thousand dollar additional investment\nI might need to roll it over a couple of times because I think the caps are legitimate threat not only to repeat this year to touch Libya three peat I'm only after all that every year by year so that's my dilemma but I'm leaning towards the right now I actually think this team and the special team\nAnd one that um is going to have a lot of success going\nForward [noise] well uh\nI get what you're saying I bet the Astros last year to win the world series of turn one as you know because you put to bed I did that and for you in fact the chicken we did we didn't we didn't just the ticket as that we didn't roll it over but ah\nA several others I mean you know we're not going to spread it all out all over the state [noise] um if\nYou have to know you know you

[noise] one by twelve porn twelve to Fifteen points I got an\nA in a [noise] blacks district in even more I think that are in Stuart events district and uh you know the dynamics are changing in this and it's not just so much a matter of of Trump\nOr anything the demographics in this state are changing and they're changing almost daily [noise]\nAnd ah it's obvious which way you know they're moving\nAre we going to be like Maryland now we're not going to be like Maryland but we um northern Virginia is beginning to look more and more in northern Virginia suburbs more and more not totally but more and more like the Maryland suburbs\nNational it's not just reached one right happening nationally in these kinds of areas\nRight as I said New Jersey suburb same things going on everywhere router sites everywhere but you're seeing this you're seeing this an awful lot and um [noise] I think we have an excellent chance\nAnd no question we're getting help from the guy in the White House whether it will be there or not you know uh [noise] I I was joking was Mark Warner and I said you know we well we we need them they're just one more election [laughter] you know but I mean it's you know\nI'm a generally speaking we've done better [noise]\nGenerally speaking when there's been a Republican and the White House have there been exceptions yes generally speaking the Republicans have done better when the Democrats spending the White House have there been exceptions yes but the trend is there\nAn unmistakable try and understand and I\nI Would be surprised if we didn't know you know get to a Twenty one in the in the election that are minimum\nYeah I I I tend to agree you know you still have to defend a couple of the like you got a couple of comments he got one over on the eastern shore that ... to ... I think Republicans can hold the black sea to they don't have the black\nI I think that you [noise] far weaker today it's in combat and probably anybody else with the ex just some personal proclivities and\nAnd and things that I think that hurts him among some of those voters we have some strong candidate I don't have a black a and I don't know what happened to their he's got a hundred and fifty thousand in the banks are like that it's like he's ready to go way very quickly but\nI Will do my advice to him and he got no when ... when the phone and you want to go out to undefeated not indicted if you could do that and they lost before\nHe comes back but I don't think you want to in your career because I I think you beat him a disturbance of very attractive candidate a you've but you've got some issue ... after the initial matrix there where he has not really thinking or his voting record 'em [noise] or to that district and you got the state house at fifty one forty nine into redistricting\nThat's critical happened that made many I mean we have to wait and see but make working the Democrats said with the\nUm [noise] I mean it would appear that the judges are going to wind up throwing that house district of south Lebanon house districts and I think that's what whatever formula they come up with that is going to also be what the Senate's going to have to abide by twenty Twenty one\nAnd uh it could change or you know a\nStick to change an awful lot [noise]\nUm you know a part of the districts are unpacked not totally but below the numbers I mean look what Bobby Scott I mean his district one from what fifty some fifty six percent down to you know low forties\nAnd I'm a you know produced another democratic district so you're gonna have to see how that plays out but it seems to me\nThat uh the judges drawing that district is by far and away their their best bet\nAnd if they do you know Supreme Court I think it ruled before the gerrymandering is is has been constitutionally permissible until it spills over and racial discrimination\nAnd therein lies the problem and that's what the Republicans are facing there and it's going to change its going to change the way you know a\nWhole makeup of legislatures around the country\nOf course the court for a five to four court will do this differently blocks from the other quarter back if I may be wrong but I think when they sent it back to that lower court it was like seven\nTo ... well I I just think one of the thing is you got to understand the Republican base for better for worse is migrated from the country club at the country in so doing they've taken out of some competitive districts were these were economic issues Republicans would be very viable [noise]\nSo it's not just the demographic sticking out of the fact that they have changed the emphasis on issues in ways that help them in South West Virginia robbery but but it hurts them in growing parts of the state\nWe have about the ... and this was a very popular governor with very low negative and you look at ... number ... had a lot of support amongst Democrats\nWas not popular among Republicans was more polarizing in numbers Ralph Northam has incredibly low negatives for somebody in this environment you look nationally um he has a very high positives very low negatives um and in going into these competitive seats [noise]\nUm I remember in ... eleven and Democrats drew the state Senate lines and they lost the majority and who was the the person who was in every Republican TV ad that we're slipping\nThat's a big um item that timetable here\nThen these are still nationalize races I don't care how you slice it the national environment place\nWhere you have to have a messenger more than ... outbreak there especially when you're turning out the Thomas writes\nThe the I mean it that that national same ways very heavily you know which is why you've had you know the the patterns that you've had\nUntil McCarthy Cuccinelli I mean you know what happened for almost fifty year\nI'm gonna I mean I've been here about the surveys like let's take for example that started in the ... ... feet was not driven by national politics and twenty fifth and it was driven by local politics in Chesterfield versus Richmond and\nI'd like to be democratic um and I think that we and we know who you're forced to have more restive candidate but we don't have we ended its campaigns don't matter you know I don't think we had a ... I don't think we had a great and after that I think if you rerun that same race in twenty Nineteen and you had Ralph Northam on TV\nI'm In that district Raul patrol it that I'm not going to be a vote the votes stardom and it's chaos is going to create problems for them\nYou know I think that's a greater problem is and he's he's he's not harmonious\nWhere the district on some of the hot button issue I just say that like Rob Portman been good governor I think it's a wonderful man but he gives a fireside chat in the FARC\nHas now you put him on TV ... ... ... it's it's not the same kind of rally the team but he announced that everybody can email me to use that ... I don't know what I did not only that if that's the kind of governor you actually need this\nAnd he picked up not a fiery he picked up Fifteen states I mean I think in terms of color fitness fiery and I'm at a carnival Barker one and and he doesn't he doesn't pick up the flavor up north I'm dead\nWell north and didn't pick them up from picked him up for him yes if if Trump would have been president and twenty Fifteen we'd be in All right but look\nI don't know I I decided on Ralph Northam disagree however I think he's been very much just say that\nCame in California by three points and rapport with them on by eight and technicolor pick up the euro seats in ... north and picked up the sci fi point difference was not ... but there was also a hotel different let me tell you the\nWhite House about\nTrump okay I was a driving factor church last November on top of that um [noise] you had a ... and spilled over into everything [noise]\nAnd keep in mind Gillespie was not good you know\nI mean he was very polarizing [noise] but um I just think people keep underestimating if governor oh oh I don't think anybody on the rest of the ... I don't think anybody under estimates him but they know it was I mean you know\nWhat's driving politics in Virginia right now is not a Ralph [noise] ah it's it's what's going on across the Potomac River\nIt's negativity is driving politics on both sides right now in the one thing about Robert he doesn't have any negative [noise] doesn't have any either very likely do not\nI'm not you know art now go you know been knocking on doors since may I have not gotten\nYou know it's I mean people like him he's just a likeable person is not a\nI'm not the problem is you know I agree with that even after that but he's not a fire reader that gets voted off for\nYou know I I think Tom Davis is not a fire eater that got to vote for the Republicans but for Twenty years\nEvery single Republican Lippi she would have thought the person was married to Tom Davis because the Republican candidate had his picture bigger than their own picture with a quilt for him saying like here's why there'd be great for your time sometimes without permission um so I mean having a messenger\nIs important and democratic not had good but I Love that Ralph Northam is the first time in a sense Mark Warner ... we've had a messenger like\nMargaret ... agree I agree but you only take him out an income but that was an entirely different that\nI don't know I tell you what man I I that's the joke joke kind of Peter ... you can't underestimate or see and I'm telling you\nWhat he had a disastrous for us to offer I wasn't there and it was a disaster of all time so we had a disastrous press conference it really hurt them all kinds of underhanded things going on but you know after that\nI'm more she's married and you know the the thing about you is an independent thinker he's got to go is the only way or you know he's not a he's not a whole bunch of any of the establishment caucuses or anything like that\nI think he's gonna play very well in that district and I think a lot of friends there that no one thinks that he got screwed by what they just throw 'em in and taking\nAdvantage of Morsi did the smartest thing I've ever seen anyone to in politics when he won the\nWas it I think it was the Mickey chintzy but he won Mickey chintzy on each um moved up I think\nAnd in that primary people didn't think he was going to win that primary is crowded field\nAnyone in a landslide natural people are asking what does he do he went around and after he knocked on doors at you know and I wrote a handwritten note to every voter he spoke to the data that for a week and a half before the election in the context of it that he had remembered the conversation\n... kept these postcards for six months and send them all out ten days before the election with a handwritten note from him talking about how their conversation and you know I met your dogs ham or you're a teacher here and I remember that conversation and you know hope I can count on your support next Tuesday and\nPeople came out in droves for him to do do that though and I see people read postcards but I've never seen one posting them to make it appear as a month later okay well companies didn't I'm Tom Davis has everything better than anyone in politics either\nBut [noise] but he did that to anyone in a landslide and like it's been done before\nAppeal or not I don't get out of the time I'm not going to be four or five people in that race either\nIt's going to I'm just too I'm not an expert on that's the big difference you know if we had you know there's a whole lot of people have gotten in the journal stomach because we don't have Ronald ... in this day a whole and and you won't have that you'll just have to people when they're\n[noise] and she's well why [noise]\nI don't think I if I had the gas and I think until they're only going to live in that district and I guess that rock camps have extremely on a Monday pardon\nI Would guess that rod dance with extremely low name id and that if you tested there Jim or signing me not to say the towel part I'm just [noise] but like in terms of I'd name id\nRichard Nixon had our name or\n[laughter] you know I mean like I don't think rises like the superstar in the Senate\nBack on you know Joe and I know Joe\nThan you got to get out out work something like Fifteen or twenty to one okay Joe without their knocking on doors and making phone calls now well this is\nBetween the fastball primary too in that primary like Dick was independent district for Twenty years ... got drawn to safety ... actually has a concept of campaigning and knocking on doors and doing the things that you do when you're in a competitive politically\nFreighted Seventy percent of the vote in my district Mondale yeah rock that's never\nBeen a personalized yeah but I've been a Confederate says she's never been\nOf and you guys have to perform and she's got to get out work I'm a joke I doubt worker he's fighting Joe he's gotta get get gotta worker and the other\nIs I don't care I'm telling you he was going to get a tip the bears the sympathy vote out there for the fact\nThat the power banks enrichment screwed this guy out of it the livelihood\nAnd that's that's real I mean he got screwed I mean what the political logging license it looked Saturday Stanley told me the whole thing is I ... it was blowing what happened there was a total bologna\nAnd it was because uh there was it was the cause he challenged the Richmond system that's what happened and that's why they told them and so I I just all kinds of member that\nLike you know there are a lot of people in that area\nThat have and and this is a loyalty to the gym or the the reason he does well there's a lot of people there that is represented and when families have had a time of need you know the attorney they went through the criminal defense attorney to help out someone in their family was Joe Morsi and that created a level of loyalty he had they [noise] I\nI'm not ready to call this one one way or the other yet but um he has a real ... [noise] it's it's across that district the from being an attorney I'm In the same way that Donald McEachin you know when he when he ran rubber on his running\nYou know him as a primary challenge of what three times two incumbents are twice twice as the challenger don't come in Delhi gets been one to the challenger don't come and senator\nAnd and mceachin was the guy who everyone news on TV it was a lawyer um he had to help so many people in the community it didn't matter that he was\nAnd until more see I mean he had helped a lot of people and those in those communities where they don't know who to turn to joy Morsi has been the guy who's defending their nephew there's time um you know against major charges that any he's one of the top defense attorney there so I'm just\nI I I think that it's an interesting race than in ... we got to see you know will rise even run again\nLet me let me look ahead to twenty twenty won the governorship when it comes comes through and a lot of um determining who's in the White House has said that dynamic and so on but when north them goes well the attorney general within a governor clash at that who else is looking at this at this point in the Democratic party or as I Know\nI mean there there's a name pops up there on that Perry Ellis was not out of the picture either either now or I Would imagine if you're running you know of course but I Would I Would hope that herring Fairfax and get things worked out it or not to see a contest nomination but\nYou've got a lot of people in the back looking for upward mobility to get the mayor of Richmond stony knocked or some other larger\nThem getting her yellow sitting there on you'll have a primary and you'll get sick if it's a success or it can be dangerous is only I think it's only a [noise]\nAs long as you don't have a two way right [noise] uh\nBetween Fairfax and ... and Erin [noise] uh I think that if a if it's if it's one of them against the whole batch of other people like when [noise] uh you know either Fairfax\nYou're counting somebody out so I like you guys are talking about\nAnd a Fairfax you're not talking about ... stony who was absolutely going to do something because the other person you're not talking about\nWho can pull the upset in a two or three person race and\nThat's Kenny handling Alexander mayor of\nNorfolk right now who in a three way primary against to\nProgress is trying to wild liberal left wing each other Kenny Alexander comes in the sky business track record and the mold of hope water businessman ... column business guy daughter ridiculous why\nI started just first of all just there's Alexander 'cause there's not as if there's a moderate right or the Democratic primary is any way for the first piece safety but the fact\nThat we're like a rock in order to be your candidate Asia or their state they're not going to line up behind ... I like ... good friend but they're going to either lined up behind either herring for Fairfax what about stony and I don't even know I don't I don't know I didn't know that are the same thing with low bar record got\nPeople like him but they're either going to go with one of those two it's probably\nGoing to be a Republican any Lakers Trump's going to be gone and twenty twenty\nI was going to win again [noise] ...
