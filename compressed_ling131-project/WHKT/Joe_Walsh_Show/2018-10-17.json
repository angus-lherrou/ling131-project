encouraging me I guess that's what my folks and the panhandle into watching seen any kind of tough they will accept each other and they were supposed to happen but we have a long hard to have to go I\nHave started getting thinner and while they had the Saudi Arabia as minute by minute things are changing like president today to call it a king said he absolutely denied the secretary of state Pompeo over there in Saudi Arabia turkey and the other places as well to try to get to the truth\nOr the targeting they mentioned it potentially roving killers it's language that people think that he may have gotten directly from the administration um your democratic counterpart in a Senator Chris Murphy says that's been hearing a ridiculous Cole voted killers theory\nTonight why we fight his new book ... great to have you back during the John tractors radio network to be back with God\nThank you said let's get to the Saudi Arabian situation sub not too good first they say well Jamal came out then they say they didn't come out it's like the Welsh motel you go into the Saturday constantly miss them both but you know come out now they say well maybe\nThe one in for interrogation and ah but there's no official statement\nComing from king Salman who denies the whole thing and now the Saudis threatening that there was any sanctions or they're going to retaliate\nAnd disrupt the world's economy and shoot up oil prices ... what the hell is going on here\nWell this individual who's not a journalist in your piece drive a lot of the American like it was a resident alien he's been caught up\nIn the middle of a geopolitical competition between two Sunni nations who want to dominate the Sunni Muslim world that turkey which is becoming a Neal ought to them and that's the ... the crime you ever go on and Saudi Arabia where Islam was founded in the second century\nOf this person has to be caught in the middle of an individual who is the report talk through about what happens if didn't deserve what happened to him or they Barry Barry said character with very close ties to the Muslim Brotherhood even to the bin Laden family I'm an individual who was the next few of the\nBiggest I'm speaking of the twentieth century ... so it's it's basically an individual caught in the middle of a giant just teaching ... competition\nSo the president's sending a secretary of state Mike Pompeo a to Riyadh to try to get to the bottom of this find out what happened\nObviously the Saudis the first day when they put out which was not a this individual was there an hour got to work in a departed but they said the dog in the cameras or something they they couldn't produce the footage of that now they're changing\nTheir a story how does this affect us relationship with the Saudis as it relates to\nMohammed Mohammed Mohammed bin Salman\nWell when we were in the White House we were very encouraged by the reforms and yes was an issue\nBut you always used the term behavior modification Saudi Arabia has been in bed with the wrong people for too long a key member of the elite has been slumping in supporting a jihadi out the audio ... how they act around the world\nThat was going on a very very close to ... this is not what we expect from a nation to set the recording itself so it might come payers top guys talk the talk of the closet Westport over director he will get to the bottom all read the report\nTurned out to be true about what happened took a shock that it will be a consequences for Saudi Arabia definitely in the field or on a I'm a traitor if my

that we leave we maintain pressure\nOn cops on the DCCC continues to to behave in ways that the less from the impact will the importance of these radical groups all covered up is the second the second to the to\nThe order of ... most important the whole thing you're wrong so you know that there is the ballot in the region but the cost of the competition between the Sunni Muslims and she has more of those are all the raw egg recall we won't we cannot have negative consequences from this brand making Iran stronger\nSo you're in by President Trump right now if you just turn the clock back and you're in the oval office what would be any advice\nYou would give to the president has new information comes out of your peers\nThat it appears that the guy was murdered allegedly in constantly because as Marco Rubio just said on Fox and friends he came in he didn't come out so he sees you still there are he's dead there's only two really outcomes to that's\nWhat would your advice me to a Trump\nWell I'm not going to speculate what happened what happened right on the garbage that's been written all read the story or what I what I what I advise the president is that we we have to do more than we have to have supplied absolute\nFull disclosure that by the Saudi regime as to what happened and then once we have full disclosure we will make the requisite decision which has not been a stretch and get up to you about game clams away right but we have to have full disclosure\nAnd then the president will will decide whether it's arms trade thing whether it will support we give economically to uh to Saudi Arabia that that will suffer whether it was something else\nWhat did you think when the president went to the you know when a parent of two weeks ago at the annual meaning any in any sense to king Salman he's looking a\nYou know is this all fine and they were friends and all but like you got to start paying now for the defense we're giving your protection you're you're you're only paying three percent\nI Want that double your your uh your oil prices are too high a lot of people were outraged by that but and then she said well gee nobody ever asked me that then he said well I'm not going to do that\nHow does that all play out\nThe president is a pragmatist and he's constantly out requests and this isn't about Saudi Arabia is about uh partners and friends in age from elsewhere in the butt in Europe you have to be very simple question why is it the countries that are incredibly well they need us\nTo sort through a subsidized that its patents so it's a very reasonable question that we're going to keep on asking because if you're one of the richest countries in the world but you don't meet up\nThe Saudi Arabia [noise] tell us that Gorka about a new book that you have out why we fight why should people by that\nWell look it's a great read it's about all the threat we face if you want to understand\nAll of the dangers out there and how the president's going to treat them whether it's Russia China you know whether it's a North Korea or whether it's which\nIran than the book gives you about strategic analysis but more important ...

that we do have reception penalty seven seconds for mister Bryant Dave sorry I missed the spammer Abigail if you would um would you like the question again\nDon't get okay when I have traveled\nAcross the number one issue that people are talking about the rising cost of prescription drugs medicine and the cost of health care across the board is number one thing that people are talking about and how it is that we can actually address ...\nLater it is possible for pharmaceutical companies to do what's called patents ticketing where they are Longate the patents and they they depressed competition\nMedicare for example needs to be able to negotiate it's prescription drug prices the Veterans Administration is able to do so and some drug or up to eighty percent cheaper on the Veterans Administration five and they are on Medicare side\nIn terms of what we need to do overall with health care and\nI think we'll probably be talking about this quite a lot we need to strengthen our current healthcare system and we need a public option you will hear my opponent speak very frequently have some expensive program that I Do in fact not support\nI support a public option but we're talking about the costs and special interest money I Would note that in our tax bill the twenty Seventeen tactile that added to the deficit to the tune of one point nine trillion dollars\nPharmaceutical companies the top five pharmaceutical companies about forty two billion dollars\nAnd so when we're looking about at\nReason we cannot find a we cannot lower the price of prescription drugs and Medicare cannot negotiate it's prescription drug prices and it's because of the pharmaceutical body it's so great it is so great that when we have a congressman like congressman brat\nWho said he would not add to the deficit who voted against spending bill because they would add to the deficit is willing to add one point nine trillion dollars to the deficit in order to get tax cuts to the tune of forty two billion dollars to pharmaceutical companies\n\nLike ... out here we are trying to you for next question which I have to deal with immigration what impact if any has the current administration's immigration policy had on Virginia's workforce\n\nAs a country need comprehensive immigration reform\nIs something that has been talked about for years we have not achieved bipartisan comprehensive immigration reform and right here in colpepper\nHave heard stories from people in the agricultural business who are concerned about\nWhere their long term they will have the employees that they need\nPeople throughout our district are concerned about the way immigration has become such a politically divisive issue the truth of the matter is we need immigration reform comprehensive bipartisan immigration reform that achieves a number of things first that secures our borders and our points adventurous I worked at CIA at the former\nAs a former CIA officer I worked undercover I worked counterterrorism I worked in narco trafficking traffic\nUnderstanding the drug cartels working throughout Mexico I Am well aware\nOf the threats that present themselves\nOr southern border and it's for that reason that we need comprehensive immigration reform that is strong on border security and strengthening our points adventurous but we also need immigration reform that will meet the needs of the employers here throughout the seventh district here throughout the commonwealth of\nVirginia and we need comprehensive immigration reform that give certain teaching dreamers children who were brought here through no fault of their own by\nAnd that's what bipartisanship should look like this is uh\nFor this country and we need bipartisanship to actually to ride\nA change on this issue but when we look at what my opponent has been advocating for it is not a bipartisan solution me the bill the compromise bill that he says frequently talk it out it was a compromise between the FARC rebels and the more moderate\nAnd the more moderate Republicans there was a compromise cell there wasn't a bipartisan bill that was put forth in Congress they didn't get out of committee this time around but it was put forth by a Republican and Democrat there are people who are willing who were working to try and find ... bipartisan solutions but there are currently not enough of an in Congress\nThank you out of jail big\nYeah thank you for the question I think had to do can you repeat the question\nLabor force sure of what if what impact if any has the current administration's immigration policies panel Virginia's workforce\nYeah as I say we achieved a fears resolved by first of all avoiding a huge amnesty bill which would have had a devastating impact on wages for the nation as labor supply goes up with a huge amnesty American wages go down American Jobs go down and so our efforts on that front have been very positive\nAnd so my opponent just brought up comprehensive immigration reform we had the good last failed this year and she says that's not my hardest Obama was for that the Clintons were for either verify it and the major components in that bill everyone to tell the last couple of years left has gone off the rails\nAnd so every major Democrat including Barbara ... Jordan the great civil rights leader was in favor of all the components in that good lab built it is bipartisan compromise we took care of seven hundred thousand DACA kids gave them a legal status that's a compromise no Democrat would vote for it\nThen President Trump did one point eight million DACA kids the Democrats said no to that compromise than I did a bill that United parents and kids at the border with Senator Ted Cruz and Chuck Schumer the Democrat said no to that bill\nSo if you look at the facts of the matter and the actual legislation that came up and the vote it's very clear that my opponent falls to the very far left\nOn this issue of immigration she has been on the record in favor of sanctuary cities she says the states and localities can deal with these issues we don't need to cooperate with federal government that's what's sanctuary cities are\nYou don't cooperate with ... the last we have plenty of great laws on the books if we would only follow the law and so it's just a matter of simple law enforcement\nAnd of course we need our federal ice agents working with us at the state local\nHurt her objection there is very radical if you think about she said don't follow the law the land we should not cooperate with federal law enforcement and that's done it\nThe ice agents are the ones who are protecting us from the three hundred million lethal doses of fat and all that came across the border last year the heroin the opioids the human trafficking\nThese are real and talk to their shirts up here in coal pepper talk to the sheriffs in hand right go down in Chesterfield if you don't think it's a serious problem we have a hundred and fifty badge and ...\nAbigail was chosen to use one of a red card so you have one minute to ...\nThank you so much and congressman brat I appreciate you explain to me the role of federal law enforcement agents the heat I used to be one I used to work jointly with ice I worked joint drug cases in fact in the DC area with the high intensity drug trafficking area for it's often and it's higher\nWell aware of the role of federal agents I Do not support safe haven for criminals or gangs I Do not support anything that would make our community is weak\nOr hurt our enemies in fact I used to work every single day to keep the community I Lived in state to keep our communities free of drugs on the street so for you to lead to anything else it's frankly comical um but in fact I Would like to stay for the record\nThat I support the law enforcement in all its foreign because I used to be among them and I and the daughter of a career law enforcement officer [noise]\n\nYou're listening to your friends your comments screwed [noise]\nDrink radio stations and\n[noise]\n\nAnd we paid for the entire liberal order that has brought us all together for when when we made friends with our arch enemy the Germans and the Japanese and now we all our friends at play when when together on trade and economic growth and it's been great for our country\nAnd so that is the result that we've achieved with this executive and our Congress this year\nThe economy is now booming we still have work to do with China\nUh but when it comes to our agriculture is the largest sector in Virginia and so we work very hard with our foreign bureaus across all my ten counties to protect them and to ensure that any tariffs negotiations are short lived in a matter of months not years\nBut we have to do that it's basically more a matter of geopolitics and not a matter of trade policy I trade we all want zero tariffs and the White House to said that if the goal for the long run\nI thank you Dave I appreciated Abigail same question I\nIt's an updated version of NAFTA which has\nAnd across our communities in the seventh district the notion that we would move toward zero terrorists by starting a trade war is not something that I understand and in fact we have antagonize\nAnd our trade partners by creating and starting a trade war when we look at the fact\nThat as congressman brat just said China is a big threat is China is such a big threat why are we comfortable with the fact that they hold the most amount of our debt debt that we have now just chosen thanks to the tax sale of twenty Seventeen to increase by one point nine trillion dollars\nAnd these terrorists and the changes that they've made habits been great and if you don't believe me after\nTwenty thousand Ford workers who just lost their jobs because for that they couldn't handle the steel and aluminum tariffs\nThat depleted their income by one billion dollars and then we can talk about the soybean farmers rates here\nThe seventh district soybean farmers right here who because of these terrorists\nHave decreased prices for Bush will it costs about ten dollars in five cents per bushel for soybean farmers to break even prices since the tariffs went into place I haven't been above nine dollars we're creating challenges in our community and\nTo answer them the president's desire the president's choice whereas in fact to put a twelve billion dollar bailout\nOn the American taxpayers back at twelve billion dollar bailout\nDon't want bailout they want to sell their crops\nAnd so the notion that we would start a trade war to begin to get ourselves the point where\nDoesn't make any sense to me it is reckless foreign policy it creates detrimental relationships with our friends our allies and our trading partners and long term it's tremendously detrimental to our stability in the world\nThank you but you know [noise] I Do thank you very much we're going to move to our next question I'm when I'm Sorry I Apologize this question is for you [noise]\nSecond Second Amendment ... said the continues to be a growing public concern regarding gun violence and school safety one measures would you put in place to provide a safe environment for students\n\nAs I mentioned I Am a former law enforcement officer I get to carry a gun every single day I Am well aware of the responsibility of gun ownership I grew up in a house with guns I grew up in a family of sportsman\nBut we can have conversations in our community about how it is that we can balance our Second Amendment right which I firmly support with the rights of our school children to go to school and feel safe in our county Indian rights our county I say our because the Congress and lived there as well one of our schools had\nThe day that I put my children on the bus\nWhen there was a threat of gun violence in our county which is a hard day no parent should feel that way No Child should feel concerned that they might die\nThree out of for doing paying and are a number I Believe that background\nThe same standard that exist if you go to a federally licensed place a point of sound like that was that they can buy at a gun show that is the first step forward that we can take the other thing that we should be doing when looking at and gun violence ensuring that our schools have the resources to deal with students who might be facing trauma or who might be facing track\nMight be at risk for violent behavior this is a comprehensive issue is not one that we can solve in a day but it's certainly not one that we will be able to solve if we do not have leaders in Washington who are willing to have\nConversations but the good news is there are already members of Congress who are willing to have that conversation there is a bi partisan background checks bill in Congress couldn't get out of committee because there was not a critical mass of people willing to have cars conversations\nAnd so I Want to go to Congress to be a part of these discussions again I understand gun ownership I understand the responsibility of gun ownership and these are Congress stations we can have about\nEnsuring that people who are at risk themselves their community or others are not able to do harm our schools that you have a few\nIt's thank you very much this is a tough conversation to have and we've had plenty of them in the seventh district I have a daughter in the audience that goes to public school as well and of course we all work hard every day on this issue to keep our kids very safe\nSo I can be a major group of all the folks across all ten county school resource officers school councilors mental health experts sheriff says police first responders\nEveryone who was in a room with school counselors so that we had all voices in and they came up with solutions are then I'll share with you tonight at first and this was after the Parkland, Florida incident and a lot of businesses in response to the failure in Parkland and we don't want to repeat that\nIn our counties here and so the first was the heart and the schools with school resource officers the second was enhanced significantly mental health\nEveryone was agreement that that was probably the major peace we need to work on and that's connected to the third piece which is to connect the dots between the federal government state government the FBI their local the localities and law enforcement and then the schools themselves\nAnd that was a total tragedy in Parkland, Florida case they connected note that the FBI did not talk to the state to state didn't talk to them all the ... the local police force visited that young boys home twenty times\nAnd no dots were connected the school resource officer was not in the school in our districts and across our counties we have outstanding law law enforcement you see them with us today\nThe FBI gets in constant communication with our state leaders and I'm very proud of the work our law enforcement does on these issues and so those are the primary solutions that I received by listening to my constituents those are the experts in our community and that's what they came up with\nA when it comes to gun if you want to follow the Nancy Pelosi liberal agenda and if you look at blue states\nCan I finish the question I have a few more seconds that when if you want to look at the liberal Nancy\nBlue states and blue towns they say let's just work on this issue in this issue in this issue and have conversations about it but up in those blue states they want to take away your gun and they have taken away guns and crime has not gone down at all in San Francisco or Chicago or New York\nCongressman thank you again there was a ... there was a a family of nine seconds on that answer thank you actually\nOur next question goes to you as well sir I'm dealing with education and workforce readiness\nAccording to the Federal Reserve national student debt reached one point five trillion and the first quarter of twenty Eighteen\nBecause of this and the challenge challenge recent college graduates are facing and finding fulltime women more unemployment of adequate or implement of adequate pay high school students are hesitant were skeptical enrolling in traditional two or four year colleges\nWhat plans do you have to either provide insurance to future collegiate or expand higher education funding to college alternatives such a CD and trade schools\nRight thank you very much for the question is you know as a professor and for Twenty years at Randolph Macon College\nAnd I work with students every day on a career planning and got to work with community colleges with senator scotch and not see the ... years our our districts are blessed with grace a current technical programs already an excellent programs in the trade off but we have huge moves we can still making sure man is part of that solution\nAnd so last year our results we improve the K. to twelve education bill by\nTaking away federal mandates and so now our states and localities are not under all of the federal burns for high stakes testing constantly and they have the latitude to add these courses an internship in on the job training and career technical education\nAnd that's step one and it's got to this year I'm On the education committee and we also provided results\nAre in higher read by doing it keep the bill that enhanced and broaden all sorts of opportunities for kids to [noise] to follow new and improved path\nAt four year college is not for everyone and we have to break that stigma for our kids there's nothing wrong and there are great opportunities right now are truckers
