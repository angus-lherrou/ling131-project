to have a good basis for doing it and presumably his lawyers you know let him do it without a good faith I could say faces and the big issue is whether he told the truth about the timing of meetings with the Justice Department namely per se or he says he didn't meet with them until after the election\nIt turns out he met with or it looks like before the election so you had the Clinton campaign vendor dot CA creator a meeting with the Justice Department in the middle of the election in August of two thousand sixteen he tried to cover that up it looks like to Congress\nAnd that's why he's

looked the other way again crazy let's go to a phone line gene in Italy yet Virginia\nJohn John looking forward to your news station and eight days yeah they\n... you don't want to ask you this question here yesterday apparently according to Newsweek or Mitch McConnell\nSaying that uh we need to cut Social Security and Medicare and he said that in spite of what uh uh the government owing a security trust to point not tree in\nAn inner governmental debt and the uh money to Medicare trust uh you know and conquer Whitman a you know or or brat or Comstock or\nWe don't see how to get an answer to any of them about paying back the money that they took out of the Social Security trust and I want to point out one other thing to me on the spinal burger brat debate or two nights ago that uh\nDave Brat hammered Abigail on a\nSingle payer health care and I want to point to the to the ah sixty miles interview that Donald Trump did during his campaign\nWas Scott Kelly where Donald Trump promised health care for all Donald Trump promised he was going to take care of everybody and uh he was questioned about how it's going to pay\nFor the explained that that interview a Scott Kelly is available on YouTube to crawl you want to see it all along with the uh other campaign promise on a YouTube were during the debates with Ted Cruz Marco Rubio\nDonald Trump promised that they could get the money from Mexico to pay for the wall and it was only going to cost ten to twelve billion and one of the promise to the people are forgetting about\nIsrael complicates promised us for seven years but they were going to repeal and replace Obamacare you know I don't think it's unfair\nFor me to ask you about the promises that Republicans have made over and over again to us thank you John [noise]\nThe number one on the seven year Republican promise to repeal or replace Obamacare rebuilding lives Eugene\nThey went and lied and then they got your money and they lied and they sent you a donor letters and they lied and they never had a plan they never had anything right they voted to repeal and replace\nIt when they know they had no replacement and it would get vetoed and it couldn't get through the Senate so they liked liar liar pants on fire a President Trump assumed they had a plan they had no plans and when Trump tried to get a plan together it fell through and John McCain voted no so he\nDid not deliver on that promise now he's been dismantling the pieces of bombing here that people don't like no question about that but I'm Republican as wide as far as the wall is concerned uh because I think you brought up poor things let me get the third one uh use me but Mexico is paying\nFor the wall because we renegotiate NAFTA deal much to our advantage\nAnd those terrorists and that money that is coming in has got to go to the wall nobody that had a brain in their head ever thought that the Mexicans were going to\nShip over a a truckload of um gold into the into Fort Knox or they were going to give the U.S money in their treasury so the way is paying\nFor it is by a renegotiating bad trade deals that were cost us hundreds of hundreds hundreds of billions of dollars and so they they are paying for it and this I think for the thing is that is a title minutes and ... McConnell said\nA President Trump and Trump's ... campaign and said he would not touching tournaments that he's not and if they're everything probably can send him a bill to reform entitlements and cut back payments or eliminate people the president would veto it so the whole the whole issue of debt and uh\nThe Social Security fund and everything else that that's got to be addressed but as far as cutting entitlements or this president has been very clear from the day going to the campaign trail oh that was a covenant\nBetween people and Social Security recipients and he would not cut back and he had and if McConnell does it he'll veto it and you can't get an overriding detail so they're going to have to come up with a comprehensive entitlement reform but cutting it is not part of the president's America First ... the gender\nNeither Democrats or Republicans have done a good enough job of helping me countries improve their economy helping these countries improve the rule of law took things we don't we put it that much money so we found them\nAnd Mexico has jumped more than ten spots on the economic development with the international I think it's now number a weapon we've made in Mexico rich with trade billions and billions of dollars millions of jobs and yet we still have twenty two\nMexican people I'm just saying we've made in Mexico way richer than it was and we still have an informed from Mexico so like we're not getting anything out of this cat [noise]\nJohn triggers radio network you're God's truth in America great to have you with this\nKind of a lot of fun or Tucker Carlson a little clip there and he's got a good point one third of Salvadorans living in the United states one way or the other legal or illegal while they're here would be given money or because it gets a you know corruption that's what ... Vanessa Newman said it's the corruption stupid all these countries are corrupt\nAnd now the new buzz word for the open borders crowded economic reputation now their economic reputation is whether it's four billion economic refugees\nAcross the globe that I Want to come to the United states get housing get clothes and get free medical care get welfare again the bottom of phone you're in a house get taken care of get blankets get food\nHere at school and get an education or billion let's just let them all in and then there's no country goes bankrupt and then you're like everybody every other bankrupt country I mean it's absurd argument their economic refugees well there's four billion economic refugees across the globe either have\nA country or you don't these open borders people they don't want any country\nDistrict for things they don't want to country they don't want an America that are running out of the states they just want open borders and I don't know what did they think this money come from but in the short term they'll have political power and then eventually\nTheir vision is because of that political power with all these four million people voting for them eventually that come\nHere legal and vote and get the citizens and the company gets bankrupt you don't have the link and then you'll have the pet\nThat's really the\nSociety they want a handful of liberal elites running the territory that was once the United states living very high on the hog making all the\nDecisions drinking wine and cheese and caviar and flying around and helicopters with all kinds of garden talk about gun control of the guards like crazy bodyguards armed guards tank trucks machine guns the already protected\nAnd then everybody else will be fighting over food and there'll be the person that they will rule over I mean that's what else could be a gender thing there's nothing and open borders agenda wipes out your country your culture your government it\nBankruptcy the whites it out so what other what other objective could it be then you have no country and the elites make all the decisions and they live\nIn the matches with armed guards by the way they have a hundred percent ... gun conscription except for their armed guards there they all have only going to get ever need to protect them that's still liberal vision them they're the elites they make the decisions average people too stupid to have a job and\nThey'll go in a row I'm sure there'll be food lightning and stand on line for an hour and you get a bonus\nYou get a cracker and a half and that's their vision for you\nWould open borders I really can't think of what else there will be and of course the people were Goldman Sachs will be making billions of dollars and they'll have their own island with armed guards because of the cheap labor because then people worked for you know a dollar a day this is what this is what the open borders society\nIs after some kind of a global order where the elites are protected and they were all over the polar Terri\n\n[laughter] I mean is there is there any other explanation they could possibly happen there's less like Fifteen hundred people come into the United states in a caravan just come\nIn because their economic refugees who's not an economic reputation the entire African continent\nTo come here every one of them at the economic refugees all of South America could\nBe economic refugees four billion people that don't have the luxury that we could be economic registries so where is this going and why isn't this on the ballot\nAnd why aren't we talking about this and jobs in the economy and why are we talking about this other nonsense like the hooker I mean why are we talking about this it's unbelievable to me talking about losing control of the message Twenty one days\nOut of the Republicans want to when they should be talking about two things keeping the sovereignty of your nation so that you have in America for your children\nBecause it is being absorbed and going away and the liberals the water they don't want an American they weren't open borders global a society\nNo different here than in any other country where there are no countries just land masters and cheap labor I don't know what they want and they should be talking about the great economy instead\nWe're talking about Stormy Daniels don't care about Stormy Daniels I don't care about\nThe porn actress I don't care that\nIs thank God I don't care about any of this\n... thing I'm tired of talking about that but you can't get away from it because that disturbs the international order of things\nAnd\nIf you have sovereign governments you need international or otherwise you'd go to open borders and then it doesn't matter the auto constantly this\nOne world government I mean I don't know what the liberals are trying to do here with the open borders I really don't get I get with Goldman Sachs doing they wouldn't make as much money as it possibly can in a short period of time they can so they get all the money and buy an island and have guards and yeah\nI get that but\nAnd I get in the short term the liberals want open borders and they get cheap quotes cheap cheap labor but at some point\nIt breaks\nAnd then they have the power and that what are they\nNow a bomb or said he wanted to transform America maybe that's it maybe just transform it\nI Can't figure it out maybe somebody can help me eight eight eight or you know John\nEight eight eight story though John if there's no borders no country\n\nSo you got Fifteen hundred feet when your your your cut there at all\nAnd then the military should go down at the border and not let them in because the consequence is the next time it's fifty thousand object either under\nHalf of them are going to make it over on on income or\nThe other half will get apprehended and get caught and really why would the Fifteen how could actually go back\nThe others don't show up and then they called her friends say I'm In I'm In wherever Denver here's my cell phone number oh this is from my bomber phone I guess you'd call for free and come over then the next week I got a house\nLike at the bottom of SALT I got through food stamps welfare kids were in school they don't speak English but to bad\nSchool have to figure it out\nAnd a lot better than it was because I haven't ever economic refugee\nAnd by the way a let me fill out the form here not checked a box and I'll go vote because of people I'm voting for will make sure that I stay here they I don't know who they are I Can't read English but I Can't read a ... and that's that I don't know how else to explain this maybe you've got a better a better answer to me\nI really don't know\nNick in Virginia Beach that they couldn't agree more the open border crowds hates America\nNot all of them some of them just want money\nGoldman Sachs lower Manhattan and a gangster banks jurors that support all the stuff they love America but they love money more\nMoney rich money they want bigger bonuses how do they do that\nCheap labor higher stock prices fell off make money when America implode they'll have the
