bad boy he's the political editor and writer for Breitbart News that's so let me ask you this so like what happens\nWhat happens if the Republicans hold up by one she can you imagine wow\nI think I think they're going to come down to like I really couldn't majority one way or the other\nSide the debt right now it's going to be five he her last\nFor either party that whichever party wins um this is going to be a very very close election on November to save by\nIt could very well could go to the Democrats it very well could share Republican can't I don't know yet arrived professor and to be a process of prophecies person here right like I'm not trying to be a prophet like the rest of the pundits impulses or whatnot they're always there and they also not ever know what they're talking\nAbout but the point is is that this is very close our eyes is there if Republicans you hang on herself the expectation that's been set by the media by the political class by the Democrats\nAS Nancy Pelosi made very clear on cold there last night and actually has done in in so many different other interviews over the course of the past several months and the expectation is the Democrats are taking the majority is even buy a seat in the fall short of that\nThat is the mountains of loss for the Democratic party for the resistance to President Trump and then the message to win for President Trump is Republicans hold on if you can buy one city or even a few more than that what would happen here is is it easy shot\nIn the arm for President Trump going into his reelection then we're going to see wanting something Democrats\nRunning for president in two thousand twenty here each other apart they're going to risk their party to\nEveryone President Trump's going to be able to move forward with all the way more Republicans in the Senate because on the Senate side of things things are looking really good for that you have the right now so we're seeing Republicans will probably have at least fifty four maybe as many as fifty\nSeven or more in the Senate after her\nFive years he said something like that in the Senate and then hold their house majority we're going to be able to see President Trump do things on it even more than what he's done the first few years he's going to have\nIn Congress because not only is he going to have a stronger Republican Congress on both sides of Capitol Hill what you will have Republicans who are wrong\nGr inside the party or have guys like Scott like Paul Ryan and Jeff Flake and Bob Corker their visa even the people that are that have been criticizing President Trump grabbing its agenda dual hall from inside the Republican Party they're not coming back and said we're getting people like Kevin McCarthy has been doing all why\nBe honest with you have to charge a leader of the house he's been doing everything he can to help the president gets a wall right right like rent is Brian head didn't they had an edge where I'll\nGive him an enormous amount of credit on that front I tell you Kevin try to get the last Easter was written in you know we're getting him were getting Marsha Blackburn to say about corporate we're going to get my mic salaries\nThat are I guess waking in Arizona all of these are upgrades inside the Republican Party so we're seeing the Republican Party who are in the president's direction but if you're able to hang on and use majorities in hang onto the majority of the house\nAnd get to that place and they got fifty five fifty six they're going to be able to roll the Senate Democrats and the and that's where the problem right we can't get legislation through sanctions there's only one Republican Senate right now\nAnd there's only and there's a hand for those that aren't as solid on the issues right to the point is is that if we can get to the place we got sixty six five fifty six it's going to be very easy to roll the Senate Democrats were going to be able to gym that with so many major piece of legislation I stared Chuck Schumer to try to shut the government down or something on the wall funding at that\nPoint right like we saw that went for him last\nYear or earlier this year is not going to go so well for them now\nSo but the point is that the opportunity to enlist hip Republican to hold onto\nHouse [noise] well and it's got to be it's going to single really are the total breakdown\nOf the resistance of the Democratic party you're right if the Republicans hold a housewife to vote and I think I agree with you met him and saying all along the ... they're going to pick up five maybe six seats in the U.S Senate predicting five I don't think they're going to win mansion see so I think you've got to win five states\nAre going to switch parties and that's all I don't I mean\nCome back after he voted for Brett Kavanaugh and that might that might that\nMight happen I mean that might happen just like like if the Republicans win by one of the Democrats went by one all you need is one person to being promised a you know Germany the appropriations or something and they switch parties and you know we've seen that happen\nI mean they could be it could be a divided house if it's if it's if it's somebody slips club so rich it's tied to all kinds of things that can happen I don't think that that will be the scenario but um\nI tell you why for by a legacy media friends are those the CNN I'm going to have to go to New York that night and a lot the windows because people will be jumping out of I don't know what they're going to do I mean what is it what does

Corey Hughes Nevada GOP chairman argues that the event and then she had some meetings in the morning we\nHave done some polling and we decided to go to Kansas very last minute\nSo today we were so last night we landed in Topeka ... we had a gathering of twenty five people in the small room at the Hilton and that's like the holiday and express excuse me the pizza and as I talk to you see it as leading our Kris Kobach later today Steve is going to be talking to\nLike a congregation\nOf Catholics\nAnd then we are going to go over to call vox 'em robots are campaign headquarters to me but come

are taking it from there\nAll right sounds like you've got a big scheduled now I just want to\nI just wanted to let everyone know because I've gotten calls from the media is a Washington Post and others are just too for cannot coordinate with campaign so that people saying well this James ... got to be there as quarry store going to be if they feel like stopping by like anybody else I can stop by what they're thinking not\nWarnings is what the campaign to the question is the first really most anybody could come to any of their events\nBut this is not coordinated with the campaign they don't have to get through this mission because it's a sea forces separate entity and they can't coordinate with federal or state campaign so just get that\nA low and let me tell you something we were told by Kansas GOP either seeing Kansas geo ski state party who understands and Kris Kobach the Kansas GOP who is going to lose the districts that are next to the one I'm sitting in right now\nThey had suggested that we don't even show up in their states so we are\nWe are motivating the base\nWe remember when the anywhere schemes goes they talk about that's why people were there twenty five people were there they could say only X amount of people showed up satisfy Steve that ties in media interviews yesterday he was on all the local affiliates talking about white people have to get out\nAnd vote 'em\nWe feel that we have been extremely attractive you don't actually this was something if you want to go back to the Trump campaign I actually um one of the things I learned from Corey Lewandowski was Corey said that Trump would get a lot of media more media that you could think and I didn't think it would be as much as\nCase I have had the TV on I have not seen an ad for Republicans Democrats are spending in Kansas convenience outraged by quality over three hundred million dollars a cycle and when I talk to the folks here in the restaurants when I talk to them last night at\nMen they tell me that all they hear ads of Republicans toss up I think the you know they get these were Cuban I get these um they get these big government rhinos the same people that Donald Trump is they take on go on the air talking about how they're going to be voting for the Democrats\nIn Congress that's what the Democratic party has done here and it's pretty attractive puts that said I think was the president back on the campaign trail continuing\nTo nationalize that selection I don't believe the media let me give you a perfect example I saw the ad us in Nevada three if your audience grows on Nate soldiers website right now he says the Democrat\nWill win has a Seventy five percent\nChance of winning I tell you the Democrat has eight zero percent chance of winning that seat I tell you divide us we're going to come out of their gasoline costs one perhaps klutz to with the way that Nevada for it is trying to show don't believe what you're hearing there is any plan behind everything we have\nTo get that many of these markets as we can there's only so much that Donald Trump can do there's only so much that his allies can do in time you know they're saying that Donald Trump the president said you'll interviews the president about\nCitizenship which I Wish I'd like to get through if we can very briefly John right he writes an article saying here's here's the president's schedule the president has completely abandoned house that's simply not true\nIf you look at the schedule that he has taken a free trip he goes to Florida in ... cording to protect\nCheats as of now we think keeps a house if we only come out of that state's negative ones that I think like you know I'm not going to go over to the scene I think we'll probably lose but if we cannot negative one there to get one end and Rick Scott\nEnded up winning they're respected group tore on Senate races on the back of Donald Trump\nHe has done something to save the Senate by him going to Missouri he's able to get into those other markets that our neighboring stores so I spoke to the White House as well just to get their read any end and they are not given up on the house\nSo whenever you people want to read whatever hole riding in a group wants to start telling people because we know I'm sure Mr Ryan who came out against the president as what the president\nSaid well she's a hundred percent right from from a legal constitutional point of view about his executive order blind came out against is being are wrong they are wrong I think that as a as we talk frequently I think that right now\nIf people get out and vote we will keep the house now I'm not telling you were going to go skiing in the seats in the house I'm telling you is that if everybody wants to support the president's agenda support this movement basically supports some\nBesides that Republicans will keep Republican controlled house believes the barbarians at the hordes hordes at the gates you know polo the lower end\nLook there's this narrative that the ... for the president has a fan of the\nHouse was the stupidest thing ever heard they have an eleven rallies in five days okay eleven rallies big rallies in five days now what are you going to do when you do a big rally and you get twenty thousand people well you're going to do it in this thing in the states where there's\nA Senate race up for grabs so you can get the most bang for the box but then\nYou pick the congressional district that you need to draw from so he's going to Fort Myers Florida or today just what that is a competitive

subject interesting question about what is the first of all the storm the border that's an embrace it and and I'm not going to set up here and say that the military should should fire on them so on and so for those decisions that the commanders\nWill make but the fact is\nYou cannot illegally enter the United states do not have a right to come into the United states they can request to come in through a silent but they're violated all the principles of asylum anyone who declared asylum in Mexico they weren't interested because there's little political a construct sold her remains to be seen what they will do\nThem until their their immigration hearings 'cause the president's made it very clear to catch and release days are over now there's no doubt in my mind that there are some activists storage will probably already has the staying written out uh the the the pro illegal immigration\nFolks on the left will run to a court and\nGet some judge some activists judge probably in the Ninth Circuit to see that the president can do this can stop can set up tents cities ancillary men and I think at that point a push us to come to show because that's an intrusion upon the\nViolation of the separation of Powers Act I think it's an intrusion on the authority under the constitution that the president has\nIn these situations so I think and this president has shown that I think he by by throwing out yesterday or a potential into those are the anchor baby situation as birthright citizenship he's going to push the issue has\nTo proceed push the issue because nobody else well this is the fault of Congress' job you know this is the fault of Congress's inability or the will to fix this broken immigration system so this is what we have but the president does have some options but I think what he's trying to do and\nTrying to force Congress to act\nOn this thing so he'll throw some things out there make the courts while may Congress getting bothered maybe find that we'll get some action on this but I think that if at some point if the court struck continue to intrude on the executive authority under the constitution I think the president has to push back I don't know how that will be\nI mean what form that will take but I think you have to push back\nSo the the er\nPresident yesterday sheriff David Carr of former sheriff of Milwaukee County sheriff Clarke president yesterday saying look this birthright citizenship\nThink makes no sense a lot of people I've been saying that because if you end up with the anchor babies now we've got hotel we we got a whole cottage industry of illegal companies uh\nMainly on the west coast basically you pay it come\nTo the United states to that get put in a hotel hidden you have a baby and that becomes an anchor baby hoping they understand what the president says I was going to do an executive order because there's an opening in the fourteenth amendment\nNow we know that's kind of get overturned immediately by the nice district in Hawaii and everything else but uh\nThis could end up according to the brain core what do you think if if if you took the average\nPeople um where do you think this is going to fall politically I think average and Americans are going to say yeah it's a good idea agra babies make no sense or you think you've got to say no I don't want to mess with the fourteenth amendment I that's the constitution that's who we are how do you think it'll fall\nWhile this anchor baby thing just birthright citizenship just part of the abuse right and so this has to be rectified too there's a lot of moving parts in the illegal immigration thing\nA soldier just chicken is one thing one at a time because you have to solve the whole thing you can't just take one thing and say well we'll fix this will be okay because they won't be okay this is sort of the use of our immigration system\nThe American people will be on the side of the president look at some of these other immigration issues are securing the border border wall so and so forth um pools heavily in favor of the president said last one I saw nearly Seventy percent of the people want to southern for to secure the ends\nOf the sanctuary cities they want an end to illegal\nImmigration so I think the politics of it he's going to be spot on the radical people will be on this side of the thing is\nThese things take time for them to work their way through the American public and so I don't know if the anchor babies things impact on next Tuesday but I Know that in the long run the president's call for Congress to do them jobs while they're not doing it right now the\nQuestion about that you're on the job truckers radio network\nSure if you ever talk with us they sure clerk hang in there for another
