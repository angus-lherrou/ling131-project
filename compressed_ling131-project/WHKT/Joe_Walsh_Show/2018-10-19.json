states should be a military leaders shouldn't be a person you make your personal trainers hopefully [noise]\n[noise] [noise] [noise]\nWell she's got a point and we'll see what the president's response as he has to respond to this I mean you you can have allies that people go into conflicts and get chopped up with the with the chainsaw well while they're alive and then put in doggy bags I mean you just can't have it you just that's not a civil society and I told you this before and I know\nAll my friends out there that like Trump they wonder what excuse it and say he's not a journalist who was with the Muslim Brotherhood I don't care who he is\n\nYou have to be consistent in your view are consistent view for\nAmerica First is America First and we want to country now if you have a country and sovereignty then you need to have international relations otherwise you have a global of society so in international relations there has to be a sense of order without order\nThere's there's no sovereignty obvious follow the logic here\nI Believe in logic\n\nAnd Matt two plus two four\nAnd\nIf he had gone into a cafe and got assassinated\nCrap happens right it happens\nIf they blew up his car when he started at crop happens right they got to be for the guy\nWe get it now their business maybe you're going to get it if it happened in the U.S but uh it it ... you wouldn't assessed against that ever happened to us as homicide but if it was in Turkey it's up to them but the fact that he went\nInto an embassy or consulate\nThat's that's where it breaks down that's why they've been gossipy thing was such a hard I mean once used and that's why the Iranians are over running our our embassy there and and keeping the hostages ... embassies are supposed to be a safe place\nFor a world order\nAnd the Saudis violated that and they stuck their finger\nIn the eye of the of all their allies just sit there just isn't the United states it's Theresa May in Great Britain me they're also funding them they're also selling them arms there are also involved in a Yemeni war there's all sorts of implications that go way beyond the U.S here\n\nAnd the president has to send a clear single any will so let's stop jumping to conclusions number one he has talked about pale\nNumber two for parents not pack number three we don't have all the facts number four they not admitted anything number five number six number seven is not enough in from mission number eight and ten see numbers one of the seven once the information comes out I guarantee you this president is going to have a response\nAnd it's not going to be slipping under the carpet he will have a response\n\nUp to and including what Lindsey Graham said which is the immediate removal of MPs as the air and they get somebody else in there\nLeap frog over to uh be in the planets are session for this route for the kingdom\nAnd maybe he's just not the guy certainly if he would be the scapegoat that would solve it and the other scapegoat like some faceless nameless person over say rogue general I think that's gonna work OSU all plays out because the facts on into\nGoing there was just I was just the boys the boys are going to play a little baseball sauce yeah huh I Know right it's just us and the guys working on friday night he's only got one a\nPhrase get one game nine o'clock so after that you know

great atmosphere\nPeople definitely make plans from the game they're bringing their off a freshman class to cheer them on how the whole court here cheering us on end up getting a great ball game always have been three years we played them in my career that's far came down to the wire with a lot of exciting football\nWell a lot of money and sending football and uh they have a they haven't they haven't pretty solid team and their their record hasn't shown and I think they're better than they looked start with their quarterback stronger merged Jordan black\nAnd joined by experts you're starting a left handed off the record back extremely tough kids probably one of the better passers they've had their up here for a hundred and eighty a yard sale last week I'm sixteen or twenty three so kind of opens up their traditional last option running attack with some some good play action passing\nOut again and they're very solid on the office wine that come off the ball lowered hard very hard simulating practice if it got running backs they see their balance dots and fully not between running past but in who touches the ball and where they touch the ball so very difficult to stand defense plea a multi\nPressure unit are they bring a lot of letters from a lot of locations you have to be really solid or your past protection against them and they play certainly hard and then special teams are big they get to the stream they will beat in Merced journal last\nDog a play the game kickoff return for touchdowns so very well coached by rent Tom send their kids are like our young men they play strongly hard they fight for the for the final sound they never said guy so technical ball game against a very healthy talented in\nYeah in a couple of weeks ago um Palestine quarterback Tom flak though by the way is the brother a younger brother\nOf a so called a quote unquote elite quarterback Joe ... uh [laughter] is the elite quarterback uh well I don't know but based on uh the last game against tendency looked pretty lead to me\nBut coach a Flaco really carved up the citadel defense and\nYou look at you didn't ski and uh the the arm strength that he's got in the maturation he's gone through your quarterback you didn't see your fast receivers\nUm they they had a lot I watched that some of the game actually they have a lot of uh let's say upper you've got opportunities I thinking there's secondaries that a fair analysis of mine\n[laughter] well I think the central defense probably learned a whole heck of a lot from that ball game it was you know first team they played that just threw the ball around\nA little bit and you know they're young on defense like we are and so as the game got on I thought they played a lot better defense linking confidence is the game goes on and I think there'll be much better prepared the playoffs after playing that ballgame yeah flak also\nHurt him with his legs a little bit running the ball early and ah you know I think once again the young still\nGame do you look at a young quarterback or doing a little more scrambling out of the pocket maybe having some design runs slaves to keep the defense honest\nYou know we always have to sign run plays in for the second quarter back in so that's part of our all kinds of packages to keep the defense on a I'd prefer not\nTo scramble from the pocket because that means we have a clean pockets buy they failed to protect some breaks down like it does you know at every level of football than you know obviously reached needs to maneuver in the pocket and do what he takes it needs to do whether it's run the ball or you know operating scramble drilled that we've done you know since\nNews in this hour some town hall in downtown line down or in Dallas president

there's no war\nAnd nobody nobody really wants to talk about this\n\nAnd are short text and that says the ... the caravan it's coming for the midterms I mean you would think you would think that if this caravan of invading illegal aliens that that's what this says this is an invasion\n\nThis is an invasion coming to the United states\n\nI don't I'm not going to call it anything but what it is an invasion\nYou would think that that would motivate\nPeople to get out and vote for Republican so that you have some kind of a security on the border but other people think it's actually going to hurt the Republican because\nCNN and all the news networks going to be showing pictures of moms were babies that's\nThat you you can't script is out mom's with babies and they're going to call them economic refugees seeking asylum asylum means you're a political prisoner or you were at risk in your country of some sort of a\nMedical situation that will ... what\nBecause there's four billion of them\nWhat what are they all just going to come and ask for asylum because they can't get a job in there get corrupted corrupt country\n\nThat we give billions of dollars to these people and it's at the corruption is beyond the pale\n\nYou would think that this would motivate Republicans and independents that come out and say look this isn't right and I send my child to third grade there's twenty five\nKids in the class Nineteen and them don't speak English what the hell kind of an education is my child going to get my public school which are paying for\nThey're not paying anything well you know you're a racist\nWhy because I Want my son or daughter and the third grade to be taught in English with other people that speak English so we can have some kind of a a learning environment yeah you're you're a racist\n\nI had a peanut butter sandwich for breakfast like put marmalade on at the heritage racist\nOnly white people eat marmalade\nI mean it it's this thing is going to go on and on and\nAnd so it's all these mobs and what is going on is intimidating regular people for just looking at something reasonable\n\nTo be called a racist because you don't want your country invaded by four thousand illegal immigrants on the southern border\nNow it's just like you want to obey the law\nI guess we have two sets the laws paws for people that the Democrats won in and that was very body of I don't really understand it\nThis is a real issue\nAnd there's no answer to this and we're really you would think that our ally Mexico wouldn't let them come into Mexico\n\nI mean think about think about think about what what would happen in the U.S if these five thousand a caravan of invaders said well we really want to go to Canada so as we can you let us in the United states and give us just a a a sixty they are status here so that we can\nGo up the highway and ah get to Canada and we can invade them\nI mean what what what would the Canadians say well sure you know I understand I understand that's our problem no they'd be like why are you doing this\nThis is just a logic\nTo open borders crowd is relentless and they have Wall Street Republicans behind them you would think that this would be the major issue of the day and\nBecause of Goldman Sachs is salivating and looking over their chops at the prospect of more cheap labor nothing is going to be done at the end of the day they're all going to stay because the Republicans hands are tied\nJudges will overturn whatever their what whatever ... Jeff Sessions the site\nAnybody now from their children especially before the midterms that say disaster\nEven though if somebody today in the Bronx or in ... ... or Richmond\nOr Lynchburg or anywhere in America\nShoplifting a seven eleven on camera and his apprehended by the police and they have a child in the back seat of the car they will get separated from the child the child doesn't go to jail with him that's the laws that we have in America you want to change it I guess change it but that's the current law but laws don't matter now\n\nI mean if you ever had more evidence why there shouldn't be a wall visit\n\nSo the Republicans are attempting to make this\nA a election issue where they're putting a\nBill together for thirty two billion dollars to fund the wall\nBut they're not getting their message out as far as I'm concerned\n\nI mean you you really think about you really think about how any other country would handle and organized caravan of illegal immigrants coming into your country and expecting a fully expecting that they will be allowed in and taking care of\n\nIts crazy and\nUh you would think that this one issue alone would sink the Democrats\nIn the election but many people think it's going to have the opposite effect so you know you just start scratching your head\n\nI mean I think the debate over this issue in this country should be whether or not you want to border or you don't\nAnd you know there is an argument for not having one and the argument is cheap labor and we have a big heart and we'll take care of anybody that comes in and eventually when the country collapses then it is what it is\nI mean that's one argument\nYou in the meantime the elites will continue to profit off of it and then obscene fashion\nAnd the gangster benches will make more money and Wall Street executives of get more wealthy than they are and if you work at Goldman Sachs you'll be able to buy an island\nI mean I guess that's the plan and you continue to fund the Democrats who will then have on unlimited power in perpetuity and remember it was President Obama who said ah my goal was to transform it America\nTransforming you transform it by changing its make up\nDemographic makeup you change it by allowing 'em unfettered illegals to come in and change the culture whatever the American culture is those who want to change it want it to be something else I'm really don't know what they want it to be\nOr what do you think but that's the objective of this whole thing\nIt's Wall Street Republicans at one cheap labor and the third and they open a open borders one world government that wants to change and wipe\nOut cultures they want to wipe them out so they don't exist they just want land mass and the free\nMovement of people and goods between land masses that's it John\nFrederick radio network in your heart you know I'm right there's no argument to oppose what I'm saying but it it doesn't matter the Republicans are ineffective in articulating it anyway John ... radio network I'll be right back [noise]\nOn former Trump advisors in order to discredit this this is scary and this is your deep state right here a senior official working for the treasury department's financial crimes enforcement\nOperation network find sad I got a lot of acronyms here so hang with me has been short this is a senior official has been charged

the southern district of New York with one count of unauthorized disclosures of suspicious activity reports in one count of conspiracy to make unauthorized disclosures\nFive years in prison\nI mean if

for vice president as you know with Hillary Clinton two thousand sixteen he's up for reelection for a second term senator great to have you with us\nYet I'm going to be with you today\nWe get a lot to go over a let's start with Jim Alka shockey or this very troubling to a lot of people it's like the ... a Roach Motel he went in but he didn't come out and out now there's a lot of allegations from the Turks saying that he was murdered chopped up somebody even saying that he was ...\nHorrific situation\nAnd a disruption to the international community because when you go into as you know sent her an embassy or consulate that's supposed to be a safe haven I'm I Know secretary propane was the president wants to win all the facts come out share with us your perspective on this as it is now\nWell John yeah you're like really troubling I'm a member of the Senate Foreign relations\nCommittee I Am the lead Democrat on the on the sub committee that oversees the U.S Saudi relationship and this this has the potential to dramatically change the relationship between our countries um your rights that I'm a mother of a journalist has to be taken seriously this\nIs a journalist who was living in northern Virginia whitener Tyson's corner in Fairfax writing for the Washington Post and be the murder of anybody a consulate which should be a safe haven but that would take place a is shocking I'm so there's a\nCouple of things that we're doing in Congress first on Foreign Relations committee we sent a letter to the president would trigger\nThe Mac it's yeah it's I think you know the Magnitsky Act was named after a Russian\nDissident who was murdered by the Russians off for his political activity how Congress sent a letter to the president pet gives the president of the twenty days to make a ruling about whether\nThe murderers of human rights violation and if so what sanctions would be imposed we sent that letter about two weeks ago the other two issues that are currently under consideration I'm her somewhat related are whether the United states should stop or put a moratorium on our arms sales to the Saudis we have\nSignificant arms sales to them and they have for years um and third and this\nIs one that are very focused on because it was a significant passion of she wants to show that uses whether the United states should stop supporting any Saudi efforts are in the war in Yemen the civil war in Yemen that's going on between Lucy minority in the Yemeni government\nAnd Saudi Arabia is very very involved in St Louis competing against that who sees it that way or the United states is providing a support for the Saudis in that position refueling aircraft that others and um we have some votes to try to\nStop us from such a patient in that war we had recently got up to forty\nSeven votes in the Senate not fifty not fix it got pretty significant wrote so um and I are increasingly up the opinion that the war is a humanitarian disaster in the United states should not be as just the Saudis and the prosecution or that or\nThat we're going to you know get more facts but bluntly I think the burden is on the Saudis\nTo prove that they had nothing to do with any harm kidnapping or ... or a mother of this journalist enough\nFacts are out there enough information and collaboration is out here I think burger now on their shoulders they're going to have to prove that they weren't involved in any harm and if they don't I think it's going to fundamentally change the relationship with countries Saudi Arabia\nCenter teens is this now the day of reckoning for the U.S relations with us\nQuestion I I think I Know what you're thinking there and some very very significant challenges in a relationship in recent years you're anywhere you overwhelming majority of the nine eleven attackers were Saudis yes um and then you lose\nForward to a whole series of other instances Yemen um bizarre Saudi behavior in recent years um especially since the ascension of the crown prince MPs to his position\nAs you know when in within the last year the Saudis were involved in a bizarre kind of error kidnapping up the Lebanese\nPrime minister prime minister Hariri around where they sort of as he was visiting Saudi Arabia he gave sort of a force televised interview announcing his resignation from the position of Lebanon and that was widely viewed as a Saturday Paris light and I'll tell you when I go to the region um what I hear I\nAs this terror van gets through Mexico and yesterday the southern border of the United states senator Kaine what should authorities do what should we do well\nWell first I mean let's let's not wait I'm there to get the watchers or not to the Guatemalan Mexican border yet so we need to work with a government some Guatemala and Mexico\nI'm On this and you know I Hope that the president's especially you know often talk talk about Mexico et cetera does not hurt our ability to reach in accord with Mexico on us\nI think one of the issues that important 'cause you gotta have allies in the world and\nIn when you have allies you can work together on joint solutions you got staying as for like Caribbean people ate and Honduras or or not even get to the\nBorder with the United states but that would involve the U.S having a cooperative relationship with Mexico for example and not spending time crashing Mexico which the president does so I Know that a U.S military and north command which basically is everything\nNorth of the Mexican Guatemalan border um our own you know we we do have a da chess another a U.S presence in Mexico I Would hope that we would work with the bottom all on the\nMexican Government to uh to have that caravan of folks remain in place I I Know the president hunter as he always point out no country wants to export its young um there are also things that we can do to help\nPromote stability in hunter a swat them all in El Salvador and if we do that we can reduce people who are leaving those countries to come to the United states\nYou know center I'm\nYou spent time as a young man and missions in\nJesuit missions and I really respect what you've done and your uh your work in that and now where do you think about these these violent left wing mobs that are going around chasing people out of restaurants spitting on Lindsey Graham sending\nA packages and horrific emails to Susan Collins and\nAnd make it make what is it is it's so discouraging job it really is I had an event last night I'm Out in Fairfax County where there were sort of it\nDisruptive protester tried to get in my face with a camera and light up and yell at me hoping I think that I Would say something in temperature that they could have been put on video and\nWhether it's somebody doing that to me whether it's somebody sending something the Susan Collins is home whether it's a colleague being accosted in a restaurant um and it it it really really\nI don't know it's just it's just sickening [noise] um and you see a you know an escalation of all kinds of pilots that have Europe we saw Nineteen swastikas painted across one of a Jewish community center in Fairfax two Saturdays ago that was very shocking\nSo I think we have to those of us in elected positions you what we have to do which maybe\nTry to be better role models bring down the temperature bringing down the rhetoric you can disagree with somebody without being you know you get in temperature on civil to them I I really try hard to do that and everything I Do I disagree with the president on a lot he sign\nSeventeen and my bills you know that that I've been able to put on the steps [noise] um I I Try not to get into the name calling saying that your rights any violence has to be condemned and whether it's probably wants on the left on the rights violence that's you know not political in nature I'm asked to be condemned\nOne of the great things about our constitution and you know your your\nFavorite part of the constitution is in\nThe first amendment freedom in the press and my favorite part of the constitution is in the first amendment to which is the right of the people to peacefully assemble the right of the people to petition government for redress or created says we we give citizens\nThe right to peacefully assemble but it's got to be peaceful or to you know write letters to congressman but it's it's gotta be peaceful and I think that that the framework realize what engagement was necessary\nFor democracy at work that they understood that the engagement had to be peace for any kind of disruptive or violent okay and he wants to be involved\nWith dinner when a when you were former running mate Hillary Clinton said that an civility is acceptable under environment doesn't track and field is a fire I mean we're like a democratic society and they very much\nYeah I disagree with that happens when you say well I think uh I think you got to maintain civility especially at the pop 'em let me just let me use to role models on my side of the aisle to fix some role models on your side nobody would say Bobby's God\nIs not a very progressive Democrats very progressive Democrats dairy farm and his point of view points out what he thinks is white points out what he thinks is wrong but bodies guys\nHad a political career where nobody thinks of Bobby Scott as an uncivil person or a name caller Don buyer would be another example and search and yet very progressive Democrats\nPoints out what he thinks is right that in mind calling out something that he thinks he's wrong but nobody calls on Byron name caller nobody thinks he's on several [noise]\nSo I think I can look at examples in and look I got colleagues on my side and I can think of the Senate colleagues on the Republican side Lamar Alexander Lamar as my share of the health education labor pension committees very much a Republican\nAnd that he thinks is wrong or something that the Democrat wants to get like there'll be plenty about it you know what he says that Lamar Alexander is an unsettled questions so I think I think you're right or it's out there that says you know well it's time for a holiday from civility is a long long I think we need more of a level\nWhere the example of obvious cuts in some way and he's my congressman uh and he's been right on some of the biggest issues in America in the past two decades so yeah you can call them a progressive\nAnd John reinforce that even when you disagree with body size great you know what I mean think somebody's got as like a name Paul or something that's not that's not who he is you know and then we need we uh we need to act like that\nI mean I Would I Would put a I Would put your colleagues centered Johnny Isaacson in that category uh abstain thing everybody knows where he stands he's very conservative the votes were the president a hundred percent of the time but everything is done in the ... civil respectful manner\nI ... where we're very short on time but I've got to get to the election because that's\nThat's coming up in Nineteen days or you have that or what looks like to be center and it's remarkable lead in both of polling and numbers but you know nothing is certain the only poll the matters is the one on November six tell me about your reelection campaign what you're seeing how it's going and what you think the outcome will be\nWell as you as you point out Nineteen days and yet polls are looking pretty good but I saw people culture about preferences and elections are about energy and preferences in society as energy so what you want to see energy um I've I've loved serving in the Senate\nMy by campaign themes that I chose this I'm trying\nTo reflect the way I've lived in the way I've served in Virginia that works for all the proper genuine about what's on the sensuality of working on or your can have any good policies about working in the workforce but it's also about this Virginia that works for all I've been kind of obsessed with the last two words and the pledge of allegiance\nThe notion that uh you know if it's not working for all what's working what's not working for\nAll we have more work to do so I'm going to continue should I be a lot about beyond anything reelected I'm going to continue to work on these areas armed services Foreign Relations budget and then health education labor and pensions um I haven't\nSeen really during this calendar year twenty eight genes or maybe no surprise given the elections that results in last November's elections in Virginia I continue to see\nVery strong energy turnout and events voter registration for midterm year we're seeing pretty strong energy early vote it's taking place but as you point out nothing for granted and take to go back to ... body Scott he says there's only two ways to run an election either run unopposed a run scare I'm opposed\nTo I'm running scared so that's the way I'm going to do it all the way your election eve\nOr are we going to see a potential to obtain for president campaign or twenty twenty\nJohn I'll tell you I I was really an honor to be the first world the Virginia politician on the national ticket is Eighteen forty in twenty sixteen but I definitely came back from that campaign saying like at the end up with the wizard of Oz there's no place like home there's no um I really I loved it\nAnd what matters particular level regular person in the world will be only they can be able to like in April but just the ... so I Am very focused on if I'm staying in the long continuing struggle\nOkay Senator Tim Kaine our thank you for your time or at a time today a great dialogue with use or as always it's always great to have you on for more information on the senators reelection campaign go to Tim Kaine dot com\nTim Kaine dot com and he's up for re election on November sixth that's the midterm strict with on your calendar if you're in Virginia and listen to me right now early voting and started\nSo you can go and take care of that right now go to Tim Kaine dot com Tim Kaine dot com for more information chain two thousand Eighteen and by the way that's came within eight the senator thanks for being with us\nKaine on and a what a great interview that was I mean really great whether you like his policies or you don't doesn't really matter to me I get it how you do what you are but a here's why I respect the center and kind of like I respect Bobby Scott they\nCome on my show whenever I ask a there is no topics there was no scripts\nUh I I mean I just had the center on here for what twenty five minutes unfettered\nAsking him anything and you have a conversation and that is\nThe definition of civility we don't agree on a lot of things most things but uh we can still have a civil conversation disagree or agree we can have a dialogue we'd have a conversation we didn't have a relationship of the center and I have a relationship we have a friendship\nAnd just because we don't agree I mean look I ran Trump's campaign in Virginia against them and we did good enough where\nTim Kaine and Joe Biden had to come to Virginia on Sunday and Monday because we're closing the gap but that doesn't mean we're not friends and that doesn't mean you can't have a conversation and\nAh you know I thought his answers were very interesting or we agree on the Yemeni situation we shouldn't be there there's a lot of these Secret Wars that the U.S has and that we shouldn't be and then I'm going to go into any minute and\nCertainly the Saudi episode was job to show he's bringing all this into light but uh you know we're in we're in the secret wars that we're going to do it's like they're all under the radar screen and we're in so many of them now\nAnd the military industrial complex is so big and we've been in wars for so long that nobody really thinks about him until something goes wrong like are the Saudis blow up a school bus with the\nUs made missile you know then we hear about it on the news but I hear about it every day because I'm a senior contributor now for the al Jazeera Arabic\nNetwork and so what we talked about on a daily basis is wars going on over the world and I get to go on panels with military generals of various\nSponsors or around the globe and so you get a little bit of a different perspective is one thing that al Jazeera Arabic does that al Jazeera satellite news does\nIs it really brings the world news home and they don't really have an outlet in the u._s. you got to go on the Internet but uh when I go on al Jazeera and I'm On several times a week I I've had to turn this week down most of my assignments because\nI'm busy with families stopped and opening up this new radio station which is a lot of work by the way ... but are typically when I go on a an al Jazeera Arabic prime time you know the average\nThe average Seventy million viewers Seventy million not seven not seven hundred thousand Seventy million that's their average reach prime time on an average weekday\n\nCNN rigid about seven hundred thousand on a good night they might get one of the prime time shows might get a million I go on al Jazeera Arabic I'm reaching Seventy million people around
