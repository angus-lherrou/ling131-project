uh I have way too much coffee in the morning\nYou and me both me and I go through metal pots um I'm not here not no I'm just ready to go to Mike what's going on in New Hampshire these days\nWell I'll tell you what we had a we had a couple of presidential candidates running for twenty twenty already here in the last week so ah things are wrapping up\nSo this is only the Democratic side no Republicans are going up there right\nNo well you know this is talk of course about John Case sick and or Jeff blank running against Donald Trump for the Republican nomination\nI actually wrote I'm an op ed for uh the statewide paper here in New Hampshire just last week I it's pretty silly to take on Donald Trump I'm a ... you know two years or ... any time a Republican primary where a sitting president has been challenged\nIt's getting on the right job and these guys will be running on the left they really wouldn't have a prayer feeding the president and the Republican primary\nRight now right now that's that's right now anything can happen goodness knows what I'm hearing anything\nCan happen anything of course and especially you know God Forbid the economy collapses\nRight right that's what I'd like to know when something like that but if but if what if mother drops of big weren't things can change All right let's let's shift to the Democratic nomination Democratic primary where I think we're four hundred and Seventy nine days away something like that from the Democratic primary hamster [laughter] who's getting\nReady for it now that's why I think it's I think it's smart pressed for you to to be talking about their stock fans because they the presidential I stopped as you well know there's there's all kinds of things happening behind the scenes right now\nThis is where it happens right the pros note I broke frozen them then [laughter]\nThen comes the day after November's election candidates start killing things in a more public way but like I said senator or Joe a branch from New York was up here yesterday campaigning with C\nThe groundwork change and and you know she's doing that all across the country and um [noise] ah so she's starting to to put things together\nI'm Alec Baldwin I Know it may seem Shelley I'm sure you've heard about it to the guy he's he's making rounds he think he made his second trip to New Hampshire just this past week it real\nTwice in the last six months Alec Baldwin Alec Baldwin and he has said he has not ruled out running for president\nHe Mike we are making news this morning it was my comment and my the producer of the show looking at we're making news this morning Steve ball like this one\nIs Alex Alex ... has um a spoke at the largest fundraiser for the Democratic party in New Hampshire who um just last week yeah\nWow see if he ran his old out Goldman is Jack Ryan you know it's kind of my God yeah [laughter]\nThat was back in the Cold War you know hundred October [laughter] that's right [laughter] so so who else do you see in up in in New Hampshire in who would you get to be the front runners in the New Hampshire primary today likely to win the twenty twenty primary in February of next year after next\nBernie Sanders runs for president he will be the proper okay just no doubt about it now I'm In New Hampshire no doubt about it right if he doesn't uh down a little bit Warren will likely be the front runner\nOkay so how 'bout what recently happened with Senator Warren in New Hampshire how does that play with her I mean fumbling of the DNA ancestry ball this week with disasters\nYou know in in democratic circles I actually don't think it's got as much a liberal Democrats are going to be looking for a liberal Democrat regardless of facts\n[laughter] you know they they think they face their their choices and in possession primarily on emotion in in a\nJesse parents from I was just going to do if you heard that\nThe very a veteran democratic operative in in Iowa was describing a I'm a so called scene but in reality in the in the Democratic voter in the primary motor but they also want to win and they might go you know I don't think Sanders can win nationally I think you could yeah\nThat's the I mean\nI I'm a Republican I think it was about to warrant would have a similar problem I don't think she's electable in the in the\nGeneral election nationally nationally okay yeah I I like the you know for that using TNA issue as an example um I think so I I thought one thing I Will say though it's a\nI I don't think it affected her here in New Hampshire I Do think it affected the again the behind\nThe scenes operation a and then you know the ... all the maneuvering going on behind the scenes among potential democratic candidates for her to actually take over a news sites all before the election the way she did was outrageously\nI mean if you knew the results of the DNA test and it was counter to your narrative that you're trying to go after you put that thing up midday on Christmas [laughter] have you been married right\nNow I don't understand it so how do you think uh okay so you got Sanders worn just because this New Hampshire but the other guys have got to go up there and compete or do they have to they might say just say you\nKnow I think I Do I think that you know because there's always going to the opportunities and that's as you probably know ... ... I'm Still Clinton made a name for himself by doing well and and coming back to to win at a time when she was losing\nSo you don't have to win the New Hampshire primary to make to make a poll waves across the country\nSo especially as Elizabeth Warren is a front runner she's from Massachusetts neighboring Massachusetts the Kennedys who comes in second and even third ah I can get momentum as a result\nYeah cause I think Clinton finished third right yeah that's right yeah so\nSo but you have to win pleasure show in New Hampshire to advance to have to yeah that's right that is correct and I ended up just what I don't think people understand about the the democratic nomination process this cycle is that California\nHas moved up yeah and they're going to have and that's what expense of snakes and Kamala Harris McConnell Eris was going to have a big lead there\nYes and that's I think that's going to be the interesting thing I didn't hear if you guys talked about this with but on the Iowa\nA conversation but what she does in the early primary states will be interesting given the California moved up will she tried well we'll see try and uh and and pick a state to do was to try and do well in all of them and um you know 'cause they're so different that the early primary states ... compared to California\nWell again I think you have to at least try to compete in some of these because\nThe reality is even though you might not win New Hampshire you won't matter and the the nomination legitimately so you still have to win in the in the electoral college that practice but you don't you can't you can't just blow past Iowa New Hampshire because\nThose are those who have gone in either direction with especially with Trump winning Iowa lesson that's right no doubt about it what issues are dressed in New Hampshire voters these days what's going on up there\nAnd expect uh uh the economy is still\nThe number one issue um the governor here a is a Republican Christian new new and he's and a bar with what Donald Trump's been doing it and governor Sununu the economy's booming we have the second lowest unemployment rate in the country\nThen I'm off the Democrats don't want to talk about that they're trying to talk about anything but the economy with\nA family you know he paid leave issue ... they're just trying to make up an issue that might connect with voters authors in the economy so that's going to continue to be number one the second issue here Chris I I don't know how it works in other states you've heard Donald Trump even talk about this is the opioid epidemic\nThrough a which is pretty pretty severe and New Hampshire so that's the second biggest issue really\nWe've had the we've had that disease in our family as well and so it's a scourge of member of people dying as a result of that is the doors anything else it dies country it's a good handle on it and I don't think that's part of it as I\nSaid it's not a partisan issue Mike a final production as what do you think coming out with got thirty seconds punch it what are you got for the the democratic nominee the Democratic finishers in New Hampshire twenty twenty\nI say it's going to go Elizabeth Warren a won't win\nOr if she runs she is going to win the New Hampshire primary um they're going to be I think there's going to be some kind of dark horse like a\nUm a Cory Booker I expect will be somewhere in the top three um and then and then you know what I I I Would not be surprised at someone like Michael Bloomberg as long as it as well because the Democratic state we need to read uh the bank roll up a business\nThat's all right Mike Dunn a joining us from the Granite State of New Hampshire four hundred and eighty days plus or minus out of the New Hampshire primary thanks for joining us we'll be back on the John Frederick sure this is Chris sacrament filling in her back to\nHow how about you know we're not all that a lot I\nMean the nor nor should you should the anyone in in politics and gossip but how do you how do you compare the intensity this year to last year what are you seeing the same similar not as intense when he says well\nSimilar but I think we we're we're very proud particularly in Virginia last year when we send a message to the country into the world that you know hated bigotry have no place here and that we were open and welcoming for business\nWith the election of governor north him and his team and then you know that that sort of verse set of a house candidates that got across the finish line that just beautiful tapestry of um of of of our our\nCandidates that are women and a diverse women and I just it just it you know so that was that was really great but I think what is happening is\nPeople who are like we have we can't do this we can do this and it's just health doubled down and we said for example the surge in the absentee balloting I'm In ... county and Orange County which our number one and two right now\nIn the state or requests for absentee ballots you know that's good for us that's that's really good I mean when I think we're just added you know adding more excitement and enthusiasm right\nLike quitting kid was on earlier to seven o'clock hour and he said he he thinks the turnout going to be forty to forty five percent and it's a large large a range and there but where do you all project in turn out right now\nWe're just going out there looking for every single vote\nAnd stuff [laughter] I Know where do you\nBut we have a reason to get out there's a lot at stake and um and a sandwich\nGoing to be better than your average near term but I'm you know I'm not in the business of of that we're just going to we're we've just reached over we can you're describing ground yeah we're in a G. O. T. V. now face and we are just trying to get out of our lives and bring over anybody else that wants to ...\nThe been impressed with your with your crop of Kansas this year and last year they they definitely worked hard and when when they're struck me as a sort of an obvious one is that your the dominance of the meal Kansas nominees\nRight if this is definitely the year the woman I like to talk about our women candidates and then I got an Anthony Flaccavento nine [laughter]\nI mean for one thing is is I mean and they're all they have a different kind of experience and diversity but it is all good and it will be a good refreshing breath I'm a for Congress and across the crops up atomic several states that are in general\nFor West End up there on the temp congressional district that we're really excited about what we see up there um the volunteers are just showing up on non stop and the Washington Post endorsed ... which is something that I'm\nA you know and Barbara Comstock got endorsed every other time when they're very disappointed that her that she will stand after Donald Trump and that proved not to be the case so ah her ...\nGoing to be on a congresswoman and then down in uh I'll just run through a real quick if you want to ask me something about him but we were ... and the second district I retired navy commander in a small business woman and of course Scott Taylor's got he's on his own problems with a\n... you know trying to cheat and quite frankly and on\nAnd and and having a staff or put half fraudulent ah signatures on the ballot I mean that's\nYou know that's unheard of stop that's pretty safely and I I think if I ever saw it on a reject that but but even that we you know without that we still have a son you know could credible candidate\nWell when I when I've seen in your in your tennis you haven't been obviously a female when I think it says regardless of the outcomes and we can talk about polling and they'll come November and you know when kids got a tailor up and\nHe's got ... up and Coburn and maybe maybe the Angie Williams influence in the in the six uh when I think it's sending a signal though is moves that you're going to see even more women in the future running for office regardless of party and I think it's a very healthy dynamic\nYeah yeah and I want to I Want I Want to say two things on that real quick we were really excited that Leslie coverage just got moved into the red the blues um program for the D triple C but the thing I think you're exactly right about women women have always um um\nWomen have always and studies show yes but you know then the ones that would and I know your mom would agree with me on that would have\nLet them go from a hard sell out from a horse can not my don't go\nAway that raise my kids I got to get my degree got to pay off my lines\nSay good outcomes of twenty six teams was when I decided well not white many more we're going to step up your mom lives ... something to offer\nAnd I I don't think that you we will just seeing more and more of that because someone sad is that saying and I don't know who was you know if you're not to table you're on the menu and if you look at what is it state this year with women's health care uh with families ah\nWith just health care in general you know women have a lot to add to that and there and we just don't think we're going to step back anymore\nNo no no I don't I don't think you should and I think having the frankly it's not just that they're women but they're but they're in a certain age range to relatively speaking to me a couple of them you know a bit older a little bit younger but for the most part\nYou're you're center cut on mom's right the suburban mom is is is a strong voting I won't say walk but a market that I I think your party is obviously intentionally trying to attract\n... correct correct and um do suburban moms some of them who voted for Donald Trump\nI think have seen the ramifications of that vote and we're reaching out and talking to them and particularly when you take something like the Kavanaugh's\nNomination where you know stress side of the fact of whether you didn't did or didn't believe Dr for just as a man who can't permanent we saw back his temperament that is not meant to be a judge and then add on to it the fact\nOf you know her very compelling tests the testimony and on and and they you know Republicans decided not to believe up to ... there's going to be some ramifications from that\nOkay um let's\nTalk about mostly Coburn moving from into the three D. triple C a red to blue program\nUm then you're you're making the news here in the John Frederick radio show this morning with the other folks make news about ethanol in Iowa and Steve bullock is a potential outsider and ... and the hamster wheels [laughter]\nSo you're you're ... three for three but my colors here so this is news was Coburn moving into this special category of funding from the D triple C talked about that\nWell we just we just got the information ourselves and that just shows you know that's an open seat we've always thought it was very competitive and uh we we're pleased to see that\nOn the inside the beltway group recognize that as well she's Seventy two thousand miles on a car you know the fifth district has\nReally really dig it goes from up there and faulty accounting all the way down to the north Carolina line it's got a lot of different you know rural but you know it's got Charlottesville area in ... to ... you know then you've got sort of the D.C suburbs\nWith fall here so you got a little bit of everything that she is really a campaign in every part of that district and ah and I think that you know hear your share and it towards the end they finally you know solve the value and investing more in her\nWell it also says hey they have the resources to do it right well that's a good point too I think that is and if you've seen the articles that in you know\nThey are actually out raising 'em a Republican incumbent psyche looking day brat versus Abigail Spanberger I think she got raised him three to one lady ah this last um [noise] I guess this gets recent filing report on\nForeign arms and and you know that that's just what we're seeing all across the board\nI think it's a lot of them are small donations to which is like really gratifying because you had a small bangers are the ones that really invest in here and show up and knock on doors and time day care and uh and put the shoe leather [noise]\nWell I think that's showing up obviously in the polling generic ballot is a little behind where are you all were last year at the end of the day\nOr if you just followed the if you just follow those those numbers and the data you're probably do quite well election day maybe not as large but sooner army that happened in Virginia last year but you know showing up on the ground um I I think the Democrats are going to have another a happy day here again

like two days\nJohn John where you wish you the best way to judge other best down in Florida I'm after his Astros took it on the chin last night against the Boston Red Sox I turned it off a little bit early I think I'll turn off in the eighth inning\nAnd that was it looked like there was a it was wrapped up there this is Chris accident I Am a filling it I Do is is occasionally I'm I'm a former member of the Virginia house of delegates I surf in two thousand two the two thousand ten and currently I'm the executive director of Virginia free\nThe foundation for research and economic education Virginia free is a nonpartisan underlined nonpartisan boldly non partisan or a visit pro business out advocacy organization here and the comment there for\nThirty years I'm not over yet pro business we're also very much a working towards responsible pro business government cause as we heard in the\nIn the news updates Mike we heard that that China's economy is slowing down its growth and that's a problem they have a significant debt burden and their economy is slowing its growth down there\nYou know you're trying to like be be that guy and that has that has devolved to where we are today largely as a result of several\nFactors I'm One that the Iraq War or to the collapse of the economy in two thousand and eight and a in that has led to this massive worldwide suspicion of government\nOr what's going on today this unsettled place that we are in this world is not just manifesting itself in the United states we are not alone in this and this is in this cultural shift is manifesting itself in politics\nIt's showing up in Hungary in Poland and in Germany over the weekend and but very which is actually I ran into a [laughter]\nGerman political picture of a weekend fancy that right you're going to exchange program I didn't want to go to the vet and like I my wife told me if I I really don't want to go on and watch football I Want to chill out Sunday night it was a great game on I'll go you'll have fun okay fine subsidies to German teachers\nTrying to have a conversation and thinking I don't know any German right what are you gonna do ... you know your voice [laughter] hell sampler you know [laughter] [noise]\nThey probably better than than we do structurally\nAnd um and I and I said so how are the electricity in Bulgaria because they're very has their lectures on Sunday was a very important election in Germany\nThat's the kind of guy and that's what I follow and well this one teacher was a teacher of politics so then we went down a rabbit hole two hours later at the dinner table we just we're just we're chewing up politics\nAnd when he was telling me about the very was is that is extremely successful economically it is the richest region of Germany for full employment like three percent unemployment youth unemployment is extremely low\nOr their school system is set up to get people to work straight away um if if you're like a tenth grade and you're not you don't really want to go to university you don't have to fake it to make it you can go right into a a a trade school with apprentice program and you're gonna get a job and you get a diploma so they get um really it's a very work intensive area they\nThey pride themselves culturally\nOn work and productivity an organization and good government\nRight there it was like a it's not like a shining example of how you would want to have a state where a region actually be everyone's employed there was a job you have any functions\nAh and it works well they had this major upset in the very end election Neal what are you upset about what\nWhat could you possibly be that concerned about that you basically blow up this and it was they blow it up but had his major upset in the ruling party that had been has been in control\nFor decades last probably the ... the ruling majority in Bavaria and it was stunning to me to realize that we're not immune from that here here in America so people say you know the economy Republicans are on the economy is going so great vote for us people don't vote on yesterday's news they don't vote on today's news\nThey vote on the future where are we going where what is going to be happening that's my fear that's my concern because well things are going well you know what Donald Trump got elected gasoline was about two twenty five a gallon now it's around two eighty a two thousand eight was four dollars a gallon or better but are we getting better are we getting worse\nYou know we hear the China news today about their economy is slowing down its growth rate of growth and that has a factor on the human psyche about how how's it going to manifest itself in my life you see these commercials\nThey're not all about you know skills and here's my dad says there about\nThis guy's off all she's horrible there ... there but there's no big overriding issue like here's what we're going to do in the future it's just that the other person is really bad therefore they're not going to be good for you um and therefore because he is going to say well they're gonna hurt the economy I guess is what they ... the subconscious\nBut I'm going what is the big driving issue other then obviously Donald Trump and it's a fascinating time in American politics are reasons why I Do what I did because it is so interesting but also to teach people\nAs I used to tell my my students I really don't care I really don't care [laughter] what you think I care that you think if I can encourage people to be more interested\nChallenge themselves they will in turn create a better outcome for the rest of us and I tell my students I don't care who you vote for I just care that you vote but if you don't vote understand that's also a vote\nIn itself because you were saying I'm not I'm not doing this I vote none of the above and it's and that's and that's tabulate in it'll aggregate itself just like a vote will and that people do that doesn't make any sense actually\nIt does if you don't show up for something the two political parties going to try to get you to show up next time we're trying to reach out to you in some way shape or form that data point will register I talked to a a a family I was at a baseball game with\nAnd they were so upset or I just can't stand voting and like they don't vote if they haven't earned your vote don't vote and tell them that you don't put it on social media like he would anyone else anything else say I'm not voting you haven't earned\nMy vote you haven't gotten me off my couch off my dogs to go down and say I'm voting for this person you don't register it'll aggregate data and that raw data collects and is dissected by the political class to determine what they want to do and there and that in every election that swings on the undecided voter right the independent\nVoter in October is like oh we're going to stop talking about these issues that motivate our base to a degree we're going to focus on these oh I'm really happy to work with the other side received this now and then certain cans I work with the president what shows up at the polling independence\nAnd they might not like President Trump but when they agree with something you'd better work with him to get 'cause that's just you know all politics is personal not just walk anyway this is Chris actually filling in for John credits if you tuned in to hear me drawing on\nAbout politicians who is this guy a I'm a former member of the house of delegates I'm filling in for John products as I Am wants to do a as John is on vacation with his son down in Florida in a baseball tournament a John is a baseball fan by looking as well but he was a pitcher in college and his son Joe Joes a picture\nOf you want to call and ask me some questions love to hear from you\nEight eight eight four five six four six eight eight four to five six\nFour six eight eight eight for eight oh five six or six or you can text me straight away five four zero to non for zero six zero five four zero\nTo nine four zero six eight zero I'm gonna have some great experts on later today Clinton kicked CRISPR Newport Jack Wilson for the Republican Party every congressman Rob Portman\nOr Dr Robyn McDougal for the Virginia Commonwealth University of wild her school and Jesse Harris from Iowa who's a political operative and uh as is on the Democratic side in from the Republican side from New Hampshire will hear from Mike Dennehy and Susan slacker or my good friend\nFrom the Central Valley uh we're I'm known citizen for you know gosh early nineties I think\nWhen I started dating yourself there's there isn't\nA Democrat a chair a chair of the Democratic party Virginia this from highland county ... county I used to represent\nAnd they've known Susan for for decades and so we have we have a great friendship and I and I'm looking forward to having all these callers calling today stir up the conversation a little big go a little deeper we're going deeper today in politics we're going to go deeper dive in not just you know the pope polling\nCalling and why are they calling because it's a very different\nWhen a university does\nA polling like CRISPR Newport you'll hear quitting to talk about this\nThey start with a very broad universe um and it keeps coming down to a smaller University of actual likely voters minutes and we'll get to that we're getting to the nitty gritty will still be able to get it take you do a deeper dive so when you look at the polls when he got like a real clear politics which\nWhich I spend unfortunately way too much time on 'em but I guess is healthier than other websites right [laughter]\nThis is a healthy Internet\nOf it as a a ... you look at these different polls and you go like let's just take a look at the uh\nThe polls on a generic ballot it's insane what are what they were looking at here pulled up its it's fascinating might generic ballot follow this track plus Democrats plus a Democrat suppose five Democrats plus a lot of\nDemocrats plus eleventh Democrats plus one what how do you get there\nThey say the polling is wrong well poems always right it's just data you're collecting other people who call what the differences isn't the methodologies who you're going I talked to one leading I'm\nDemocratic source and I said okay what's your polling showing me he said Democrats are around mid low thirties thirty four thirty three percent thirties that range Republicans\nWe've never seen self identification for Republicans is while it's around twenty four percent and what used to be you know thirty four\nThirty four is now thirty four twenty four and independents are up around the lower mid forties he goes Republicans have never been lower on self identification but we haven't picked up any of those voters they're all self identifying now as independents that\nIs huge and when you get down to it with people when they understand what's really going on that's when they get more excited more engaged this is Chris X. men selling for John Frederick it eight four five six for six states even come on back [noise]\nA what a what a blessing and it's just to be alive right to be able to\nAh just to be experienced at all and I'm Wondering is I I enjoy coming in during his radio show where they get to hopefully get people excited about politics um get the does governor lives it is important you know we can't break down we have to work with each other\nTo get good things that we should have the debate though we should have a vibrant vigorous debate that right moves the country forward\nUm and we shouldn't be afraid to have that debate but we should have in a in a civil manner and I think today we see it or a lack of civility more and more and that's difficult\nIn my professional life I Am the executive director Virginia free the foundation for research in economic education and are or were five and wants to be three see sex and we're not partisan which is a great lane to being\nOkay good for you well you know aren't you might not really I don't have to be actually I'm paid nachos [laughter] that's even better right oh yeah they get healthcare so\nYeah [laughter] what we did was we represent businesses and uh we have membership and we tried to do is educate them on politics and as a former teacher and a former business person in my family in a bottle water business for years old a couple of years ago\nA blessed with like um you know I I like getting people excited about learning about politics seeing it differently and what's that makes me do as aren't even deeper it's like you know when you when you go to teach the subject is better than other subjects you have to really get engaged in the subject\nSo it's an every day I get to learn more and more about politics it's it's a it's a deep interesting topic because it brings in culture\nAnd a economics and history that was a history major so I I get to bring down altogether because it manifest itself is Andrew Breitbart said in the last uh last segment you culture is down politics downstream of cultures so if you want to impact culture or the politics impact culture first and foremost suffer your cultural legal\nLeader you'll be you'll be a political leader give us a call a day and age four five six for six we got some great guest calling in today are not just congressman Rob Wittman but also the leaders of the two major parties here in Virginia posters quaint and kid and Robin McDougal and then two operatives one from Iowa\nAnd one from New Hampshire we're only I hate to say this because you're probably second tier the elections already in the midterms we are four hundred and Seventy two days away from the Iowa caucuses [noise]\nFour hundred and Seventy two now it seems like a long time but let's be honest as soon as this election is over you're going to start hearing reports back from Iowa and New Hampshire and we're going to be at the forefront of that we're going to get calls you ever get a chewed up there with us of operatives that Republican and Democrats\nTo see what's going on the ground I think Trump's got the lock on the nomination you never know\nYou never know you never know goodness knows you never know with Donald Trump because um that that that that's that's who knows who's actually does what he says it says you can do but you never know what's going to happen around him\nAnd I think that's one of the more interesting parts about politics today is because\nHe's brought that dynamic ... max and that sort of it was if you remember from your uh ... days in school or or at work you know when the leader changes and it's like a substitute teacher what's this going to be like your\nYou know you get an you're going to be bars or whether it's a it's there's there's the newness and from since June fifteenth of\nTwenty Fifteen this has been a very different political dynamic\nAre not necessarily unhealthy because it has made us think and react differently and respond differently and I don't think that's necessarily on healthy ah but we do have to be ever vigilant to make sure it does not become too unhealthy and I think people are recognizing that we have\nAh some some discourse in this country or that can be improved we can get better at that as a people and how we do that is every day one on one with each other if you want to impact politics if you want better representation be better people\nSort of comes down to um they represent us and if you want them to be better it's up to us to be better so I go to school\nI don't know what to do with these days the generic ballot what I pay attention to first and foremost that's what I checked every day I'm On the real clear politics they give you the um average of all the different polls and then they break down the individual polls\nI'm now polling should be looking at what are called Elvis likely voters polling companies should have an understanding of who they imagine are going to be showing up on election they should have a pretty good handle on may ... began in Virginia about a month ago so that we shouldn't know who's actually voting\nI'm In Virginia in or you can always tell my Arlington because they're the tabulation their uh their absentee ballots some friends of mine who are tracking that to see what kind of\nA who's voting relative to the last round of elections to see what the intensity is\nBut when you look at the er the averages of the generic ballot them this is why I Do this is why I Do that in twenty Seventeen\nWhen governor Ralph Northam defeated at Gillespie he won by eight point nine three percent a point nine three points the generic ballot on that day was nine point one if I'm trying to instruct the class\nWhat do you want to follow Fox News Reuters Rasmussen CNBC Emerson Maris Quinnipiac\nWilder pool poll a Christian Newport which one do you follow follow generic ballot right now because that it that is fairly proximity to what happened last year and the year before and twenty sixteen\nIf you look the generic ballot in twenty sixteen it was very close it was like tied\nAnd Republicans over performed on election day by about a point and they won and the generic congressional ballot I'm obviously Trump lost by about three points a nationally three million votes um so that's something to consider when you're saying okay we're just going to go I think\nI think the the objective view here is look at the generic ballot look at the average and you can pretty much extrapolate where it is right now\nIf election they were held today and because on that basis it it takes away the the partisan lines you might have or a would be inclined to\nIf at nine point one percent the dams won by eight point nine nine point one point nine that's very close\nAnd they are at seven point six right now it is safe to assume that they will not perform as well as they did in twenty Seventeen but still will win and likely when the house\nOf representatives given the the dynamics in the Senate very different because the individual races likely that Republicans a hold on to the Senate what's the dynamic that if the Democrats have the house and Senate Republicans have the Senate what's going to have the next two years and that's how you can sort of figure out\nWhere this thing is going so that you can understand what you need to do or not to like myself I don't watch cable news I don't watch broadcast news every papers in the mornings Washington Post ... times Wall Street journal and I get mine on information what's going on in the economy in politics and culture and whatnot\nAnd then leave it alone don't listen to you know the the uh the national\nI bet with my eyes I see what's going on and I think most voters do that if you look at the aggregate numbers of\nYou know the Fox news of the world and the MSNBC it's a very small subset of the American population but they're the they're they're the most active voters they are the ... they're the activists so those shows are pretty much you're broadcasting to the activists\nAbout what they want to hear about the all the messaging points that they're they they they're supposed to repeat so when you watch when you go to Facebook\nOr Twitter or Snapchat or Instagram or whatever they're very different social media platforms you see\n\nThe replica repetition of the message and you're like wow I I go to a town hall after I got like a congressional panel was from my friends you know if there was no Congress there were seat mate to my I watch them and take the questions from the audience is like where do you still get the information it's fundamentally wrong but they're really upset\nI mean angry not pleasant not understanding but what do they show up for do they show up because they're angry\nThey are concerned but more importantly like anyone else in the world they just want to be heard right how important is that in a conversation to hear what the other person is is really feeling and get down to okay what is up what what is what is making you got to say oh 'cause there's no no no no\nThat that's the operative subject matter [noise] what is triggering this fear and when you get down into the nuts and bolts you ... you really can't understand\nWhy people do what they do and hopefully get them to a better place than station life and it's not easy to do but it's a it's it's what we do it in a democracy in the Republican form a democracy which we have\nIn America thank God I'm so we can just live more peacefully amongst each other governors self self governance I think is really important historical and concept and I think we've lost sight of that a little bit it's easy to uh but more importantly it suffered for folks to point out to people that look we can do better\nYou can do better on down we got this I mean are are you have too many TV channels at night\nDo you have too many options are they are too many restaurants and grocery stores around you\nIs it too good are you afraid\nYou're gonna lose all this I mean it's it's crazy how good life isn't suburban

policy call and ask a question a date for eight oh five six for six or do they call them talking about his polling and of course are Newport university\nUm I think one of the most accurate or posting polling operations in the in the commonwealth and I think it's a great job Clinton they're\nRight here is hey Clinton how are you man I'm awake drug myself out of bed for this [laughter]\nRight and that's and that's what that's the campaigns they followed that means they follow you you look at the\nThe cross tabs in the in the polls and they go okay I've got a problem with um women between the ages of twenty five I'm forty five minutes don't go there on crime let's just say you know and then they structure their messages according to beef up or if they have high positives for for their opposition don't try to attack the tack to bring down deposits\nI'm getting people because of cell phones this is the question is extra short\nI we're not we're not having any more difficult at times and we had been having 'em in the years leading up to um today so Virginia is about two thirds cell phone mostly or cell phone only users\nAnd so our sample we we actually draw samples have cell phone numbers and so we do quotas on her cellphone versus landline sample\nSo we basically go into the field with about a two third one third cell phone landline split already\nUm and we haven't found our response rate on cell phones to be any different than it has been which is\nNot great um you know the people typically aren't taking cell\nPhone calls to do surveys like they were landline calls in the seventies to do surveys show we're not finding it any more difficult than we were already\nUm I Do have colleagues around the country who are finding cell phone number is being blocked more um and and it's driven by this um all of this fishing that's been going on with our cell phone numbers lately\nI Can't recall my phone number is recall from Idaho where I'm driving\nAnd we we do there are two things that we do to try to help us with that we're Dennis Hi ourselves as Chris rooting for university so we're not we're not an anonymous number or we're not\nI'm not listed number you'll see who we are when we call and then um if you say look put me on your do not call list will put you on argue not call list and we will call you back or we don't have to do that because\nYou know according to the federal regulations were doing research academic research for not working we're not getting paid to you know do this we're not making a profit so we're considered um researchers so we don't have to comply with they do not call with whom we do keep our own do not call list and if somebody says don't call me I don't want to do surveys\nThen we'll put them on our do not call it so we try to be transparent in that way as well\nWell that's fascinating because most people go oh yeah I'm On those on those do not call was to me they are because because you are academic nature around interesting so your turnout model is is showing forty to forty five percent that's interesting because people I talked to the campaigns are they're hoping is going to be around forty eight\nThat's so that's ah so it depends on who you talk to 'em it could be forty eight um it could be higher I mean so here's the real sort of question that I have in my head right so\nIf there is a big blue wave if there are a lot of voters that are engaged right now who didn't even vote in twenty Seventeen then we're missing them in our survey were not capturing that right and that some of the pushback I got back\nUm what do we want to put out our second district poll showing Taylor leading Luria\nSome Democrats push back and said well you're not even capturing some of the voters that were newly registering in and they're going to vote okay fair enough but we have the luxury in Virginia in in that we had a twenty Seventeen election that we think captured that surge pretty well it\nBy four percent first time a Democrat or one that district in about a decade\nSo we think we twenty Seventeen captured that surge pretty well but it may be even bigger than you can also Republicans\nMay have responded 'em by by engaging their base voters already know what you have done that we think we've captured them because they were already voters anyway um but if turnout is higher\nI think it's going to help you um I don't know that helps one party over the other all the way it might be helpful to Democrats because it might be that extra search that we might that might be a lot of new voters were not capturing\nSo you ... you you saw the surge I called the suburban tsunami twenty Seventeen you saw that you saw it coming in\nI think you had it and we all yeah we we were we\nWere modeling 'em in twenty Seventeen\nLike we are likely model this year a what we were doing a twenty Seventeen as we were we were modeling the same way but we're also looking for new the registered voters\n'em in twenty Seventeen because of that was that was that search that was the difference between\nTwenty sixteen twenty Seventeen was a lot of those new suburban voters um and so we did see the surgeon twenty Seventeen we all know what it looked like in Virginia and so there's nothing that says to me that that's going to be any less this year than it was in twenty Seventeen\nAnd there are things to say to me it might be a little bit bigger than it than it was one twenty Seventeen and by the way in twenty Seventeen the Republicans\nWere as engaged as as you would want them to be interest that Democrats were a little bit more engaged\nSo you think it might be even bigger this year\nIt very well could be I don't think it can be much bigger but it very well could be um Democrats in particular are trying to register new voters or they they were until the deadline and Republicans\nI'm work trying to register new voters as much as they were trying to mobilize their their base voters had already there so I mean look if both parties it's not likely to be because we don't have a really robust statewide race going on 'em and we have ... competitive congressional races some places and not at other places so\nSo that's part of the reason I'm thinking forty five um but if it ends up being forty eight it's because there were met and there's massive turnout\nGoing on and some of these really competitive congressional races um I don't know if you're a if you're if you're looking for a competitive statewide race to drive turnout we just don't have that this year and so that's part of the reason I'm hesitant to say it's going to go as high as forty eight\nBut look I can wrong many times I'm and all the wrong many times in the future\n[laughter] goodness knows that's that's a blessing we'll talk about the same ones not close\nClose um if I you know I did what I find interesting about the statewide races that um it's not close yet you see Tim Kaine campaigning in his ... his campaign campaigning as if it were close he's running ads on on every in every television network in in the commonwealth\nAnd I think there are two things going on I think Tim Kaine\nLeads to send a statement that I've moved beyond twenties sixteen um and and and sort of the difficulties of being the vice presidential candidate on the ticket and twenty sixteen but I think he's also recognizing that in some\nOf these are really close congressional races um if he can pull any coattails um if he can run out and he curtails\nIt could be really helpful to democratic candidates down ballot and so I think oddly enough Tim Kaine is running a campaign to get reelected to the U.S Senate and running several\nCongressional campaigns to elect Democrats um in in in some of these competitive races at the same time um and he doesn't really have a challenger that has a lot of money but Corey Stewart is all over local talk radio which is where his voters are going to be and so I think Korea sewers running\nThe kind of campaign that he needs to run to give voters out given um how difficult situation he hasn't had a little money is\nSo your state wide pulling that\nWe used we pulled the Senate race several times and then decided it wasn't going to be competitive enough support 'em throughout the final stretch from Labor Day on instead decided to pull these congressional races because\nReally for the first time in probably decades and Virginia if if if a hundred and some odd years we've got a lot of a lot of really competitive congressional races going on so we decided to pull the congressional races instead of continuing the pole what doesn't appear to be a very competitive Senate race\nBut we are we're wrapping up here in the segment with which the final call here on what the Senate race is going to look like in the day\nWell probably somewhere Fifteen Fifteen ashes my is where my ... I'm at right now it could be a little bit higher could be a little bit lower if it's a little bit lower it's going to\nSome of these congressional races are going to look really good for Republicans are going to be really tight if it's a if it's higher if it's closer to twenty than some of these democratic congressional candidates are going to have a better night I think\nFifty six fifty seven yeah anything moving a libertarian front making an impact at all\nNo in uh in in in we we anticipated they might given that that you know a lot of country club Republicans might not be interested in Corey Stewart but at the end of the day we're in we're in a very tribal period of our politics and if there's an hour by your name a lot of Republicans are going to just vote for that are and not actually give\n'em the libertarian their their vote so we don't see any uptick I'm I'm among libertarian candidates either state wide or\nIn these congressional races um there's a libertarian and attempt there's libertarian seven we're not seeing any uptick with either one of them\nOkay thanks Clinton kids were calling it was like an opportunity last a Libertarian Party they had a chance to to crack the crack the market here a little bit in Virginia they might have fallen short this is Chris ... filling in for the vacation and John ... come on back\nRepublican Party of Virginia jak our this morning I'm doing well crafted hope you're doing well let's learn third day this week we've seen each other I Know I think you're stalking me around stalking you haven't figured it out yeah let's not go there [laughter]\nYou're the elected got it right now so uh you know if you heard the last leg with Clinton kids from Christopher Newport or are you seeing anything different than what Dr kids seen out there\nWhen I heard that the that the back end of his um interview and I\nYeah I I sort of got the sense from the discussion that perhaps he'd seen more of a blue wave and I'm seeing I'm yeah I'm In in regular contact with all our congressional campaigns throughout the commonwealth and frankly most of them are doing really well um and\nI I Will be a surprise if it doesn't really come down to perhaps just two and a congressional districts being really in play when we get to the election night\nTo just to which too\nI think you know the seventh and the tens clearly are the two battlegrounds right now I think the other ones that perhaps people are looking at are the fast but I think Denver ragle man is clearly running a far superior campaign there and so I think Denver or\nWill it will be fine come election night on there have been some talk Scott Taylor's race scotch really working hard um I mean if perhaps we'll be closer than we otherwise would hope but I think at the end of the day Scott should be fine as well so\nThat's where it comes back down to Barbara Comstock in the hands um and Dave Brat in the seventh is the way I see at this point\nTo act as a conductor kid he didn't mention the Brad spanberger racing I live in a district I see it every day at least in western in Rico county and it was a stark difference in what's going on the ground at least but I I pulled back and try and do the objective follow the data\nYou follow the data that Clinton kids right in front of what you're saying\nOh the Taylor and ... are the ones that are most in point as far as you know changing I'm changing party right if they're accurate um you've got to tell my seven and Tom struck down by the state or nine times like that\nSo if that's consistent than his polling is accurate um it would probably show up if you if you're going to do one on bread spam or you know what I imagine that he would but what he also pointed out obviously the quality of the candidates important local issues are important but also what are you pointed out was he didn't see the big Kavanaugh kicker\nOr that everyone and I'm Talking about this is going to have this big search for Republicans or if it is it's pretty quiet people make up their mind just going to vote and as he said Republicans are show up in midterms\nAnd and I sort of see the latter I mean obviously when I'm looking at is saying that go the way I'm like\nDuring a prior to the to the judge now justice Kavanaugh hearings um there was some um perhaps apt to stay on the part of the Republican base\nUm but that changed almost immediately uh with those hearings and I think the Republican base in Virginia and I think the Republican base around the country saw what a Democratic majority in the United States Senate and the Democrat majority in the house of representatives\nIt's called for impeachment set a precedent investigations of justice Kavanaugh\nAnd so what I saw as a state party chair with a clear up tick in enthusiasm response or the emails fundraising jump significantly as a result of that\nAnd I'm as it's been said before somebody's going to write a check or send some money to the party or a candidate they're more likely going to vote for that person as well so it may not be showing up in the polls quite yet but I Believe\nThat there is a renewed enthusiasm they're clearly wasn't enthusiasm gap between the Republicans and the Democrats prior to the Kavanaugh hearings but I think that gap spin eliminated so now it's just a matter of turning our folks out\nSo you're seeing the enthusiasm ticket I talked to Morgan Griffith about a week and a half ago and he said the same things and you know it was a if you were doing the scale of one to ten ten being you know absolutely undermine showing up no matter what a he said you know Democrats were around Ninety and my folks around thirty said but my folks are now up around the\nUh so he he he sensed it and he felt that on the ground inclined told me the same thing or so from the anecdotal standpoint I Do think there's a renewed a fervor in the in the Republican base that quite frankly is getting a lot of what they want it in the last election as part of the hardest thing in politics you know\nYou know when you get what you want you show up right are you satisfied or you know you're fat and happy new stay home because things are going pretty well but what's the point uh but I think the the cabinet things sort of re energized refocused or at least the Republican base on uh wanting to come out and vote but you're seeing that throughout the state\nI Am and I and I think you know getting what I think folks realize you're right I mean are they got what they wanted and twenty sixteen\nWe have the president and acting tax cuts the economy's booming letter was unemployment and in decades and so there was a price on complacency in that but then I think now the Republican base seems\nAll that can get on done very quickly with the Democrats control the house and Senate and so I think Republicans are saying we've got to roll up our sleeves and if we want to keep what we've got we've got to go to the polls and vote for it\nUsually the cycle of politics right so what as the new chairman of the Republican Party in Virginia or what is the next step for our people worry all go and what should Republicans in Virginia but you only got\nBecause when you look at Virginia and Maryland you have to give to very strange electric you know a democratic Maryland with a Republican governor who looks like he's going to win three Fifteen and twenty points in Virginia which has been a battleground trending now towards a blue state\nTim Kaine couldn't get thinks he's going to win by Fifteen uppers probably maybe twenty points as well\nYou didn't really do have this dichotomy don't you across the Potomac we're we're the the the dynamics in politics are changing Massachusetts has a Republican governor\nWho's up pulling a the leading Democrats in the state you know Charlie Baker you have a governor a Republican governor of Illinois um is is is the ... other Republicans in Virginia sit right for the electric\nI I think what you're saying I obviously I don't know that in our current climate in Virginia whether any of the three candidates you mentioned governor Hogan and others would\nAnd and I and I've sort of sense to perhaps a more pragmatic approach among Republicans\nI'm again coming out of the Kavanaugh hearings um uh if somebody you know six months ago had mentioned you know Susan Collins and Lindsey Graham being I'm\nSort of a stalwarts of the Republican Party people to laugh but now I'm getting request is how can we bring Lindsey Graham in to speak in Virginia for candidates and and have him there and it's a feature speaker and places it's so\nI think the Kavanaugh hearings may have showers at what we need to do is have a broader based in the Republican Party that can bring conservatives to gather around core principles and perhaps uh if we agree on eighty percent of the issues we can disagree on the other twenty later on after we start winning again\n[laughter] again because look both parties are having their their uh Internet signed battles were I mean the Democrats have their own battles are Republicans are having their battles were going to have some posters\nAnd that pollsters are some operatives from Iowa New Hampshire calling in the nine o'clock hour should listen to that we have one calling in from a Democrat from Iowa Republican mantra is going to tell us what's going on there to the national caucuses because that's really what they are really\nOnly got ... I don't have time to worry about that I Do I just holding out for delegates to the state Senate up for reelection but there's nothing that worried about twenty twenty after we went in to preserve I bet you're already in the house and Senate next year in Virginia and\nGently push back here because the dominant theme in American politics is what's going on in Washington DC is being reflected back in in the states and in the local to the districts because Trump is the issue right now since\nSince June fifteenth of twenty Fifteen\nThat man has driven the conversation every day in American politics\nAnd if you know four hundred and Seventy two days away from from the Iowa caucuses people are going to be focusing on those issues but it's going to get very retail very quickly why all the Virginia races are going on and that's the beauty and the dynamic of Virginia politics isn't it because we are we are the polls\nWe take the temperature all the time\nWell that's exactly right and I think um for a congressional candidates this year I think last year gave them sort of a wake up call and they could say OK\nPerhaps around to roll up our sleeves and work much harder than we thought we were going to have to and so um you're right that this year will sort of perhaps give us a preview of what we can expect and twenty Nineteen but that will be a sort of a pulse of the of the country for as you say\nBecause we have the entire general assembly up\nThis time next year all one hundred and forty members of the district to the general assembly are going to be up for election\nAnd there's so many issues at play and and what Clinton kid was talking about what he's seeing in his polling is that quality candidates matter and local issues matter I got an email last night from a former colleague of mine\nTalking about Corey in northern Virginia and uh basically local development and he was engaged on also sends out emails on traffic patterns and potholes and I'm like this is not what you're doing the general assembly but if that's what the voters want they want someone talking about it right\nBut I I think that's right people are really looking for results from their elected officials and the things that are impacting most people today with a booming economy and job I'm stressed\nDaily basis trafficking holds up at northern Virginia as you said bottles and and and more rural areas of the country those are things that people are focused on now because their kitchen table issues are doing great", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Joe Walsh Show", "city": "Portsmouth", "day": "22"}
