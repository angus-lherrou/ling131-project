said\nAnd two thousand Nineteen okay this is going to be the open Mike our will be taking your phone calls for you know John for eight oh five six for six the boys are back in town let's start with bench or better than the caps\nI Know you were so excited about door to the caps game Wednesday night to see the flag\nOn for old world champion Stanley Cup tell us about the experience and Canada capturing the\n[noise] it was incredible and um [noise] I don't know how to put it into work then [noise] you know being a couch and my entire life and [noise] the amount of um English I think that all caps fans have have had over ... over that time\nUm and the number of times that we were right on the constant just couldn't couldn't make it and um it was a great night and a great ceremony and then seven nothing when and yes the cats can repeat I think that actually going to be better this year I think a cloud\nOf pessimism has been lifted from that team you know John one of the things that I can tell you the season ticket holder that was just so frustrating but you just couldn't break it was in the playoffs you know that that we have a great home ice advantage the yeah\nThe the entire year and the playoffs\nHappen over and over again\nWe're living in a fire right living in the big game and and and the whole the whole I\nMean it just um I've never seen an arena just skills so last year game seven against Pittsburgh in ... when we when we went out the ... in in twenty sixteen\nAnd um they went down one nothing and it was like you know one nothing and hockey is is not for nothing and and I mean it was like you're at a funeral that we already lost the game and they were there for a short hair\n[noise] right [noise] and and and and that's and now it's like it's lifted and and and you could feel the playoffs last year once we got through Pittsburgh it didn't matter if we went down in the game people could still believe in a team and the team could believe in itself I think I think that\nThat the caps in their history was Wayne on the players were they were believing when they went down a goal that they the games where you can play it and how they because the fans flavor\n'cause every everyone believes and once Pittsburgh got the last year everything changed you could be able to change their I'm Thomas he's taken hold on a season ticket holder we set up four sections away from each other sometimes each other and the Dunkin' Donuts line in between factions [noise]\nUm but um [noise] this is going to be a great era for the caps now I don't think this was the one thing I think that you look at who that's often is young I'm over in in his you know not in the mid mid thirties and it was thirty three thirty two [noise]\nUm [noise] he's gonna make a run a Gretzky for the most goals scored of all time the regular season is over six hundred Gretzky they Ninety four he's going to make a serious run it being the number one goal for an inch on history and the caps have an incredibly bright future um [noise]\nAnd I'll just end with saying that my dilemma right now I put a thousand dollars in the capital last year when the Stanley Cup in Las Vegas Fifteen to one\nWe want to in Vegas that the cash for tickets Fifteen thousand dollars when I catch the ticket the person at the counter told me the biggest payout she's ever paid at the sports book\nOr when people will take about like that and roll it over for two or three seasons and she said you know the caps three feet and you wrote this money over it'll be two million dollars by the time they have three ... so I'm Still having this dilemma for the rest of the season I have not\nDone anything with the money that because it may be that like you know it was just a thousand dollar additional investment I might need to roll it over a couple of times because I think the caps are legitimate threat not only to repeat this year to ... do you have to repeat\nI'm the only after all every year by year so that's my dilemma but I'm leaning towards the right now I actually think this team is a special team and one that um is going to have a lot of success going\nForward [noise] well uh\nI get what you're saying I bet the Astros last year to win the world series attended one as you know because you put to better than in for you and I in fact the ticket we did we didn't just to take it as\nYou have to know you know you gotta play where your ... your ... your strengths and it would be there I think a Ralph one uh [noise]\nI think [noise] one by twelve points twelve to Fifteen points I got an ear a in a [noise] blacks district in even more I think in ... district\nAnd uh you know the dynamics are changing in this and it's not just so much a matter of of Trump or anything that demographics in the state or changing and they're changing almost daily and\nAh it's obvious which way in Europe they're moving are we going to be like Maryland that we're not going to be like Maryland but we um northern Virginia is beginning to look more and more in northern Virginia suburbs more and more not totally but more and more like the Maryland suburbs\nNational it's not just reached out to be happening nationally and he's kind of various\nRight doesn't hit New Jersey suburb same things going on everywhere around us are separate but you're seeing this you're seeing is an awful lot and um [noise] I think we have an excellent chance\nAnd no question we're getting help from the guy in the White House whether it will be there or not you know uh I I was joking with Mark Warner and I said well we we need 'em they're just one more election [laughter] you know but I mean it's you know\nI'm a generally speaking we've done better [noise] generally speaking when there's been a Republican and the White House has it been exceptions yes\nGenerally speaking the Republicans have done better when the Democrats been in the White House have there been exceptions yes but the trend is there an unmistakable trend yeah I don't understand and I\nI Would be surprised if we didn't know you know get to Twenty one and the every election Adam minimum\nI think I I I tend to agree you know you still have to defend a couple of states like you got a couple of comments you got one over on the eastern shore that is in play I think Republicans can hold with the black sea if they don't have to buy I\nI think that he is far weaker today a it's an incumbent than probably anybody else to the extreme some personal proclivities and\nAnd and things that I think that hurts him among some of those voters we have some stronger candidates don't or black or and I don't know what happens there he's got a hundred and fifty thousand in the banks are like that it sounds like he's ready to go away very quickly but\nI Will do my wife's him and he got nowhere to hold on one of the phone and you want to go out to undefeated non diet if you could do that and they\nLost before in mountain when here and helped delegates any moves over the first district run for ...\n... very attractive candidate a you are but you've got some issue ... after the initial matrix where he has not really thinking or his voting record [noise]\nUm [noise] ah to that district and you've got the state house at fifty one forty nine and some redistricting that's critical happened many many I mean we have to wait and see but may work in the Democrats' favor the\nUm [noise] I mean it would appear that the judges are going to wind up drawing that their house district\nOf south eleven house districts [noise] and I think that's what whatever formula when they come up with that's going to also be what the Senate's going to have to abide by twenty Twenty one\nAnd uh it could change or you know or it could change an awful lot [noise]\nUm [noise] you know a part of the districts aren't unpacked not totally but below the numbers I mean look what Bobby Scott I'm In his district one from what fifty some fifty six percent down to\nYou know low forties and I'm a [noise] you know produced another democratic district so you're gonna have to see how that plays out but it seems to me that uh the judges drawing that district is by far and away their their best bet\nAnd if they do you know the Supreme Court I think it ruled before the gerrymandering as is has been constitutionally permissible until it spills over and racial discrimination\nAnd therein lies the problem and that's what the Republicans are facing there and it's going to change its going to change the way you know\nA whole makeup of legislatures around the country are going to court for a five to four court will view this differently lots of other points and they don't take it back if I may be wrong but I think when they sent it back to the lower court it was like seven to initially\nWell I I just think one of the thing is you got to understand the Republican base for better for worse is migrated from that country club in the country and in so doing they taking never sell out of some competitive districts where these were economic issues Republican it'd be very viable [noise]\nSo it's not just the demographics ignore the fact that they have changed the emphasis on issues in ways that help them in South West Virginia but but it hurts them in growing parts of the state\nCan we talk about the ... and also with a very popular governor with very low negative\nAnd you look at ... numbers ... support amongst Democrats was not popular among Republicans was more polarizing in numbers Ralph Northam has incredibly low negative\nFor somebody in this environment you look nationally\nUm he has very high positive very low negatives um and in going into these competitive seats [noise]\nUm I remember in ... eleven and Democrats drew the state Senate lines and they lost the majority and who is that the person who was in every Republican ... flipping seats with Bob McDonnell a popular governor can play a big role mask and\nI don't care how you slice of the national environment plays Baltimore\nBut you have to have a messenger more healthier especially when you're turning out the Thomas writes the the I mean it that that national same ways very heavily you know which is why you had you know the the patterns that you've had\nUntil McCarthy Cuccinelli I mean you know what happened for almost fifty year I'm gonna I mean I've been here about the surveys like let's take for example that started in the disturbance seat was not driven by national politics and twenty fifth and it was driven by local politics in Chesterfield versus Richmond and I'd like to be democratic\nUm and I think that we and we probably if we'd have more or less if Canada but we don't have we done and it's in campaigns don't matter I don't think we had to I don't think we integrate messenger there I think if we run that same race than twenty Nineteen\nAnd you had Ralph Northam auntie\nI'm In that district Ralph with what they're not going to be as they are they going to vote the votes that stardom and it's chaos is going to create problems for them\nYou know I think that's a greater problem is that he's he's he's not harmonious with the district on some of those hot button issue or just say they're like Robert ... been a good governor I think it's a wonderful man but he gives a fireside chat and the fire goes down you put him on\nTV it it it's not the same kind of rally the team but he's an asset that every I mean they just didn't have to use that I don't know what I did not it is that's the kind of governor you actually need this and he picked up not a fiery picked up Fifteen seats\nI mean I think in terms of color in his diary and I'm at a carnival Barker one end and he doesn't he didn't pick up the flavor up north I'm dead\nWrong north and been picked him up Trump picked\nHim up for him yet if Trump would have been president and twenty Fifteen we'd be in ...\nAlright look I don't know I don't want to do on Ralph Northam disagree however I think he's been pretty much just stayed\nCame a color for my three points and rapper with them on by eight and ... picked up the receipts and picked up by point difference was not a fifteenth well friends who are either but it was also hotel different let me tell you that\nThe White House ... Frank about Trump okay I was a driving factor show last November on top of that um [noise] you had a ... and spilled over into everything [noise]\nAnd keep in mind Gillespie was not true but you know\nI mean he was very polarized [noise] but um I just think people keep underestimating as governor oh oh I don't think anybody underestimating [noise]\nI don't think anybody under estimates him but they know it was I mean you know what's driving politics in Virginia right now and it's not a Ralph [noise] ah it's it's what's going on across the Potomac River [noise]\nIt's it's ... driving politics on both sides right now Iran and the one thing about Robert and he doesn't that many negative [noise] doesn't have any ... he's a very likely Austin immigrant\nOr not you know I've now go you know been knocking on doors since may I have not gotten one negative comment about brown non and that's it\nNot be the policies you know I I agree with that is an asset but he's not a fire eater and that gets my vote out for\nYou know I I think Tom Davis was on a fire leader that got to put up for the Republicans that for Twenty years\nEvery single Republican Lippi she would have thought the person was married to Tom Davis because the Republican candidate had his picture bigger than their own picture with a quote from him saying like here's like it'd be great for your time sometimes from Beijing um so I mean having a messenger is important and Democrats are not had good but I started that course is the first time in a\nMargaret ... either I agree but now he's taken on income but that was not entirely different that\nI don't know I tell you what man I I'm a joke joke kind of Peter ... you guys are under estimating or see and I'm telling you\nWhat he had a disastrous press conference I wasn't there and it was a disaster of all time so he had a disastrous press conference that really hurt him all kinds of underhanded things going on\nBut you know after that\nMorsi's mayor and [noise] you know the the thing about Joe is he's an independent thinker he's got to do with their own way uh you know he's not\nA he's not holding onto any of the establishment caucuses or anything\nI think he's gonna play very well in that district and I think a lot of his friends there that I don't think that he got screwed by what they did to him and and take\nAdvantage of Morsi did the smartest thing I've ever seen anyone doing politics when he won the ... I think it was ... he won mceachin the on each and moved up I think\nAnd in that primary people and think he was going to win that primary crowded field anyone in a landslide networks people are asking what did he do he went around and after he knocked on doors at you know and I wrote a handwritten note every voter he spoke to\nThe data that for a week and a half before the election in the context that that he had remembered the conversation\n... kept these postcards for six months and send them all out ten days before the election with a handwritten note from him talking about how their conversation and you know I met your dog sham or you're a teacher here and I remember that conversation and you know hope I can count on your support next Tuesday and\nPeople came out in droves I mean for him to do do that though and I I I see people read postcards but I've never seen one posting them to make it appears that month later okay well tell me that I'm Tom Davis does everything better than anyone in politics libraries but [noise] but he did that to anyone in a landslide and like it's\nBeen done before it ... no I don't underestimate Joe I'm just saying take on incumbent in a district like that is if it's appeal\nIt's going to just to I'm not an expert on that's the big difference you know if we had you know there's a whole lot of people have gotten in the journal stomach because we don't have run on purpose in the state a whole lot [noise] and and you won't have that you'll just have to people when they're [noise]\nAnd she's well why [noise] I don't think I if I had the gas and I think until they're on whether or not live in that district and I guess that route dams has extremely low name id pardon\nI Would guess that route dance with extremely low name id and that if you tested there Jim or she has our name id not to say the Powell Hi I'm just ... but like in terms of I'd name id\nRichard Nixon had on any money\n[laughter] you know like I don't think rises like real superstar the kind of\nBack on you know Joe and I know Joe rather than it's got to get out out work something like Fifteen or twenty to one okay Joe was out there knocking on doors and making phone calls now will just in\nBetween the tax law primary too in that primary like Dick was independent district for Twenty years before I got drawn to the ... has a concept of campaigning and knocking on doors and doing the things that you do when you're in a competitive political right\nSeventy percent of the vote in my district against Mondale yeah\nRock that's never been a personalized sum for every Confederate says she's never been in a matter of you guys actually perform\nAnd she's got to get out work I'm a joke that outward courteous fight Joe he ... he got out worker and\nThe other thing nearly as a human do they get I'm telling you he was going\nTo get a sip it clear that sympathy vote out there for the fact that the power banks enrichment screwed this guy out if it's a livelihood\nAnd that's that's real and he got screwed I mean what he did to pull us long life it looked senator Stanley told me the whole thing is I ... it was blown it okay [laughter] what happened there was a total bologna\nAnd it was because uh it was it was big cars ... challenged the Richmond system that's what happens that's why they pulled him and so I just don't remember\nThat like you know there are a lot of people in that area that have and and this is the loyalty the gym or see the reason he does well there's a lot of people there that is represented and when families\nHave had a time of need you know the attorney they went to the criminal defense attorney to help out someone in their family reunion was Joe Morsi and that created the level of loyalty he has a big ... I'm not ready to call this one one way or the other yet\nBut um he has a real base [noise] it's it's across that district from being an attorney I'm\nIn the same way that Donald McEachin you know when he when he ran rubber on his running you know him as a primary challenge of what three times to incumbent twice twice as the challenger don't come a delegate it's been one to the challenge is going to come and senator\nAnd mceachin was the guy who everyone news on TV it was a lawyer um he had to help so many people in that community it didn't matter that even the challenger to encompass um that's how they knew how much they thought he was into right and and ...\nShe's been the guy who's defending their ... year there's time um you know against major charges that area he's one of the top defense attorneys there so I'm just I I think that it's an interesting race than in ... we got to see you know will rise even run again we don't\nLet me look ahead to twenty twenty won the governorship or when it comes comes through a lot of um determine who's the White House is using that dynamic and go on but when north um goes well the attorney general Montana governor clashes that who else is looking at this point in the Democratic process you are on\nI mean [noise] you know our name pops up now on that Perry Yellen was not out of the picture either I don't know I Would imagine if you're on the of course but I Would I Would hope that herring in Fairfax thanks for delta or not the contest nomination but [noise]\nWhen you got a lot of people in the back looking for upward mobility to get the mayor of Richmond in the bar stony you've got some other religions him getting her yellow sitting there on you'll have a primary\nAnd you'll just see if it's a [noise]\nA successful can be dangerous and you can only I think he's only a [noise]\nAs long as you don't have a two way right [noise] a majority in Fairfax area and uh I think that it's a it's them if it's one of them\nAgainst the whole batch of other people when [noise] uh you know the Fairfax\nYou're carrying somebody outside I like you guys are talking about herring and a Fairfax you're not talking about large stony who was absolutely going to do something he was the other person you're not talking about\nWho can pull the upset in a two or three person race and that's ...

know what is your ... nobody's talking about taking away the guide liberty and putting them in jail that's a that's a different issue than it is you know everybody's out to Republicans\nAnd that Trump would put up somebody can come come out and say he did something to me forty years ago I have no evidence no corroboration and that's the\nI didn't say something that's in sexual assault which is an entirely different issue and you've got to put yourself in the context of the time and the place and back then in the Nineteen eighties wasn't some people can't afford\nIt don't they don't come for nearly as much today about it they should but they back then when I was in high school and I kind of think people in\nYou you didn't hear about the broader look a sheen but extremely credible I'm just very emotional ... and and I do think that I think that taking that extra week going back and interviewing some of the people more judge and others around it I think it was was the right thing I think slam dunk in the spring or the day after her would have been\nTerrible politics and would have been terrible I mean\nHaving said that nobody else can remember the party was there how she I mean there's just too many holes to really make the case that doesn't mean she's wrong [noise] but but that's a tough standard for the future you know anybody can come forward and say anything\nTo say that but this is a way to go back within six days and remember after she testified Chris Wallace from Fox News and the president to talked about how\nCredible she was an old public operatives protects the everybody right after she testified this is done it's over cheese toast and then seven days later oh Rob act where we weren't amazing to me how fast the world changes but back to what we're talking about before\nFifteen I Want to say now that now he's up by fire say no but I saw a poll last week that I'm a fair thing that's ... that's got all the polls you read when they're asking you to do a lot I Know he's certainly a he's not a question\nAbout by you under fifty he's well into well under shift and I and I think what you gotta remember in this in if he ... his independent she's in Seoul ... I think this is for him this this changes the outcome I think it's right\nYeah I I Can't I ... and I'm not an expert on West Virginia but it seems meet Joe Manchin told position that I'm an independent guy I'm not beholden to either side and uh\nI think it would be hard for him to get reelected it would seem to me in a what a Trump when the date by like fifty points something like that\nAnd I'm not on also not convinced and Susan Collins is going to run again either and that that that that I think it's well\nI'm not ... but she says she never voted against the Supreme Court judge ever you have any group in the state to the ... billion dollars up to like get ... votes against million men\nYeah okay now it's up to a million and a half ago find me but then it looks like a bribe but I'm I mean I think at the end of the day without corroboration she's going to be there for ... for which he or she I agree with you not only twenty twenty twenty is she going to run again well should make that decision the appropriate time [noise]\nI I think I think Tom now that I think she is going to vote yes on the one that I have no read on the top Davis is I'm Lisa Murkowski of Alaska what about what about you [noise]\nPretty independent I mean just remember this when she lost a primary to Joe Miller the last Republican primary she run as a\nWrite in with the name Murkowski matter where you get started and ended up and also as you want to laugh but you know make the part about the independents pieces when you guys mentioned when it's because they claim they're they're reelect in terms of looking out for their state right mhm and Murkowski has a big issue with the Kavanaugh opinion about Alaskan natives I think was something that you know like when she ...\nShe she she does on on that issue so now it's not clear cut I haven't seen the polling in Alaska or the but the I think if you get ... like I think you're going to get flaky voted him out of committee but I think without some crap ration Jeff Jeff is fundamentally very conserved right\nNow you got to be a little more research to he's also very independent and I think a very principled guy which is why people think he's flaky because he doesn't always stay in one boxing\nIsn't always predictable but this judged if you've got to understand for Republicans this unites us this this will be very important vote on the court or as it is on the Democrats on the other side a wanting somebody else\nCan I ask a question has a has a a vice president were broken a tie\nOn a Supreme Court nomination knocking on where here I think that would be unprecedented out what each [noise] what's that ... and then we'll challenge that but it's still count how do you know that it just sort of thing a competition just as inviting can set and there's got to be no\n... already on the president's than any votes but he's not a number\nI can tell you the satellites okay you're a lot for here in the states that are not Virginia not much in the office\nAnd if he's confirmed that they're going to go and they take over the house or the Senate to move to impeach that would\nBe a disaster in two thirds of the Senate good luck\nYes I'd just like I think the ... and I'm\nOf elections have consequences that's what I take away but here's ... let's get some Republicans stealing Supreme Court says well I say I mean all of a more profit from one here's the problem I still can't get over the fact that Trump won two years later you still can't get over ... I'm\nNot married Garland well let me let me talk on immigration I think might bite every indication is a very honorable straightforward would have been a good Supreme Court judge in in the traditional sense with these balance not completely a liberal democratic operate before he wanted to win bench but but met the criteria for a for a judge\nBut what is better not holding a hearing on them are doing what they've known in this case and that it's bringing in putting the sham of of hearing him and then finding a way to trashes reputation and voting no they weren't there to confirm it it was ... [noise] it Republican senators were confirmed school we used to eat and putting on a more liberal members just wasn't going to happen\nIn a presidential politics here not a mentor who who who knows what the rules are writing about it but I didn't hear the president it's the president United States to nominate somebody for the frame court out the senator by right set right\nSo therefore I think McConnell's argument out when he says look a that was a presidential election year like voters\nBy it that ... but I'm just saying that they stretch it each time I don't know who started it but it keeps getting worse and worse and worse\nAnd once you do it for one year you could do it two years you could do it three years I I don't know there aren't any guard rails long enough so they can they moved it from sixty votes to fifty votes for everything but the Supreme Court of course they're going to do it for the Supreme Court has me there are new guard rails anymore and this and that's what's scary\nAre not going to you again it's actually you're from a DJ Republican operative in Virginia Beach if there is such a thing DJ Joe mansion is only apply for\nIn the latest Fox poll as of a two days ago I applied for not Fifteen so Scott needs to what chickens email is what one of our listeners setting for eight hours\nA day they have gotten another email on that let me check chops got another emailer\nThe point is your factory town of waiting on\nBreitbart spores that must be well that is part and said I just got to Glenn yells at eight or what's his name Beto is destroying Ted Cruz\nThey know is not going to win that we're with Tom tom David how we can track or something from northern Virginia and new games just favorites congressman ever\nWe've got ... Peterson is with us we're at jeopardy this world headquarters here\nCity and Scott surveillance state senator from northern Virginia Democrat and part of democratic leadership I'm\nNot part of the ... on a fairly but there is a role for saying that if you challenged or if you if you challenge the godfather of anybody\nI think he's seen a seven eleven awhile real clear politics average one man's right now nine points for well that's a far cry from Fifteen oh here's one plus twelve Thirteen or Fifteen minutes and plus when I was\nI mean here's a here's a has been consistently had I think he's got I'll give you I'll give you that and I think\nBut I think a no vote here changes the dynamic there was a poll earlier before all this controversy or that showed that if he voted against all certainly numbers change on\nThis ... I don't dispute the fact that the numbers would change a\nBut from my perspective I think having a confirmation to is probably in terms of the Democratic enthusiasm probably five to ten sheets maybe a Senate seat or two I mean well I think it helps in the house and her team because when it's brought on very red territory North Dakota\nUh Missouri I mean these are pretty solid state West Virginia\nIn the Senate race since Kavanaugh thinking silk\nRepublic or wherever we're where we're at a time for a couple of guys and finally our news but one thing I\nThink Tom now there's\nThis is the only thing I've seen in since Trump announced that has a unified Republican so I've never seen anything like this we couldn't figure out how to do it we're going to talk about\nI said Fifteen I was it was twelve point for when I went back and actually look at the\nImage of the cabinet discussion yeah I Want to go ahead what do you want to go ahead and that but that we got to get the foot foot football hockey Bogart go ahead\nOh well we in fact last night among the winter and the Senate Judiciary committee the official account of the Senate Judiciary committee is tweeting about Democrats do not understand the definition of ... thing\nI Would be a Senate Judiciary account\nThis thing is so off the rails and and and I feel like\nYou know people were completely missing the point with all this process crap\nYou know the reason the Judiciary Committee is tweeting that the Democrats have the definition Ronald book it's our process and none of it is actually on where people are on it and where voters are on on this is the Kavanaugh only has the support of the conservative base\nAnd the message that women are getting around the country is that you know people are OK with sexual assault\nNo I think that that is that the reason\nThat the measures they're they're they're getting it you're now a pronounced\nWrongdoing or joining it it'll it'll medicine nobody I mean this is the same democratic\nParty to defend that Bill Clinton better tactics accused him of rights especially the one that got raped well\nFirst of all first of all I was I went to the ... the allegation\nOf rape against Bill Clinton which which you'd be dead actually\nA week after on national television that whole process is so when you say the Democratic party rallied around him or whatever that delegation wants to be out there at the time I Will say second thing is fear\nThat was why he lied and said\nIf you're talking about John Webb power Jones are different than ... then that was not rape I just got through how judges will ensure cast was we had to really cannot\nAfter that was ever catch one interview was a week after the Senate in the Senate about that you had to sequence Kevin really was the same time it's ... [noise] I think you're thinking about\nThe arms around me the money to buy abroad when I first when I was in the first thing you were not retaliation anyway the point [laughter]\nThe message that women are getting around the country is that this is okay and Republicans are now into a debate about the definition of ... I mean to have a trend and doubled struggle I mean it is a this was on the official Senate district ... look everybody knows what Butina\nArt or not but you have to first of all I don't know what I'm\nSaying is Butina is inserting drugs in your ... instead of taking down your throat because your body will process it faster and you're going to Iraq as you mentioned that I learned during the
