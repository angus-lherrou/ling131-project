right back I mean when you when you miss the ph thing I think was a around\nThe end of the third quarter of the game was Twenty one twenty or at home I'd put it usually been Twenty one Twenty one

Maxine Waters Debbie Wasserman Schultz ... it it just it's just very odd to me that are like half of these people aren't even argument involved now I just find that\nOdd I find it I just uh the whole thing is a odd to me let me leave it at that it's just odd happening or eleven\nDays before the midterms the FBI now investigating the potentially destructive to the vices of course we don't know if they were actually set to go off either we have pictures of them but um none of the devices thank God discovered this\nWeek exploded and no one was harmed so\nThank the lord for that these six inch long package Bob's each other battery\nContaining powder and broken glass were constructed from a PVC pipe and covered with black tape this is what we learned from a law enforcement uh\nAssociated Press the white powder in the package set the CNN was tested and determined to be basically baby powder harmless sort of white powder was harmless they um it's not really determine right\nNow if these bombs could have actually got off a\nThe FBI intercepted the packages for Obama Clinton and the Soros before they were received now anybody that does what it is what the other if they didn't know that you can't get to a bomber Clinton or Trump or anybody in this nature because uh\nThey have Secret Service protection and everything is screened before it ever reaches them\nSo that seems to me the package forever colder was forwarded to return address where the offices of Debbie Wasserman Schultz in Florida\nPackage for bread and that was that the CNN resulted in the evacuation of cable Josh headquarters in New York City leading to the surreal scene of bankers and journalists reporting on the breaking news event from the street\nAnd uh\nThe FBI says it's possible that other packages were male to other locations that are still in the mail string the makeshift bombs are going undergoing test inspection at the FBI Laboratory in Quantico, Virginia the associated\nPress reported that the trailer clues are are eventually going to lead to that would be bomber and a course of time and get that's not good now speaking in the East Room yesterday President Trump condemned the axe\nOr threats or political wild and called for unity as his audience to two apart\n\nAnd he said that in these times when you have to unify we have to come together and said one very clear very strong unmistakable message that acts of threats of political wild so they have no place in the United states of America that coming from President Trump\n\nThat was it made it Lincoln damaged by Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer who then turned around and I said it was an insufficient response [noise] let me read it again in these times we have to unify of course a Hillary Clinton said you can't unify until the Democrats went\nThat's what you said a week ago\nApparently the Democrats thought that the president's message of unification and coming together to send a very clear strong unmistakable message that acts or threats of political violence of any I'd have no place in the in the United states obviously they are\nThe ... statement it said it was insufficient and that he was part of the problem you had eight other democratic operative coming on TV last evening who said that uh all of this\nHe said you could uh basically get rich by following the president's Twitter me see this is the Democrats\nAre trying to take advantage of what could have been a horrible situation or maybe not because of the Terminator bombs could actually have gone off we don't know like the powers that to CNN\nWas baby powder so we actually know that the bombs had the potential\nTo go off and they could have harm someone who works out but we don't know we don't know anything only knows what we know so let's wait until the FBI if they're being honest about it I mean we were now questioning the FBI but if they're being\nHonest about it well let's wait until they give them their report\nThe Washington\nPost reports that Republican leaders were very quick to condemn package bombs that the rest of the politicians officials or news media later on a campaign rally last night in Wisconsin [noise] I'm Sorry I had a campaign\nRally in uh Wisconsin President Trump's message of common\nPurpose shifted to criticism of the Democrats and the media Trump said people should not mob people in public spaces seems like a pretty reasonable statement to me and that the\nPress has a responsibility to set a civil town that stopped the animals hostilities in constant negative and they get taxed
