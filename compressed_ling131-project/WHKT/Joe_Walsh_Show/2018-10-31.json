its\nBecause the Trump Administration has put the Saudis at\nThe centerpiece of their Middle Eastern policies they also want to remember the Saudis and getting the Palestinians to the table when

Democratic\nSide of the aisle because the um relationship that Donald Trump parents with the Saudis and has always been was always put that on our presidents but the relationship is corking his foreign policies or he wants to use them as a a profit for a partner against the expansion of Iranian chair\nAnd I'm a there are many people that would like to see that scale they would like to see

them which is ... billions and billions hundreds of billions\nOf dollars in their any American Jobs that are dependent upon that real people\nReal families will lead real livings now I have a whole different take on this thing melons mentioned this this is\nMy take this was not simply the silo scene of a journalist it wasn't a journalist to begin with you didn't go to journalism school it wasn't an official columnist I Know what to do this to be a columnist he was just a commentator or will columnist for the\nCall him once or twice a week come hell or high water\nIt was a ... a commentator there's not an issue about a commentator who the Saudis didn't like his opinion as being put to death then as soon as your cloak and dagger stuff this is by counter\nSpy ropes fire has nothing to do with killing the journalists because of the strongest didn't like what they were saying what he was saying this fellow at one time was very close to the Saudis he knew the secrets of the Saudis he was part of their networks you went broke they found\nOut that certain things that turkey and Qatar or enemies or the Saudi Arabians they were they now have certain secrets I kept wondering where did they find out this stuff this was a guy who at one time was close to the Saudis part of their inner circle eat went rogue and what you have here is your own fashion\nCloak and dagger counter spying double agents happens\nBoth countries don't have a time when you're a rogue spying in your country finds out that you're revealing certain information to enemies you're gone\nI Am sure this happens in the\nWhole forty times a month they discovered some world major it's not going to do it from the silencing of journalists that has to do with getting rid of an agent who was provided information Saudi Arabia's and that means it's ...\nYeah but you have the rabbi sparrow it was done in a very stupid way to do it in in a in a conflict and the guy who lived in the United states in embassies are supposed to be a you know it's neutral\nNBS isn't confidence I think he's arrogant I think he's incompetent and I think he's going to be tougher to do business with because everything that guy is touched rap like everything everything is touched his father put him in charge has blown up in his face the Yemeni civil war complete disaster\nHe kidnapped the Olympics on prime minister two weeks after the guy was in the White House or\nNot like he did a tour with the gang of four blow up in his face that's a total disaster now discover up I mean that everything that guy just I mean sometimes you just have to say hey you think he's confident and\nConfidence and and and the arrogance bad combo I mean if they wanted to get rid of this guy I Would think that they could have been\nDone other wait let me ask you this wide thing intense interest here by the president fertile fertile won what's his what's his play here rabbi\nWell here's a competition right now with Saudi Arabia he wants to be the head of the Islamic world you know at one time for turkey is at one time that was the Ottoman Empire and the Ottoman Empire um was the leader of the Arab Muslim\nWorld for fourteen hundred about World War one and he'd like to restore about two to turkey is competition\nTo Saudi Arabia in a way it's also Iran right now Iran is his thank God because of President Trump's economic waning are still involved in terrorism or their their\nTheir power is waning so this was a competition between ... who wants to be king of el ... as opposed to Saudi Arabia Saudi Arabia says none of the leaders of the Arab world because ... is in Saudi Arabia\nSo that's what that's about so whatever arrogant can do to them and the rest of the Saudis worldwide whatever he can and be able to walk\nThrough the relationship between Saudi Arabia the states is in his adventure zoom scissors ambitious interest at what's happening [noise]\nAll right well turkey\nAnd Qatar versus Saudi Arabia for who's gonna leaves in the Arab world\nWell we're we're going to see how it plays out um\nI don't think crown prince Mohammed and solemn and I think eventually his father team is going to happen to make a decision here I'll probably easier to be a positive one because I'm\nJust Camp Six and confidence and he's embarrassing administration and he's a virus so Jared Kushner and uh the world's most handled this thing is just it's it's really job I mean I Can't what you're saying\nAbout this happens all the time but it doesn't happen in an embassy and number to cover up and then it goes on for two weeks and then he changed his story ten times an hour or\nYou know it's an international crisis and they did that to themselves I mean\nEar exactly correct or not it happens was surprised but that doesn't happen minimum embassies in the way they did it the way with the proper size and the foolish cover up a it was there are so amateurs and barbaric\nAnd really dumb Robert Shapiro is in order to

Bush went to his father what's the neo cons\nHave tried they are part of the ... into a set of communication between the two ah Bush said to ah\nThey routed kinda depending on cotton Bush said are pushing it says can I ask a question what the mayor calling and the father says do you want names are description and\nThe president says I'll take a description and he says I get into and won what Israel which is interesting on all levels including the confirmation that all president doesn't really need to read the newspapers\nExplain what you mean when you say that and how do you know the conversation ... ...\nWell I called really say who told me but I ... it's someone who was I have absolute confidence and soaked in that I'm a type of telling the truth and also in that position to be aware of this conversation\nDenver a\nThat was Leslie Coburn husband uh now now here's injected himself and his campaign made fun of your military service and things of that nature so he's now open water 'em and he's also the author\nOf the fourth or dangerously liaisons with his wife your point of running for Congress or does that sound a bit and say some medic or is it just me\nYeah I mean you know for for for this um\nIt seems like since I wrote the book for one thing that I noticed when I when I listen to something read something when I Do any type of analysis you consider the source and this is the same thing that they get in there but also they had some sources that would say you know like you just he just said there at the end\nThat um he he had somebody can say the name of it was but it was somebody right and that's what they even getting their book like that anonymous letter from Nineteen eighty four and it just seems like there's this there's this willingness\nOr again this this whole thing that always comes back to the anti Israel juice it it just always sort of swings back around this way and I'm and I sort of scratch my head that that's his even taken seriously by anyone about what's been said either on C SPAN\nThe books that they broke or even the fact that they have real issues with with Twitter like with me\nBut also with things like you just heard I mean it just sounds\nIt just sounds crazy and uh you know and I've been so careful in the last couple of weeks we've been trying to move back you know just make sure its policy because we'd been personally attacked so much\nUm but it just seems to me that they have a real issue with Israel and only a real issue with Israel they have a real issue with sourcing and they have a real a real love\nOf conspiracy theories and it just seems like this is sort of the M O O O since dangerous liaison or even before that because you know their history will ease and free markets either so it's just a very interesting thing you need to hear\nYou know this lack of sourcing it always goes back to anti Israel and the sort of bizarre thing of destroying everybody personally by you know by implying that George W. Bush was stupid or that somebody\nActually would tell him what's going on the conversation between Bush Bush senior it's ludicrous\nActually that's where I Want to it's just\nThat it is and but it it seems to me whenever you pick something up on these people it gets back to answering Israel anti Semite anti or anti\nShooting always assumed that the only factor always\nAlways it always it always rolls back around that wherever you did it it was really the question you know about you know what's in it that's where he wanted to go back to was Israel and and to me that that was the whole basis of what he wanted to get to not just that George W. Bush you know had a issues with one knowing what a neo Cobb was or not the fact that they had a source that he can obviously\nTalked about which seems to be what happens when all the way back to this anti Israel thing and it was just you get to the point you're just you shake your head and you had enough and I think most people most people realize what's going on there aren't a\nI'm going to run a couple of other clubs here from over and I want to get your reaction to here's one she did a radio show obviously they will not do mine [laughter] but they did a radio show and the er visits per carrier pride in Murray where\nAre they they asked her Bryant asked her about her negative comments on making fun of your military service let's run that I Want to get your reaction to this like a military service cuts to\nThe to your husband Andrew posted on Twitter is only talking about Mr ... risking money power snorkeling off Diego Garcia a cheap shot his service in the air force I mean do you do not come in\nYou know\nI I I got it there I think that that we'd all get back\nIn and serving that's kind of I think I served it as well as internalize so I'm having spent I found a lot of time in Afghanistan I mean I think it's important to recognize that it was so but I think you know where you're at it that\nWay why people actually care about hitting the strength\nBring into question your military service and I mean\nI don't think being a journalist says the same thing is trying to plan invasions of what is up for this lady\n[laughter] it's so funny you ask the question is in her idiotic or commercial came on where I was joking about to get another job extremist shutting off each [laughter]\nAnd has about Halloween costume on there and has marchers you know going through Charlottesville um they're just so out of touch and they're so absolutely have no idea what they're thinking about because they actually\nDon't live here I mean this is this is really what we get down to the root of this is that okay let's let's just demeans somebody like they just did with George W. Bush ledge demeaning\nChange the subject and then say something that's completely\nLitter fresh that that is a this is the whole progressive left game\nPlan also it's just over and over and over again that that the district doesn't care about it amazing amount of veterans in the district they know who I Am the fact that somebody would tweak something like that means or out of touch elitist has no clue what's going on in the real world and sometimes I get angry\nAbout you know it because you're just sort of looking at the school and are you really saying is that nobody cares about that and argue upgrading journalism to my veteran status or you're waiting you being a journalist to people that have to serve you look over their shoulders\nAre kids are frying on the flight line while you're getting on a plane where your order to do things where you don't get a chance to be in the Green Zone surrounded by people write that are protecting us or you can do a story and you can leave any time\nThere is it's a false equivalency and and it's it it actually in crisis type of cognitive dissonance that you can't even\nReally get your arms around because you know I could\nI can say anything to make anything on the new job but the fact that that she would sit on a radio show ... ... and and say hey God bless her she she's just defending her husband's\nBorder with her husband did become set up to my face you know if you if you know everybody hides behind glitter and social media and that's the thing that we have the day social media has created\nSort of this this this mob of passive aggressive measures that the only thing they can do is try to slant attracted to leap things very quickly you know if it doesn't go right or they're not getting the right you know sort of mixed on that", "show_name": "Joe Walsh Show", "year": "2018", "city": "Portsmouth", "day": "31"}
