America there's one Godzilla the truth and that to me it's great to have you with us today with a fake news resulted again with state polls coming at you all over the place they make these pulled up to\nI just I don't know that some crazy person is doing it but it just seems offering odd to me\nHere's the thing is the Democrats the Schumer is the the whole crowd that whole mob over there there were screaming\nWe must have the FBI investigate before we can vote on Kavanaugh there must be a full investigation before we can vote on him before we can decide whether he should uh be you know the sense of the Supreme Court by\nThe same object saying we must have an investigation before we can let that happen [noise]\nThey're not even waiting for the FBI to investigate where the bombs are coming from before they start blaming President Trump declared President Trump guilty responsible for the whole thing they're not waiting for the FBI to investigate these are the same people that three weeks ago\nSaid we cannot do anything until the FBI finishes its investigation so I mean they were total hypocrites it it is absolutely ear responsible or beyond counterproductive it's it's absolutely you're responsible for them to be saying this is all about because of the President Trump\nUh they're they're trying to they're they're trying to score political points off this which\nYou have to ask who benefits from these bombs that's all I'm not saying who did it it it's obviously some crazy person because no sane person sends bombs or fake bombs through the mail we don't know if the bonds real are fake or\nThey emptied out some firecrackers put it in a in a in a toilet paper two and a a attached to a digital watch to to make it look like the scary thing we don't all the time it's easy to scare people what can I tell you\nWe don't know and I'm not going to go down that road where I can say is whoever did it is crazy in one way or another whether they're sort of a fire bleed can be committed to an institution crazy or just the they've got a screw loose you don't do that kind of the norm\nPat Buchanan has a column out today very makes the point that when John Kennedy was assassinated Lee Harvey Oswald who defected to the Soviet Union was pro Cuba\nOr he was found to be the shooter a yet who got blamed for the John birth society and all the conservatives so\nThis is not the first time that the guilt by association or let's let let's slammed the conservative let's blame everything on conservatives not the first time it's been done before we even know who actually sent these packages so\nIt's a everybody's got to calm down and take a breath and ah I think Sarah Sanders had it right we should be coming together the president is calling for unity dialing down the rhetoric\nAnd the Democrats are going in the opposite direction they're they're they're blaming the president unequivocal he no question about it taking no responsibility whatsoever\nFor calling the guy look at the sky Brennan the president's guilty of trees or what's the what's the penalty for treason death\nHe's basically a former head of the CIA had been out they're calling for the president to be hung by the neck until dead and this is not considered inflammatory rhetoric or it's\nIt it's disgusting the whole thing is just just hypocritical if people go down as the all time greatest hypocrites\nJust ask you something a ... I think you make a great analogy on the depression and that's how the Democrats who cried and screen than wind about Kavanaugh\nNot getting the FBI not investigating everything I mean why don't we just wait here I mean the FBI seems to be holding again in southern Florida they're going to come up with a report pretty so we're we're we're going to find out the answer the why not just wait\nExactly how about everybody say calm down let's we got we we have the FBI on the case unless this guy was a or gal or or or ... or whatever [laughter] whatever entity it was\nThat created these packages unless that entity was a very very very sophisticated person or a boat and by it and if they were very sophisticated they were able to cover their tracks\nBut considering the number of packages delivered to these various places coming out uh one place\nAnd there are a lot of clues there and I'm confident that the FBI will be able to figure something out here and find out who did it or narrow it down and the fact that they use Debbie Wasserman Schultz as a return address\nThat's kind of interesting in itself Debbie Wasserman Schultz was the one who was forced to step down from head of the Democratic National Committee a big cause she had been reading the system for Hillary against Bernie I don't know what that means\nThat was funny to use her name out all these bombs I don't know uh but my point is is that unless this was a very sophisticated operation that they knew\nHow to cover their tracks at every step of the way you've got twelve packages now that the FBI is investigating it let's wait for the FBI to figure this out to come up with something yeah why not wait before you start\nA ... and why not why are they not waiting because they want to politicize at least the Democrats are missing no opportunity to score political points on this\nWell it's uh it seems it seems odd to me that that all this is happening but let's wait I mean that's where everybody's saying let's wait any time let's get to let's get the the economy will get to the Taliban invasion after the bottom of the hour a\nBut let's get to the new economic numbers that just came out the gross\nDomestic product GDP growing another three and a half percent now let me just say what this means right that's the first time that we have had\nBack to back quarters or in a very long time of of of over three and a half percent growth factor back and consumer confidence uh up at an all time high consumer spending was four percent another\nGreat a quarter of\nEconomic growth this is more bad news for them they don't want to talk about this that they don't want to talk about the economy or jobs or the growth so what did they talk about\nAh they talk about all they talk about they've got this wonderful thing to talk about it was horrible thing to talk about here with the with the bombs and they talk about the president again they're falling in they don't realize they're falling into a trap and and it's their own traffic crop of their own making\nPeople don't want to hear the Democrats talk about the president they want to hear Democrats or Republicans the politicians in Washington talk about what they're what the politicians are going to do for them to make their life better write\nWhat I I I go to work every day I got a family to support I got a job up I'd like to get a raise what are you going to do to make that happen how are we going to make my life better easier make me rich uh make make make my kids you know healthier talking about President Trump talking about you're\nA Native American DNA doesn't do that [laughter]\nI Would do that\nAbout President Trump are causing the bomb scare doesn't do that so they are going back to the for the last two years all they've been talking about as President Trump is is a Russian agent and now they're President Trump as a Russian agent who Craig creates bomb scares I mean\nThey're they're they're not doing themselves any favors\nBy the end and on the other side I mean it burns very clear jobs not mobs a President Trump and the Trump Administration have created the best economic ...\nTen Twenty years\nAnd that is a long way that\nAnswers peoples' questions what have you done for me lately we've gotten me a job you've gotten your raise you've gotten my kids or food stamps gotten my kids out of the basement there on their own now great thank you very much\nSomething [noise] or I'm going to pose this question and then you're going to answer when it gets back so stay with us for another part of the hour but I'm\nAsking when you get you know where Trump Tower for the last two weeks of the joke sealed is almost like a huge blow all over again I mean [laughter]\nI mean I could shut my eyes go back on the scene and it's the same thing you know at least they pulled out and everybody else Trump couldn't when it was all it was all you know whatever it was that he was going through at the time with the Access Hollywood that we're going to be right back I'll go way\n\nComing out of the towns coming out of the farms\nComing to vote for Trump didn't never voted before and uh so yeah there is a feeling of deja vu here all of these national generic ballot polls are meaningless national election\nOther they're all like I mean it's all the calls I I've been talking all day about the Washington Post poll that came out\nYesterday that shows Jennifer ... and they had a Barbara Comstock urging is tense district like Thirteen look like that might when she said she's a favorite no doubt that's a very tough district for Republicans to win barbers\nEvery internal poll that the Republicans have from the White House to the end or the scene to Barbara\nDown shows the race does not have a Thirteen points but this is what the Washington Post jobs they get a uh\nThey get a ridiculous methodology to get our state polls get a fake analysis of it to do things news to get a fake inclusion drawn so they can continue on with their fake narrative and like we've already put down this path so now I'm going to start calling them on how ridiculous it isn't there doubling down it's the same\nNow that's why the way you want that John triggers radio network I\nAm your Godzilla of the truth in America where eleven days out to the biggest midterm election ever Curtis Ellis is with us She's a senior policy adviser for America first policies this segment brought you buy the job creators network you know folks I've been saying this is about turnout\nAnd Kurdish just said the same thing the upcoming election dimensions may be the most support you've ever seen a lot of their ballot besides your candidate your tax cuts are on the ballot the American economy grew in another three and a half percent on the ballot are great\nCutbacks are renaissance that's on the ballot too so wars on about your jobs are on the\nBallot your jobs that they just kind of moved out of the basement that's on the ballot your race\nYeah that's about it and here's the biggest issue on the ballot eleven days who's in charge of America's future politicians and corrupt the collapse and the deep state in Washington DC or you know if you want to preserve the victories of the past two years I'm urging you've got to get involved this November\nYeah I Know you've got to vote yes I Know you've got to do early voting I Know that I can count on you for that but you got to do more go to pick the choice the elections dot com think Joyce elections out chop they'll make it easier for you to get involved you can make calls you can send emails you can send text you knock on doors\nYou're too shy to do that okay you can take a neighbor to the polls I don't have a car trouble you might make the coffee there's all kinds\nOf things that you can do what you got to get about big choice election dot\nCom because the only way you lose in two thousand Eighteen is if you don't show up and you don't work if you turn out and\nVolunteer you're going to go to big joined she let what election dot com every vote matters big choice election dot com junior part don't get out work by the other guys in out of every six good a big choice election dot com this message pay for an authorized\nBy the job creators network we want to welcome all of our listeners on the brand new talk station in West Rick Richmond and groups on counting W. J. fattening whatever point slide apps and\nStay with us who who starts a talk show talking all new things every it's closer to doubt we started with counter Trent where's it just ruptures after many Curtis just to come talk show Morsi can't wait for that\nHe's I tend to down Tuesday and friday the fighting Joe ... show where with Curtis Ellis a senior advisor America for his policies Chris looks into the caravan\nGet with a caravan marching home I ... the bombs were there they're going to bomb rushed the border it's a bummer I Want to\nSay one more thing about the uh about the election before and you just said it's about turnout and that's what this is all about you got the polls you got all this nonsense polls you've got this that\nIt's about identifying voters sometimes pockets of twenty five voters here fifty voters they're Seventy five voters they're a hundred there distinct pockets of voters that are\nOn our side in identifying them and getting them out to the polls that's what this was going to come down to that's when it's coming down to\nThe Republican National committee and others are doing a great job of that and uh that's what's going to determine this uh as much as older probably more than all the ads\nAnd everything else so I encourage everyone to go out and vote and bring your friends and if they're going to vote for the other side don't bring them in cutting\nHome pretty much in the air out of their tires I don't know you don't do that we don't do that and we do\nWe look if you're if you have a democratic neighbor and they're going to go do all the way down and they came to the polls you don't have\nRide give them a right to the point\nEverybody that as an opportunity to vote yet I'm Out and get them a couple of coffee because at the end of this you're still your neighbor\nThat's right neighbors are still Americans were in this together folks right here in this together\nAnd you know what you can disagree and not getting that you have to oh good okay acted Mandela\nCaravan now that what the air out of the towers there that's a good idea\nBut [laughter] but the Taliban is very different because I didn't think okay how do we stop it\n\nHow do we stop it don't let them in the country don't let them in the country there to gain the ... they're trying to they're going to try to game the system once they set foot on American soil they claim asylum there they've all been taught to say the words credible fear they have credible fear\nCredible fear what credible if you're not getting a job credible fear of having to live off mangoes and bananas\nA rather than a food stamps and welfare\nA so once they get to the United states is set foot on American soil and say the words credible fear they didn't qualify for that triggers the whole asylum seeking procedure and once they're in mashed and the trial um seeking procedure\nAll of the interlocking court cases and ruins and judges by these deep state judges say you can't hold them you can't detain them you have to release them and give them a date to appear and they never appeared they disappear they just disappear\nInto the woodwork they get hired by corrupt big business bosses want cheap labor\nThey get sheltered by a corrupt sentimental is who think all the lights invite the entire world to live in America that's going to do everybody a great big favor\nAnd it just becomes a big mess so the way to stop them to not let them into the United states in the first place to stop them at the border build the wall\nBelow the wall literally and figuratively President Trump is sending up to a thousand troops deploying the military on the border that's\nWhat the military is supposed to do defend our country and if we're going to defend the country in Afghanistan to defend the country in Iraq and defend the country in Djibouti where we have troops\nHow about we defend the country in Tijuana in Mexico the Mexican border and in Texas\nThat's right in San Diego and everything else we need to build his wall and the president determined he says I'm going to stop this because I think the president Curtis understands I'm I'm all of a sudden it's time here but I think you understand understand that is Fifteen thousand today\nIf they get and tomorrow it's going to be a hundred and fifty thousand and then\nOne point five million because it's just one thing that you said to me a while back that really uh was riveting and then I got to take off you said that you said your four billion people in the world that all want to\nCome to the United states so you might as well let them all then\nAnd then you don't have a country you have a land mass\nThat's basically it I might have time to\nThink Curtis also being with us John took his radio networks\nOne hundred

Saudis have changed their story temp jobs did they change again yesterday and they'll change it again tomorrow\nAs more facts come out so I\nDon't understand what they're saying the president has changes because you have a position he's waiting for the fact that President Trump is not a politician he's a businessman here's all businessmen make decisions facts numbers spreadsheets and math so as the facts come in\nAnd the mathematical equation gets put together his commentary evolves as information changes that is what are you supposed to do the end of the day I don't know what the final outcome\nOf the U.S reaction is going to be but I'm just saying this all week in the middle middle Middle East on TV this president does it take well to being lied to and\nI don't think there's any doubt crown prince Mohammed bin Solomon lights all I don't think that goes over well with President Trump he doesn't like being lied to here's the other\nThing doesn't like dealing with it competent people doesn't have a lot of patients I'm telling you crown prince\nMohammed bin Salman is incompetent everything the guy at thirty three years old has gotten involved in has been\nA complete undone mitigated disaster for the Saudi kingdom so eventually the father just has to say you know what my son is going to top it bubbling fool and I got to put somebody else\nWe'll be king because he does stupid stopped in promoting this assassination allegedly\n\nThe Saudis have now ... I guess our final story they're saying but that's kind of change again so who knows what the uh to showcase has\nHere's what is it is really brought renewed focus to the Saudi Emirates tactics and the support that we're giving them and getting involved in the Yemen's civil\nWar which is causing a horrific it's very disturbing very growing humanitarian\nCrisis where I can tell you this um on outages here every day I see the pictures you do say because uh the fake news networks today they don't want to show your real news they want to talk about\nYou know President Trump Stormy Daniels or whatever they do but I\nI see the pictures on TV and I'm and it'll really tear out your stomach you've got children just starving I mean they can't they they got mother's stripping park for trees bark and boiling it just matching it up so there's\nSomething and that's and that's in the summer reading graft I mean there's no food I mean just think about having your child is sitting there and they started that we think about how that feels mentioning this thing is\nIs a horror show it is worse than the area it's worse than anything I've seen\nAnd our involvement in it\nIs shameful and it's absolutely shameful and if there's anything to try to monitor to show your fair or\nWe're going to get the hell out of there as we should end it just it it's horrific that the United states is involved in something of this nature\nAll because you know we've got the Iranian bogeyman with their Nineteen speed boats or whatever they have like let's get the phone lines Mike in Oakland Europe you're on the air Mike\nHey good morning John yep I agree with you on the up and saying I think you're exactly right about that so I'm I like you know that comes out with this for anything good could come out of this thing I Would be good but [noise]\nI have to point out though the irony\nOr in something you said just a few minutes ago I'm sure you didn't pick up on it because you don't agree but uh you know you said the president or the two things he doesn't like he doesn't like to be lied to and he doesn't like incompetent and I I Can't help but think he must be just once all that to him so [laughter]\nYou surely likes to lie to us and I feel that he's in competing for the job so he just doesn't want to share those two things with others [noise]\nI guess uh I guess you'd say just tremendous economic renaissance and there's full make tremendous economy we have an all these jobs I guess you think that's the you\nKick kicked out of the majority of their caliphate and they they not only can troll a tiny part of terror story yet when he took over it was a massive I get you think that's the topic\nIs I guess you think the fact that\nThe wacko and North Korea has not done a nuclear test and see\nThem I guess you'd say that's competing I guess you think all these new jobs we have in the fact that we just keep going up in the confidence and there's a tax cut and you figured that confident so I guess your nice definition of incompetence Mike\n... is just a little bit different\n\nI guess uh some of those things happen at all but certain notch\nOr\nAutomate or we don't want someone who is in the mission what kind of this and we were at the end right now you are right now that\nYou know what I thank you for straightening yeah its economy Obama leaves office\nIs plenty wages are Rob savings jobs there are people are moving out of the things that kids have jobs everything is out there it's all because of a bar owner you for pointing that out don't\nCome

a premeditated murder this guy got chopped up and uh\nBasically got out of there and some kind of doggie bags and the very end of the garden or something the whole thing is just a horrible situation but look a\nCrown prince Mohammed bin Salman the administration's been a lot of things in the sky that Jared Kushner has\nAnd a lot of people are saying\nYou know maybe this guy's just incompetent capable of\nRunning the country everything touches turns to crap whether it's the Yemeni civil war that's a disaster the gang of poor embargo against the state of Qatar that backfired and blew up in their face to towards better off today than they were now he's got this thing where they changed their story nighttimes what are we do hear\nWhat John as you point out it's clear that a joke he was brutally murdered it's clear that it was premeditated it's clear that ah that I think the crown prince knew about that a NPs Mohammed bin Salman a\nDay I think have a lot to answer for and I think they have to be held accountable so I Do think that there has to be significant a penalties that they suffer I Do think to the question has to be asked\nIs like just the United states believes that it can carry on a continued relationship with Saudi Arabia which I Do think we need to be with the crown prince I I think that's a pretty compelling question I think the administration is going to have to ask that I\nThink Congress will eventually addressed that an aspect to you know what will be the penalties are to uh\nTo Saudi Arabia I listen I understand the impact of those of those contracts for what we're doing just supply a military uh equipment to Saudi Arabia\nI think Saudi Arabia I can be a like a a force on that is is a is a is an ally gosh end up in the middle east but I don't think that it can it can be that type of ally that we wanted that we need to you if this is ...\nStand by our in our allies have to have to abide by those and I just don't see Saudi Arabia doing that you know you you point out the issue with Yemen too and you and\nI have talked about that before a those are all questions I think that come out and how we see Saudi Arabia operating in the region house policies being played out and these are are they are they doing the same mass hysteria in that region\nOr that create stability and that and that\nAre working in the in the best interest of all involved not just Saudi Arabia but ah other allies in the middle east and listen I I I understand what they're doing that to push back against the uranium but are are they doing things that in the long term\nMoving in the middle east at the right direction I think those are questions that we have to ask or foreign policy standpoint and I think that U.S policy toward Saudi Arabia you know needs to be directed by those I think very a very sobering issues that we have a for us\nSo it seems like congressman Whitman ah we're in total agreement and it seems like what you're saying is the best way to solve this is a four crown prince MPs will hammered that solving to maybe a step aside for someone else had his father for somebody else in their final question I\nOnly have half a minute and I got to get your website out so very quickly um is there going to be a vote in Congress on our involvement in the Yemeni civil war and backing the Saudi Emirates coalition yes or no\nI'm John I I I Can't can't predict that because I don't know where the discussion is going to go over with Saudi Arabia but I Would say that it won't it will be part of the debate in Congress about what our policy is I Wish Saudi Arabia and conflict there and you haven't\nGot to go more information Rob Portman dot com\nRob Wittman dark out early voting has started in Virginia you get out and get involved go to

Godzilla of the truth in America boy that nonsense that's going on in the everyday got um people like to eat with hosts like if he were they just get up every day they read the paper you got the big image he got fake\nPolls what we did a big poll yesterday from the Washington Post is unbelievable I mean the Washington Post like what are they going to learn like they don't want to work people say well what are they going to change a pony methodology to get it right never because they don't want to get it right because it's not about\nIt accurate poll it's about the poll driving fake news to get a fake narrative draw the conclusion that's all it is it's all why\nThe Washington Post actually putting out a poll yesterday actually putting out a poll showing Barbara Comstock trailing Jennifer ... than in the ... district by Thirteen points now there is no way that watched\nOn top stocked every internal poll that his pay four and a lot of money\nShows this race a dead heat or Comstock slightly ahead and the Washington Post has got cops are down by Thirteen just to take complete and\nUtter lie energy on fake news it it is and it's beyond the onion it's beyond the national Enquirer what they tried or do they have Tom starts so much they want that seem so bad\nThey want the liberal do nothing Jennifer watched it in there so bad they can taste it they want their left is in that seat so much that they\nActually conducted poll make things up\nDoing in such a way to get results that they want so they could put\nIt out there and say the races over don't give tops any money and don't work for her it's a lost cause so they do a fake poll\nIn order to do things now it's unbelievable nobody in that district is going to look you in the eye and say that they think that general Washington as a third gene point lead this race is tied\nAnd I think Tom's started is going to win but otherwise you're opposed to care do not own up to any of this uh neither one of the New York times or ABC News or read anything\nOr MSNBC or any of the polling companies that right there who were the fake news and that's what they are so it's it's fake it's\nFake news network and it's designed to drive in conclusion to make you not want to do anything to help her\nIf you're in the ... district go volunteer for complex she is going to win this race if you get out\nHer but they live on a daily basis and that's why the president says it's fake news editor he says it's an enemy of the people when you why did the people and masquerading as a legitimate news network with a legitimate poll is that not\nAn enemy how would you define that this poll for the poster so astronaut that even watched them most staunchest supporters\nThink it's a joke because they know it's not true so what are we just let me just ask you a question\nIf they're putting out purposely putting out the information driving it so that the snake is that not an enemy of the people it's certainly an hey it's an enemy the truth maybe the president needs to change one work\nIt's an enemy the truth it's certainly an enemy of fact\nIt is unbelievable they're doing it again they didn't do as a sixteen and they're doing it again they were\nNot think do you know what the Democrats have learned nothing from two thousand sixteen the Lakers the media has learned nothing in fact what they're doing now is they can't believe they were wrong and so they're doubling down and here's the thing if the Republicans joke\nTo to watch is in a row going all aimed for the Democrats and losing them vote on a federal level will become irrelevant this restriction of them are so high that will become a relative that\nI Am\nBecause I certainly tell you the truth good data rubbery\nThere'll be relevant they are doubling and
