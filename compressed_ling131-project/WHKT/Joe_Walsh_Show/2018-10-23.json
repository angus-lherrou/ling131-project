holding out the possibility of prisoners\nI Hope is gone but [noise] I think our position is still\nLet's take this one step at a time we need a full accounting\nAnd then when you accountability and as editor of the editorial page at the Washington Post that's what I'm focused on the nature of which I'm all one I mean that's the other part of this you know he was no enemy of Saudi Arabia or he wasn't anybody's enemy\nHe was a journalist doing his job\nYou know spark open debate about important issues he was a patriot\nHe won in the right thing for Saudi Arabia he was even rooting for the crown prince to succeed in his reforms he had these ambitions in dreams summer which we shared here at the Washington Post ... expand the platform uh for voice is a particularly in\nOr about Saudi Arabia in the middle east\nOr to allow for the kind of open debate which he felt those countries are entitled to in people there want but their governments don't allow so I think there's a a last hotbed if that's what it is which\nYou know now kind of read like a final will and testament was not that it was a a mission statement on for what he thought the region needed and and what he still hooked to do\nHere's what we know from all walks into that conflict on October second and he didn't walk out the Saudis to know what happened so the idea that we need days and days of investigation uh and forensic work and it's ridiculous just tell us what happened and\nIn my opinion I you know United States government that was committed to the values that we should be standing up for what you're saying that\nWe wouldn't be sending people over the smile next to the crown prince we wouldn't be raising ridiculous series about road operators we were just saying we need the facts\nAnd we need them yesterday\nAnd then we can figure out what the right policy at the post in our global opinion section we are dedicated to I'm the same thing that your mom is dedicated to which is\nProviding a forum for a range of voices\nUm that can debate each other and have ideological diversity and you know particularly if we can do that or for people who are living in countries where the governments don't allow their own press to do it [noise]\nUm that was demolished vision for the middle east is why we've translated some of his teachers in our editorials into Arabic it's widely transferred some some ... cases into Turkish you know I'm sure a\nWe will redouble our efforts in that direction and and you know we will always have them all in our mind as we do it\nKnow when you hear that music on the

Sorry that's not enough\nWell I'm voting that's not enough either got a lot of work to do because look you know and I know and everybody knows that off year midterm elections are about one thing showing up\nAnd early voting sides show that this mid term there's going to be a record turnout is I'm not even going to be comparative to\nAnything we've ever had record numbers of people are coming both sides of the other way you got to get involved in this election the most important ever in the mid term\nI can assure you that we're going to follow the facts\nExperiencing received a

eight feet ticket you can follow her on Twitter at act project and\nAct present project K real great to have you with us\nI think to be with you\nExperience or versed in America than you on what's going on with the Taliban that people coming up through Mexico from Guatemala to get into the United states\nIllegally basically ... some of their nose at old laws many people like me to see this as an invasion\nWe don't know who makes up to seven thousand terror of an elite we know there's people that are there for economic these we also don't know what the bad actors that might be better than their why should we doing this or do\nWe should immediately deployed a military our border and make sure not to even the one of them get into the border I get into the United states look all we know that a part of the people and the caravan members of has a lot for example middle Easterners or are\nWe all are very aware that the law has major operation centers within South America\nTo train people learn how to go to the United states look I Want to go out to anybody who wants to come to America we have to do is make your way to Mexico pay some money to the drug cartels and you'll be smuggled into the United states and this has been going on for decades\nAnd no one president before President Trump has basically put he put down whether they are Republican or Democrat I mean this is happening under Bush\nIs what's happening under Obama this what's happening under Clinton and just got worse especially under the Obama years so we know right now is that they are operating within that caravan\nFrom ah people from the middle east who are ... within that caravan trying to get into the United states there are many actors are trying to get into the United states who are involved in putting together in this caravan including people from within the United states from political party within the United states\nBasically creating this whole problem right before the election for any purpose\nBut the American public is not done by the American public is waking up and the American public and behind it presidents\nWho is committed to putting America First and doing everything he can to ensure that America remains protected unsafe and you know what John in a way this is good this is happening before this very important election where I'm heading do\nBecause when they're doing and if you will not be conservative\nAnd ... and freedom loving Americans who love this country who are concerned about this country and not just talking about Republicans or conservatives I'm Talking about independence I'm Talking about these people\nAre seeing bits and thinking okay we can understand about helping some people who need help you know here and there you know maybe a hundred here on a hunger there\nBut the caravan upon caravan over a thousand seven thousand this caravan it's coming you cannot control your country and allow open border with this type of gas coming into the country\nRegime let's get to what you said earlier I only get two things to determine coming over and the president saying look if Mexico there\nIt really banking on the Mexican authorities to stop them in the event the joke and I think it's fifty fifty right now whether they're going to be able to do that\nIf they get to the border and the president does deploy the men the military and he said he would whether the national guard or not closing the border\nUm waters that risk that becomes another PR disaster for Trump and the Republicans like changes when we went to the euro tolerance policy how do we deal with that\nLook at little jumped mobilized the base for Trump those who care about the country there probably are not mayor\nLooking paints us anyway that left dates\nOn the left does not want secure borders left wants open borders bring everybody in here and give them I'm given shelter and giving them free it's free that as a matter of freebies and let the rich pay for it you know what that that is all that's not identify with the American public anymore\nThey they are the ones on the left friends in the one that's making it screaming and yelling but in the last election the presidential election and twenty sixteen thought I for one thing is that the decent American people who care about America be America which was written by our founding fathers\nI Want to change it would be really wants to take your borders they want one language they want the economy how can we have a better economy if we're going to have people like this coming into the country when you get used to be John you mentioned my new book arise\nI Know my book cries because I wanted Americans to understand what's at stake and I'm going to run a little bit of no with you about what illegal immigration is due to the country and I shared these numbers in my book I rise\nAnd eleven billion dollars to twenty two billion dollars a year is spent on welfare illegal criminal aliens by state

secretary of state Mike Pompeo on the show you fair which is just it's just a total mess and um we're going to get to collect for here Mike here's the president\nSaying that it certainly looks as though missing Saudi journalist your mouth shut your dad and the president actually understand very upset by other line\nTo name like why are you know who cares and it doesn't matter what his Muslim Brotherhood and he was an operative and maybe it's a conspiracy and maybe it was a set up and don't believe the Turkish government\nBut you have to really understand that's why it to me and you have to understand what's going on here and uh Sean Spicer said the same thing day brat said the same thing\nOr this is a slap in the face to President Trump and you're just sort of spice or an hour ago who was there in Saudi Arabia when the president made his first trip and chose to go to Saudi Arabia is his first trip in order to build a relationship\nThat they basically took for granted and put the president that would have very awkward position and so it was a trust issue and the problem with NBS says he's thirty three years old see this is why you have a law in the United states like like you can't be president until you're thirty five\nPercent of the kid is thirty three years old Jared Kushner is thirty three years old that's why you can't be president who you're thirty five you you know you're just as a maturity issue\nAnd you know what they did and they're sending these operatives in somebody coming out with a look at life look alike wearing his clothes sending it ate a U.S sending a at a uh for I think Dr flying I mean there were the bones saw\nI mean it's crazy stuff man it's crazy stuff to do in a conflict I mean they they knew this guy he had an appointment to go in and get his paper work done and they chop them up and little pieces and\nYou know sort of the best and the Turks say they're going to have the evidence of this and it's you know the person is not happy and so you know before you just jump to conclusions like oh you know doesn't matter\nDoes it matter he's dead he's that it's not and it's not a jury is not a journalist it's just that\nYou know this is that much by their arms it's got nothing to do that there's there's they embarrass the president on the world stage they embarrass them and they\nFurther embarrassed them by telling you that ridiculous story about he was in a fight and then right after that the Turks released video\nOf somebody coming out this close so they ... like again because the president said well this could be credible and then a day later that's proved to be\nFalse so they lied to the president and embarrassment publicly again and so what is the president what\nIs Trump supposed to do now say oh well you know he was Muslim Brotherhood so it's okay\nTo how we talking about can't do it and there's he's going to take action but this\nPresident or President Trump is going to send a message that you know what a if you're going to have this level of disregard for our relationship or for the United states I don't take action it's simple doesn't mean we have to\nDisrupt the relationship or not be an ally or\nCancel a hundred and fifty five hundred billion dollars an arm so it definitely has to do that but there's other things that we can do and the best thing to Saudi can do now because they can't get out of this thing\nSay you know this guy's not equipped right now to assume this route and let's find somebody else get uncle Mohammad over there or my nephew whatever let's find someone else\nJon

have to fake news media seems crazy ideas I Can't believe that\nThe media on my side with what we've accomplished because nobody's done more than all of us nobody's been more in the first two years or even two years yeah\nBut nobody has done anything close if they were on my side instead of always everything is don't take a big victory dry and make it into a lost their very dishonest people as they

computer age right maybe it was better than the other way maybe but then you wouldn't know that\nReal Donald Trump that wouldn't be so [noise] but I think of a human trafficking is worse than has ever

Republicans bully illegal border crossers after being brought back home immediately Democrats believe our country should be\nShould be a sanctuary for law abiding\n[noise]\n[noise]\nFlorida and therefore to the scene of one of the biggest races in the country for US Senate Rick Scott\nAnd senator incumbent former astronaut three term incumbent Bill Nelson they are tied in virtually every poll out there except for the CNN fake polls because CNN does fake news with fake polls to drive the fake narrative\nTo reach a conclusion\nAnd basically the CNN poll also has a socialist candidate for governor here in Florida Gillum up by a fourteen points override the census the Republican who has the backing of Trump now there's no way this was a fourteen point differential this is why these are fake polls I'm telling you\nWe don't we talk about fake news but now there's fake polls and we had this discussion the other day about why didn't the pollsters change their methodology when I got two thousand sixteen so wrong\nIn order to be more accurate because they don't want to be accurate they have no interest in accuracy them no interest in reflecting the truth what they want to do is send out false and fake polls to to pry fake news and make up a fake narratives that that Republican candidate is doomed\nSo they depress workers mailers turnout during doctors phone call makers and volunteers\nNobody is going to volunteer time for somebody who's down\nBy Fifteen points in the polls it gets much tougher to do for average people you show a tide than where you show it closer that people want to work\nIt's very difficult to give up to ... you know two weekends right now and go knock on doors for Cory Stuart when he's down by twenty points\nAnd that's just the reality of it I'm not ... the candidate or the campaign that's just the reality\nAnd store this down by about ... Fifteen or twenty Virginia\nBut you go to Florida there is no way that the socialist mayors Tallahassee is up ... fourteen points overruns advances\nAnd in the same poll they have the Senate race tied that's like the most ridiculous thing I've ever seen anybody on the methodology of these polls they over sample Democrats to reach a false conclusion live here in West Palm Beach Florida great to have you with us this was the scene of my son's first\nA justice first perfect game baseball tournament\nUm they made it to the sweet sixteen kind of a hodgepodge team that became the organization put together called the American team they I'm a gun in the sweet sixteen got to the playoffs got bounced and the first round\nOn Sunday but the jet judgment a great tournament pitched a four innings gave

Fifteen Percent of their energy from renewable energy sources come twenty twenty five that solar and wind so don't forget that they're putting a lot of money in that\nIn order to diversify their sources of energy now a couple of things I Want to say about the weather is a it's not going to rain today I'm so excited I'm In Florida and\nI wouldn't care if it rained there to be honest with you but not going to rain\nSo in Hampton Roads today highest sixty three what a beautiful day low forties sunny skies enrich Vegas sixty one is going to be a high\nGetting down to thirty five though very sunny sky south West Virginia sixty two high low freezing thirty two but sunny Martinsville, Virginia Medina Virginia where bill standing lives\nBill Hi uh sixty one get this going all the way down at twenty nine but sunny\nAnd as far as uh the greater metropolitan the Washington DC area high up fifty eight low forty and very sunny skies so great to have you with us one of the most interesting things here that is going on is this caravan which many of these migrants have\nCrossed Mexico I'm not sure I'm not sure really how steadfast the Mexican effort was in order to stop the caravan but we understand the others it's about five thousand people strong\nAnd many of them have gotten through the Mexican authorities they were stopped on a bridge they jumped in the river many of them now just getting through and they're on their way to the United states now the Trump Administration has got to make a decision in a very short period of time on this caravan I'm just going to say this straight out\nWhen you have four or five thousand people storming your country and this is what this says they're storming the border their strength and numbers they're getting money along the way they are being encouraged\nAs the president said we don't know who's part and that's certainly CNN is going to play a mom with babies that's all they're going to play they're not going to play the traffickers or anyone else that\nHappens to be involved in it that might not be the type of\nPerson you want the United states are open to show the miles with the babies but at the end of the day you have five thousand people crashing the border of the United states where I come from at sixty years old I think that's an invasion I don't know what else do you call it a migrant right at what is it a like may we come in\nI mean we have laws in this country the president's going to have to act on it as he has no choice and he threatened to send the military there uh hopefully they'll turn back hopefully they'll trade back and they have to turn back and fix their own countries everybody\nI've been people that it would collapse you simply cannot allow five thousand people but simply storm over the border and then be fed closed education and who's paying for it\nAnd the minute you do that the next candidate that will be fifty thousand and then five hundred thousand and then when you do then you have a country that's coming that is absolutely coming and it's coming sooner\nThan you think it is because thousands of these um what what you want to call them migrants or a ... resume their journey on Sunday despite a Mexican Government or just submit\nTo processing where the immigration authorities they simply ignored or just like no we'll ignore ours\nAnd the differences CNN will be there with cameras and God Forbid and all they're going to do is take pictures of moms with babies that's it they don't put all the moms with babies up at the front and take all the pictures\n\nAnd I don't know one or the CNN people and all the other liberals just take them into their home and go through the cracks just drive your car down there take five other than driving through the processing yourself spending money how's the feed them quote them I don't know maybe you do that they're not going to that they're not going to do it\n\nAnd all of the things that you're going to see is about how mean we are not letting them it\n\nIt's incredible that this is going to turn into a major campaign issue and to be ... this is the worst possible scenario\nYou're talking about an October surprise here it is you're watching five thousand people trying to innovate the United states from the southern border and there's no wall and President Trump got elected on this issue and now here comes a week before the election a week\n\nAnd a James says isn't the timing of this caravan interesting yes I think maybe it was put together they thought it would help the Democrats because we have kids in cages again it's going to blow up in their faces are back fire\nI mean average Americans looked at this and they're like I don't think it's a good thing for tens of thousands of people just stormed the country I mean that's where the Taliban is your storming the country it's just not like you're just a group of people in an orderly fashion\nOr they sneak through a rancher there's a handful here and a handful there\nI mean you get five thousand people that's a mob and that is an invasion and what are we going to do there's no one does I mean what are you if you put the military and straighten them out at the border\nHow are we going to stop and you're not going to shoot them so her going to stop them then the confrontation goes on TV and the Democrats were screaming about how mean we are or Trump is it\nIt's a it's a powder keg it's a powder keg and you've got fourteen days away fourteen days but it's going to blow up because look if you listen to me right now\nI don't think you're excited about\nMaking all of our laws and somebody that I was at everything and that's they take care of me I mean you don't have a country if you allow this to happen\nAnd Trump's it suddenly get the relative agree with him he said you don't like the Democrats here and you're basically saying an invitation because then I got a stern\nI got to stop it and the invitation is come on it he said the next ... will be fifty thousand is right because the Democrats are campaigning on let them in basically they don't want to stop them I don't care what they say when they come on my radio show about\nSecure the border to obtain secure the border how ... how are you going to do that to him\nI asked him three times on Thursday specifically what action center are you gonna take when this

you can't behave this way and they're gonna have to be accountable for it\nAnd the bigger problem here is crown prince Mohammed bin Salman he gets thirty three years old and everything this guy is touched us trying to craft right he's the one that got the Saudis involved in the Yemeni war that we should have no business being and that's number one\nHe's the one that did the uh with all of a war with the gang of uh of four did the block paid on guitar that blew up in his face that's been a disaster now this is a disaster\nAnd he's thirty three years old and the guy's a disaster and so this is

serious issue\nAnd so they'll they will be a response Steve or many new shouldn't the treasury secretary's already canceled his trip to uh to some Saudi economic summit\nSo there's gonna be a response it's gonna be a bipartisan response and we'll see what happens but like the president says let's wait till the facts urine let's not jump to conclusions and let's wait to the facts are in ... I went there we've got our own into people working on it\nUh but you simply can't have people going embassies and get their bodies chopped up okay it it it's\nIt defies international world order and without that then you go you go to some kind of a one world government you can't have it both ways right we don't want to be sovereign there's got to there's got to be an order here\nAnd and what concerns me about this is if indeed if indeed ... a crown prince Mohammed bin Salman authorized this\nIn in in the face of the relationship that the Trump Administration\nHas built when the Saudis that is a really a slap in the face to the president like I don't really care or at the end of the day I got money buying arms and you're basically going to do a deal with whatever I Do\nAnd this

government wide effort to roll back recognition of transgender people under federal civil rights law\nThe New York times obtained a draft member of the department of health and Human Services that would define sex as either male or female and an changeable the move would be the most significant of a series of maneuvers to exclude the estimated one point four million Americans\nWho identify as transgender from receiving civil rights protections under the Obama administration the recognition of gender identity became more fluid\nAs you know\nSo the Trump Administration are gradually doing away with transgender as a sex for purposes of gaining civil rights now that has nothing to do with gay rights has to do with defining a gender\nAnd I don't know I don't know I Am\nAt you know pro gay rights and ah people want to be transgender I'm for whatever they want to be but um I don't know that this was a tough one John perfect radio network we'll be right facts they will be on this\nFood and water to help them get here and if so are those people also in violation of the United states all helping someone to enter our country illegally and can't be prosecuted\n[noise] uh well let me get that back for your question the answer to that is I really don't know so I'm going to be honest about that I don't know what the how the law applies to that uh if people are giving food and water to the caravan or there are\nOther sponsors supplying them with the cash they need to feed themselves to go forward what how you would implicate them or how you would go to a foreign country and across the gym I don't know that's certainly if that money was coming from the United states uh that that\nWas certainly the organ I heard is [noise] excuse me the churches and God Bless her is that a lot of churches or or uh taking care of these people once they get in there making\nI'm a ... going on with getting some of them\nCan't these people who do that like you said from the United states or maybe other foreign countries or be prosecuted for what checked into a violation of the United states all\nWell know number one uh there's uh even the president said at this rally that we're getting money he didn't know where you're from but there there's no evidence is coming from the United states doesn't mean it's not okay\nSo let me just stop there doesn't mean it's not but there is no direct evidence right now might come out this afternoon but right now are there is no evidence linking to that the churches that make money off this the reason they make money is because they've set up businesses\nIn order to take the refugees and feed them close them and then they charge the government and uh they make a very tidy profit up with me a lot of money means is this a migraine refugee illegal immigration thing\nThat people will always find ways to make money off the government and so there's plenty of companies associated with plenty of church is making a lot of money off the government because they provide for the food the clothing that housing and education\nAnd they get more than they put out so it's becoming a very profitable business for people and these are short term I think it's right\nIt's a very profitable business\nFor it it's almost all going to get back on it and then [noise] sitting and people down south to organize the rally put bringing people north then you can say I'm a [noise]\nIt's organized crime and I think what you're going to take a very close to who's organizing these people who is finding these people and see if their parents\nAre these organizations in the United states than profit off of them mhm once again here no good for illegals coming you know being made\nMake it ... Glen you make you make a very good are you making very good argument for that I mean they should get looked into now if it's being funded by drug runners and sex traffickers and other up bad people that are have a better themselves in a caravan and if their funding it then there was not a lot that we can do about\nAnd there's a lot of people um\nInferred that that's where they're getting the money in order to make the track to the United states is by bad actors are that\nHave access to resources that have a better themselves in the caravan whether it be sex traffickers drug traffickers meals if you'd call them uh you know there's been rumors that there's a a that there's other people from parts of the country and this caravan\nThe way that I like it doesn't really matter who's there good bad or not it's an invasion as you enter the United states and if you let the stand if you let the stand if you'll let them come in I'm In the political pressure become such that big jet in or the majority of them again in five sets\nIt's not going to be seven thousand gland it's going to be Seventy thousand and the one after that it's going to be seven hundred thousand and then there are simply going to craft the United states and he can't do anything about it so they're gonna have to stop this and if you remember a\nThe zero tolerance policy which was the antithesis of catch and release was put in place by the Trump Administration and Jeff Sessions in order to act\nAs a deterrent and for a short period of time it did until they have to go back to catch and release because they separated the kids from their parents and we got the CNN kids in cages headline and they all blew up and it was the PR disaster and that was the end of it and so you know there's no we have to figure this out\nAnd some kind of immigration reform in the hole in the Congress is it going to do crap when you got seven thousand people ready to crash the poor\nThey they're gonna have to figure it out thank you Glenn but we'll have to see how that goes right ah meantime the uh the caravan is becoming an election issue that Democrats think it's going to help them they really do they think that the fact that these people are coming under his mom's with babies\nAnd it goes back to the kids in cages and don't you have a hard and\nTrump's meaning and all the Trump supporters of me that they don't want help the kids will debate the mouse with the babies are they think it's going to help them I think this is a disaster if you're the Democrats right now every day this caravan gets closer to the United states they are losing votes\nBecause people look at this and they say the same thing I Do this is an invasion into our country that we're powerless to stop powerless powerless because of the media and because of\nWhat happened with a zero tolerance\nAnd so I don't think the president is kidding what he says he will put the military there but you're gonna have to have a wall and then they're all gonna be camped out right at the border and then they're going to need food water and they're they're not going away they have to go back to have to turn back\nIt's got to be a very it's we we don't know how this was going to turn out but right now for the Denver crafts right now at the snapshot in time this is a political catastrophe for them\nTwo weeks before the election now what they're hoping it turns into is more kids in cages propaganda so then they can blame Trump the administration and Republicans on having the heart\nAnd separating from ... that's what they're hoping it turns out too\nBut if it doesn't if it's just a humanitarian catastrophe on the border and people see pictures of ten thousand\nMigrants tried to invade their country the Republicans are going to hold the house because no one in their right mind can't think that that is a good idea other than\nThe most left wing part a sense that believe that every one that comes over as a potential democratic vote that's it\nSo the president regardless of the political ramifications President Trump ran out of this issue of this was his signature issue it's coming in for which there is no wall\nAnd he's going to have to take a stand and stop these people from coming in [noise] but they have to do it in a way that is a with in our value system if that makes sense Jimmy Williamsburg says this could be a powder keg\nIf they get to the border before the election imagine troop stopping this that's what the Democrats are hoping I mean that's why they were behind this at the beginning to figure okay if we can get this\nAnd it's a PR catastrophe a with a military with bayonets and miles with babies I then uh it's it'll be great for the Democrats drew\nYour time's post CNN the LA Times will be a beside themselves with plate so you're right this is a powder keg uh Jennifer in Norfolk says\nThe gets back into the transgender issue has really complicated things with for the majority man just won the women's you see a cycling championship we identified as a woman and a woman suppresses just tossed around\nAny compete says a woman with a male body science is simply science we are different if as an adult someone who wants to identify as whatever so be it\nBut they should be identified as what science themes them at birth and should be listed as a male or female or their birth certificates\nI just don't have a lot of passion for the ... I'm Sorry I don't I'm pro gay rights or you want to identify the woman and when it's cycling contest or\nI guess eventually women that are real women are going to get mad over it and filed a suit or something\nBut I just I'm passionate about this and that ... somebody wants to identify as a transgender and married another do whatever they want I just don't care I mean that's how they're made and that's what they want to do and\nI have no interest in it and I'm In favor of people identifying themselves or however they want to identify themselves has no bearing on me and uh you know it is what it is and I know a lot I have a lot of transgender friends and they're", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Joe Walsh Show", "city": "Portsmouth", "day": "23"}
