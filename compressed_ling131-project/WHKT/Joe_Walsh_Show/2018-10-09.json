people's also where the campaign and he's now with Steve Bannon pack or citizens for the republic which is a political action committee that Steve Bannon started we had Steve on the show Wednesday talking about all the great things they were doing and he is with us now Sam\nThank you very much for having me happy Monday happy Monday Sam\nFor Kavanaugh Kevin from so you nailed that what happens now\nThat we have a couple issues planting forward but first how do we consolidating continue as Republicans to make sure that I'm the opposite\nThe enthusiasm that has opened up pundits selection the\nKnowledge of what the Democrats want to do how do\nWe translate that that people will remember that this is not over just because we got a judge Kaplan now I think during according to John's of crafts um to press the fact of what lingering setting Lindsey Graham during that time going out here and he put it very eloquently I find that I Can't believe I'm quoting Lindsey Graham\nI mean it shows you the way the Republican Party has changed strike yeah no more John McCain and will back to ah\nAnd we every one of the party of Trump balloons see Graham said the Democrats\nWant power God help us I Hope they don't get it and what they did the cabinet now was a dress rehearsal for not only what they're going to do the Donald Trump for what they're going to do to everyone and anyone associated with him\nOn anyone from any White House advisor to anybody who worked on the campaign to any business associates they will all be cold and they will try to end this president and God Forbid there not swimming in the window out\nGod Forbid they win the Senate I think that the fact that they may try to do impeachment trial\nOf a cabinet now I don't know if the house can do is say they will look to um forcibly\nAre take those articles in many teachers will pass through a Democratic House by the time of which will be a historic it will be for the second half of the first term president is obviously fighting\nA fight sorry both parties have ignored which both parties house\nI'm not trying to do with North Korea or you know trying to read and read a brief strikes in the middle east from the damage left over from the Shia crux of Iran a bronco\nBomber was all too happy to help promote um they're going to shop around the world stage and and then I say God help us because [noise]\nDemocratic state to not have power these days when it's time to time again if you remember two thousand nine two thousand times we were in Waterloo party but\nAmericans came together this Tea Party movement and the only party that needs to change the Republican Party the party out of the power to stop that Obama agenda I can tell you they will be ten times worse because they ... they are enraged the mob the\nWinter obviously most important in late is American people here and why do I say that because this\nFirst choice not your first choice but I counted out not come out\nAnd given that response in his opening statement after Fort testimony you would've had he probably would not have the right and he would he would have had something where the politics of destruction where you're allowed to use the anger route court\nAnd it sounded like you know it's time to like cops and it's funny to you know I say bowler who didn't so much you can act like put them in jail and political enemies and trying to undo election\nBut Democrats who you know very they're very they're very tough against Russia don't you know I'm thinking about what they are they also they were acting like a Russian Soviet communists ma you know mobbed trial the Chinese pull of euro again and\nAgain now so I think that that was very important now from a political point of view\nObviously this is a win for the Republicans\nThe issue is do we maintain where are we paying ten days from now we remember why we realize why why this election is important to remember what's happening now shows he could have it out what is it only about the Supreme Court wasn't about doubts\nAbout the direction of the country we wanted and if it was about to elections matter are we going to let the Democrats\nTake over the house in the Senate\nAnd really throw the country into disarray so we'll find out so for that point of view from a strictly political point of view it remains an open book we don't know yet\nWell well\nYou're right because one of the ... the only apprehension I have is that the Republicans who were very far up\nRight now by the time we get to the end of the next twenty nine days see how the hell that uh we ... we got the guy we wanted to kind of forget about it\nSo you you've got to keep them far enough no doubt but just this like you're saying Sam this is this is the most critical midterm election in our history I mean\nI Know a lot of Republicans are fired up about Obamacare and I remember I called I was calling me up when the Supreme Court passes saying that it was the end of the Republican and it was like okay it's attached to me you know you get a tax you don't have a tax\nIt it was just policy it's no big deal you know we didn't like it but it was attacked so what this is quite different maybe because now you're talking about the direction of the country um\nGive me the biggest loser in all the\nCalled the biggest loser [noise] [noise] I think I think the biggest loser\nOne unfortunately or when you were being abused now look I've been pretty talk on the record mhm um I was much tougher allow made a point when I spoke about it even two weeks ago on your show and thank you for having me on a lot\nIt's an honor but I said I thought she was lying I'm I don't know what happened to her house on ... job usually has mental problems but the biggest loser the women's movement\nEntertainment industry in the news industry likes to point out mostly Democrats but the gr minor details that's our friends that I Would say I love that term but the way that she was used in the way they say she wanted to keep this confidential\nShe didn't want to go to Congress remember she looked at her lawyers\nWhen she was crap you know that we could have gone from California just shows you that this really has said that because it's never quite seen care about her the Democrats didn't hear about\nUm what actually may have happened to her was the Democrats were I just wanted to throw in the kitchen sink and and the worst kinds of way of getting\nDressed is what is going to president look what you're talking to somebody who frankly and I said there's some people want to criticize it I don't really care delta Burke the rhythm pedaled birth to read them I knew more about what was born in the United states I mean you know typically produce probably you know I think Israel's\nProblem is he or she wants to talk politics as presidential politics and stuff are electric what they did here was we went out to sea can destroy\nSomeone and in the worst kind of way possible once again so I think that's really the biggest loser but Democrats don't me not lost on there will be very fires\nUp they're raising a lot of money as well um I think that the cleared clarify their presidential field such that it is last week's show a little bit\nI don't think Michael off and on any [noise] he was going to get any more attention by winding down on that one once again once again to linger open book ... the biggest loser if you want to point to anyone that I have will be a loser separately Michael out of a novelty\nDianne Feinstein and probably Cory Booker\nI with great sand with all those right down the line\nLisa Murkowski John for God and I'm not going to have sex or look one thing people like you and me who were on our criticism of power of cocaine Mitch but trust me he'll get back it hurts so she she's got something come into her mentor made her on the Republican side\nAbsolute loser and McConnell a big one and uh\nYou know I never I never saw the Sinaloa Cartel and you and I have been I Know it's probably too when they get in on the side uh over the cultural and every other we usually think he's done looking shocked and so you got to give credit where it's too and he was a big part of this\nFrom the equivalent I think John when Trump came out it's actually the base after uh NBC lead the Access Hollywood tape out yeah that'd be the lead to tell you would take they're all calling for Trump to drop out and he just came out there and he just destroyed\nPorter so people don't really I mean not like I personally have done a lot of terrible things before she got\nReally certainly has gone he certainly delivered on that promise as he delivered on all of his promises which is unbelievable I said my God\nA minute and a half I got to get to a baseball this is classic\nFan I'm an Astros fan a\nYankees where the huge when Saturday Night huge when sensitive to homers now they go home I don't think it's ever get back to the way I think they're going to win it and\nThe answer is going to Cleveland up to oh maybe they could be today but I were in command a very good chance we see in the ass I don't want to jinx my team but\nI feel I feel good about being in Cleveland so that's why we're going to have the\nAstros play the Yankees John longer the Syrian better for the Astros are shorter the series the better for the better for the Yankees I think God wants us to both teams when I think they will hopefully we don't go by the way I don't think you're going back to the earlier on that\nThan writer or not we're not Cleveland theory I think the longer the series the better for the Astros\nBetter starting pitching in so [noise] the Yankees are able to get\nA couple of ones on the road for one on the road in the beginning of carried assuming that happens then the heat or in a much better place and they were when they were here on it I think we'll find out but this is going to be I think that actually equivalent of the world series\n[laughter] that's what comes to fruition theory I don't see any way that you're walking and most likely the Dodgers would be able to beat the Yankees or the Astros material\nI think that said I think the world series you got to be an ale championship game and the estimates would have the whole field so Disney sacked replay of two thousand Seventeen or two to three two and\nThe answer is I don't even think we're close to the game in New York I don't even think we were in a game and we got bingo [noise] three and then have to go home\nNo there was one again we have to come in here and there was one game we let them and they taught them how to fly like one of the series\nNorth yeah well that's what I Will say well playing out John triggers radio networks have Sam Nunberg I remember Sam Nunberg senior advisor now when it's a\nSteve Bannon's political action committee you're going to hear a lot about\nThis political action committee says it when that
