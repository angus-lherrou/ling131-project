their strategy\nIs people know what I'm so Abigail Spanberger I'll have to spend a lot more money on social media and TV earlier to get her name out there people in the district has a very high and then you might do\nSo I think they're going to wait here until the final Eighteen days so I Know a lot of ads are have been a purchased by their campaign\nAnd I would think that you would start seeing

that they did what they had to do the first of all they do we get one of those they get what all they wouldn't want in Boston I expected but what do I know I thought that the Yankees were going to be [noise] me too\nBut I mean you're going to be a great team I think the issue is what comes out of\nTheir natural lake I\nStuck Milwaukee [noise] I don't I don't really know if it's an upset but I think Milwaukee maybe the dog [noise]\nI well I think they are also so a winning ... remember that but you know what I see that the problem with the natural than it is you're paranoid right because we were losers for so long that even though we did win the championship last season there's just my whole family is\nBy Danny pitch their narrative knock the older the older they need the older pollsters they don't understand the demographic what I also think the following\nThe reason I said that they were worse when you were talking about John is because they're based on [noise]\nOn typically the ... the worst of the worst than is like that it's like I mean the worse it is\nThey see cripple ones of let's say the worst political you can think of it just seems to be you know Democrats are always writing and Republicans are always wrong by [noise] um [noise] they base it on the model where they're looking at\nPeople typically don't vote\nFrankly aren't even registered some time voting this time and they base it on the fact of the woman march ... not pay something millennials are coming out the vote the way they these Democrats pollsters are putting millennials are not coming out of those who are a democratic candidates\nFor nature and the second issue is unless you show me a poll on them down and don't tell you if you were to real polls John how you look at the CBS you got a call\nWith that poll struck forget his name he released a book and he says look I'm giving it to freeways Peter Best\nCase scenario right now for the Democrats undermined polling he had the Democrats with a tendency majority worst case scenario undermined polling he only had two Democrats and Republicans keeping house by one see\nI still think that under national circumstances the reason he says because what they knew what they do they're generic that way I don't remember doing these congressional races [noise] so what do you need to work for congressional as opposed to the Senate races\nThey it's just not fair\nFor accurate way to do it because\nOf the gerrymandering the way these districts are\nThe way they polled people let's say in the state of California the state of New York or even the state of Virginia and then they put that into their poll is a composite it's just not accurate it doesn't represent what they don't waiting accurately for what it has to come out to eat a little slit\nRepublican seats the Democrats [noise] part of it to one of the one who said part of it is just simple laziness\nBy them laziness unsophisticated in a way of doing your part of it is that it's very expensive look at his expensive if you wanted to do what we did citizens and the American republic see parents group we spent two hundred thousand dollars I'm polling\nAnd what we did was we saw in the region [noise] the polling in the state as well we didn't even do state we said we want to see a lot\nOf New York we want to see southwest California we want to be made a we want to see them\nWe will look at the state of Washington right where we have not where we have lost the game and we want to see the um northern and western column of Washington right that's the way you got to do with that look that was two hundred thousand dollars we expect you know\nSo it's a lot more expensive to do with the right way to do with the Kobe Bryant is these\nDoing jobs that one person can do right right some of the rules and things like that you would think they actually would want to spend money were no polling but they don't\nLet me shipped over I got a couple of minutes I got two ...

[noise]\nElaine these are economic numbers continue to just stunned people\nThe or the the level of growth that we're having the newest unemployment report coming out to about ten days ago three point seven percent unemployment Elaine just as the lowest recorded on unemployment in the United states we've had since Nineteen sixty nine\nWhere's the county where does this phenomenal Trump autonomy\nI Know that restricts God where is it\nWell health care and the economy just about all over the country are at the top issues national security is important to many and in some states like Arizona\nImmigration is a critical issue so economy everywhere is one of the top two issues but I think you or your framing of the question is a little bit of oil you know I talked about this a lot [noise]\nUm [noise] the economy just greedy there is not as much of an awareness that was not a lot of voters are giving credit to the Trump and Republican policies and that's creating a bit of a disconnect\nWow that's a I mean it's it's it's it's unfortunate and to me every day that goes by where the Republicans are not talking about the economy and jobs and\nPromotions and raises and you know the other thing to get you a link back involves the ... of um chief operating officer of the job of critters networks\nElaine another thing that is not readily talked about\nIs the number of people now that are comfortable changing jobs Elaine ah which is another number that is off the uh CNN polling radar screen if you will but the number of people that were in jobs he didn't particularly want to be in or didn't like her one happy\nBut in the Obama economy one percent one percent growth\nThey were afraid to move now you're getting movement from one level to the other people changing companies feeling more comfortable that they can make that move can you expand on that only\nAbsolutely and that's just all part of what I was talking about earlier with having more out of all people died about six and a half million jobs\nAnd the only people out there and I mean there's always a skills match on the jobs that are available and there is overseeing leaders Ryan I'm just by the free market and how it\nHow it's supposed to work on and people are feeling the counter fall and looking at other opportunities when he got out there on the opportunities for people here were taking their first stats on going to start their own company and the Trump Administration has taken steps to make\nHealth insurance more affordable for small business health providers three of the emotional health cleaning people were able to make that leap tax or maybe they weren't able to just because of the cost of health insurance on and that was actually health insurance would actually protect our fire\nSurvey last week and we found that sixty percent of people are are unwilling to give up their doctor\nMhm on or their current plans for federal [noise] and um that that was that people want access to health insurance they want access to affordable insurance in the ... the government had to really ensure that cutting are providing it\nSo\nThat issue going to show up on November sick but I noticed that\nThe Democratic come on my show now ah one of their major talking points are well Republican X Y or Z voted against a extending free thinking nations when they voted to replace repeal Obamacare where is that showing up\nWhile you're at the end that that is a fear and that gets to ... people want to make sure that everyone has access to quality health care and to the degree that they charge like that is believed to this person is going to lead to ending coverage for those with preexisting conditions that's a\nThat's not our practice ploy I'm obviously it as something that Republicans would say is not true at CERN misrepresentation vote to misrepresentation of legal actions that have been taking 'em sock clarify what happens there is it's\nCrazy because again Americans do want everybody to have access to health insurance or want to make sure it's horrible they they're not aware again or some of the activities that the lenders mentioned some of the policies that have made less expensive plans area will\nBe which increases acts of 'em but probably of any thing on the health care you know the flashpoint a scary thought is in motion it's somebody in any condition and then you places will be unable to get access to health care\nAnd so that's the reading that that's driving some some people um yes to vote the other way thinking well if the if the Democrats get in they're not going to end the bombing here\nI mean it's just as a side note of amazing because um two thousand ten and the and the Tea Party and all that we covered over all that and getting rid of Obamacare was like everybody is number one issue\nAnd now the polling numbers show that you know people have accepted it they're comfortable with it and they they don't want to change it\nSo um how how do you reconcile that\nIt's very simple the healthcare system was broken the whole ... it was not by Obamacare people still believe the system is broken [noise] um but it's no longer read the shoulder finding part of the health care discussion because\nUm it's been in place now for several years people aren't quite sure what progress in civil law day like or don't like 'em have anything to do with Obamacare will be in the middle is if people want to have more choice in their own and making their own decisions on health insurance [noise]\nWe know that they are aware read very wary of having the federal government take over the healthcare system um there are a number of things that\nYou would say would be opposed to Obamacare\nAre put into place but people are you know President Obama has now been out of office for a few years his policy was past eight years ago [noise] people want to deal with the system as it is and make it better um and they don't see either side really having a solution to that at this\nMan on November sex is only a what twenty two days remaining how how do you get maximum or exposure to get Republicans on November six how do we do is\nI think we have to keep talking about the economy\nAnd connecting the economy to the policies that the administration\nLike the tax cut things out that the cutting of regulation um we did a poll a couple of weeks ago I'm asking how many Americans use that there's been a tax credit and about a third of them said they didn't even know that they had had their taxes I\nMean that's that's the potential we should be talking about the fact that five million Americans got it all out of where you can increase it and he says that as a result of that's been out that\nNot just the people the companies that cut out press releases\nWe got numbers just small main street small businesses to get rain has been getting raises and hiring people and expand their businesses you just don't put out press releases about it so we know that things are happening for employees you know people are getting money back in our paycheck to small businesses hiring\nOnly near the economy's doing well but we have to be talking about educating Americans about that\nSo uh what what is the advice that you have for Republicans that are running in tight races or how would you change their or encourage them to a change the message in order to take advantage of this tremendous economy we have no way\n[noise] [noise] well I mean I think it it's very clear and it's about choice it's a choice between painting the on this very hot economy on as a result of these policies or going back to um you know wage stagnation going back to a higher unemployment\nAnd it's about a choice\nAnd and that's why people how to educate themselves on on the benefit that these policies coming out of the nation\nI don't want to thank God and it'll links for being with us John Ross Mazen the number one pollster in the history
