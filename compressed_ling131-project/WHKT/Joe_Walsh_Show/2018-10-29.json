Want to ask you this I thought the Cory bookers and it was odd because it was like okay so it's getting out of the news cycle and now we get another one right I don't\nKnow I just I don't know that some crazy person is doing it but it seems awfully odd to me here's\nThe thing is the Democrats the Schumer is the the whole crowd that whole mob over there they were screaming\nWe must have the FBI investigate before we can vote on Kavanaugh there must be a full investigation before we can vote on him before we can decide whether he should be you know send to the Supreme Court right\nThe same mother saying we must have an FBI investigation before we can let that happen [noise]\nThey're not even waiting for the FBI to investigate where the bombs are coming from before they start blaming President Trump declared President Trump guilty responsible for the whole thing they're not waiting for the FBI to investigate these are the same people that three weeks ago\nSaid we cannot do anything until the FBI finishing his investigation\nSo I mean they were total hypocrites it it is absolutely here responsible or beyond counterproductive it's it's absolutely you're responsible for them to be saying this is all about because President Trump or they're they're trying to they're they're trying to score political points office which\nYou have to ask who benefits from these bombs that's all I'm not saying who\nSince ... bombs or fake bombs through the mail we don't have the bombs are real are fake or\nThey emptied out some firecrackers put it in a in the toilet paper tube\nAnd a attacks the digital watch to it to make it look like a scary thing we don't know it's Halloween time it's easy to scare people what can I tell you\nWe don't know and I'm not going to go down that road what I can say is whoever did it it's crazy in one way or another whether they're sort of fire bleed can be committed to an institution crazy or just that they've got a screw loose you don't do that kind of normal people\nWell adjusted people don't do that okay by definition\nPat Buchanan has a column out today very makes the point that when John Kennedy was assassinated Lee Harvey Oswald who defected to the Soviet Union was pro Cuba\nOr he was found to be the shooter a yet who got blamed for the John birth society and all the conservatives so\nThis is not the first time that the guilt by association or let's let's let's slammed the conservative let's blame everything on conservatives not the first time it's been done before we even know who actually send these packages so\nIt's a everybody's gotta calmed down take a breath and ah I think Sarah Sanders had it right we should be coming together the president is calling for unity dialing down their rhetoric\nAnd the Democrats are going in the opposite direction they're they're they're blaming the president unequivocal he no question about it taking no responsibility whatsoever\nFor calling the guy look at the sky Brennan the president's guilty of trees or what's the what's the penalty for treason death he's basically a former\nHead of the CIA had been out they're\nCalling for the president to be hung by the neck until dead and this is not considered inflammatory rhetoric I it's it it's disgusting the whole thing is just just hypocritical and people will go down as the all time greatest hypocrites\nSomething a Curtis I I think you make a great analogy the depression that of the Democrats who cried and screen than wind about cabinet\nGetting the FBI not investigating everything I mean why don't we just wait here I mean the FBI seems to be home again in southern Florida they're going to come up with a report from so we're we're we're going to find out the answer I mean why not just wait\nExactly how about everybody said calmed down\nLet's we got we we have the FBI on the case unless this guy was a or gal or or or bought or whatever you know ever\nEnter the it was that created these packages unless that entity was a very very very sophisticated person\nAre able to buy it and if they were very sophisticated they were able to cover their tracks but\nPlaces coming out of one place there are a lot of clues there and I'm confident that the FBI will be able to figure something out here and find out who did it for narrow it down and the fact that they use Debbie Wasserman Schultz as a return address\nThat's kind of interesting in itself Debbie Wasserman Schultz is the one who was forced to step down\nFrom head of the Democratic National Committee a because she had been reading the system for Hillary against Bernie\nI don't know what that means but it's sort of an interesting clue you know maybe somebody thought that was funny to use her name out all these bombs I don't know\nUh but my point is this unless this was a very sophisticated operation\nBut they knew a how to cover their tracks at every step of the way you've got twelve packages now that the FBI is investigating it let's wait for the FBI to figure this out to come up with something yeah why not wait before you start\nA and and why not why are they not waiting because they want to politicize it the the Democrats are missing no opportunity to score political points on this\nWell it's a ... it seems to it it just seems odd to me that that all this is happening but let's wait I mean that's where everybody's saying let's wait any time let's get to let's get the the economy will get to the um caravan invasion after the bottom of the hour a\nBut let's get to the new economic numbers that just came out the gross\nDomestic product GDP growing another three and a half percent now let me just say what this means right that's the first time that we have had\nBack to back quarter a in a very long time of of of over three and a half percent growth back to back and consumer confidence uh up at an all time I can do for spending was one percent another great a quarter\nOf economic growth this more bad news for them they don't want to talk about that that they don't want to talk about the economy or jobs or the growth so what did they talk about\nAh they talk well they talk about the up this wonderful thing to talk about this horrible thing to talk about here with the with the bombs and they talk about the president speaks again they're falling in they don't realize they're falling into a trap and and it's their own travel tropic of their own making\nPeople don't want to hear the Democrats talk about the president they want to hear Democrats Republicans the politicians in Washington talk about what they're what the politicians or going to do for them to make their life better write\nWhat I I I go to work every day I got a family to support\nI got a job or I'd like to get a raise what are you going to do to make that happen how are you gonna make my life better easier make me rich uh make make make my kids you know healthier\nTalking about President Trump talking about\nDo the jogging about President Trump causing the bomb scare doesn't do that so you're going back to the for the last two years old I've been talking about President Trump is a Russian agent and now they're President Trump as a Russian agent who created bomb scares I\nMean they're they're they're not doing themselves any favors\n[noise] and on the other side I mean it's very it's very clear jobs no jobs a President Trump and the Trump Administration have created the best economic conditions in this country in in a generation it's the best we've seen in ten Twenty years\nAnd that\nGoes along the way that answers peoples' questions what have you done for me lately you got me a job you've gotten me a raise you've gotten my kids or food stamps got kicked out of the basement there on their own now great thank you very much\nSomething I'm going to pose questions answered when it gets back so stay with us for another segment is about a hour but\nWhen you get back where Trump Tower for the last week so they can't do yoga it's almost like a fool all over again I mean [laughter] I mean\nI could go back to two thousand and it's the same thing we're only talking about everybody from clear when it was all it was all whatever it was that he was going through at the time when the Access Hollywood they were never going to be right back I'll go way\nPeople coming out of the woodwork coming out of the hills coming out of the bally's coming out of the towns coming out of the farms coming to vote for Trump they've never voted before\nAnd uh so yeah it is there is a feeling of things I hear all of these national generic ballot polls are meaningless because there's not a national election\nThey're all like I mean it's all the calls I I've been talking all day about the Washington Post poll that came out yesterday that shows Jennifer ... that had a Barbara Comstock are genius tense district like Thirteen look like it might when she said she's a favorite no doubt that's a very tough districts out for the Republicans to win barbers\nEvery a journal called that the Republicans have from\nThe White House or the or the same to Barbara down show is that right why not\nHave a Thirteen points but this is what the Washington Post jobs they get a\nUh they get a ridiculous methodology to get a steak polls get a fake analysis of it to do fake news to get a fake conclusion drawn so they can continue on with their fake narratives and like we've already been down this path so now I'm going to start calling them on how we\nAm your Godzilla of the truth in America where eleven days out

tomorrow\nAs more facts to come out so I\nDon't understand what they're saying the president has changes the just have a position he's waiting for the fact that President Trump is not a politician he's a businessman here's our businessmen make decisions facts numbers spreadsheets and math so as the fat man\nAnd the mathematical equation gets put together his commentary evolved as\nThe end of the day I don't know what the final outcome of the U.S reaction is going to be but I've been saying this all week in the middle middle Middle East on TV this president does it take well to being lied to and I don't think there's any doubt crown\nPrince Mohammed bin Solomon light so\nI don't think that goes over well with President Trump he doesn't like being lied to here's the other thing he doesn't like dealing with incompetent people he doesn't have a lot of patience\n\nAnd I'm telling you crown prince\n\nMohammed bin Salman is incompetent everything the guy at thirty three years old has gotten involved in has been a complete ... mitigated disaster for the Saudi kingdom so eventually the father just have to say you know what my son is in a top rated bubbling full and I got to put somebody else\nIn the country to to lead because it's guys are capable of being king because he does stupid stuff including this is talk of the nation allegedly\n\nThe or Saudis have now ... that'll by just on a final story they're saying but that's going to\nChange again so who knows right\nThe a jokey case has here's what it is tough it is really brought renewed focus\nTo the Saudi Emirates tactics and support that we're giving them and getting involved in the Yemen's civil war which is causing a horrific very disturbing very growing humanitarian\nCrisis where I just got to tell you this I'm On an allergist here every day I see the pictures you do see because uh the fake news networks today they don't want to show your real news they want to talk about you know President Trump Stormy Daniels or whatever they do\n\nBut I I see the pictures on TV and I bet it'll really tear\nOut your stomach I mean you've got children just starving I mean they can eat that ... they they got mother's stripping park for trees bark and boiling it just matching it up too so there is something that's in the summer reading grass\nI mean there's no food\nI mean you think about how to get your child you're sitting there they starve to death me thinking about how that feels men make this thing is is a horror show it is worst in the area it's worse than anything I've seen and\nOur involvement in it is shameful it is absolutely shameful and if there's anything that's got to come out of the show your fair or\nWe're going to get the hell out of there as we should is it just it it's horrific that the United states is involved in something of this nature all because you know we've got\nAll right let's get the phone like Mike in Oakland you're you're on the air in my\nMind John Yup I agree with you on the him and I think you're exactly right about that so I'm I like you know comes out this for anything good could come out of this thing but I have to point out though the irony or something you\nSaid just a few minutes ago I'm sure you didn't pick up on it or if you don't agree but um you know you said the president or the the two things he doesn't like doesn't like to be lied to and he doesn't like incompetent\nAnd I I Can't help but think he must be he just wants all that to him so\n[laughter] he surely likes to lie to us and I feel that he's incompetent for the jobs in this doesn't want to share those two things with others [noise]\nWell I guess uh I guess you'd say just tremendous economic renaissance and it's full make tremendous economy we have an all the jobs I\nGuess you think that the homework governed confidence I guess you think the fact that we haven't heard from ISIS in that they've been kicked kicked out of the majority of their caliphate and they they now only can throw a tiny part of terror tore yet when he took over it was a massive I get you think that's a topic I guess you think that the fact\nThat the wacko when North Korea has not done a nuclear tests in Britain that might get you think that the top of that I get your take all these new jobs we have in the fact that we just keep going up in the top of that and there is a tax cut and you figure that's an\nConfident so I guess your nice definition of incompetence Mike is just a little bit different\nI guess it is a you know some of those things could have happened whether he was an officer notch\nOr actually\nAutomate or we don't want someone\nWho is competent in that position what kind of position we live in right thank you and now that\nThank you for straightening yeah it's

this ah\nThe evolving story of the Saudis it's now clear this was a premeditated murder this guy got chopped up and uh\nBasically got out of there and some kind of doggie bags and they buried him in the garden or something the whole thing is just a horrible situation but what a\nCrown prince Mohammed bin Salman the administration's put a lot of things in this guy Jared Kushner has and a lot of

have to be held accountable so I Do think that there has to be significant\nPenalties that they suffer I Do think to the question has to be asked is like does the United states believes that it can carry on and continue the relationship with Saudi Arabia which I Do think we need to but can that be with the crown prince I\nThink that's a pretty compelling question I think the\nAdministration is going to have to ask that I think Congress will eventually addressed that an asset\nTo you know what will be the penalties\nAre to uh to Saudi Arabia I listen I understand the impact of most of those contracts for what we're doing to supply a military uh equipment to Saudi Arabia I think Saudi Arabia I can be a like a a force\nOn that is is a is a is an ally to us ended up in the middle east but I don't think that it can it can be that\nType of ally that we wanted that we need to you if this is how they're going to operate I mean we asked you know we have principles in the United states that we that we stand by and our allies have\nTo have to abide by those and I just don't see Saudi\nArabia doing that you know you you point out the issue with Yemen too and you and I have talked about that before I those are all questions I think that come up and how we see\nSaudi Arabia operating in the region house policies meaning played out and are are they are they doing this thing's necessary\nIn that region that create stability and that and that are working in the in the best interest of all involved not\nJust Saudi Arabia but ah other allies in the middle east and listen I I I understand what they're doing that to push back against the Iranian but are are they doing things that in the long term about moving the middle east in the right direction I think those are questions that we have to ask\nThem off or foreign policy standpoint and I think that U.S policy toward Saudi Arabia you know needs to needs to be directed by those I think very a very sobering issues that we have to for us\nSo it seems like congressman Whitman ah we're in total agreement and it seems like what you're saying is the best way to solve this is a four crown prince MPs from Harvard that solving to

people I compete with hosts like if people they just get up every day they read the paper you got the fake news you've got fake polls movies are the big poll\nYesterday from the Washington Post is unbelievable\nI mean the Washington Post like when did they can learn like they don't want to work people say well what are they going to change a pony methodology to get it right never because they don't want to get it right because it's not about\nIt accurate poll it's about the poll driving fake news to get a fake narrative to draw the conclusion that's all it is it's all why the Washington Post\nActually putting out a poll yesterday actually putting out a poll showing Barbara Comstock\nTrailing Jennifer Wexton in the ... district by third gene point now\nThere is no way that watched and had the thirteenth\nPoint lead over Barbara cops like every journal poll that I have seen on top stocked every internal poll that his pay four and a lot of money shows this raise the debt eat or Comstock slightly ahead and the Washington Post has got Comstock down by Thirteen this is a complete\nAnd utter lie and it's been on fake news it is and it's beyond the onion it's beyond the national Enquirer what they tried\nTo do they hate tops not so much they want that seat so bad they want the liberal do nothing Jennifer Wexton in there so bad they can taste it they want their\nLeftist that seeing so much that they will actually conducted poll make things up doing in such a way to get results that they want so they could put it out there and say the races over don't get top start getting money and don't work for her\nIt's a lost cause so they do a fishing pole in order to do things now it's unbelievable nobody\nIn that district is gonna look you in the eye and say that they think Jennifer what that has a third gene point lead this rates is tied and I think Tom's started going to win but why should probably start to care do not own up to any of this uh neither one of the New York times or ABC News or read the remnants NBC\nOr any of the polling companies that are in cahoots with a fake news\nIt should drive inclusion to make you not want to do anything to help\nIf you're in the ... district go volunteer\nFor costs like she is going to win this race if you get\nOut and help her but they already on a daily basis and that's why the president says it's fake news editor he says it's an enemy of the people when you lie to the people at masquerading as a legitimate news network with a legitimate poll it's not\nAn enemy how would you define that this poll for the poster so\nAstronaut that even western most staunchest supporters think it's a joke because they know it's not true so what are we just let me just ask your question if they're putting out purposely putting out the\nInformation driving it so that would make is that not\nThe people it's certainly hey it's an enemy the truth mainly the president needs to change one word it's an enemy of the truth it's certainly an enemy of fact\nIt is unbelievable they're doing it again they didn't do as a sixteen and they're doing it again things were not think do you know the job with the Democrats have to learn nothing from two thousand sixteen the legacy media has learned nothing in fact what they're doing now is they can't believe they were wrong\nAnd so they're doubling down and here's the thing if the Republicans don't relinquish the house the legacy media after two elections in a row going all aimed for the Democrats and losing them both on a federal\nLevel will become irrelevant there's one of the stakes were there were so high\nThere'll be coming relevant I'm more relevant that they are 'cause I certainly tell you the truth good bad or roughly\nDon't become a relevant they are doubling and tripling down on more than ...\nOr more fake polls and more fake news again should drive the results they want I don't like they again and it's going to backfire\nAnd get\nI mean they actually think that somebody sending pipe bombs that don't go off at like a change the trajectory the election\nIn general why we're going to get an economic report coming\nForty five minutes that it's going to show
