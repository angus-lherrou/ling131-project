coming in now sentinel folks market down learn where central responsible for thirty thousand\nJumped last year it's coming in increasing these are our southern border to manufacture in China but there is an infringement talking about the forties and coming into our communities through the southern border and it needs to stop this is a failure or the Democrats\nA life changing said he would do a deal and the dreamers he wanted to end chain migration\nThe actual content that they have them ever again [noise]\n\n\nRadio network is jobs the mob\nCaravan that's what we have right now and we have polls and here's my narrative Mike\n\nHere comes less than we've got twelve days to the midterms your vote Republican you're voting for jobs you're voting for economic prosperity you're voting for a continuation\nOf the America First policies policies led by Donald J Trump you vote for the Democrats you're voting for mobs and caravans that's it and you want to turn the clock back on the tax\nCuts and everything else [noise] now what you're going to have to endure through the next twelve days are fake polls because now we have a new system in the United states ladies and gentlemen you know it's fake news is that we have to take polls we have big polls to drive thinks news\nTo draw the conclusion let me say it again\nIn the next twelve days be very wary of what the legacy meaning you're gonna do here's what the legacy media it's going to continue to do the New York times CNN\nThe fake news state polls driving fake news for a fake narrative perfect conclusion it's all fake\n\nAnd you're going to get the truth right here from your got ... of the truth in America and that's\nMe when CNN puts a poll out showing mayor Gillum in Florida or by twelve point to override the standards and he's a socialist that is absurdity\nBeyond belief that sort of real poll none of these polls are real not one of them are real they did this thing or two thousand six thinking that they're going to do it again and these are not polls to disseminate legitimate\nInformation these are polls to drive a result so you're going to get from the legacy media fake news\nWith fake polls\nTo drive the narrative to get a fix inclusion and here's what they want you to do they're going to continue to tell you and lie to you what these polls that they take with fake metrics and false information these are pushed falls to try to get a result and here's what you're going to get you going to get a constant\nDrumbeat for the next twelve they just like they did in November two thousand sixteen staying there is a blue wave coming in\nThe Democrats are going to win a hundred seats the generic numbers have widened to Fifteen or the Republicans are depressed don't bother to work don't hear that a flyer don't knock on doors don't make phone calls don't do anything because look the polling numbers show the Republicans are cooked and so why waste your time go enjoy the\nWell they don't want you to be enthusiastic so they're going to lie to you what state polls driving fake news to get a fake narratives and at the end of the day they want a fake inclusion drawn\nSo they can get their own think result posed by these latest the fake news ers are no longer to disseminate legitimate information and inform the public they are done to drive a narrative\nTo buttress whenever result they want and so that's why I've been telling you per week you just take one district\nAnd that's the attempted Virginia just one and I've been telling you for weeks Barbara Comstock either tighter head and she's going to win that race it finally a poll come out showing a tide finally some legit poll somewhere or the other fake news polls\nShowed her down by Fifteen\nAnd I knew for a fact that was not true same thing now they're showing spanberger ahead of the seven fake they're showing coal burning had recommended up bring them it's got to win that race by double digits they want to press Republican turnout and depressed her volunteers and\nThey do that by lying to you\nOr we're beyond fake news now\nNow we have the networks of the legacy media that won't even report certain news items if they think it's going to interfere with your narrative talking points of the day which is to defeat Trump and the Republicans\nAnd look I Know there's a lot of Republicans out there that drive you nuts and you don't want to vote for them and they voted this way or they voted that way they didn't do this or they didn't do that or there was some in fight or a primary fight or a few going on\nYou got to twelve days here's my thing let's unite now let's keep the house Republican let's build\nThe Republican majority in the U.S Senate so President Trump continue his butt nominal America First policies and keep this country moving ahead what should we do that on November ... then we can fight again let's wait now quite later\nOh I don't like this one because he didn't he big tent okay whatever go fight with Dave later oh I don't like Scott Taylor 'cause he beat Randy Forbes\nI fight with them later oh I don't like Barbara cushy voted this way or that\nOne so I'm going to vote no I'm going to vote for nobody or I'm going to vote libertarian are better stay home it's ridiculous right now what Trump if you're a Trump supporter\nTrump needs a Republican majority period doesn't matter what it needs Republican majority you want to pick your petty fight we all have\nThem I get it do it later\nA lot of people not getting on my show that I have you did with and you know who they are not going to mention their names and they come on now every single week why\n\nBecause we are we are working against hundred million dollars in swat money hundreds of millions of dollars from\nThe Hollywood crazy ... was left wing or Z and\nThe entire fake news legacy media network which has a line now behind the Democrats and so that's what you're fighting so fake news is out there and I'm going to say that again you're going to get spanked polls which is fake news to drive a fake narrative\nTo get a fake inclusion and the end game is to get the result they want which is Democrats to take power so they can do what roll back the tax cut impeached Trump go further with investigations\nInvestigate Kavanaugh tied the country up\n\nSo that's my advice you get involved do something to go to tax cuts worked out ... I don't care what you do remember how happy you were that night Trump won those of you that\nAre Trump fans out out there remember how static you were that night and I know the never Trump or his hated it in the Clinton people and the Democrats and listen to my show I Know it all drug you're nuts but for those\nThat were relievers like me in ... member happy or federal goes away November ... at two AM if we lose because we're not able to do anything and then it it ... it comes back to twenty twenty yet\nWe're real opportunity to fix things in this country\nAnd the Democrats don't want to talk about the economy they don't talk about job they want to talk about economic growth they don't talk about business confidence they don't want to talk about all the great things the president is doing they don't want to talk about ISIS is on the run they don't want to talk about the fact that\nNorth Korea has been shut off the missile in months they don't want to talk about the fact that Trump has unilaterally renegotiated every bad trade deal with all this money coming in from time to talk about that\nThere weren't talking about the fact that he renegotiated after and Mexico caved and then candidate caved and sort our way we get better deals you you just want to talk about the fact that the Chinese economy is tanking\nBreaking news is our town hall died on the street or in the

politically correct guy he makes fun of these people what the big deal but again when you talk about mockery about going after people it's again I think people think what is going on\nYou know like any of these Democrats in Congress and your going to get the most of the left wing radical agenda that you could possibly think up and if you don't like this caravan\nOur immigration laws and our inability to cope what was the loopholes or a magnet\nAttracting these people we have does anyone know who's funding there's no this is actually got to come out my take is it's kind of\nCome out before the election and I'm not even going to conjecture about who was fun to get an organizing it but somebody it I mean ten thousand people just don't show up\nOn a two thousand miles march in the heat somebody is organizing this paying for it funding it\nThere's there's water there's clothing their shoes nobody's paying for this\nYou're only conjecture right over to the facts are in it\nBut what appears to be is probably people that thought that this\nWould be the end all be all for the Republican because we'd have cages after zero tolerance that the border which proved to be a public relations catastrophe for Trump and the Republicans\nBut\nIt's gotten too big they ... they wanted maybe a thousand people now it's got to be it's going to be Fifteen thousand by the time it's done now it's an invasion and that one of the Democrats trying to do was blown up in their face and it's their policies and their loopholes\nThat have been the reason that's being center\nI mean these migrants who were coming in this in Beijing every caravan they know the law they have the schools are US law and the loopholes you step what you put one little tow over that border and us laws protect you was that crazy those are the laws you're protected\nLet's go to a quick or from our sponsors Mike and I'll be right back on the job triggers radio network truck to truck in the truth across America stay with us\n[noise] punted this how many times have you been in Congress teaching and here's someone said that they used to be Catholic it happens to me more often than I'd like to admit to when I get this statement I had to have someone could ever church founded by Jesus Christ [noise] did they leave to go to an end the Christian denomination\nIt may have been or music or better fellowship [noise] what did they joined a congregation has better preaching did they leave because the scandal in the church and find a place of worship led by and I didn't think about this [noise] no I think the church or the has to print\nThis crisis in Ukraine [noise] newer they're non NATO or they didn't have many Asians and they had better music better fellowship and better preaching\nTo not have the real question in the [noise] most intimate experience with the [noise] never\nAlways stayed with teeth [noise] I'm Kelly and it's kind of a moment is brought he kept the patch the ministry [noise]\n\nNancy Pelosi and our allies are spending more than ten million dollars to elect Jennifer Wexton they've promised to raise our taxes my salary and then when they need to two thousand tiny

I'm Barbara Comstock candidate for Congress and I approve this message pay for his eye contact\nFor Congress [noise] don't touch that dial you've found your home with the truth\nDoing my own [laughter] with\nThe best analysis in America you can handle the truth and now back to the John ... a great to have you\nBack here and the judge rivers radio network more than seven million people have already voted in the mid term elections and it looks like the turnout is up for Republicans Democrats and independents are like now the thing that they would have to report this was a true but the kind of spin Michigan it'd be fun next twelve days at the Democratic blue wave\nCrumble nothing because the Republicans are going to hold the house now I'm convinced that my five and they're going to gain five seats in the Senate by the number to remember five Democrats lose five seats in the Senate and come\nWithin five seats of power in the house but Republicans hold on by five five that number\nGo play it on the power ball five by by pot you're good\nSo uh so far more people like you to vote Republican are thought to have cast ballots but uh the New York times and telling you oh don't draw any conclusions or don't join the conclusions it's so good for the Democrats even\nRepublican turnout it's bigger than ever in the early voting precincts that's an anomaly they say look at\nOur polls we have every Democrat winning everywhere and history of ever\nThe um meantime the show the affair um\nSee aren't you glad I covered this stuff right you don't want it to blow it under the carpet and didn't\nMatter and then and I say it was a big deal and then I covered for two weeks straight nonstop and now look it's a bigger mess than ever that's why you joined me in and out the fake news right so what's happening with this so uh yesterday the a\nCrown prince of Saudi Arabia who seems to be responsible for this Mohammed bin\nSolving who was incompetent that I'm going to say at the guys are talking to me that Trump's problem with this guy and Jared Kurdish\nTerrorist problem with the thirty three year old her crown princes you simply incompetent so now they don't trust them I don't know about Jared I've no idea but I don't think the president ... trust them I don't think he believes them and I don't think he's competing and here's the problem with Trump when he doesn't think you're\nConfident then you're in big trouble if we can deal with the not trusting thing he can like navigators way through that but if he thinks they're not\nCompetent forget it you're done and that's I think that's the conclusion\nThe president is drawing a day they for a though John ate and ate for eight oh five six or six and if you want to comment on fake polls fake news and fake narrative coming out of the lake\nUh\nMe too I'm a single ticket holder in South Carolina we understand one the may give ... million\nJillion dollars jackpot billions of dollars\nOne point six billion with a one time cash option a nine hundred and Thirteen point seven million I think I'd take the head where do you think you get the shot imagine getting the ticket and like you see the numbers and you're you're reading the numbers at the bottom and\nGot that one got that one got that one got that one got that one of my all my God I just wonder what point six till where do you think about\nThat like I don't think we'd be on the radio the next [laughter] I'd probably finished out through the election and that would be at that it'd be like see it you never hear or see for me again the president calling NBS\nAs a cover up the worst cover up ever like the Keystone Cops President Trump's assistant worst cover up\nEver it's just like a bunch of bumbling fools and then they tried to cover it up but that was a disaster now they probably pieces of the body that\nReading the garden of the Capitol\nI mean you just can't get them and then this they botched every this isn't a complete macho Reno and when the president says the worst cover up ever well here's here's what you draw from that he met we talked to Gina Haspel\nWho went to this damn bowl turkey or CIA director you have\nTo assume that uh she gave them enough information for him to make the statement the worst cover up ever which means he gave her information that the Saudis tried to cover it up and I think it's even more to anybody would have a brain in\nTheir head that Mohammed bin Salman was not calling the shots so to simply say was wrote people gone awry as ridiculous they planned\nThat they had body doubles their they blow it and the guys incompetent because everything he touches a disaster\nSimple\nAnd the president's gonna react when that follow the facts come out by pulling visas and putting various sanctions are those that were involved\nAs you should\nBut I think the relationship with the Saudis going forward or is not going to be based on some grand\nRelational a reality between Jared Kushner and Mohammed bin Salman I think President Trump is probably done with this guy we're not going to change anything\nIt's not going to affect the arms sales balance of power in the middle east we're not going to cancel treaties are polite of deals but I think going forward it's going to be very difficult for President Trump to take Mohammed bin Salman seriously because I Believe after the series of events\nHe now believes he is just simply and confident\nJohn ... radio network trucking the truth everyday right here you're Godzilla of the truth that America watched the fake news think polls there'll be coming at you every single day telling you how you're going to lose stay with us\n\nYour Godzilla of the truth in America you're commander commonsense great to have you with us it is Wednesday ten twenty four that means twelve days of the biggest midterm elections in history to the crisis our border right now with the caravan continues to move towards in Beijing every status of the United states recent illegal limited immigration data\nIs very clear there's an urgent need to address the crisis at our border park like catch and release loopholes backed by Democrats\n\nDemocrats want mobs Republicans want jobs Democrats want illegal immigration Caribbean invasion along with a Goldman Sachs lower Manhattan\nDonor big ego driven gangster banks are Republicans in New York that's the holy allies of all time this surge of aliens coming into the United states is a direct result of an outdated laws demanding what it's called catch and release\n\nNow customs and border protection get to the apprehended Ninety five thousand Central Americans as part of family unit at the border last year\nOkay so customs\nAnd border protection apprehended Ninety five thousand Central Americans who came as part of family units at the border last year you know how many of them are in the United states now\nNinety nine percent\nI just want you to grasp the reality of the situation Ninety five thousand were apprehended Ninety nine percent are still in the United states\nJust last year\nThis is what I've been saying our laws are such you don't understand that you've touched foot on us soil you're you as an illegal war breaker we have other laws that protect your\nIt's crazy customs\nAnd border patrol apprehended thirty two thousand unaccompanied minors from the northern triangle of sexual America last year you know how many are in the U.S today Ninety eight percent the number of illegal aliens family you know that we can remove in the year\n\nIs roughly equivalent to the number that come over our border illegally in today's\nToday's these\nDemocratic back loopholes for the release of apprehended aliens from Central America is outrageous these catch and release laws in court rulings have resulted\nI'm from Central America who arrive at the border with them die of San Francisco push to\nSee what she called the trafficking victims protection reorganization which prevents the speeding return of unaccompanied minors from not contiguous countries\n\nJudicial orders interpreting and Clinton area consent decree known as the poorest settlement agreement blocked they blocked the US's ability to detain and removed alien family you're in you're only going to do is covered the kid you're in it doesn't matter\nThat you broke the law here for the Fisher thing on believe will pull him facility of our for walks by stepping foot in the United states without any legal status or paperwork you break the law but as soon as you break\nThat law there's other laws that protect you so you can't be remote so the first law that you broke doesn't matter because all the other laws protect your status then you can't be thrown back then you can only be detained for twenty days match\nYou could only be with your child for twenty days Matt\nWhat's that twenty days is that you got to be released you're not released back into the country you came from your not repatriate it you're simply released into the interior the United states [laughter] I mean just the crazy there's no\nPoint for me that's why the\nPresident wants the oil I mean this is the most interesting thing you didn't even realize until you dig into these laws what they are this is the most outrageous thing into it you can imagine the\nEffect is that the U.S government is forced to release entire\nFamily units in the interior of the United states after which they failed to appear pork court hearings they're just really yet they came here legally and broke the law but then other laws that the Democrats fact protect them because they want\nOpen borders because eventually every one of these people will vote for Democrats and they will work for them\nAnd so here's the plan Letterman so the Democrats getting eventually have a permanent majority and who is complicit Wall Street donor gangster\nGangster Republican 'cause they want cheap labor and hey all of their real estate holdings guess what they got to live somewhere where the government pays direct\nWhere's that money go to shareholders of their companies for bigger bonuses they're living in a mansion with guards and\nSchool is overrun by\nChildren who don't speak English and are\nOn welfare that you're paying for and try to go to the phone line on the first of the month and see how that works out for you it's just I mean it's ... it's unbelievable\nThe government is how we're listening to anything that's what I keep sake you argue with people said oh do this do that just you can do nothing you have laws\nEighty percent\nEighty percent of illegal aliens claiming a fear of return to their home country get through the initial credible fear screening\nWas this three phases of a silent\nBut only twenty percent of those claiming asylum actually ended up being granted it but it doesn't matter because all you have to do is to claim asylum reached the first eighty percent threshold and you're done\n\nRegardless Ninety nine percent of asylum seekers family units are able to remain in the United states to all you have to do is get your foot over the border you're caught fine claim asylum your route Ninety nine percent are really\nAfter twenty days max never be seen from a heard from again\nIllegal immigration in this country has gone from a dramatic shift from what used to be mostly single adults from Mexico now to Central American family you and it's an unaccompanied\nMinors in fiscal year two thousand Ninety eight percent of aliens apprehended by the United states at the border were from Mexico get that that was two thousand and two years later sixty percent are from Central America open border obstruction or\n... or the congressional Democrats who saline solution to the crisis\nHas been obstruction because they don't want to solve it\nFeinstein's bill would effectively get amnesty to any legal alley in court within a hundred miles of the border

caught you're really\nJust get a minor by the way of miners fighters under Eighteen\n[laughter] by being sanity I mean we have an open borders country that is now being exploited by this camera ban which is gonna hit with ten thousand people and the country can't do anything to stop it because of the actor\nNine hard that we have so even though you break the law into getting and five other law protects you\nAfter you break the law and you can't be deported or returned is this the most crazy insane thing you've ever seen and I want to know why there's ten\nThousand invaders coming and you
