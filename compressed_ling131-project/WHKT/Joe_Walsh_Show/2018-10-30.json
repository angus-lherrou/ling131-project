rhetoric\n[noise] what do you have to understand how\nGreat what they see what they're trying to blame instead of blaming themselves you know what would they want to accept\nThe election when they got in the streets in any of those was marching to the Spanish that's just part of the things that they support what made low the White House seat when you do\nYou feel you understand this is merely the

you\nGet married if you\nCould use it when you're looking for that\n\n\nThere's one Godzilla the truth and that to me it's great to have you with us today with a fake news regarded again with state polls coming\nIt's getting out of the news cycle and now we get another one right\nNow I just I I don't know if there's some crazy person is doing it but it just seems awfully hot sweaty and\nHere's the thing is the Democrats\nThe Schumer is the the whole crowd that whole mob over there that were screaming\nWe must have the FBI investigate before we can vote on Kavanaugh there must be a full investigation before we can vote on him before we can decide whether he should uh be you know the sense of the Supreme Court right\nThe same thing we must have an FBI investigation before we can let that happen\nThey're not even waiting for the FBI to investigate where these bombs are coming from before they start blaming President Trump declared President Trump guilty responsible for the whole thing they're not waiting for the FBI to investigate these are the same people that three weeks ago said we cannot do anything\nUntil yesterday I finish in the investigation so I mean they were total hypocrites it it is absolutely\nIrresponsible or beyond counterproductive it's it's absolutely\nYou're responsible for them to be saying this is all about because of the President Trump\nUh they're they're trying to they're trying to score political points at which you have to ask who benefits from these bombs that's all I'm not saying who did it it it's\nObviously some crazy person because no sane person sends bombs or fake bombs through the mail we don't know the bombs are real are fake or\nThey emptied out some firecrackers put it in a in a in the toilet paper two and a a attacks the digital watch to it to make it look like a scary thing we don't all the time it's easy to scare people what can I tell you\nWe don't know and I'm not going to go down\nThat road what I can say is whoever did it is crazy in one way or another whether they're certify bleed can be committed to an institution crazy or just that they've got a screw loose you don't do that kind of normal people well adjusted people don't do that okay by definition\nYou cannot have the column today Barry makes the point that when John Kennedy was assassinated\nWe Harvey Oswald who defected to the Soviet Union was pro Cuba or he was\nFound to be the shooter or yet who got blamed for the John birth society and all the conservative\nSo this is not the first time that the guilt by association or let's let's let's slammed the conservative what's blame everything on conservatives not the first time it's been done before we even know who actually\nSend these packages\nAnd uh I think Sarah Sanders had it right we should be coming together the president is calling for unity dialing down their rhetoric a and the Democrats are going in the opposite direction they're they're they're blaming the president unequivocal early no question about it taking no responsibility whatsoever\nFor calling the guy look at the sky Brennan the president's guilty of trees\nOr what's the what's the penalty for treason that he's basically a former head of the CIA had been out they're calling for the president to be known by the neck until dead and this is not considered inflammatory rhetoric I it's\nIt it's disgusting it's the whole thing is it's just just hypocritical these people will go down in the ... as the all time great is hypocrites\nJust ask you something I'm sure it is I think it makes a great analogy places as of the Democrats who cried and screens and whine about traveling\nGetting the FBI not investigating everything why don't we just wait here I mean the FBI seems to be holding again in southern Florida that got to come up with a report that he's got to find out the answer why not just weights\nRight exactly how about everybody say calm down let's we got we we have the FBI on the case unless this guy was a guy or gal or or or walk or whatever [laughter] whatever it was that created these packages\nUnless that entered the was a very very very sophisticated person a table and buy it and if they were very sophisticated they were able to cover their tracks\nBut considering the number of packages delivered to these various places coming out of one place\nAnd there are a lot of clues there and I'm confident that the FBI will be able to figure something out here and find out who did it for narrow it down and the fact that they use Debbie Wasserman Schultz has a return address that's kind of interesting in itself Debbie Wasserman Schultz is the one who was forced to\nStep down from head of the\nDemocratic National committee a big cause she had been reading the system for Hillary against Bernie I don't know what that means but it's sort of an interesting clue you know maybe somebody thought that was funny to use her name out all these bombs I don't\nKnow uh but my point is is unless this was a very sophisticated operation that they knew how to cover their tracks\nAt every step of the way you've got twelve packages now that the FBI is investigating it let's wait for the FBI to figure this out to come up with something yeah why not wait before you start\nA and and why not why are they not waiting because they want to politicize the Democrats are missing no opportunity to score political points on this\nWorld it's uh\nWait I mean that's where everybody's saying let's wait meantime let's get to let's get the economy will get to the Taliban invasion after the bottom of the hour a\nBut let's get to the economic numbers that just came out the gross domestic product GDP growing another three and a half percent now let me just say what this means right this is the first time that we have had\nBack to back quarters or in a very long time of of of over three and a half percent growth back to back and consumer confidence uh up at an all time I can super spending was four percent another great a\nQuarter of economic growth and this is more bad news for the damn thing I Want to talk about this that they don't want to talk about this economy or jobs or the gross so what did they talk about\nThey talk well they talk about it and they've got this wonderful thing to talk about this horrible thing you're talking about here with the with the bombs and they talk about\nThe president again they're falling in they don't realize they're falling into a trap and and it's their own trap the trap of their own making\nPeople don't want to hear the Democrats talk\nAbout the president's they want to hear Democrats Republicans the politicians in Washington talk about what they're what the politicians are going to do for them to make their life better write what I I I go to work every\nDay I got a family to support I got a job I'd like to get a raise what are you going to do to make that happen how are you gonna make my life better easier make me rich uh make make make my kids you know healthier talking\nAbout President Trump talking about you're a Native American DNA doesn't do that [laughter]\nI wouldn't do that you argue about President Trump\nAre causing the bomb scare doesn't do that so they are going back to the for the last two years old I've been talking about is President Trump is a Russian agent and now they're President Trump as a Russian agent who creates bomb scares\nI mean they're they're they're not doing themselves any favors\nThe end and on the other side I mean it burns very clear jobs not mom's a President Trump from the Trump Administration have created the best economic conditions in this country\nIn in the generation the best we've seen in its ten twenty\nYears and that goes along the way that that dancers\nPeople's questions what have you done for me lately you've gotten me a job you've gotten me a raise you've gotten my kids all food stamp she got my kids out of the basement there on their own now great thank you very much\nLet me ask you something [noise] uh I'm going to pose this question and then you're going to answer it when it gets back so stay with us for another segment you got to get the bottom of the hour but I'm going to ask you when he gets back you know you and I were Trump Tower for the last two weeks of the campaign\nAll over again I mean I mean\nIt was all the time\nOut of the hills coming out of a bally's\nComing out of the towns coming out of harm's coming to vote for Trump that have never voted before and uh so yeah it is there is a feeling of days or move here all of these national generic ballot polls are meaningless national election other\nGirls I I mean this whole thing falls talking all day about the Washington Post poll that came out yesterday\nThat shows that are for whites than I had a Barbara Comstock Virginia sense district like Thirteen last question in life when she should she is a favorite no doubt that's a very tough districts out for the Republicans can win barbers every internal poll that the Republicans have\nFrom the White House to the CDC to Barbara\nDown shows the race question does not heavy Thirteen points but this is what the Washington Post jobs they get a uh\nThey get a ridiculous methodology to get a fake polls get a fake analysis of it to do fake news to get a fake inclusion drawn so they can continue on with their fake narrative and like we've already been down this path so now I'm going to start holding them on how ridiculous that isn't their job right now it's the same\nSex by the way you're on the John Silver's radio network I Am your Godzilla of the truth in America were eleven days out to the biggest mid term election ever Curtis Ellis is with us She's a senior policy adviser for America first policies this segment you buy the job creators network you know folks\nI've been saying this is about turnout\nAnd Curtis says the same thing the upcoming election measurements may be the most important you've ever seen there's a lot of the ballots besides your candidate your tax cuts are on the ballot the American economy grew in another three and a half percent on the ballot or great back our renaissance\nThat's on the ballot to the wall or something about your jobs are on the\nBallot your jobs that they just try to go down to the basement south on the ballot your race your wages your case\nThat small business owners like me tax cuts uh yeah that's about it and here's the biggest issue on the ballot eleven days who's in charge of America's future politicians and corrupted crafts at the state of Washington DC or you know if you want to preserve the victories\nOf the past two years I'm urging you've got to get involved this November yeah I Know you've got to vote yes I Know you've got to do early voting I Know that\nI can count on you for that but you got to do more do you think the choice election dot com drinking choice the elections out jobs they'll make it easy for you to get involved you can make calls you can send emails you can send text you knock on doors\nYour to do that okay you can take your neighbor to the polls I don't have a car trouble you know I think the costs\nDot com because the only way you lose a two thousand\nEighteen is if you don't show up and you don't work if you turn out and you volunteer you're going to win big joins us every vote matters big choice elections that Tom junior part don't get out of work or the other guys and I don't\nEver six scored a big choice do you like to do this message pay for an authorized by the job creators network we want to welcome all of our listeners other brand new talk station in West Rick rich in ... county you won't have replaced by the ... and\nStay with us to talk show talks all these things are pretty close yeah we started with coverage right where they just ruptures after me and Curtis just toss the\nCan't wait for that he's not tend to see the party to fighting Joe ... show where with Curtis Ellis is a senior advisor for its policies curse of the caravan\nSo let's get to the caravan the march on I ... the the bombs were there they're going to bomb rushed the border it's a yeah\nI don't want to say one more thing about the uh about the election because you just said it's about turnout\nAnd that's what this is all about you've got the polls you've got all this nonsense polls you've got this that it's about identifying voters [noise] sometimes pockets of twenty five voters here that the borders they're Seventy five voters they're\nA hundred there distinct pockets of voters that are on our\nSide in identifying them and getting them out to the polls that's what this was going to come down to that's what it's coming down to\nThe Republican National committee and others are doing a great job of that and uh that's what's going to determine that uh as much as old as probably more than all the TV ads and\nEverything else so I encourage everyone to go out and vote and bring your friends and if they're going to vote for the other side don't bring them okay she hopes for letting the air out of their tires on\nOh no no don't do that we don't you know do we encourage your look\nIf you're if you have a democratic neighbor and they're going to go all the way down and they can't just suppose you don't have a ride to the polls do the right thing\nOut here so nice just to get them you know what we want every vote to everybody that as an opportunity to go get him out and get them a couple of coffee because at the end of this they're still your neighbor that's right\nThere's a neighbors are still Americans were in this together folks right runners together and you know what you can disagree and I said man yes oh God okay in\nThe caravan now that what you're out of the ... there that's a good idea but [laughter]\nBut the Taliban is very different because I think okay how do we stop it\nHow do we stop it don't let them in the country don't let them in the country bigger the game as they're trying to they're going to try to game the system once they set foot on American soil they claim asylum there they've all been taught to say the words credible fear\nFear of having to live off mangoes and bananas\nA rather than a food stamps and welfare a so once they get to the United states is set foot on American soil and say the words credible fear they qualified for that triggers the whole asylum seeking\nProcedure and once they're in ... in the trial um seeking procedure\nAll of the interlocking court cases and rulings and judges by these\nDeep state judges say you can't hold them you can't detain them you have to release them and give them a date to appear and they never appear they disappeared they just disappear into the woodwork they get hired by corrupt big business bosses want cheap labor\nThey get sheltered by corrupt sentimental with\nWho think oh let's invite the entire world to live in America that's going to do everybody a great big favor and it just becomes a big mess\nSo the way to stop them to not let them into the United states in the first place to stop them at the border build the wall to wall literally and figuratively President Trump is sending\nUp to a thousand troops deploying the military on the border uh that's what the military is supposed to do defend our country and I think we're going to defend the country in Afghanistan of the country in Iraq\nAnd defend the country in Djibouti where we have troops how about we defend the country in Tijuana in Mexico the Mexican border and in Texas\nThat's right and in San Diego and everything else we need to build his wall and the president determined he says I'm going to stop this because I think the president Curtis understands I'm almost out of time here but I think he understands that\nIt's Fifteen thousand today and tomorrow it's got to be a hundred and fifty thousand at that point five million because this is one thing that makes sense to me a while back that these are was riveting and then I got to take off you said\nThat you said yours four billion people in the world that all want to come to the United states so you must let them all then and then you don't have a country you have a land that's basically it\nAmount of time on the same results for being with us John

Christopher Newport university releasing a new poll on the seventh district as it hits the final weeks are\nAnd they're likely voter model Democrat Abigail Spanberger and Republican incumbent David ...\nOr in a statistical dead heat forty five ... brat forty six the spanberger now let me tell you why this is great news\nFor the ... campaign everything in your poll ever done every single one favors the Democrats they over sample Democrats because it was part of the fake news networks that\nTries to do big holes in order to get a result and they just only go so far so that is good news for\nI mean what can you how did you try to your good ... good shape a\nThere's a six they have a sixteen for an enthusiast enthusiast some gap for a\nSpanberger as Seventy eight percent of Democrats are very enthusiastic about voting versus sixty two percent of Republicans well that's because they have to deal with Corey Stewart on the top of the ballots which is hurting\n\nBecause nobody is excited about Corey Stewart\nNo one well let's go vote for\nCory stores oh let's see if they're cutting the coverage live or that I can take the money for voting for the\nUnbelievable\nWhile forty seven percent of voters in the seventh district of rules of the job the President Trump is doing fifty one percent disapprove that's not that big of a cap it really really isn't in the Senate contest a chain is up by five not that big of a gap either\n\nCertainly hurting right now use the good news for brought a disgrace he's got to piece of good news number what he's got a ... point lead among independents ... point lead and that's not\nGoing away and that's the only gonna get bigger so their sibling if you have an eight point lead among independents and you get out to Republican base in the seventh district you went that's why a\nSpan burgers you got to be excited about this whole but then when you look at the cross steps I think this is great news resent that would've been better if it was a place that seem to get what she calls from Clinton said he'll be joining us in about\nTwenty minutes are always due to the Democrats are matter what\nRepublicans always outperform their poll regardless of where it is always\nThe good news for Brett what your race has got to be very very close and we've been saying that it's a one or two points race from the beginning here's the other hand there's\nA there's a libertarian in the rice Joseph ... who has four percent if you're voting for Walton what the\nHell are you doing things vote for Walton in this race is a vote for Abigail Spanberger period\nThat if you want to vote spanberger voters member\n\nIf you want to vote for days and ... votes for David ... foot and\nVote for a walk the libertarian at four percent you might as well in that district and the Democrats\nAs it is that if that's what you want to do\nThat's what your four percent vote for walking and I guess you know the good news for rats libertarian votes in grad school districts collapse on election day because at the end of the day\nYou're going in there and you're saying why waste my vote now than it is a little bit different Matt waters is the libertarian candidate there are simply people they cannot vote for Cory stores they just can't do it there are Republicans that tend to not vote for Cory stores because they just don't like the guy\nThat so what was going to get a big role but that's a little bit different you get down to the district level and\nJoel can't win and so for for central walk and there's a problem for breath because take him out of there Ninety nine percent of those are going to say Ninety five percent but again\nIf you if you want to vote for Abigail have at least getting police vote for somebody in that\nDistrict who could win this this and this makes no sense so if the wall and vote collapses to the typical one percent set a libertarian yes in these races or two percent of that other to present you go to Brad\nSo uh that's why there's some good news but look this is that this is a very hard fought just right now are we going to be doing or election night show here\nAs a brand headquarters or I Will not be there I'll be calling again every so often but Chris action will be running the show or people will be there but I Will not be there a\nNumber of already booked on TV that night all

us at\nNine forty so quite the show plus your calls thinking for eight oh John in in in for you know five six for six and let me just say that uh\nAs far as blaming anybody for these horrific events over the weekend that especially in the\nPrimary Pittsburgh and all those people just run down in cold blood police saying it was one of the most horrible crime scene as they've ever seen our heart goes out in our prayers go out to these families and it's just it's just horrible\nI mean you should be able to go in your place of worship and pray without getting your head blown off it's sick or what is going on in this country man\nAnd I just it would be nice for wants to see the left and the Trump theaters not try to take everything into politics or we've got to get rid of guards are we got to get rid of Trump or woods Trump's fault it's not in school\nNow we we have crazy people it's crazy people fall\nAnd the only thing that I heard that I thought it made sense about what to do about this is the president said probably she should've been an armed guard there for those in there if somebody was carrying\nThey could have stopped it I mean that's kind of stopped crazy people started was nuts and he posted all kinds of hate on social media I mean\nThese people are just I don't know what happens to them but it's a sad state of the United states as I say we can't go sixty days of that was one of these\nIt's really sick\nIt's we're in a very sick time in our society no question about it John treasuries radio network truck the truth across America live in the swamp I'll be right back Dr quitting kids coming up give it a writer\n\n\n[noise]\n\n\nThe man behind the whole Dr Quentin Kidd from Christopher Newport University He is the chairman of the Judy watching center on politics and Newport university now doing a some very extensive polling they hold attempt the second and now\nWith the seven at the end Dr King's great to have you with us\n\nAre you there I'm here in you or me yes oh yeah okay we got a doctor said okay\nSo you're you hold down and it's pretty pretty interesting\nYeah I mean we have a ... as you know we when we've been going to graduate races around Virginia we've been putting out two models a likely voter law when they committed voter model and the difference between those two miles is how enthusiastic um sometimes without respondents are\nAnd how uh how much they say they're likely to go vote and soda a likely voter model is people who have a history of voting but they um but they may be very enthusiastic\nAbout it and they may not be not very enthusiastic and then they committed voter model is that same history of voting for people who say they are very committed and they're very likely to go vote in a likely voter\nModel we have a um in both models we\nHave a statistical tie in this race in a likely voter model we have spanberger at forty six brat at forty five and importantly the libertarian Joseph wall and taking four percent of the vote in a committed voter models we have a brat\nAt forty five spanberger forty eight in walnut libertarian taking three percent and so this may be a race where um the third party libertarian candidate actually plays a role as it ends up being\nYou know within a point or two at a on election night\nFour percent vote for Joe Walsh stunned me as I look at your whole uh when it first came out of poverty I've seen it over the course taps Dr Kim only had a half\nHour here and I've been on the air but\nWhen you get a libertarian that has no money that nobody's heard of getting four percent in a district that is so hot like this which is so hotly contested knowing that all the majority of those voters are coming from day they're not going to vote for Abigail\n... why is why is Joe ... add more per cent\nWell there could be there could be a number of reasons um than the most likely reason could be that this is a place where it gets gravel Republicans are parking their votes because they're for whatever reason frustrated and Dave Brat um if you if you happen to be a liberal or a sort of a country club business minded Republican\nYou might not be happy with with Dave Brat necessarily but um you know at the end of the day and they committed voter model he drops and drops down to three percent on a on election night um\nFor congressional races in Virginia where a third party candidate is able to swing an election essentially um and so it'll be interesting to see a lecture night how well wall and you guys um if he does as well as four percent than he is clearly going to have an impact on this race if he doesn't have less of an impact\nWhat normally happens as libertarians and drink rational races is that their votes collapses on election day because people that say they're going to vote for him because they're mad about something funny actually going to vote for like I don't want\nTo waste my vote because it's a low profile race it's another thing when you get some Matt waters the U.S Senate it's higher profile\nLook there's no question there are people on the Republican side that are not going to vote for Cory store on November sixth regardless of the situation because they just can't stand the guy that's just so I Try to get that\nBut I think he's rational race like this or is it jumps house me I Would be jumps out really well\nFor for say well look\nI think a lot of conventional norms are being turned on their heads right now during this um during the Trump era I mean one of the conventional norms are would be the incumbent should be about\nFifty percent right now and if they're not about fifty percent they're in trouble um you know we have granted that's forty five percent I mean by conventional\nNorms I Would say that he's in deep trouble but I'm not convinced that at the end of the day he couldn't pull out a really narrow wins um or you could lose by a really narrow margin I'm In a district where clearly\nIs you know there's a lot of energy but there's a lot of there's a lot of disgruntlement also\nWell it's it's what does it come down to a\nSoccer team when you look at these cross tabs what does this race comes down to if you're just spent a little defunded if you're the ... campaign and you're looking at your home right now they do their own in Charles we we all get that your independence\nHall and they're looking at it now as we speak what message to the ... campaign take from the false you point out certain\nSo the reason the races where it is um there are a couple of factors for why the races where it is Democrats have a sixteen points enthusiasm advantage over Republicans in this poll there's a massive\nEnthusiasm advantage that is overcoming boy is structurally I'm a Republican district um you know at the last thing you want it as you noted Donald Trump beat Hillary Clinton by six points in twenty sixteen you know it's it's this is a Republican district split up costs sixteen enthusiasm\nAdvantage is able to bring into a statistical draw 'em there's a massive gender gap advantage on the females try for spanberger\nAnother male tried for a day Brad hey Brad has a plus Fifteen I'm male advantage spanberger has a plus fourteen female advantage that the twenty nine point spread on gender um and then there's an age difference a standard\nPlus six advantage for older voters and so that's I think that this side I think what's making this so close that democratic as soon as you as an advantage that is being driven that is driving that females that the gender gap in span burgers a favor and the female side\nYou're on the job triggers radio network rely today from your nation's capital of the swap days before the midterms on your Godzilla of the truth in America we're chatting with Dr Quentin Kidd is the director of the ah\nChristopher Newport university Washington Center for public policy as a new poll out today on the seventh district coverage what is your other surprising factors\nTo ask you about is a horse stored in his district only five bigger than that because the state wide lead is about what Nineteen somewhere in there\nSomewhere between Fifteen and twenty depending upon the given pole and they're given day but again I'm Tim Kaine's that in a sort of surprising to me I mean we we put out a poll last week and the second congressional district which\nShows Scott Taylor up in that race and Tim Kaine was leading by five almost six in that district um and in this district Tim Kaine is leading by five these are two\nDistricts by the way that are that are tough for Democrats seconds in the seventh seventh is really difficult for Democrats and so it isn't surprising to me look when I can walk around in two thousand twelve he lost his district by eleven points um and\nAnd then when he you know so this isn't\nIn historically democratic district so for him to be leading at a Republican congressional district by plus five is probably rights given that there are other districts in the state that where he's leading by bigger margins and that sort of driving his wife totals\nYou're on the radio network a hang\nThere with us other

like damn what's Menendez to toss up I was filling up my journal I've had people telling me for months that problem was going to make this a rice I'm from New Jersey so I don't believe any of us all lives as far as I'm concerned but but now\nYou got you got this thing as a as\nThe cook report saying it's a toss up is this real\nYou know I I think what the quick report is doing is they have a really broad definition of a toss up I also consider the Ted Cruz data will lower rates of toss out for 'em\nAnd clearly a Ted Cruz's heavily favored to win I think look I live in New York City every ... the only thing we walked on our local TV is the local news and every single commercial break tense at least one can campaign commercials for\nThat Senate race or the Democrats\nAre just port six million dollars more into the race in the last couple of weeks they are concerned Menendez has terrible favorability ratings are good ones still New Jersey I think it would be a maybe\nNot completely dark seeing how Congress will certainly be a very big surprise when to end as loses that race\nI don't think it's going to lose I think that that's just like those of us from the New Jersey area like come on I'll forget it the thing is it's like people come in I\nThink that's part of the reality of this if this was a strong Republican years something must be different on it I suspect that race will be closer than most other contest in New Jersey but at the end of the day I think the Mendez goes back\nOkay so you mentioned something interesting Scott you said that seven or\nIn your most recent polling that the generic ballot difference between Republicans and Democrats had narrowed\nTo seven and you said is it gives in this environment the Democrats control the house uh obviously the masses even goes higher than seven they have a better chance of what is what\nMean I could do some math what is the number where you would say wow I think Republicans can actually hanging on by one or two or maybe three is that fire was up for what is it\nIt's five to be comfortable with the Republicans could you know and again this is what he's talking about a national doesn't translate directly\nBecause what was the fourth oneself favor to take the house if it's five points are six points then you're trying to cause some territory and then as you move up to seven points at higher but the see the credit or are clearly favored\nThen once I should point out you know we're talking about it being close right now with all of these races by Republican turnout is a bit higher they have a chance to hang on to the house but the other side of it is if the Democratic\nTurnout is higher than project in the Republican stay home for the Democrats forget twenty three seats there you have a chance to get something like forty seats or forty five seats on a very\nGood turnout nice so this turnout within this idea of how\nClose races are is something very important to this hour has come\nRight because uh when you said what I'm going\nHat on here is twelve or God right we all know that so that that just looked legitimate twelve or God so that leaves right eat all I've been seeing the\nNeedle lemon morning when control right and they were just over the races that are too close to ... right now and they're highly\nCompetitive and if the Democrats when liberals want they take control so clearly they have the edge but I also point out says if the Democrats don't win control is they'll still pick up significant getting nobody's thirty one competitive races twenty nine of them are held by Republicans\nRight so they they would have ... as ... and if they run the run the table right that that's where they get that's where they get the forty forty five seats sort of way to pick up right and uh\nWhat so if you do the math for those listening to us right now how tough it is for Republicans hold the house\nIs uh they lose Lebanon of thirty seats that are rights that are tied right now\nActually test they can only lose ten of the thirties after one of the thirty I'm treated at right here in Virginia one is tied whether Republican is slightly ahead of the second district Scottsdale or a day brat Abigail Spanberger tired and then a flex than it had\nTop starch in northern Virginia so in a blue wave Jay dirty the Dems pick up all those as a Republican several good evening or\nThey could win two to three are all three let's get the word is from Elaine Elaine ah it's all according to Scott it's all about Republicans turning out right that's that's not really makes things days it's all about them turning out and what what's your message\nWe we have a couple of races in Virginia specifically where the libertarian is taking votes away from the Republican actress wing it what what is your message to those voters always\nManaged to small business owners in their employees so sad to see 'em economy that we're feeling as ever since the attacks that are

just one side of the most disgusting things I've ever I don't know what this country is comedy too but these crazy people just go into what people are praying and they just kept massacred on a Saturday morning unbelievable joining us now for that\nAnd many other things lives speak from New York you could follow lives that lives speak she's also a contributor to the hill Liz great to have\nIt in the morning thanks for having me on\nWas eight days to the midterms um a lot at stake here all of us were just shocked and dismayed sadness sickened by another massacre and then another place of worship Liz ... what is going on in the United states\nI don't know I think that that really has been a hardening of attitude [noise] um I think there is a banker everywhere and I think you know look I don't think it's new with Donald Trump I think Donald\nTrump was elected in part because of the anger that uh has boy all die against white people refer to as the\nRuling elites or however you want to describe it um and I do think that's true to some degree I think that there's a real feeling amongst a lot of people in this country that they have been ignored brushed aside or as people\nGlobalization a and I'm\nReally not stop to think about what that meant for some other people in the country but you know it it is alarming because we're about as you point out a right to have another election and I'm afraid that you know there's a good chance that the Democrats are going to retake the house of representatives\nAnd the progress that has been made under President Trump and writing some of the wrongs that had prevails a you know it's going to be rolled back I mean I I really think that's such an incredibly dangerous situation and by the way for anyone who thinks that the Democrats might be modified\nBy taking back the house that the firestorm of political activism and hate speech and everything like calmed down forget it because we're going to have an C. plus his speaker one of the most dishonest politicians out there and one of the most ruthless competitor products you know we have people like Maxine\nWaters going to be taking over the house financial services committee\nAnd Adam Schiff taking over the intelligence committee I'm not making these things are those are the ranking members and for ... a a parent\nSays those are the people who are going to be running these committees and what we're in for John is two years at least of endless investigation subpoenas into every aspect or Donald Trump's life and finances\nAnd business organization it's going to be an incredible mess but I think honestly I think people are just going to get angrier and angrier as that goes on\nTo situations it is worth of just things of ships and the Democrats\nOn the heels of this short of this horrific crime\nMean I I just beside myself with what happens is the first believe we're still having this doesn't get out the next day and they go on TV they blame the president for this I mean where does it matter what these people\nI I saw more blame throwing after all the bombs that were sent to Democrats favorites um like light Maxine\nWaters I I I thought after
