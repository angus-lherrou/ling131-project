to its now ten thousand people under ... understand they want to crash the border and just to mention that the United states\nAnd coming as you know the loop holes are such that once they stepped foot in what what do over the Puerto our hands are tied and we can't hold them for over twenty days and then you have to be released so what happens\nAnd the Emirates in Yemen's civil war a and yet the senators yet my colleagues to come down on this one way or the other supported or not is that\nBeing involved in this or do you see it in a different way governor\nThink Congress certainly has a role to play in American foreign policy we we'll talk about a lot so commentators said that they really don't do\nThat it's all up to the president of the executive branch I don't think that's the way the constitution works I think our foreign policy is conducted by the by the president but certainly broadly major influence the Congress also [noise] so ah the point is it legitimate to go to the Congress and have that conversation but they have unlimited power\nTo do that so many things but frankly the they can set a standard that Congress can set a standard if they choose to want to say goodbye to Yemen kitchen put everybody this list including maxed out take a look at ... really is and it said on the southern part of the Arabian Peninsula\nSo if you have Iran to the north and they are so many English a revolution and the civil war down in Yemen you get a Saudi Arabia flanked on boards north and south [noise] uh they can't put up with that and that's why they're trying to defend themselves\nOr war as always horrible particularly in third world country humanitarian impact is awful [noise]\nAh but they make the decision about how they think that they have to protect their\nCountry and that that's really what's going on so the point is they give up a conflict is more complicated first appears on depression\nI Want to get to in order to go to the un written just the other day and one of the things that you said in the piece are you talking about the relationship we have with the Chinese and of course a lot of people and not need a lot of people were predicting that\nChina will eventually overcome the United states as an economic power will be indebted to them in a you have a little bit of a different take on that you want to share that with our audience governor\nYeah yeah I'm just not pessimistic everybody the conventional wisdom in America these days is a bad goes on declining China's off the\nCouch and I just reject that I just don't agree with that at all I think it's the United states has the absolute advantage for the future we're the ones at least so far they have a free economy where are the ones who still have a free country that everybody looks to watch\nUh we're the ones that actually bring material benefits there are system the Chinese have got a real problem on their hands and their problem is you know modern society and the twenty first century they cannot continue to run an authoritarian government and yet that's their vision for the world that's their vision for China\nThat they're going to control the used in the western Pacific in eastern East Asia and I got to control it and they're going to start tearing methods to do that\nAnd in fact you see concentration camps now in western China set up against minorities this kind of brutality cannot last in the twenty first century with the Internet modern media modern communication and ah and frankly are rising middle class in China\nTheir their problem is they're building their middle class which is a good thing but the middle class was not going to stay under communist dictatorship forever I Believe that the future belongs to the United states I Believe the\nGoing to be a Chinese Century is going to be an American century or get\nA what about our debt a lot of people now getting concerned about the uh the tax cuts of the president which I Know both you and I are very much in favor of it I think they feel this economy I've tried to tell\nOur listeners if you look historically a tax cuts and the effect of having the economy and grow right in growth\nThan the main thing is is there's a lag between when the tax cuts take effect and when the revenue increases to actually out what it was prior to the tax cuts so there's a lag\nAnd the president ALSO Holding in his cabinet under the blue and saying time to get out\nYour ... I Want to five percent cut from everybody across the board you can find you have a good day ... what do you think of that\nWell first of all what you're lifting too from time to time go on my Web pages of up by non profit policy organization called American opportunity dot org American opportunity dot org and you'll see that over the years we've written about economic growth than we've written about foreign policy you alluded to\nA recent article that I wrote on foreign policy of ... and we also have some people writing all some Chinese issue about other issues like that they're on\nOur Web page American opportunity to work but one of our oldest for physicians that we've done in our organization that's the gross code which has decided at the time that that they will have to lose in charge of the country and the wages were not growing it people were not working on a wire it was gross\nAnd we propose that there'll be a policy\nOf tax cuts for economic growth well that's now been done and you know the whole point is this how do you got to get another debt either going to have to raise taxes in\nOrder to finance the debt or you're going to have to grow in order to create more revenue to\nBuild a bigger pot but at the end of the day then de any good to increase revenue if you just stand the same revenue right again if you get your age or you know grossed ... million dollars and you spend a billion and a half you're still on the show at the end of the day we have some major diseases Tucker about how we're going to spend our money\nRight now we're basically a moving the left is trying to move us in the direction of socialism which is a transfer of money for one pockets of the other but at the end of the day there's no limit to that and that increases the debt and furthermore drives out money that's going to be absolutely essential for the coming conflicts of the twenty first century\nIn our military spending is going to be absolutely necessary I research are are developed our science\nUh these things are also has to push forward so we have a lot of priorities and good governance in good executive leadership got to be just a good two rational leadership is going to be necessary to help the time that's been [noise]\nSo um we can't tournaments because the president has made that promise on multiple times that was part of his economic platform he said I have a deal the deal are you\nThe cuts that that represents what over fifty percent of the budget right right right there and he's not going to cut military spending you know so when you when you look at a five percent cut across everything else discretionary spending you know you're not talking about trillions of dollars are you\nSlowly Joel desire Lee American conservatives\nThey're actually doing a majority of the house or wherever we're spending money and then have a policy against us a real political discussion commit either in campaigns are get elections or otherwise\nJust do what we're spending our money on on what we have to step nearby but one thing it real short and that is if you increase taxes you reduce economic activity\nIssue you're increased taxes you reduce economic activity it made and that's the approach to the left their goal is to simply go for the bucks and grab the money from anybody they can get his law and they usually make it quote or they're rich unquote\nBut I can promise you John based upon all the numbers I've ever seen in order to pay for this debt into\nPaying for this government if it's going to be a socialist you're gotta go into the middle class and get that money you just have two\nAnd a conservative don't believe in that we believe and people keep it as much of their own money as they can that's why when I ran for governor I pushed the car tax cut and that's what the goal is the goal is to give people more control over their keep more of their own money that's the Republican conservative mock trial\nAnd that's where we have to try to do for the future [noise]\nGovernor Jim Gilmore that is a great analysis of where we are today that's why I Love having gone\nSo refreshing thanks for your time sir hey for more information you can go to the governor's website American opportunity dot org American opportunity dot org that Jim Gilmore website and where you're going to get a sober salient cogent analysis\nOf world affairs how's that Governor coach that guy see how you're feeling more flamboyant next section radical stuff\n[laughter]\nRubber Tim is on the job British radio network and\nWe're on the same page on the to show the affair you you got to do something at\nThe fact that this was done in a conflict if it is an embassy look you either have international world order or you don't\nAnd for all mine corrupt listeners out there we all screaming about sovereignty writes you ... you know one of one world government you know one one world order\nYou want sovereignty well after sovereignty that means is countries and it just countries there has to be an international order otherwise there's world chaos\nAnd one of the international lawyers are if you walk into an ever see it's supposed to be safe\nAnd sacrosanct not you get your head chopped off and put in a barrel and a garden right that just doesn't that just doesn't work and uh\nDay of reckoning it happens it happens when you behaving this way and it's coming quicker rather than later in my judgment surround the same page on that take you governor\nA a you know until now this was in any other country this would\nHave been between countries but now is tarnished the reputation of the president's family simply guilt by association and I personally believe the time has come to deliver a very strong in [noise]\nAnd not a slap on the rich this are the kinds of messages where the Saudis have to basically learn\nThat what they're doing the harms not only their reputation harms harms their own country and also harms the interest of the United states of America or I Would start very liked by making of Clinton's Saturday you sit there and again when the war is over they have to wrap it up\nSo I Would certainly I Try and take whatever actually Clinton against the people directly involved all the way up to the set of lifting of the real world we're not going to take personal actually has more than nine I Believe\nBut certainly not for the fun is inner circle that decides that it hurts\n... even the commentary as bad as they buy so much from us that we need them family is not as good an hour to the real narrative is the\nSaudis me much more than ... than a it's not a\nWhat's the word I'm looking for it's not a one way street tend to eat or Saudi ... after some of the United states is really quite considerable they can't go to somebody else to buy weapons because\nI can but it means that makes me break with us their own military comes to a screeching halt\nWithin a within days because we provide all the spare parts we provide American companies in American technicians provide most of the maintenance of supervision and skills in time as I said I don't believe the certainly the military could stay functional\nA few weeks maybe a month or two without direct American support so\nWe have the upper hand there's no doubt in my mind we'd have the upper hand and also looked like the Europeans are going to stop selling a voluntary equipment so he's\nSo that leaves them with the Russians are the only other viable place to go and I'll tell you I wouldn't want to be in countries like Saudi Arabia dependent on the questions from I ... it would take five years\nSo this reaction to a very simple we saw from the Canadian foreign minister during my relations in case we may not rational actor on\n\nThe other great of course\nIf you know so much\nDamage to the only family industrial so many of them for their wealth and so forth was justified but at the same time he has made so many enemies [noise]\nDomestically but [noise] [noise] [noise]\nSo um is your best or by the way for everyone knows you're on the John predicts radio network we are with former cutter United States ambassador country near oh he is now the president of the U.S Congress business council\nSo you mentioned the word Mr Ambassador\nIncompetent or you're the first one that said that and ah I've got it written down because I think that really sums up\nYou know a lot of the things that NBS has gotten involved in um have not been successful whether it be the way he's conducting the Yemeni civil war which I think\nAh even supporters of that would say it's been a disaster on every possible level\nThe um the blockade he did with Egypt Bahrain and the Emirates against the tar has been a total colossal failure it's almost a comedy show\nBecause uh the country I'm cutting the stadiums\nCutter is much better off economically and otherwise and they were before the blockade and all the men is that the Saudis aren't getting any of their business I mean it was really a complete disaster for me\nI mean if you if you went to Harvard Mr bastard taught a business class and international relations how to do a black teen inhabit blow up in your face and that would be your classmates dancer\nSo every guy gets involved in a blows up at what point does dinner fathers saying you know maybe he's just not equipped\nFor that may not be in a situation where do you call the shots when we moved the embassy\nTo Jerusalem and this was too much [noise] but [noise] I'm Sorry we support [noise]\nThat he was no longer [noise] parents that you can stand up [noise] I was a civil war\nWould be\nBut the father must also be conscious of the fact that so many people now his son that you wouldn't be exposing him retaliate personal retaliate [noise] like I said it could very well established and [noise] the less power\n[noise] [noise] [noise] but\nThat's kind of their complicating factor the father is a\n\nCalculations\nMiss how was just going to affect the balance of power in the middle east especially results the Iranian\nIranians must be absolutely speechless that's a good luck on this one\nI have not I am married into what the Iranians are going to let this one play out personally further undermining the position of Saudi Arabia\nAbilities or the Iranians position now are they able to say you were done away with the nuclear agreement the jinx repeal lanes I Know what are you doing favoring somebody was much worse than anything we've done\nI mean that's an arguable questions but right now the Saudis are made the headlines not fair [noise] it made all the negative headlines\nA show for example in reading your question [noise]\nUh sending it out I think we should be able to play the propaganda part of the war with ah\n[noise] again with the war really well and the amount of any residual support there might have been a for the Saudis in Yemen War is just going to\nYou're going to just go away or the other big winner on this for the church is now in a position of the will to say [noise] was the Saudis poor into what's the word I'm looking for a for\n[noise] in the mastery of that part of the world as they are not going to be interesting\nTo stand up to ... to ... all in all in this\nIs Lewis Lewis for the Saudis all around and it's unless we really forcefully and it's a lose lose for us as well we do need to put the Saudis and the place to make sure to understand who they really are they not the country the call the shots for the United states of America\nOr if you're either either were calling the shots or no it's calling the shots but they're not the ones calling us Ross [noise] ten so I I feel very strongly that we need to\nYou know there's some stand up and say this is not you know this is simply intolerable conduct it affects our interests and certainly try here's the president's\nBrand or no matter how you\n[noise] so how do you get there it's the way you can get out of this is very unclear\n\nI make it clear that there's not an acceptable of course of action\nMedicine or a hundred dollars for the for the ruling this now back to the other things in the Gulf um how insects congressman mission and the blocking\nAnd the position that the administration has taken on that will be any change in that will be looked at it differently I think

called my friend [noise] and you know what it is a problem we let them know about the problem is we don't take 'em Twenty years down the road and then we can if\nWe let him know immediately the first time in American of natural [noise]\n[noise] [noise] [noise]\nOf LA in what you're saying [noise]\nNot have a\nThey they're not taking advantage of any more for\nUnder Republican leadership [noise]\nWondering again\nBack then again [noise] [noise]\nLet thousands and thousands and thousands tens of thousands\nOf undocumented migrants just walk into the country that's what this election is about you can either go forward or you can go backwards and I've told you for weeks the Democrats were going to find a way to snatch defeat from the jaws of victory they can't help themselves\nThey have political Tourette's all they have to do I said this three months ago all Nancy pulls you have to do is take the entire\nDemocratic candidates delegation for eight Ninety Days ... in Hawaii don't buy ads just go to Hawaii and they would win nope they can't do it instead they're talking about socializing medicine that we got communist\nAs their party's standard bearer isn't there chairman is saying is the future of the party I mean it's it's bizarre now they've got this caravan which is an invasion it's an exodus now there's another there's eight thousand strong now I heard today it's up to eight thousand it James Dean as it goes\nThey're going to go to the U.S border and only have to do was put one foot over and there are laws and our so porous and there were so many loopholes they can't do anything about it\nI mean you can't when Trump says I'm going to close the border excuse me Mr President that would mean cutting off for trade it's just like you can't just\nClose the border for the migrants you have to close the border for everything [noise] so you would knock out all trade that would all be gone and it was it would it would cause economic habits or you can't do that\nThat's just the reality of it you can't do it [noise]\nAnd so the problem is that there are so many loopholes that is the problem in the law\n[noise] you know fifty percent now of of\nOf our migrants are coming from Central America fifty for ... percent there was a time when almost a hundred percent were single males coming from Mexico looking for jobs like everybody got that\nIn two thousand one\nLess than one percent of illegal aliens claimed asylum now thirty percent claim asylum\nAnd we have a law\nThat was passed in two thousand Fifteen called the forest floor and with the force law says\nIf you were apprehended on the border if you're apprehended and you claim asylum [noise] legally the government can only hold these people for twenty that if you can't get your paperwork process than twenty days the federal government the border patrol has to release them\n\nThis is all lost the Democrats like the law\nBecause once they're released it's over [noise]\nThey get a piece of paper that first show up on this day which is not a week's out years out years\nSo then they just disappear into the interior of the country\nThey only have twenty days and now obviously you can't separate the children from the parents\nSo the parents and the children or whatever the children are the guardian wherever they are they can be detained together but only for twenty minutes at the end of that twenty they they have to be released they get a piece of paper and then they just go wherever they go in\n\nAnd they say the coming fleeing persecution up I'm certainly that some are countries that are ... are not doing that well but four billion people would like to migrate to the United states and get welfare and education and fish is on the back\nSeat this doesn't affect the elites are the rich they they\nThis is a burden on middle and lower income Americans because schools get over Ron the welfare system explodes and I told you the story of my own so when I moved to just speak Virginia we put them in school I guess it was what third third grade\nAnd or or the fifth fifth grade [noise] pork I don't I\nI don't remember third or fourth grade first day of school twenty five kids in the class I get I get that\nTold them don't speak English just forget was in the school that I was in twelve or Thirteen kids don't speak a word of English all migrants now what are you gonna do how\nCan that be satisfactory learning environment\nYou can't so the teacher was going to go down to the lowest common denominator\nWe pulled him out and sending the St Matthew Catholic school I didn't have the money for that\nSo we have to give up a lot of different stuff so you pay your taxes for an education that is worthless in some\nAreas of your living in a mansion in northern Virginia in orbit that that you know as a five million dollar lobbyist for the federal government you don't care they're going to private school\nBut if you have to send your child to a public school because that's where your economic means land and half the kids in there can't speak a word of English you tell me what kind of ... of a learning environment that for your child well it's not\nIt's no fault of the children but it's a form of the system for a while to get me this is an invasion\nThat and they're they're burning they're burning tires in front of the U.S embassy there flying around\nThe Honduras Guatemala flags\nAnd their voice basically taunting the president to stop them because they know that as soon as they get in the United states they're safe they won't get released in twenty days\nBecause their cases are years away so they simply disappear in the interior of the country\n\nAnd all they have to do in the first asylum hearing is meet the basic threshold see their screen thresholds of asylum\nThe first one is claiming it eighty percent of people meet the first asylum requirements so they're released anyway and the other twenty percent get released also because\nThey can't get processed in twenty days so they all get released this is the problem these are the poles\n\nOf the people that are detained that actually show up in court when they're supposed to Fifteen Percent so ... percent of people are not apprehended and up to twenty percent\nOnly Fifteen Percent actually go to court when they're supposed to sell\nOf the country state it's it's an incredible number\n\nAnd they're coming for either economics or for family reunification\n\nAnd we don't know even who is in this caravan human traffickers drug cartel bowls bad people some say some say that there's even terrorists than in in there from the middle east no one knows\n\nWhat does the president to we've tried zero tolerance that was a public relations fiasco\n\nSo I tell you what [noise] um the images on TV Now\nAnd what the what the Caribbean has done is they've pushed all the women and children to the front of the line so the cameras catch only women and children on TV so you see children crying and moms crying for food for their baby\nWhile they made the choice to come but it doesn't matter\nThat's the images that the fake news wants to play they don't want to go deep into the caravan of find out who these other people are\nAnd who's funding that\n\nHas anybody asked that question me this is an invasion it's like we have no laws we have no border we have no laws we have nothing\n\nSo here's why the Republicans are going to win and hold the house\n\nBecause suburban women that the Democrats have been counting on heavily to give them victory because of whatever reason are looking at two things mobs of caravans mobs and caravan angry mobs an agri caravans\n\nI don't think that's conducive to getting votes for Democrats if you look at the early voting right now in the trends in early voting Republican turnout in Republican areas is through the roof\n\n[noise]\nDoes this hour from town hall that Thomas Patrick boss President

building on what churches era TV journalist was doing a standup do we want to start punishing Terri Burch shooting at\nJournalists where do you want to go with that I don't know but as I said I think\nThe answer is as Jesus said what was the first person who was never a sin cast the first stone [noise]\nI think the difference here is that it happened and the counselor and it was such a blatant disregard of the relationship that\nThe president has attempted to build with the Saudi kingdom and especially NBS I'm using the White House and things like that\nBut I think that's the real issue for the president and\nI you know he said there's gonna be severe consequences I Do believe that President Trump along with the Congress is going to do something\nBecause the big difference here is it happened and I'm In an embassy which is there's an international order right and I mean you're going to an embassy\nYou're not expected to get your head cut off with a\nChainsaw or a bone saw whatever they had so it's kinda gruesome and I think I think that's what's fueling the outrage him in this and this was an ally of ours and\nI think it's put President Trump in a very very awkward position and there's got to be some accounting for that what the consequences are I don't know\nCertainly uh I think that Rand Paul and others and Bob Corker and others are going to\nDemand that there's a hearing in Congress on what our involvement why we're still involved\nIn supporting the Saudis and the Emirates\nIn the Yemeni civil war I mean I I think at least you're going to get that what would you agree with me that this is not particularly helpful to President Trump's I mean come on and were you you murder somebody in your in in in in a constant lists\nAnd just do it in such a brazen matter\nI mean do you do you think do you think this is particularly helpful\n[noise]\nKnow of course I'm the kind of things that every country makes a political mistake in addition to the moral consequences of\nWhat I don't want to discount that but you've got countries like Saudi Arabia's rivals are what you're trying to profit from this geopolitical mistake and I I don't want it\nWill profit from this once again or the Muslim Brotherhood's once again costs are cut throat which is supporting terrorism all across the middle east or do we want the Muslim Brotherhood the profit from their mind bottom line and I know the Congress is going to force\nPresident Trump's hands on this I'm fairly certain that that you're right you're very your dream of the domestic political situation I Believe that's exactly\nWhat's going to happen and they're going to have a forced us to stop helping Saudi Arabia and Yemen which is basically going to leave the roots he's in charge to sign and it's going to leave the country divided um it's not going to solve any of the problems of what's going on in Yemen because you've got the same parties there that are battling it out\nOr it's just going to leave another Arab country in a state of division where people are fighting on the ground\nUm so I see no no good coming out of that politically and I see no geopolitical good coming out of supporting the Muslim Brotherhood and I knew ...\nAnd I'm Sorry he died and I'm Sorry it was brutal and I'm not going to defend Mohammed bin Salman man but you don't go rewarding or if your enemy is ah with geopolitical gifts because\nYour friends made a mistake like that\nSo what do you think the United states should do if anything\nWell I I Would hate to be in President Trump's hands place um I I Know he's got he's surrounded by some good people secretary Pompeo and the vice president who is a very strong moral person uh what do they\nCome up with I mean the king is not going to\nGet your son he's not going to throw into the walls a lot of people inside our foreign policy establishment hectic trying to\n... minutes it cool by saying that the other princes are going to try to overthrow him perhaps it's possible I suspect it's not but perhaps it's possible there are a lot of princes that would love to do that or people lamenting that farm it's been some man will be king for maybe fifty years\nOr they don't like someone like that and I think we have political objectives\nOf dividing various therapy countries I don't say we but I mean the the deep state the foreign policy establishment\nUm and that's not a good thing it sets\nThe middle east on fire a it wrecked the economy and puts a lot of young people out of work and creates floods the refugees and you see people like George Soros who would like to see refugees we don't want to see more refugees we don't want to see are gone sending more refugees Europe it's the Muslim Brotherhood that it's been doing this both\nFrom turkey and from from Libya and they continue to do this because they're trying to fly to Europe with refugees and people are doing the same thing with\nOur borders in South America coming from Honduras and Mexico and wherever else are we don't want to see that it's a mistake\nBecause it is possible and were you may be NBS just isn't particularly effective leader because right now everything the guy touches as trying to craft right I mean the Yemeni civil war and then he's conducting their or the money\nAre rushing all of his rivals and putting them in the\nHigher regency or what whatever he did the hotel there and then torturing them is what some of the allegations were I'm not sure if there's ever been proven now the blockade or the gang of for a blockade against the Qataris whatever you think of that government about government of that change them\nOver the mere that's proven to be a complete disaster ineffective and blow up in their face\nAnd they tore up people are better off um post the blood and they were before we screwed that up [noise] um I mean the get the guys you know this this alleged murderer is a complete ... I mean it's beyond a screw off I mean it's like\nIt's a lipstick Keystone Cops and the whole thing is ridiculous I mean the guy screwed up everything so I mean maybe meet his father is looking at this and saying look he's thirty three years old and maybe he's just not particularly effective right now\nYou know we have a lot in the United states that says that you can be president or to your thirty five years I mean there's a reason for that\nAnd you know maybe media you know maybe it's possible that he's just not an effective leaders that\nAre reasonable conclusion for people to make\nIt look like the drama of King Lear as I pointed out to other\nKing who is given his ... his other son was ambassador to the United states some people are wet spring or the crown prince says\nIt's a it's a bad situation you know it could happen in another kingdom obviously Shakespeare wrote about King Lear but at\nThe bottom line here I think in the middle east it's like to go to the walls I don't believe he's going to choose his other signed this is his favorite son unless he has a rebellion of the major printed inside the kingdom which I also don't think it's going to happen\nIt's not going to be replaced and if you want to know what the scenario where how it plays out if we say both\nSaudi Arabia [noise] talk a lot of the newspaper this team for\nMentioning that Saudi Arabia is also aligned with Russia and also that Russia would like to see the kingdom cut oil sales and things like to do that in order to raise prices are saying and this is just a veil threats are the voices recreate and other Nineteen Seventy three\nThe three main where the oil on the west\nWas enforced\nPrices went up and we were all standing gas lines I don't know say theoretically up again but they were certainly threatening I guess we haven't been Taliban was threatening um so do we want to get into really ugly scenario with the oil market\nNovember I I mean well how how big oil um November fourth and people would be saying Trump turns everything typical material you know\nIt could turn ugly I don't want to see that happen and watch my most important consideration here is I don't want to see the Muslim Brotherhood profit from the geo political and broke geopolitical mistake by bomb it that sounds pretty honest\nOn a day later to get a cleric or transcribe interview that will be Thursday this week before the same panel attacks and that's the gators as Fox News has learned of a renewed push to declassify some Russia records congressional sources say Republicans want President Trump to declassify fewer than a dozen pages of documents which can relate to Papadopoulos\nThat sources say they believe these records include exculpatory evidence and appear to under caught the collusion narrative\n[noise]\nThrough the network truck in the truth across America I Am your Godzilla of the truth it's great to be with you today don't forget\nOur in our new news talk station W. J. F. N. one hundred point five\nFM launches a new talk station in Richmond\nAnd go to one launches on Thursday October twenty five to six am W. J.

J. F. than one hundred twenty five ... FM\nIn Richmond pooch lend watching this Thursday so we still have a lot of work to do to get everything up and are ready to go but we're excited about it and the\nOther people are selling talk stations were buying them because we believe in the format so much of a lot of fun and we're really excited over so you get to hear me on another station that's the other good news right so good meantime Democrats are eager to keep the focus on health care and the final two weeks\nUntil election day but the president has spent the past twenty four hours on loading on this migrant caravan which began in ... travels\nAs a group of now eight thousand um the caravan reached chapter Chula Mexico on Monday about eleven hundred miles from a gallon Texas and it continues to track north towards the southern border\nBut the Democrats in order to keep the focus on health care because uh the polling shows that as the number one issue on people's mind and joining us now to try to understand why health care is such an important issue and it's on so many people's minds during this upcoming election and beyond\nIs my good friend del ballot sewers the executive director and founder of liberty health share now um my self and my family have been proud members of liberty health share forget this seven years\nIt isn't the best thing we have ever done you know all the healthcare debate [noise] we have to debate it and we talked about it and ah we analyze it for you on the air but I'm not personally involved in it because my family got out of this a long time ago we got out of the whole\nObamacare healthcare rat race and we went to liberty health share which the services phenomena oh this is a great organization where it's different because everybody shares in their own cost of health\nThose members and it is growing every day is the best kept secret in America and I urge all of my listeners now if you worked for the federal or state or county government and you've got a great health plan where you worked for a big company and they provided you're doing a little of co pay that's fine\nBut if you're an independent contractor or you work in the gig economy are you on a ten Ninety nine or you work for small companies like we haven't we can't\nWe can't buy the insurance we can it would put us out of business is so expensive or you're a business owner any of those things then to liberty health share is a phenomenal opportunity for you and as I said my family of three and I've got a fourteen year old even on it when he was seven\nAnd it's just it's the greatest place like paying cash\nIt's easy to do the services\nYou're not there is no paperwork there's no paperwork it's just you pick up the phone I mean you send them to stop sending the bill that's it and you get older the pre emptive in a chair and all that\nBut you you got to check it out to go to liberty how's your dad or check it out if we're quotation that's all you got to be shocked by it because you're going to say no too good to be true there's gotta be catch\nThere was no catch joining us now to help understand what is going on today in health care with this debate executive director founder of ... chair yeah both hey do\nSuch a pleasure to be with you John thank you for the invitation\nYou because I'm a true believer Dale when you believe in something it's really easy to talk about it because I'm not only a believer I'm customer and I have been for a very long time\nAnd we wouldn't trade it for you know the other day if I get some readers came to me and said hey ah chewing or whatever it is you know organize care you manner something makes you wonder if that's because it's a hassle LA's the addition\nTo that we band together as you've just said\nTo paint each other's medical bills on the basis of our shared values and beliefs but we also stimulate one another to leave to lead healthy lives but the reason why there's such deaths satisfaction\nIn America about health care today that's why it's at the top of people's discussion list and concern lists as we come into this midterm election that is because we don't have a health care system in America John we have a sick\nCare system the only time a doctor and she is when you're sick and we got to shoot that and we still want to encourage each other we welcome folks\nLike conditions that by just simply adding exercise or die or control their wives who were you versus diabetes and heart disease and high blood pressure certainly obesity we help people stop smoking we're focused\nOn the care of our health\nAnd that's what we've got to get back to a and focus on understand\nThat health care is really about the\nCare of our health and that's what we're focused on\nWell you stopped me from smoking so that's good [laughter] yeah right\nAnd so on pulleys this can be job because we do we welcome folks with those conditions they just have to come to change their lifestyle a recent survey came out for two days ago from the New York times\nJust dictated that big city is as bad if not worse than smoking and if people would simply engaging simple\nExercise every day it can change their lives reduced their weight a ... and certainly ...\nSimply saying well let's take care of our bodies these are precious gifts one better couldn't we invested in hopes set aside money for retirement plan their entire lives but let's make some plans to preserve held\nA into the future or ... and and the key\nIn this case because I mean the whole objective was joining liberty hill share and you know you have to do is get a quotation is going to liberty ... dot org liberty hill sure dot org it's all there or you can call any five five five eight five protein three seven\nEight five five five five four to three Seventy get yet on the whole government thing\nBut the best thing about it is it is it's a plan to stay healthy it's not a plan to go there when you're sick now obviously you become sick you have problems you know we've we've all had them I've certainly had them over the four months that I've been with\nA with the with LA chess but uh the object is to stay healthier and it permeates your whole family I mean it's held my wife even my fourteen year old\nRight is on a regimen of eating better and you know he's no jumpsuit it all works out every day played baseball all that stuff and so you find out here if you do these things you're frequency I'm visiting doctors goes way down and that's the object of it right", "show_name": "Joe Walsh Show", "year": "2018",
