really to the American people [noise]\n[noise]\n\n\nThere was one Godzilla the truth and that to me it's great to have you with us today with a fake news regarded again\nWith fake poll coming at you all over the place they make these pulled up to drive a fake narrative don't believe that it's the same thing they did it two thousand sixteen they're doubling down they wanted to press the Republican volunteer base that's their goal repressed early voting\nI just I don't know if there's some crazy person doing it but it just seems awfully odd to me here's\nThe thing is the Democrats the Schumer is the the the whole crowd that whole mob over there they were screaming\nWe must have the FBI investigate before we can vote on Kavanaugh there must be a full investigation before we can vote on him before we can decide whether he should be you know the sense of the Supreme Court like\nThe same the same we must have an FBI investigation before we can let that happen [noise]\nThey're not even waiting for the FBI to investigate worthy bombs are coming from before they start blaming President Trump declared President Trump guilty responsible for the whole thing they're not waiting for the FBI to investigate the same people that three weeks ago said we cannot do anything until the FBI finishes his investigation\nSo I mean they were total hypocrites it it is absolutely irresponsible or beyond counterproductive it's it's absolutely you're responsible for them to be saying this is all about because the President Trump or they're they're trying to they're they're trying to score political points office which\nYou have to ask who benefits from these bombs that's all I'm not saying who did it it it's obviously some crazy person because no sane person sending bombs or fake bombs through the mail we don't know the bottom is a real are fake or they emptied out some firecrackers\nAttached to a digital watch to it to make it look like a scary thing we don't know it's Halloween time it's easy to scare people what can I tell you\nWe don't know and I'm not going to go down that road what I can say is whoever did it is crazy in one way or another whether they're sort of fire bleed can be committed to an institution crazy or just that they've got a screw loose you don't do that kind of normal people\nWell adjusted people don't do that okay by definition\nPat Buchanan has a column out today very makes the point that when John Kennedy was assassinated Lee Harvey Oswald who defected to the Soviet Union was pro Cuba\nUh he was found to be the shooter or yet who got blamed for the John birth society and all the conservatives so\nThere's not the first time that the guilt by association or let's let's let's slam the conservatives let's blame everything on conservatives not the first time it's been done before we even know who actually sent packages so\nIt's a everybody's got to calm down take a breath and ah I think Sarah Sanders had it right we should be coming together the president is calling for unity dialing down their rhetoric\nAnd the Democrats are going in the opposite direction they're they're they're blaming the president unequivocal e no question about it taking no responsibility whatsoever for calling the guy look at this guy Brennan\nSaid the president's guilty of treason what's the what's the penalty for treason death he's basically a former head of the CIA had been out they're\nCalling for the president to be home by the neck until dead and this is not considered inflammatory rhetoric I it's it's disgusting the whole thing is just just hypocritical these people will go down as the all time greatest hypocrites\nJust ask you something a Curtis I I think you make a great analogy a portion of the Democrats who cried and screamed and whine about Kavanaugh\nNot getting the FBI that's getting everything I mean why don't we just wait here I mean the FBI seems to be home again and southern Florida they're going to come up with a report from so we're we're we're going to find out the answer and why not just wait\nRight exactly how about everybody say calm down let's we got we we have the FBI on the case unless this guy was a or gal or or or black or whatever [laughter] whatever entity it was that created these packages\nAnd less that entity was a very very very sophisticated person or a boat and by ... and if they were very sophisticated they were able to cover their tracks\nBut considering the number of packages delivered to these various places coming out of one place there are a lot of clues there and I'm confident\nWho did it or narrow it down and the fact that they use Debbie Wasserman Schultz as return address that kind of interesting in itself Debbie Wasserman Schultz is the one who was forced to step down\nFrom head of the Democratic National Committee\nA because she had been rigging the system for Hillary against Bernie I don't know what that means but it sort of an interesting clue you know maybe somebody thought that was funny to use her name out all these bombs I don't know\nUh but my point is is that unless this was a very sophisticated operation\nBut they knew a how to cover their tracks at every step of the way you've got twelve packages now that the FBI is investigating it let's wait for the FBI to figure this out to come up with something yeah why not wait before you start\nA and and why not why are they not waiting because they want to politicize at least the Democrats are missing no opportunity to score political points on this\nWell it's a ... it seems it seems odd to me that that all this is happening\nBut let's wait I mean that's where everybody's saying let's whitening time let's get to let's get the the economy will get to the Taliban invasion after the bottom of the hour a\nBut let's get to the new economic numbers that just came out the gross domestic product GDP growing another three and a half percent now let me just say what this means right that's the first time that we have had\nBack to back quarter a in a very long time of of over three and a half percent growth back to back and consumer confidence uh up at an all time I can do with spending four percent another great a quarter of economic\nGrowth this is more bad news for them they don't want to talk about that that they don't want to talk about the economy or jobs or the growth so what did they talk about\nThey talk about all they talk about they've got this wonderful thing to talk about this horrible thing to talk about here with the with the bombs and they talk about the president again they're falling in they don't realize they're falling into a trap and and it's their own drop a trap of their own making\nPeople don't want to hear for Democrats talk about the president they want to hear [noise] Democrats Republicans the politicians in Washington talk about what they're what the politicians or going to do for them to make their life better write\nWhat I I I go to work every day I got a family to support\nI got a job I'd like to get a raise what are you going to do to make that happen how are we going to make my life better easier make me rich uh make make make my kids you know healthier talking about President Trump talking about you're a Native American DNA doesn't do that [laughter]\nIt's hard to do that you're\nAbout President Trump are causing the bomb scare doesn't do\nPresident Trump as a Russian agent and now they're President Trump as a Russian agent who creates bomb scares I mean they're [noise] they're not doing themselves savers\n[noise] on the other side I made it very very clear jobs not mobs a President Trump and the Trump Administration are created the best economic conditions in this country\nIn a generation best we've seen in ten Twenty years [noise]\nAnd that goes along the way that that\nAnswers peoples' questions what have you done for me lately you've got you've got your raise my kids are food stamps gotten out of the basement there on their own now great thank you very much\nAnd\nAnswer it when it gets back so stay with us for another part of the hour but um you know where Trump Tower for the last two weeks of the joke yogurt like deja vu all over again I mean [laughter]\nI mean I could go back and the same thing everybody when it was all it was all whenever it was it was going through with it I Would say that we're going to do with\n\nAnd uh so yeah it is there is a feeling of danger move here all of these national generic ballot polls are meaningless there's not a national election\nOther they're all like I mean it's all the calls I I've been talking all day about the Washington Post poll that came out yesterday that shows for whites than I had a Barbara Comstock emerging as tense district like Thirteen look like they might when she said she's a favorite no doubt that's a very tough for a district with Republicans to win barbecue\nEvery internal poll that the Republicans have from the White House to the end our ceasing to Barbara on\nShows the right stuff like that not having Thirteen claiming but this is what the Washington Post jobs they get a uh they get a ridiculous methodology to get a state\nPolls get a fake analysis of it to do fake news to get a fake conclusion drawn so they can continue on with their fake narrative and like we've already been down this path so now I'm going to start calling them on how ridiculous it isn't they're doubling down just saying\nThat's why the way you're on the John truckers radio network I Am your God of

a complete undone mitigated disaster for the Saudi kingdom so eventually the father just have to say you know what my son is in a top rated bubbling full and I\nGot to put somebody else in\nThe country to to lead because it's guys and capable of being king because he does stupid stuff including this assassination allegedly\n\nThe Saudis have now ... settle but I guess not our final story they're saying but that's going to\nChange again so who knows what\nThe uh to showcase has here's what it is tough it is really brought renewed focus\nTo the Saudi Emirates package and the support that we're giving them in getting involved in the Yemen's civil war which is causing a horrific very disturbing very growing humanitarian crisis where I can try to tell you this\nUm on algebra zero every day I see the pictures you do say because uh the fake news networks today they don't want to show your real news they want to talk about\nYou know President Trump Stormy Daniels or whatever they do\nBut I\nI see the pictures on TV and I mean it'll really tear out your stomach and you've got children just starving I mean they can eat ... they they got mother's stripping park for during his bark and boiling it just matching it up too so\nThere's something you know and that's in the stomach green grass\nI mean there's no food\nI mean think about having a child you're sitting there and they start to think about how that feels that make this thing is is a horror show it is worst in the area it's worse than anything I've seen and\nAre involved in it is shameful it is absolutely shameful and if there's anything that's going to come out of the show ... fair or\nWe're going to get the hell out of there as we should and it's just it's\nHorrific that'd be not as nice as involved in something of this nature all because you know we've got the Iranian bogeyman with their nineteenth street folks or whatever they have like let's get the fall I Mike in Oakland you're you're on the air Mike\n... John yup oh yeah\nThis is anything good to come out of this thing but I have to point\nOut the irony or in something you said just a few minutes ago I'm sure you can pick up on it because you don't agree but um you know you said the president or the two things he doesn't like he doesn't like to be lied to and he doesn't like incompetent and I I Can't help but they must be he just wants all that to themselves\n[laughter] are you sure he likes to live and I feel incompetent for the job so he just doesn't want to share those others\nWell I guess uh I guess you'd say just tremendous economic renaissance and it's full make tremendous economy we have an all the jobs I guess you think that's the worst governed confidence I guess you think the fact that we haven't heard from ISIS in that they'd\nBeen kicked kicked out of the majority of their caliphate and they they not only can throw a tiny part of terror tore yet when he took over it was a master might get you think that's a\nTopic I guess you think that the fact that the wacko when North Korea has not done a nuclear tests and sees threaten them I think that's a cop that I get to take all these new jobs we have in the fact that\nWe just keep going up in the confidence and there's a tax cut and you figure that's in confident so I guess your nights definition of incompetence Mike or\nThey'll just a little bit different\nI guess it is a you know some of those things could have happened whether there are certain notch\nOr actually\nOn I mean we know when I Want\nSomeone who is competent than the position and what kind of position we repeat again right thank you want to point out that\nOut you know what I thank you for straightening yeah it's just your\nEconomy Obama leaves office an\nIs plenty wages are Rob savings

got chopped up and uh\nBasically got out of there and some kind of doggie bags and they buried him in the garden or something on the whole thing is just a horrible situation but what a\nCrown prince Mohammed bin Salman the administration's part a lot of things in the sky that Jared Kushner has\nAnd a lot of people are saying you know maybe this guy's just incompetent\nAnd capable of running the country everything he touches turns to crap whether it's the Yemeni civil war that's a disaster the gang of four embargo against the state of guitar that back farther to blow up in their face guitars better off today than they were\nNow we've got this thing where they changed their story night time what do we do here\nThe show was brutally murdered it's clear that it was premeditated\nIt's clear that uh that I think the crown prince knew about that a MPs will help in solving a day I think have a lot to answer for and I think they have to be held accountable [noise] so I Do think that there has to be significant a penalties\nThat they suffer I Do think to the question has to be asked is\nLike does the United states believes that it can carry on a continued relationship with Saudi Arabia which I Do think we need to but can that be with the crown prince I think that's a pretty compelling question I think the administration is going to have to ask that\nI think Congress will eventually addressed\nThat an asset to you know what will be the penalties are to uh to Saudi Arabia I listen I understand the impact of most of those contracts for what we're doing to supply a military uh equipment to Saudi Arabia\nI think Saudi Arabia I can be a like a a force and that is is a is a is an ally to us in the in the middle east but I don't think that it can it can be that\nType of ally that we wanted that we need if this is how\nThey're going to operate I mean we have ... you know we're principles in the United states that we that we stand by our in our allies have to have to abide by those and I just don't see Saudi Arabia doing that\nYou know you you pointed out the issue with Yemen too and you and I have talked about that before I those are all questions I think that come up and how we see\nSaudi Arabia operating in the range of policies being played out and are are they are they doing the things necessarily in that region that create stability and that\nAnd that are working in the in the best interest of all involved not just Saudi Arabia but uh other allies in the middle east and listen I I I understand what they're doing that to push back\nAgainst the Iranians but are are they doing things that in the long term moving in the middle east at the right direction I think those are questions that we have to ask smoke or foreign policy standpoint and I think that us\nPolicy toward Saudi Arabia you know needs to needs to be directed by those I think very a very sobering issues that we have the for us\nSo it seems like congressman Whitman ah we're in total agreement and it seems like what you're saying is the best way to solve this is a four crown prince MPs will hammered than solving to maybe a step aside for someone else had his father put somebody else in their final question I\nOnly have half a minute and I got to get your Web site out so very quickly um is there going to be a vote in Congress on our involvement in the Yemeni civil war and

day\nGot um people I compete with hosts like if he were they just get up every day they read the paper you got the fake news you've got fake poles which are the big poll yesterday from the Washington Post is unbelievable I mean the Washington Post like what are they going to learn like they don't want to learn people say well what are they going\nTo change the polling methodology to get it right never because they don't want to get it right because it's not about\nAccurate poll it's about the poll driving fake news to get a fake narrative to draw the conclusion that's all it is it's all why the Washington Post\nActually putting out a poll\nYesterday actually putting out a poll showing Barbara Comstock trailing Jennifer Wexton and the temp district by surging point now there is no way that western had the Thirteen point lead over barber concept every internal poll that I have seen\nOn top stock every internal poll with his pay four and a lot of money shows this raise the debt eat or Comstock slightly ahead and the Washington Post has got Comstock down\nBy Thirteen this is a complete and utter why it has to be on fake news\nIs and it's beyond the onion it's beyond the national Enquirer what they try to do they hate tops not so much they want that seat so bad they want the liberal do nothing Jennifer watched it in their do bad they can taste it they want their\nLeft us in that seat so much that they will actually conducted poll make things up doing in such a way to get a result that they want so\nThey could put it out there and say the races over don't give Tom start getting money and don't work for her it's a lost cause so they do a fake poll\nIn order to think now it's unbelievable\nNobody in that district it's going to look you in the eye and say that they think that general Washington has a third gene point lead this racist tied\nAnd I think Tom's started going to win but the Washington Post care do not own up to any of this and neither one of the New York times or NBC News or NBC or MSNBC or any of the polling companies that are into who with a fake news\nAnd that's what they are thrown its it's think it's the fake news network and it's designed to drive a conclusion\nMake you not want to do\nIn the ... district go volunteer for cops like she is going to win this race if you get out and help her\nBut they lie to you on a daily basis and that's why the president says it's fake news editor he says it's an enemy of the people when you lie to the people and masquerading as a legitimate news network with a legitimate poll is that not an enemy how would you define that\n\nThis poll for the poster so astronaut\nThat even western most staunchest supporters think it's a joke\nBecause they know it's not true so what are we just let me just ask you a question\n\nIf they're putting out purposely putting out the information driving it so that the snake is that not\nThe people it's certainly an hey it's an enemy the truth maybe the president needs to change one word it's an enemy of the truth\nIt's certainly an enemy of fact\nIt is unbelievable they're doing it again they did it in two thousand sixteen and they're doing it again things word\nYou know the German the Democrats have to learn nothing from two thousand sixteen the legacy media has learned nothing in fact what they're doing now is they can't believe they were wrong and so they're doubling down and here's the thing if the Republicans don't relinquish the house\nThe legacy media after two elections in a row going all and for the Democrats and losing them both on a federal level will become irrelevant this district for them are so high there'll be come relevant\nI'm more\n'cause I simply tell you the truth 'cause ... roughly\nDon't become a relevant they are doubling and tripling down our moral\nAre more fake polls and more fake news again\nTo drive the result they want I don't like state again and it's going to backfire\nOn them I get\n\nI mean they actually think that somebody semi pipe bombs or don't go off at Lincoln to change the trajectory the election\nIn general life we're going to get an economic report coming out in about\nForty five minutes that it's going to show another over four percent GDP Growth\nAnd their banking on hatred of the Trump and somebody sending pipe bombs that don't go wash targeted at Democrats had already been influencing anything right now it's very bizarre it's very the whole thing is very suspicious and it's very bizarre\n\nRight now if you're in national Democrat here's what you have to deal with mobs and caravans and you're running against Republicans who are for jobs and country mobs versus jobs and country versus terror of that\n\nAnd if they really think the caravan crossing\nComing in and
