whining about your negative ads and you took them down your shit doubled down an doubled the adult well\nIt wasn't my student at the time so but\nBut in the meantime he's been good part is mostly as we were in a positive is he raised a lot of issues that are alive today where where he raised the idea for\nThem and pro growth tax cuts and medical savings accounts\nTerm limit [noise] and he really ... our foreign carry that was really a a a full runner of Donald Trump right now so uh uh a lot of the issues that he means they're alive today you know him very well and that would serve our country well acted on those things\nAbsolutely John\nTell us about\nYour association I Know you're associated with the with a couple of things you associate with Steve Bannon packing told me that and then also job creators network um\nMe about what you see happening out there you did a poll the other day saying things are changing because of the Kavanaugh situation can you share with the audience John McLaughlin what that is\nWell are you sure what it is is is that um I think the whole cabinet situation was more than just the Supreme Court\nIt was really a player or by Chuck Schumer and the Democrats to try to win the Senate and when you look at the field of fairness seats that are above the thirty five Senate seats that are up this year\nTwenty six are in states that that uh uh are held by Democrats talking six feet under the seat of the Democratic seats are in states that Trump won by a\nOne in the twenty sixteen presidential election [noise] some midterm elections are decided by people that are coming out that that may voted in the presidential but a lot of the people that vote in the presidential don't come out in the mid term so when Trump brand\nAnd get them to come out and vote for it so we got a hundred and thirty nine million voters which are nine million more than came out for Obama Romney\nAnd those voters voted overwhelmingly for Trump particularly in the heartland of the country where there was some of the rust belt in the midterms you only get about nine million people vote so it's the sixty three million voters who came out for Trump come out more heavily\nIn the midterms the Democrats are going to lose a lot of seats for the U.S Senate side I think\nHumor played a gamble to try to suppress the Trump thought where if the Republicans get embarrassed and half the poll cabinet or if the Republicans don't provide the votes he needs to get confirmed there and the Trump voters will be mad at our own party and not show up so millions of Trump voters stayed home a civil\nOr would have a play to win the Senate where he'd keep his Democrats thinks impossibly when a\nTendency Nevada Arizona and become the new minority leader because the Democrats are really finding it hard to take over the house and make Nancy Pelosi the speaker and by the way that the polling took her a whole lot of times with a packet al as a bipartisan projects impacted out their project with the ban and where\nYou could see me in the numbers Nancy Pelosi still very unpopular in September\nShe only had a thirty percent favorable number ... fifty five unfavorable and the vast majority of voters don't want her to become the next speaker and uh uh you know the Republicans for whatever reasons aren't cleaning up\nThe way they should I mean a lot of the house candidates will challenge dance diplomacy in their districts but you really should have\nA you know when you think about it you should have a a a gender where she wants basically she wants to open borders she was she wants to increase taxes she wants to weaken security\nI mean everything she stance towards the pits assist to the majority of voters right now and he's going to be the face of the Democratic party if they take over the house if they take over the house Nancy Pelosi will be the most powerful Democrat in the country and in Washington [noise]\nSo what's at stake she has said on numerous occasions that's actually going to be the speaker and she said even the other day\nLet those people that are running as Democrats say what they want at the end of the day I'm going to be the speaker I have the votes in the caucus and it was like do you have to do to win but then I'm going to be your speaker words when we're John McLaughlin a CEO and\nJohn has worked professionally as a strategic consultant and pollster for over three decades about how long I Know John and he's worked on\nPresidential campaign starting with our favorite dean for Fred Thompson and many many others so great to have him when he was also involved in the governor Nathan Deal campaign\nOur number two thousand and ten and I was covering\nI ran the beacon and\nThings that he's been involved in it now he's doing work with pat you down another to try to figure out what is going on in the terms here John\nLet's get to let you get to the\nLet's stay with the house in a minute so based on the generic polling I Know when\nI think we're touching that was on a couple of weeks ago he told me something he said for the Democrats control the house tax cut down said the generic ballot has to be a\nMinimum of twelve he says but then again the same state aid to gain the the twenty five seats to gain the house because he said if it's under twelve what happens is a lot of those polls are in districts where the Democrats are way ahead and uh in California and New York and cetera\nSo he says thanks ugly it's gotta be twelve or right\nThe real politics average has been about six right what Republicans chances of actually keeping their houses that even possible\nIt's possible but like we had pre Kavanaugh we were really separately than than than we do our own monthly tracking national national tracking surveillance on them it's on our website McLaughlin online dot com\nAnd uh so if you go to McLaughlin online dot com you'll see these numbers but the but with ... uh he's got a point I don't think it's called but I think it's close to the sex and they write about there we had a survey that would you compare August to September\nWe do a thousand likely voters across the country and August there were times forty four forty four Republicans and Democrats\nIn September of the day before the cabin are hearings we were down for the Democrats were hit forty six to forty two uh the president fill a tower\nCruel and falling from forty to forty six now and differences since capital those Republicans was that the Democrats are trying to you know depressed and have not come out the Republicans have they been Trump voters or have them knock around uh they've been re energized and the the pollsters have seen these comeback\nInto states where Trump won like we had a poll this week last week where\nOther Republican was the head of a Democrat McCaskill of Missouri by eight points there's been other media polls were Indiana's a dead heat Montana's a dead heat ah everybody knows that Heidi Heitkamp is downtown in North Dakota so she's an old is Joe Manchin most polls so he switched his vote\nBut on the house side the Democrats and and the reason I say it's probably closer to six because the Democrats in two thousand and six when they took the house from us if they are they only got fifty two percent of the national vote the forty eight\nFifty to cause us to lose over thirty feet can lose the house now twenty can we had a better reports from it\nBut still the and a lot of different places but a lot of the things that are that are a defining over an hour open

we actually pick up as it is it is a is it are under performing gain of one to two seats or do you pick up three four or five seats so the Senate looks pretty good because of the battlegrounds is the number of Democrats seats that are up this time\nThe house is a much different story where the ... on the most senior balance the Democrats are ahead right right now and it's too close to call was four weeks to go with the Republicans running for their you know get out the vote no message campaign", "show_name": "Joe Walsh Show", "year": "2018", "city": "Portsmouth", "day": "10"}
