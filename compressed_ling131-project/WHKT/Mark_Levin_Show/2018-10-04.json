dot com speaking the dummy energy\nJoining us now is Aaron ... media relations manager with dominion energy and he also currently serves as spokesperson and chief communications strategist for the Atlantic coast pipeline a six billion dollars six hundred mile interstate natural gas transmission pipeline\nThat is owned by a number of energy companies and uh we're going to get an update on where we are 'cause I Want\nMy pipeline Aaron great to have you been morning John how you doing [noise] fired up today Aaron\nJobs good paying jobs by the way all these pipeline jobs average salary Ninety five thousand dollars these are great jobs man and they last a long time but then after pipelines up you get manufacturing and you get bored shops that's what the whole thing is about now\nWe had to stop for a while give us enough to\nBuy so just remind folks just as the Atlantic coast pipeline as you described it some new\nOr natural gas transmission pipeline that's going to bring new supplies of cheaper natural gas than to Virginia and North Carolina this was all about as you talked about this was all about growing the economy bringing manufacturing back to eastern Virginia Hampton Roads\nLowering our energy costs some businesses can grow family is going to have more money in their pockets\nAnd it's also about making our electricity cleaner so obviously we've been shutting down a lot of coal plants over the last several years because of tighter environmental controls and regulations and we'll replacing that with cleaner burning natural gas solar wind and all the things that you talked about before\nSo this this project is all about growing the economy\nCreating thousands of new jobs rebuilding the manufacturing sector\nUm we started construction earlier in the summer and we made a lot of progress in West Virginia North Carolina\nOr haven't started yet and Virginia we're still waiting on one final approval from the state environmental agency but we expect to get underway in Virginia here I'm pretty short like ah you're right that for about six weeks or we have to stop work I'm the\nFourth circuit court of appeals uh ordered a couple of agencies the fish and Wildlife Service the national Park Service to revise some of their opponents\nThe agencies were able to do that relatively quickly and suddenly got back to work once the\nPermits ... shoot a few weeks ago and we're hosting the hat and in West Virginia North Carolina and I'm hopefully starting to Virginia here pretty soon\nSo the six week holed up what is the barriers and now they're just getting the John in Virginia just put it in layman's terms for listeners\nChurch so we need we we we've got all the state and federal permits we need for\nVirginia and North Carolina this is a free state project [noise] ah we have one more permanent that still outstanding and Virginia and it's the it's a permit for erosion and sediment control basically Virginia Department of environmental quality they regulate construction\nProjects so that you don't create erosion and sediment patients so that you get much water and the streams and rivers\nUm the agency has done an incredibly thorough job of reviewing every single end of the pipelines pass through Virginia all of our roads and incitement control plans I'm paid been reviewing our plans for for more than a year now [noise] um but we expect to get\nFinal approval on those plants here I'm In the early fall so we'll we'll be able to get underway and Virginia and then we'll be working continuously through the end of next year\nEarly or late in the spring or early in the summer [noise] um and we'll we'll finish up and up next year [noise] John this is all that you know once this project is built [noise]\nPeople are going to see a significant improvement in the economy particularly in the eastern uh area in Hampton Roads um they're gonna see lower energy costs you know the problem with God and Virginia is we have a result of our our natural gas infrastructure for decades and so the infrastructure that we have\nIsn't keeping up with consumer demand that we're using more and more natural gas to generate cleaner electricity heat her lose power the economy but we haven't built more infrastructure to bring in\nThe additional supplies of natural gas but we need so what's happening is the last four winners the pipelines were so over a strain that serve our region that\nBusinesses have their service shut off for several days hundreds of major industrial companies had their their natural gas service cut off and consumers paid hundreds of millions of dollars for an energy costs than they would have if we had the Atlanta 'cause ... it's it's simple laws of supply and demand\nMore demand and supply your your prices are going to skyrocket so until we get the Atlantic coast pipeline built consumers and businesses are going to pay hundreds of millions more energy costs than they should\nUm and businesses are going to continue to have their their service shut off during the winter and so that that makes it hard to do business for our party different companies but it makes it impossible to attract new industries like manufacturing to help grow the economy so this this infrastructure is really critical to our economy it's important for the environment\nWe're making progress and and we're going to get a ton\nI Want you Aaron\nAaron and she spoke person and a communications strategic communications manager for dominion energy for the Atlantic coast pipeline I Want you to address the concerns of those people that are opposed to the pipeline\nOn environmental grounds um\nI don't I don't mean the ground so I just don't like any type of energy except solar and wind that's one set\nA but then there's the other side which is they have real environmental concerns that of course our position has always been if you're going to transport national natural gas there's only three ways train truck or pipeline

and filibusters it used to be sixty it's now down to fifty one and so if you have invoked cloture on day three friday voted to cut off debate then a thirty\nOur clock begins to run that's all the time that the minority that opponents of the nomination can consume until it culminating in a confirmation vote probably on Saturday thirty hours thereafter\nShannon the Senate rules say you vote on culture one after one hour after you come in to what's possible they could have\nCome in friday morning or twelve a one have that procedural vote at what a lot on friday morning\nWere you and I may be here doing that [laughter] happens overnight okay so where do we know about where they can win votes on either side now\nYeah it absolutely about the math the math the math you heard me say that many times before look at the trio Mitch McConnell needs to keep the trail Jeff Flake\nThe anti cabinet of forces are going to go\nAbsolutely crazy today\nCrazy and and I'll tell you why the snakes are so hot here right talking about overplay their hand\nUm [noise] there's a new Harris Poll that came out yesterday came out a Wednesday morning six AM and it shows that while many Americans believe capital shouldn't be confirmed I'll be for the FBI has concluded its seventh background check\n[noise] uh the poll has some great news for Republicans a Quinnipiac poll released at the same time so we have two polls that came out\nLast uh yesterday after out off the air Clinton packing house [noise]\n\nVoters are overwhelmingly supporting cabinet\nIf the FBI check comes Claire [noise] and so this is going to motivate Republican that Trump voters to turn out now we've got to pull out we got thirty three days before the midterms\nIt shows the Democratic generic ballot lead over Republicans now at seven seven points three weeks ago and it had grown to fourteen so it it's cut in half\nOf telling you seven is not enough for pillow seem to be speaker they've got to get this up to ten or twelve because all of these polls are always give it to the Democrats and they need more than seven to this is great news for Republicans meet John\nMcLaughlin poll has the generic ballot different out for so this whole fiasco as we have predicted with Kavanaugh\nHas backfired on the Democrats\nTo such an extent that they are now on the verge of potentially snatching defeat on November ... from the jaws of victory [noise] um\nNow last night senator tricky Dick Durban sent a letter to Chuck Grassley asking for the Judiciary Committee to correct to tweets\nThat plane previous background checks on Kavanaugh detain you know issues\nOf sexual misconduct or alcohol abuse and what more he could say about\nA turban replied nothing\nSo now they're complaining about Twain Durbin said that the Republican staff tweets are inaccurate\nBut he really couldn't comment on it because the uh the stuff of confidence confidential [noise] Republicans defended the tweets in question and said that the committee stands by a statement which is completely truthful more base will turn your window\nAnd fall smears from Senate Democrats [noise] judiciary panel Republicans said in a judiciary panel collaborative choice now here's what happens\nIf friday's expected procedural vote on the nomination of judge Kavanaugh it successful a final vote on Kavanaugh protect plates Saturday\nNight at the earliest that majority leader Mitch O'Connell is eager to install cabinet into the court over the weekend given that the new court term just began\nNow McConnell denied\nA request from a Senate majority leader Chuck Schumer [noise] for an FBI briefing for alternatives calling it unprecedented in a regular and suggested that\nDemocrats would just use it as a pretext to delay the nomination [noise] Grassley had earlier set out Wednesday that given senators two days to view the document before the vote example time\nThey have Thursday and friday or Thursday and friday and just go every review would get off your buck but out stairs going the basement and read the damp [noise]\nBut of course Democrats are just going to complain about this the whole\nRepublican senators Jeff Flake Susan Collins and Lisa Murkowski hold the cards right they're the ones that asked for the one week away we had the one week to lay the FBI did the\nInvestigation they investigated the witnesses for Ford in ... Republican leaders agreed to the way we had to delay we had the investigation flake said\nYesterday afternoon that he's comfortable voting as long as he has the FBI report before okay so you have the FBI report\nTheir according to the White House links\nThere's nothing in it that corroborate\nAny of these false allegations against this man and so now what are you going to do ... nobody got to do well I'd ask for additional information good riddance [noise] what is this guy leaves and other Seventy days\nOh my God\n\nNow with so much at stake the president and other Republicans backing cabinet\nHave really started to step up their attacks on this whole the fiasco [noise] taking a page out to vote Lindsey Graham's book\n[noise] so [noise] the or\nTrump criticizing the for testimony at a rally the other day we played that clip several times\nI don't think that was helpful luck I\nAm for getting distracted from now because there's nothing in it and I said look if there's a bombshell in it obviously then that's a different story Our phone lines open ended in for a though John ... five six for sex you can take the seven five seven six Nineteen Seventy ten seven five seven six nine to Seventeen time hey\nWay you know I'm not sure if I've known him since I'm Still getting text for people just don't even know if you listen to me enrichment I W wants you W and you may twenty or Ninety two point seven FM\nAlthough my show goes to ten I'm only on there 'til nine\nMy nine to ten hour is replayed on those two stations [noise] six seven at night and drive time so if you want to catch my nine to ten hour it's six to seven\nPm Monday the Thursday or friday I don't think I'm odd because I think they play I don't know Amanda Chase or something I'm not really sure what they do I think that's it but uh I Know for a fact Monday through Thursday the nine or ten hour is replayed six to seven I Believe\nMy my coming back in the studio and just think if that's not accurate let me know I don't follow all the stuff that closely but I think so 'cause I've got\nA lot of tech saying hey W W cuts you off at night well they they do but they don't because then they re replay it every day or six to seven pm Dr time you're on the John favorite radio network in for a job\nFor a you know five six for six uh\nWe serve I get to a few text here [noise] gender\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe all important Quinnipiac poll which is pretty accurate any thing how'd the gap growing to gene three weeks ago that's the dangerous [noise] soon as the Democrats get up by more than twelve\nOn the generic ballot they're going to take control that's all the history shows that they get under ten not so much they need twenty three states\nThree lean Republican or in the bag Democrats too old to lean Democrat or when the bag thirty seats are going to decide who controls the house Democrats have to win sixteen isn't their favorite but we'll see the cabin all fiasco\nHas really hurt the Democrats in the short term and their behavior so bizarre meantime I'm coming from a nation's capital in Washington DC great to have you with us as always at\nThe courtroom and down the miraculous Milky Way galactic headquarters phone lines are open this where American comes to talk in the morning for you know John anything for you know five six for six if you're in Richmond we just added a new effort that necessarily a check it out Ninety two points out of an accent\nNumerous went out\nAnd also coming you a brand new talk station W.

J. deal just fabulous like issue or an hour and official media mogul [noise]\nWell I'm not sure about\nThat but um you know we're\nWe're very we're very frustrated with the coverage of some of the talk stations around the area and we were certainly disappointed that we lost or affiliate\nIn tide water which I was on for eight years since I started so we decided to go to a new strategy and just start to buy them and then when you do what we want and so that's a that's kind of what the the goal is and and we're looking forward to it we'll see what works out\nCongratulations on their success so far I Know I Know your IX look I just wanted to comment on\nA little girl you you are just facetiously talk about my comment on\nWhat what caused him to grow up here I'm going to call for culture and so on\nAnd you know Donna thick religious two things struck me about that I mean the one thing that matches study on all the way through and really pretty supportive of the president has been the whole issue the judges on the on the lower courts and [noise] um when they're done a great job there so I think [noise]\nThis is a strike in support of his but also John [noise] for the first\nThe one who was confronted by some left wing nurse and I think that that was probably about the dumbest thing is I could have done and I brought it home personally to him and I don't think that uh I don't think that that hurt any encouraging him to do to continue to have the\nThe stiffs bond or somebody other Republicans have not had [noise] and I'm I'm not a big fan of ... ... what a lot of time watching it but it was wonderful last night I watch much of a call ... speech on for the Senate [noise]\nAnd it was just wonderful hearing his among up\nHis summation of the whole you know how we got here where we are where we are going\nOn here just or just a beautiful job by these kind of put down there and it's kinda tough to listen to some times but he just to ... point by point sharp and to me I Know left and right irreconcilable\nRight now but it's just like anybody that was willing to listen to reason [noise] um he just did a terrific job of laying out here's where we are and here's why we're here\nAt uh I Wish everybody in the country could hear what he thought the ten minutes so they spent talking on CSPAN yesterday [noise]\nJohn you make some very good point uh as I understand which is the number one you said than that right\nLeft and right\nHas um I have um differences that just can't be solved right now when\nThe I I I also think you're right the confrontation with McConnell and his wife at trying to go to the air port a backfired on the\nLeft because I think like you said I'm not you're not dealing with him and ate me I'm Seventy years old like I'm done with all this stuff and I think the third thing is I think they have they have under the they\nThey look at these Trump rallies and they looked at the Trump victory and they look at the level of support the president is able to generate because he does it back\nAnd the Republicans have\nDown for so long and so on one second nature because they don't really stand for anything except getting themselves reelected and\nI think the Lindsey Graham's or the world and the McConnell's are seeing that Trump voters want something else and they will abandon them in a heartbeat if they don't stand for something and so I think that's part of it also but you know look there's this is just out John You're welcome to stay on we a few\nYou you want but this just now the White House\nHas released a report that they found no corroboration of the allegations of sexual misconduct against\nSupreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh this after examining interview reports from the FBI latest probe\nInto the judges background [noise] now it's unclear whether the White House which for weeks has raised doubts about the allegations has completed its review of the FBI\nThey're linking that\nThe conclusions from the report aren't definitive at this point and so there is no new information Chuck Grassley the Senate Judiciary chairman said on Twitter just a few moments ago that the ... the the committee had received the report\nAnd everybody will have a chance to look at Russia and the spokesperson for the White House on his confirm mention fiasco [noise] put a statement out a few moments ago and said\nThe White House has received the FBI investigation supplemental background\nInvestigation and it's being transmitted to the Senate but they have leaked that there's nothing new in it there's no box show there is no cooperation\nI don't know what Jeff Flake is going to do now or the Democrats are going to do just simply nothing there there was never anything they're sort of had an investigation they have the week they had their stole they have the hearings they had just poured they have the delaying they had the obstruction they had the crying they had\nEverything now now they're gonna have to vote and let me tell you something [noise] you've got at least two Democrats right now that if they vote no they can make plans for vacation in January\nBecause Heidi Heitkamp a Joe Manchin if they vote no both of them will go down a slim\nBecause the polling numbers in their states in favor of Kavanaugh is like in twenty I mean it's it's not even within the scope of reason it's like ...

minister Trudeau asked for your turn it down is that true and he said absolutely\nAnd then he said not only did I turn the meeting down I've instructed might trade team just stopped negotiating with Canada\nThey're not negotiating in good faith\nI don't appreciate how they're going about this they don't understand the stakes here and so I've told them we're going to go into Mexico and maybe they'll come back to the table some other time but I said stop negotiating with them where\nThat was when Sunday night you get a deal what happened [noise]\nNinety nine percent of the deal was done based on a framework lay down with uh the Mexico deal member um some weeks ago\nWe entered into a bilateral with Mexico and that did all the high notes hit ... ah in the manufacturing space a strong domestic content and the cars we build\nRenting it hit market access for agricultural products that hit the notes were protecting digital trade and so called biologics which are pharmaceuticals [noise]\nUh at at the modern the end of the spectrum\nThat we were still a little a little part on a couple of things like Gary and some dispute resolution mechanisms are and I yeah I I said this on the air on TV and radio you know I was puzzled why I was taking\nSo long to get to um agreement that really benefited all three countries so I mean at the end of the day\nLike in this to a boxing match were were a lot of punches I get thrown but it the matches over now that all three parties raise up their hands and\nThat they signed in Nineteen Ninety four for NAFTA [noise] um this is actually good for America what a concept\nI Know right where we're hearing about it is I mean\nI'm telling you you you know this better than I Am means NAFTA was a bad deal for America America\nChina getting into the WTO and two thousand and one which was pushed by by Clinton in Congress bad deal for America twenty twelve South Korean deal I mean we lost over a hundred thousand jobs from Marilyn the auto industry\nThat deal for America I mean the president is line in these things up a well like uh the pins in a bowling alley and knock them down and it's beautiful thing to watch\nIt really is where it went viral he's assistant to the president for trade in manufacturing and the west wing he's also a senior economic policy adviser Peter Navarro was scared to some of the items in this new deal the U.S and see U.S Mexico Canada\nSome of the differences some of the changes if you could go through some of the bigger ones that would be great\nSure let's start with the easy stuff which is the modernization of agreement back in Nineteen Ninety four there were some things that didn't exist and therefore did a provisions are one of them obviously is digital train which is the protection\nOf of copyright Perino actual property is transferred over the net something as simple as a\nAs an electronic book you might might buy and read have strong provisions or for that there's a there's these things called biologics which is a reference to a big complicated of pharmaceuticals are very research intensive that are designed\nA overtime to cure things like cancer rheumatoid arthritis or whatever and uh we got a strong\nProtections for that up to ten years why is that important is because unless companies have protection\nA so that they can make some money on these things over a period of time or they won't put in the money for the research and development so so that's that's all good ah so so innovators are taken care of a digital trades taking care of now um\nAnother a small but important thing relatives the scope of the whole deal uh we were able to resolve some of the area she's with Canada and so uh that's good news will have much more market access there as well as for other\nTypes of products like chicken and egg things like that so that's good for me as a director of the office of trade manufacturing policy or the good the big white whale here that we actually got was a bringing back the supply chain to North America particularly\nFor the auto industry with NAFTA did in Nineteen Ninety four is create a set of incentives to offshore our auto parts industry in turn or vertically integrated manufacturing\nAuto plants into assembly plants performed\nThe and Mexico as well so the key provision is Seventy five percent of the of any car that's that's a made has\nTo have a a\nA U.S parts Seventy five percent and then to ensure that the u._s. gets its fair share\nOf that region on content uh there's a strong provision for labor in their strong provision for the environment so you can't have sweat shops and pollution have in South of a border grabbing that business so that's kind of dramatically change\nThe structure and supply chain of the global auto industry in a way where we is is the largest purchaser of vehicles a per capita a will benefit from that so that that's that's that's the big deal it's it's great news for this country\nOr or they're also safeguards that\nWould discourage China for instance from jumping into Canada\nAnd then bringing them into the U.S by a third party which have been great\nTennis screwed crushing yeah yes there are a and um we were written that you'd be enhanced border for a review and things like that but there's also a couple of provisions in there which which are going to be part of any agreement that we sign that that are directly\nAh aimed at the unfair trade practices that China for example there's in the jargon they called disciplines that called the disciplines on state owned enterprises being able to enter enter the zone and\nUh China is kind of the leading purveyor of state owned enterprises that engaging unfair trade practices but it's also a provision in there for currency manipulation a and again there's a lot of countries out there that purposely undervalue their currency is way of boosting air force discouraging our exports to them\nAnd trade deficit so\nIf you look at this thing this agreement um we see it uh both as a great deal\nIn and of itself but we also see it as the most sophisticated cutting edge template for future agreements in by the way I'd bury the lead here it is the largest at one point two trillion dollars it's the largest trade deal the U.S has ever entered into and", "show_name": "Mark Levin Show", "year": "2018", "city":
