know vote through your parking lot or who you're voting for votes for somebody but you got to get involved Congress when we got a upwards of ... people in Mexico from South America in a caravan\nThey expected to be ten thousand with how many hits the U.S former rushing the border many Democrats are saying hey have a heart letter man it's all good they want better jobs and a better life however when they step foot in the country they break the law because they have no paperwork so there are legal so they didn't go through the system\nHowever when the second\nFootsteps in a then there's three other laws that protect\nHim basically saying if they claim asylum you can't throw them out you have the\nProcess of you can only hold them for twenty days you can't separate their children after twenty days well you can't process them so they're simply released and\nThey disappear into the interior of the country some people say ten thousand today a hundred thousand tomorrow what is your position congressman on the caravan\nYeah well my my position is that cannot\nHappen I one of the readers I don't want to hear that you're after we one of my big electric four years ago there was a huge energy bills all through Congress center went down\nAnd explain to the next day and so my fans are fairly clear on it is that's the last segment we're talking about Los ... you're in a commercial was politically back in the primary both of them together promoting a progressive agendas rather than what you're going to get\nRight with the Democrats my opponent doesn't want to say that in the status district but she says everything it's not the main terms\nRight she says just let everybody here and we got to have a legal pathways through your as long as people work et cetera that means the caravan income and she'd open borders she won't say otherwise she won't give it up or boundaries\nFor sanctuary cities which is even worse and she won't come out and say that instead she praises it in the negative she says we should enforce federal law just left localities deal with caravans coming in to the country went under the constitution the federal government has given\nAs if it gets already there and so I I don't think people trying to get the barrier what she's actually saying that she's not\nOver saying don't follow federal law she's saying let's nor the law of the land he's running as a wall or divorced my candidate brain let's not follow the law is on land here and that's probably why I\nHave the support of the fraternal order of police down here and if you're going to talk of the sheriff's they're horrified right they have to deal with a massive in flow of drugs three hundred million lethal doses affecting all came across the border just this year and then human trafficking based\nBuying into just sit there and human evil that's coming through the border and all our share of snow about it and not the people are starting to see the real impact most family parents\nHave to face is terrible scenario with a loved one with the drug addiction opioid heroin or spending all et cetera\nAnd spreading through the seventh district and he every sheriff will tell you that\nIt's so hot you couldn't have a more stark comparison right the Democrats open border and I and then who prays all the costs who pays education emergency rooms welfare scored the taxpayer dollars are\nDemocrats promote everybody to come and they want to get more votes by the American taxpayer pays the bills and and you know that there should be construed as being anti immigrant we're a nation of immigrants we just we have a legal system for a million immigrants for a year\nOr this country is a melting pot all the people that want to come are all children of God\nOr like that it has to do if you're not legally the reason they're leading Guatemala\nAnd Honduras El Salvador's because of the rule of law has broken down\nAnd if you look at the blue states for the people are moving from blue states to red states the reasons are leading blue states and blue cities like San Francisco which Chicago and New York is taking a crime is rampant in Democrats precincts they are not good rule of law they say they are and\nNot all the evidence shows it's very clear where people are moving they're moving to red states and then a lot of those folks from blue wants to change the red states turning blue so it makes no sense I think the American people are starting to get a real handle on how all these things are hurt their lives and their semantic change\nSo comes specifically what should be done to stop the care of and you see one is stopping what specifically should we do to stop it from entering the in the United states\nYeah well it's like you said the catch and release is incredibly problematic\nOnce you put one foot here under US law you're given a\nCertain systems legal status and so you got to keep that from happening and so the president is doing the right thing working with Mexico that's she writes ... offered asylum the books are coming from Guatemala Honduras et cetera et cetera that if they're really seeking asylum you go to the first neighboring country which show that should solve the problem\nWith our folks are saying right and they've been interviews\nI Know we want jobs ... jobs is not a asylum right before the harm or repression from your government and so we've got to get it straight I think the White House is a mess and ah we we need to change\nThe law and and this will or gas ... show the American it he can you imagine if you say yes to take care of and then you're sending a message to ... billion more people on the planet that\nHey United States has a generous welfare state or you got to do is get caravan\nOf skills as ignore the rule of law or commandeer highways from Mexico takes you know ignore the rule of law there are\nFar to the U.S is that your your get all the titles here for either the welfare programs education free emergency ... everything under taxpayers are paying for it and it's simply American people have to reject that or will lose the rule of law in this country\nA time when the towers\nUm mid term

three seats right twenty three states twelve of them are duck twelve of them may have been in\nSo it's not twenty three this is what you got to get its not twenty three states twelve of them or a foregone conclusion the Democratic candidates are way ahead of the Republicans\nAcross the country so it's not twenty three it's a lemon\nSome never close but\nMaybe they'll flip one seat it maybe I think one where he says three I don't want want so that\nLeaves eleven seats the Democrats\nIn age there are thirty toss ups including Virginia seven they've already given the seats are actually there

one out of three the Republicans have to win\nTwenty of the twenty ninth\nOr Nineteen right yeah that's what Nineteen Republicans have to win Nineteen up to twenty nine states and then you got one seat that's tied that\nIs held by a Democrat who might flip obviously that would help but if there's if there's any kind of a blue trend going on and the roots and the Trump voters don't show they could win\nTwenty five of those seats and that gives them the fifteenth seat majority right if they win eleven states they're going to have a majority by one so this is very very close so for the Republicans to hang on for the Republicans to hang\nOn they have to win a they have to weigh in Nineteen\nOf the remaining twenty United States that are open if they can do that they can maintain power by one vote unless somebody some\nRhino were to make a deal with the Democrats and flip but if he did that are the guys get run out of town on a rail so I'm not sure that what happened but

polling information and are not identical like emailing me and saying all the polls are wrong yet many of them are but you can get at least if you look at a lot of polls you've been at least you got to a\nContext of the closeness now the only way the president keeps control the house is if Trump voters show up like they didn't seem thousand sixteen and nobody saw them coming\n\nThat's the only way because the difference here is you know that the Democrats are going to turn out\n\nThey're going to turn out that so it's up to you know are the Trump voters and a lot of these histories come out

J. F. one hundred twenty five Richmond in Charlottesville\nRepublican running for Congress in the fifth district this is a sprawling district goes all the way from Charlottesville all the way out south sides Virginia Danville all that figure that New Jersey's Denver is a Republican candidate a\nRunning to replace the retiring Tom and Jerry is opposed by Leslie Coburn in this race at Denver great to have you\nHey great to be here six days in the wake of John and we're a November sex\nI Know right you're going to roll your you only got a you only got six campaign days remaining a we've got lots of talking about\nToday Deborah I Want to get your comments on a few uh\nThings that your tone of your democratic opponent Leslie ... said may I sure of course okay I'll start with the clip here from Michael back at a studio or whatever [noise] like shift my bike if you get a\nCute is up for us or the first football I Want is um corporate husband uh talking about\nPresident George Bush back in the day are doing what seems to be an anti Semitic ran out of print the husband because he suggested himself in his campaign and Mike if we can get that that would cut one the first one that I uh just a few I say you two packages this would be the first one uh\nThat I sent my if you can see that\nResurrection go ahead\n\nAnd ... you write that George W. Bush sent to his father went and neo cons\nHave tried to say a\nForm of ram and took a set of communication between the two ah Bush said to ah they routed kind of a tennis court and Bush said a junior says can I ask a question what's the cause of the father says\nDo you want names are description and the president says I'll take a description and he says I'll get a job one word Israel which is interesting on all sorts of levels including the confirmation that all\nPresidents doesn't really need to read the newspapers\nExplain what you mean when you say that and how do you know that the conversation on the plane you know while\nI called really say who tells me but I ... it's someone who was I have absolute confidence in both in that I'm a type of telling the truth and also in that position to be aware of this conversation\nDenver a\nThat was Leslie Coburn husband a doubt\nThat he has injected himself in his campaign makes fun of your military service and things of that nature so he's now open fodder I'm he's also the author of the\nFoot or dangerously liaisons with his wife your corner running for Congress or does that sound a bit and say some medic or is it just for me\nI mean you know for for for this um\nIt seems like since I wrote the book the one thing that I noticed when I when I listen to something read something when I Do any type of analysis you consider the source and this is the same thing that they get in their book also they have some sources that would say like you to he\nJust said there at the end that um he he had somebody can say the name of who it was but it was somebody right and that's what they even did in your book like that anonymous\nTo go into conspiracy or to again personally demonize people or again this this whole thing that always comes back to the anti Israel says it it just always sort of swings back around this way and I'm and I sort of scratch my head that\nThis is even taken seriously by anyone about what's been said either on C SPAN\nThe books that they've road or even the fact that they have real issues with\nWith Twitter like with me but also with things like you just heard I mean it just sounds\nIt just sounds crazy and uh you know and I've been so careful in the last couple of weeks we've been trying to move back to you know just make sure its policy because we've been personally attacked so much a but it just seems to me that they have a real issue with Israel and only a real issue with Israel they have a real issue with shore sings and they\nHave a real a real love of conspiracy theories and it just seems like this is\nSort of the ... of of since dangerous liaison or even before that because you know their history really isn't free markets either so it's just a very interesting thing maybe here you know this lack of sourcing it always goes back to anti Israel and this sort of bizarre thing of destroying everybody personally by you know by implying that George W. Bush\nAnd stupid or that somebody actually would tell him what's going on between the conversation between Bush's Bush\nSenior it's ludicrous actually and I think that's where I Want to it's just ludicrous\nThat it is and whether it it seems to be whatever you're doing something up on these people and it gets back to anti Israel anti Semite Nancy uh anti\nShooting always assumed that it only got a factor that\nAlways always you're always it always rolls back around that whatever you did it was really the question you know about\nYou know what's in it that's what he wanted to go back to was Israel and and to me that that was the whole basis of what he wanted to get to not just that George W. Bush you know had a issues with what it knowing what an ... or not the fact that they had a source that he can obviously talked about which seems to be what happens when all the way back\nTo this anti Israel thing and and just you get to the point you're just you shake your head and you've had enough and I think most people most people realize what's going on there All right\nI'm going to run a couple of other clubs here from Culver and I want to get your reaction to here's one she did a radio show obviously there will not do mine [laughter] I think that a radio show and the ah let's Berg area pride in Murray where\nUh they they asked er Brian asked her about her negative comments on making fun of your military service let's run that I Want to get your reaction to this like a military service cuts to\nThe to your husband Andrew posted on Twitter about to be talking about Mr ... risking money power snorkeling off ...
