vote to get the main vote to the well on the floor then the big vote will be coming on Saturday\nSo that's how it stands right now the Democrats in these red states Heitkamp mansion in a tremendous Fox polls are showing in their states there is overwhelming support for judge Kavanaugh especially now that\nSomehow be down on western supporters to the point that they don't vote 'em and then can simultaneously encourage Comstock I'm I'm supporters to vote so it's a real up he'll challenge [noise]\nOkay so let me ask you a few questions I looked at the cross tabs and I just have a couple of questions if I may sure um I didn't see him bring down for a region obviously Tom stocks much stronger in western part of the reason I didn't see a regional breakdown [noise]\nYeah because we didn't wait on it um [noise] ... we're we're we we try to wait as minimal as possible I'm In a survey and so we wait on race um tax and I'm an age\nAnd um we don't wait on region aren't I'm simply uncertain about ... you know how\nComfortable I Am waiting on returning a congressional district survey I'm with a smaller sample size if I had\nFifteen hundred respond inside feel more comfortable doing it but\nWe have seven hundred and Ninety correspondence here which is larger than some of the other I'm pulling that's coming out um you know it's a respectable sample size but when you start\nBreaking a congressional district down into regions you're talking about moving um or waiting I'm you know thirty and forty voters at a time and I'm simply\nUncomfortable methodological doing that and so we didn't wait a sub originally which which is how you would characterize sub originally within the congressional district [noise]\nSo Dr King having said that since you know breakdown of region and I understand your reasoning um the way I looked at various you told [noise]\nForty six percent of your correspondents were making over a hundred and fifty thousand dollars [noise] obviously if you live in that area that's about what you make so I get that\nSixty four percent were making over a hundred thousand but what that says to me it's really didn't sample the western part of the district at all which is Barbara stronghold because I'm her voters they're\nMake well under a hundred thousand dollars going out into the Winchester area\nSo sure that like a quarter\nOf respondents are making under a hundred thousand dollars and um [noise] the the the the larger part of the population in our district is on the eastern side which is where\nThere's more voters in the east and they make more money about twenty five percent you you told us not enough to put a Barbara in a I'm In a competitive position is that the way I understand that\nYou know well I mean generally that's what I'm saying um the the income breakdown looks very similar to what the district looks like so if you look at age if you look\nAt education if you look at all the basic demographics I think we're accurately reflecting the district pretty well I'm recognizing that a Barbara Comstock stronger on the western side of the district in on the eastern side of the district it also is in fact that the west side of the district is\nPopulation is much smaller much lower than the more urban and suburban eyes the eastern part of the district\nSo one of the question I have is um and I appreciate your coming out because it's just this is fun normally you know you're just saying what you're told is I really tried to spend some time to figure it out [noise]\nUm so according to your poll Barbara Comstock is leading west and buy one where a\nBunch of for forty five plus right credible barbers winning that group forty five and older is it possible you may have over sampled a younger vote in the ... district [noise]\nUm no if you look at our ... if you look at our demographic breakdown our our age [noise] you know here's the deal we know what the age distribution of the district is because we know what the voting age population is with census data and so\nUm you know we're talking to about twenty five percent of voters who are thirty five an under um Seventy five percent of voters are\nAre ah thirty five an older in actually eighty percent of voters or thirty five an older so we're not over sampling young voters in disproportionate to their\nShare of the voting age population in the district um you know the district looks the demographics of the survey look look pretty much like what the district looks like um [noise] and we have we have access to all this data so we we know what the district's gonna look like [noise]\nSo you've also have low approval ratings and the district by President Trump um disapprove sixty nine percent approved thirty eight percent and along with that\nAlthough you didn't told a Senate race you said that you did ask the question within the district\nAnd that was being stored in a in the tens district by Twenty one fifty five to thirty four which basically is [noise] doomsday restored I mean you can't I mean what if I I mean I've said this over and over and over having\nRun the Trump campaign in Virginia in two thousand [noise] sixteen I mean we carried south West Virginia five big numbers but when you lose Fairfax I think we've lost Fairfax Alexandria in Arlington by a hundred and forty four\nI mean there's not enough people in Radford to make that up you simply can't make it up it's just too many yeah and and I\nAnd I think you know you pointed out Trump's approval and you pointed out um the Senate race numbers and we did those uh because we wanted that test really what we think are the two ... two of the big things that are shaping this election in the tent um what kind of headwinds are coming out of Washington\nI'm a related to Donald Trump\nAnd are there are coat tails or lack of coattails were negative coattails when it relates to the Senate race in both of those situations that Comstock is facing strong headwinds I'm Out of Washington a lot of her constituents aren't happy with\nThe president and what he's doing and what Republicans were doing and Corey Stewart isn't helping in any way in fact he's probably hurting because people who aren't excited about coming out to vote\nFor a Senate race or a half to get excited about their local racing if they're not excited about their local race are likely not to turn out to vote and you know so that means Republicans who would otherwise be excited about Corey Stewart and aren't a Barbara Comstock has to work extra hard to attract\nTheir attention to say look you need to come out and vote in this congressional race even if you're not happy about Corey Stewart [noise]\nLet me ask you something\nJust a kid that you can glean from the polling in the day she spent the district what it's if you could give a figure or I'm a ballpark to what degree is Corey Corey Stewart on the ballot\nTo what degree she hurting Harvard's ability to get reelected if your put it on a scale of one or two in one day\nMuch tending a yeah big time what would it be based on your readers Paul\nWell probably somewhere below five I'm probably somewhere between two and five or three and five I mean I think to some extent he's been baked into the to the calculation for ... to ... you know for some voters\nBut I Do that there is it is the case that turnout is typically higher in the U.S Senate race than it is in a local congressional race\nAnd so if you happen to have a U.S Senate race going on in the same year that your local congressional races going on\nAnd you're or Senate candidate is\nWay ahead and you need those coat tails that's good for you and Barbara Comstock doesn't have that this\nYear she's got um a Senate candidate who's running behind 'em by anywhere from ... we haven't Twenty one points behind in their district state why he's running behind anywhere Fifteen to twenty points that's not helpful to Comstock it's hurtful to her because she has to work her campaign has to work extra hard\nTo reach out to those voters who would otherwise be engaged because they were engaged by the Senate race she's gotta work extra hard to reach out to them and say look I Need you to still be engaged for me and I think that's part of the problems she's having\nSo I think it would be fair to say look and you have to have the numbers you're probably going to\nAnd the other two competitive was a I Would say so I Would think you're probably gonna gonna see that Stewart thing a drag on all the Republicans in Virginia ... who are competitive races because of the toxicity of of some of the things he's said and done\nHalf minutes are we going to get you back on are you going to do a poll on a second and the seventh also\nWe are in the field we went into the field last night on the second um sir right after we took this when we went into the field on a second will come out in about eight days with that and then we're going into the field and the seven um and will come out\nUm later October on the seven so we're spending our season doing congressional pulling because the Senate race doesn't look very competitive [noise]\nAll right well we should have a lot of fun that means we'll have you went back at least two more times of that and then we'll keep our tradition and have you on the day of the elections and make their final poll introductions Dr Clinton get thanks for being with us Abigail burger coming up Democrats seventh district keep it right\nWhat happened when I began my career in law enforcement or before then later transitioning to\nAnd from a teaching perspective it was a really interesting place to teach some of the kids were at the local Americans from northern Virginia but you know it was it was a very interesting place to teach shouldn't and and be the American teacher that all of these diplomatic children had\nThey're kind of point of reference in at someone who later went overseas and my colleagues have their kids in\nAmerican schools abroad you know part of the cultural learning is having the teachers who were local area to teach their language teach their culture and so it was actually a really interesting experience\nFor me to be the kind of American English teacher for a bunch of young kids who many of whom were returning to their country of origin when their parents diplomatic time in Iraq was over\nSo it sounds like what you're saying it's jobs in your uh\nYour personal and professional situation and you simply thought it would be interesting\nRight now pretty much yeah okay\nLet's get to this for you um you claim that your staff did uphold research on yourself incentive for your request and never got a response back from the government\nYet when CNN for you on your own for yeah they said oh forty was never submitted so there's a discrepancy there how do you reconcile the up and go\nFor starters I Would say that ... that we hired an outside an investigator to do a background investigation and basically determine what were the information that someone politically aligned with my opponent would gather around me and then you try to use against me um and so he individual\nSwitch notably that was the Institute for which where I actually worked on the differences with what America Rising did on behalf of the congressional leadership fund the safe side older poorer with\nNational personal record center which has a different entities right on the political inspection service on their website um requires that all four years and I've requested all four years be submitted be a male which is what our individual did um and yeah and the response of never received\nBack from us or we've never received anything back over all that didn't look particularly confusing are alerting or problems problematic to me because our only goal is to understand what would be the experience of someone else who was boy a young man right um\nBut then even though you're claims you did that for you to get a response CNN they could afford it on your point\nThere was no record of it so yeah there's also\nThe same entity that release my unreal acted personal national security questionnaire\nUm so I mean at this point [noise]\nI have a little I have a little bit less space in the fact that they're following the steps that they should be following I mean the the real the real issue here is the U.S postal service [noise] I'm In violation of federal law the privacy act wrote released my national security questionnaire which is\nA fully protected document\nIn providing and processing back rotten background investigations and providing clearances and I\nOf course received a secret clearance for my time and on for Smith and top secret clearance with special compartment in to passage for my time with with the eye and so the violation was when the U.S postal service violated the law by releasing that of course later it was distributed\nAnd it fully under doctors swarmed by another entity [noise] so are you saying\nThat the spanberger team absolutely you're saying that you absolutely Center for your request and now you're claiming that based on top of the some of them releasing all of your rejected information it's not\nA reason to think that they were the top of that and not being able to find the for you that you also better\nI'm actually saying that it's a distraction from the real violation of law and the violation of law occurred when the postal service broke the law\nBy providing my information one of the pieces of the story and it's also not reported on is that the national personnel records center actually initially denied the request when we bought the player that America Rising submit and um and so there's so many more questions to the situation but really what it boils down to\nIs there is a violation of federal law my national security questionnaire which is the documents that anyone who's speaking of security security clearance fills out and those are not members of our military members of law enforcement members of the intelligence community fill out they provide their detailed personal information not just\nAbout themselves about other people in their lives on very detailed information very personal information\nOrganization received that document they proceeded to pass it on the numbers with media without taking the steps to protect my Social Security number my medical history any of that [noise]\nWell that was irresponsible no question about it\nSo as far as the information generally do you think it was just in topping by somebody that just didn't know what they were doing or do you think of some kind of a conspiracy\nThere's currently an ongoing investigation and settle I I Can't necessarily comment on that topic\nAll right Sarah and fair enough let's get to a debate\nEurope toner Dave Brat has said when we talk with campaign about these debates he said that you had not officially committed to debates beyond the first one in October fifteenth which is going forward\nShe'd put out a very strongly worded statement blasting day for backing out a saying that they were supposed to be three debates of course the third debate was with me which hasn't been set so that date has not been said even though I've I've asked about a hundred times\nOut from the schedule debates I mean were they scheduled or what\nYeah so you know he's he's talked on your show even about the fact that we've agreed to multiple debates we had identified location we identified a place of our teams had John independent walked through\nWe had a big guns could walk through the location we had told media partners we had the media lined up a local TV station that was going to [noise]\nTo air it everything was set up the only thing we had set out a press release\nUm and that was something that we had been I'm\nPushing for a certainly the host and the media partners have been pushing for ultimately then after\nA couple of weeks and you know John I'm not the one taking the primary lead on this but I think it's about two weeks or so our team the host and the television station trying to get you know trying to get approval on how to put out the the wording on us when you were told that\nHe would no longer\nBe committed to doing that second debate that we had already detailed and that he would in fact or his team would in fact confirm it on a day of the sixteenth of October whether or not we would in fact to move forward with the with the debate scheduled for the twenties fast\nOkay so as far as now the debate on the twenty fifth which is which was the second televised debate is not a done deal even though other team did a walk through they want to wait and see how the debate on the fifteenth as I Know\nI mean I I'm not going to sign\nOn their their reasoning for wanting to wait until the sixteenth it\nIt it seems like a plausible reason but they they did not provide us with a reason why they want to wait until the sixteenth denouncing farm I you know there's been staffing changes on his team that might have been a contributing factor um by it but overall when\nWe set up the parameters of the debate one of the things that was important to art scene that we express dance team was that given\nJust south stretches quite a quite a long distance that it was important to have the ability to have to be\nYou know throughout the district north center of the district middle to district in southern portion of the districts that would be able to attend on end\nAnd that was something that was a priority because now are the first and as of right now the only the data's very northern part of the district which print plane has a pretty significant burden\nOn anyone coming from the southern portion of the district or even in the center of the district\nTo get through the colpepper particularly given the time of the\nDebate what am I don't know the tickets for that one they sold out within less than a minute right on and there's many many individuals to reach out to our campaign saying that they tried to get tickets but were unable to do so\nWell and the my debate which was the third debate\nGotten a date from Dave team\nThe standard of shame I just wanted to mention that said that um they said that they they have they've given me a bunch of day to go back to the date team\nWith and we've not been able to get that done either hopefully we'll get that done in the next week or so okay let's get the judge Kavanaugh you're under John

I think this is for him this this changes the outcome I think it's right\nYeah I Am a chance I and I'm not an expert on West Virginia but it seems meet Joe Manchin whole position that I'm an independent God I'm not beholden to either side and uh I I think it would be hard for him to get reelected there were seemed to me and what what Trump when the state by like fifty points something like that\nAnd I'm not on also not convinced and Susan Collins and going to run again either\nAn ad that that I think it's all I'm not either but she's she's never voted against Supreme Court judge ever you have a group in the state to put a million dollars up to the English he votes against million men\nYeah okay now it's up to a million and a half ago find me but then it looks like a bribe I'm I mean I think at the end of the day without corroboration she's going to be there for ... for which we agree with you not only twenty twenty twenty is she going to run again ... should make that decision the appropriate time [noise]\nI I think I think Tom now that I think she is going to vote yes ah the one that I don't know read on the top Davis is I'm Lisa Murkowski of\nWhat about what about you [noise]\nPretty independent I mean just remember this when she lost that primary to Joe Miller the last Republican primary right she runs in the right in with the name Murkowski now where you get started\nAnd ended up and also as you want to know that last letter but you know the the part about the independents pizzas when guys like mentioned when it's because they claim they're they're real life in terms of looking out for their state right mhm and Murkowski has a big issue with the Kavanaugh opinion about Alaskan natives I think was something\nThat she ... she she she does on on that issue so no it's not clear cut I haven't seen the polling in Alaska or they but they I think if you get ... I think you're going to get flaky booed him out of committee but I think without some crap ration Jeff Jeff is fundamentally\nVery conserved right you got to be a little more reason he's also very independent and I think a very principled guy which is why people making flaky because he doesn't always taken one boxing\nIsn't always predictable but this judgeship you've got to understand for Republicans this unites us this this is a very important building in the court or as it is on the Democrats on the other side of it [noise] wanting somebody else\nCan I ask you a question has ever has a a vice president ... broken a tire on a Supreme Court nomination ... not that I'm aware of yeah I think that would be unprecedented what he\nWas ... and that will kind of a challenge that but it's still counts how do you know that it just hurts the constitution just doesn't advise and consent and there's got to be no have already on the president's than any votes but he's not a member I I can tell you the state of life for\nI never had already lawsuit there's already a lawsuit challenging the whole procedure with other Democrats\nIf he's confirmed that they're going to do and they take over the house or the Senate to move to impeach that would be a disaster two thirds of the Senate good luck [noise] yes I just I'm like I didn't hear you on the ... and\nOf elections have consequences that's when I take away but here's a ... let's get the Republicans have noticed dealing Supreme Court [noise] well I I mean all the foreign policy drop one isn't here's the problem I still can't get over the fact that Trump\nWon two years later you still can't get over ... let me make America Garland well let me let me talk about ... I think might\nBite every indication is a very honorable straightforward would have made a good Supreme Court judge in in the traditional sense with these balance not completely a liberal Democrat property before going to win bench but but met the criteria for it for a judge\nBut what is better not holding a hearing on them are doing what they've done in this case and that brings putting the

putting on a more liberal member just wasn't going to happen\nIn a presidential politics here not a mentor\nWho who knows who knows what the rules are writing about it but if the president is the

once you do it for one year you could do two years you can do it three years I I don't know there aren't any guardrail song is I think it was they moved it from sixty votes fifty votes for everything

Fifteen here's one plus well timber Thirteen or Fifteen minutes and plus twelve and when I was\nI mean here's a here's a has been consistently ahead I mean he's got I'll give you I'll give you that and I think\nBut I think a no vote here changes the dynamic there was a poll earlier before all this controversy or that showed that if you voted against it can also be numbers change on\nThis is a cold I don't I don't dispute the fact that the numbers would change [noise] um but from\nMy perspective I think a cabin on confirmation to is probably the terms of the Democratic enthusiasm plane

and and and I feel like\nYou know people are completely missing the point with all this process crap\nYou know the reason that you just shake and he's tweeting is that the Democrats have the definition or on a book it's our process and none of it is actually on where people are on it and where voters are on on this in the cabinet only has the support of the conservative base\nAnd the
