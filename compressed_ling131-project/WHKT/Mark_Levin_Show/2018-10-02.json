A. saying that you voted and I I I Want you to respond to this that you actually voted in opposition to the VA into military spending when you voted against one of the budget and you've been criticized by that by the spanberger team\nSaying look you're saying you are back in the VA you're backing the military but when push came to shove you voted no on that how do you respond to that congressman\nWell I mean that's just you know simple politics that most people don't follow this stuff details so they could be anyone wants to go look I've always voted for the military\nPlot stop that's all we want to write the Democrats won't do that and in order to get the budget last year we plug up the military and nothing else that's the house budget that I voted for\nAnd at the end of the year in order to get a budget the Democrats insist that that we plus up government spending on the social side by four hundred billion dollars\nThe military plots up was Seventy billion and social side plus up and everything else in the in the mix with four hundred billion dollars the tax cuts also for example where a hundred and fifty billion dollars\nThey're paid for now if you're grown at three and a half or totally paid for and the four hundred billion the Democrats want it and got and that we should not have allowed to happen but just goes onto the kids right in the dark is Twenty one trillion it's a weird trying to preserve a principled with the budget say slap\nPlus extract pointing up the military [noise] certain democratic critique is exactly\nWrong as always right they're trying to say I vote against the military no the whole point is if you keep plus they got the social spending you won't have any money for the military [noise] and so it's very clever trick that's what the Democrats do because they cannot\nTell the truth to power and the you know the spanberger campaign that the curiosity is no one knows what she's running aren't I I seriously don't know what she's running out she came all went on health care\nAnd then she found out the price tag was thirty two trillion\nAnd would double our tax rate and she backed up health care and then you know I I don't know what else I mean she's\nAgainst the tax cut she said they were dangerous and so what is she for an immigration she won't name at upper bound so I guess it open door to seven billion people open borders I Know she's for sanctuary\nI don't get it I I don't I don't know what she's running and so if you ever had to ask her you know what everybody would love to know and she won't even put a full biography and on the on the campaign website it's fairly shocking [noise]\nWell I'll ever on eight thirty AM on Thursday and I will ask her just that also\nUh we're trying to get to the big date worked out the debate that we're sponsoring it between yourself and Abigail I'm Still trying to get that day that I should get that in the next couple of days I'm told by a both of your campaign manager\nDavid I Want to ask you about something you put up the other day you said that and they are in the mail or that is a promoting the spanberger campaign that\nYour kids found something in your mailbox for somebody had written on a on the mail or dating a rod in hell and you turn it over to the authorities and your kids founded it says right in the hell Dave I'm\nWhat it what is turn that over I mean did you actually feel at risk or do you think that's something my comment that\nWell we we don't know if someone puts on your door I think years later it's not a good natured bank right so\nIf you have kids at home and you get some input palm card from it right on your door yes everybody has turned concerns these days or whether it's you know heated political rhetoric guy and and so of course\n... in hell yeah that I wouldn't I wouldn't think that would be a fun thing to find that your door so um it's it's it's not\nI mean look at I don't know why the spanberger campaign people keep doing this kind of stuff just just run your campaign run on the issues you have your debates and one of the parties is going to win I don't know why they're [noise] you don't you don't find this from the other side you don't find this from\nThe ... campaign and I'm just pump pointing to sell it if you're spanberger supporter out there this is not helpful it's not helpful to your candidate it's not helpful to anything it's just it's just horrible ... stopped just one year campaign and you have to be there they are\nThey're they're folks are stripping Dave Brat bumper sign when we're giving big signs out they had people come in steel big science fiction I I'm I signed up to put these up for days they stole sign\nThey take stickers off people's cars I mean they have their science plays illegally all over the place we found this is a law enforcement candidate a and\nShe doesn't follow the law [noise] and so that's a little striking right and so uh we we follow the rules I always tell the the the kids are folks at the door to always be under best behavior always be positive to everybody you know negativity at all\nIn your campaign would go to Abigail's home where she's got children and put Abigail rotten hell I just don't think they would do that and if they did they should get a\nMinus for that because it's not it's not sending the right tone\nAnd that would just tell the spanberger people that are listening to me now\nJust knock it off just run your campaign right I mean there's just not helpful all this stuff is not doing anybody any good whatsoever\nAnd it's really dumb suit you stop it just when you campaign and if you're willing to win and that's dangerous or painful go up right nobody's going to die so just knock it off and run your campaign\nJane thanks for being with us more information go to\n... dot com Dave Brat dot com how's it going to spend ... will be with us Thursday eight thirty am hopefully this week we'll have a date for our debate Dave thanks for being with us John traveling to radio network Denver becoming coming up\nThis is for the seat of retiring Tom Garrick and going up against Leslie Coburn and now we just started and then the germs on November six room and the favorite there hey Denver good to have you on this\nMorning thirty five days in a wake up and then November sex is that what it is\nWhat it is now thirty five days\nIn a way yeah thirty ... thirty six days yet I Believe is Tuesday so I think it's five weeks out [noise]\nWhat is the most surprising thing so far you heard on the campaign trail like some you've heard from a central constituency voters and you said wow that's a shocker\nGosh a shocker for me [laughter] and it's probably something that's a little bit minor comparatively but almost everybody I talked to him about infrastructure so I had one town I I Can't remember payment down there he's but for Victoria [noise]\nAnd I think it was a victorious at one of the city managers [noise] you know come up to Maine and goes in Denver and I said hey what's your biggest issue and [noise] he sort of looked at me and he said sewer lines not replace it was Nineteen oh wait I'm like you gotta be kidding me [laughter]\nIt goes yet good sewer\nLines that break I'm like oh my gosh it's crappy but [laughter] it's it's amazing to me the things that\nPeople are dealing with the trail and and just some of the things you hear really amazing or [noise] you know the one in Vienna county I had one of the mother come up to me and she goes I'm really sick or driving my kid [noise] you know your homework every night where I could get why\nAnd they got real problems and he really get to hear all the real problems on the trail\nBlazers in it is interesting because the district that you would represent is very diverse obviously in for people who say look I don't have why fly where I live a that's a real issue for for people in today's environment that\nReally does it go up when when when you talk about the the urban and suburban districts\nLet's get to the president's women on Canada last night Kennedy came into the president's demand NAFTA which I hate is now dead or I never to be seen again\nAre replaced by us and the U.S Mexico Canada agreement now here's the reality the Canadians dropped every single demand they had before midnight because the president was going forward alone at the press conference on Wednesday\nHe said he was done negotiating with candidate he didn't like their negotiators you didn't like their attitude and he said he told us that he was done with him he was going forward without them\nThen they acquiesced on every demand this is a good thing for the American worker in a good thing for your district tell us why\nWell I mean the first thing in the first thing you see is that they have to limit the TTP right on\nActual dairy exports\nWe're talking about you know the import export of dairy with Canada we can now ship more dairy products into Canada have open that up and for\nThe district I mean that's just amazing [noise] um and I think that's what I've been saying on the trail you heard me John and the farmers weren't screaming they said we believe that there has to be some short term pain for long term game [noise]\nUm they they have supported Trump [noise]\nThey should have at some point it's probably going to be too much to bear but they understood that they in the system for so long and they want free trade they don't want subsidies they want to trade and I think free and fair trade is what we're looking at right now and\nI'm a military guy so I called it at two tier right fear free and fair trade what we I think you're seeing\nThese promises being kept by the by the president [noise]\nBoth at the ... I was at the un all week last week\nAnd a ... one of the key provisions that came out there is that the president is looking for some way to solve the Yemeni crisis I'm\nThere they haven't gotten there but I Know that was that was a big topic along with with Israel and the Palestinians on any on everyone's mind\nBased on your military background how do we solve that because right now a there seems to no end in sight fifty thousand ... are dead and we've also got a humanitarian crisis that could go beyond the pale of anything that we've seen\nChildren are starving there and we're backing the salaries\nOh man that you know it's pretty interesting John it's a great question because I don't even know right now there is an answer\nIn our military intelligence circles about how to extract the Iranians um from what they're doing in their support the who to use and I think that's been a big deal for us as it\nNow Iran or the number one number one [noise] perfect state sponsored terrorism and I think that what they're trying to do that they're trying to use terrorism it's like a hedge demonic exercise\nTo do all these awful things I just think if it was me going in there I Would try to find out that we could be more surgical and removing the Iranian influence based on intelligence gathering and based on special operations that would be the first thing I Would see is there any kind of alternative or course of action\nWhere we can concentrate just on removing Iranian influence um arms money and the things that they do and I think that would be the first steps that I Would take also I think when you saw General Mattis go downrange but I think it really comes down to mission planning also in process we have to improve our mission planning processes are the Saudis do\nOr they have to improve their mission planning process for like a process does save lives\nWe have to have some kind of legal structure there well we're not doing something or not supporting something that's sort of ad hoc when it comes to targeting so it'll be the first two things that I Would do is how do we certainly remove Iranian influence in the second thing is how do we improve the mission planning process\nSo that we were just collateral damage while we're trying to remove that cancer\nDenver I've got to go to a quick word from worst monsoon stay with us so when they ask you about what you or I

Louisiana\nAbsolutely blasting the Senate yesterday calling it a a grotesque a sideshow I'm a grotesque charades you can find that\nKennedy really unloading on the Senate colleagues yesterday was kind of a fun clip of even find that\nWe'd appreciate it anyway during an interview with NBC your favorite network of all time because uh you know NBC right fake news wires liberal left wing whole bit lied about the Trump team I Will never forget NBC for what they did to the Trump campaign in Virginia\nAnd which was just fake news ally and they did it for one reason to disappear and our troops in Virginia and it's really sick anyway it is what it is\nSo this one Julie sweating seemed to walk back and offer conflicting accounts of some of the accusations she and her attorney Michael Abernathy watched against stretch cabin up on the NBC's Kate Snow\nNoted that the network it not been able to verify weddings claim some of which differ from her written statement here's a little snippet here no sense what we want to do here is way out all that she said about her story are reporting we want to be transparent\nBecause these are very serious allegations of course they could get sued for a billion dollars that's why they did this\nKavanaugh has called Julie sweating story nonsense going to force the president said they questioned her credibility and NBC News for the record is not been able to independently verify her claim [noise] these are things that you told us on camera\nThat different from a written statement last week we've been trying independently to reach out to anyone who remembers attorney party\nFound anyone who remembers that she's also unclear about when she first decided to come forward [noise]\n\nSo here's what snow ask Julie sweat\nLive TV [noise] you know what\nAsk everyone is wondering\nOf those people was Brett Kavanaugh\nHere sweating censor I cannot specifically say that he was one of the ones who assaulted me [noise]\nThis is a way that I cannot specifically saying he was one of the ones who assaulted me [noise]\nSweating basically says she doesn't know if Kavanaugh spite punch at parties like she earlier claims are statement so she doesn't know if he was there she doesn't know if it was him she doesn't know if he's like the punch she doesn't even though he was in the same\nState [noise] but it must be him because he didn't [noise] it's just it's just unbelievable I mean it's like we we\nIt it's through Broadway\nSister a Broadway circus play\nI mean every day this gets more and more bizarre\nAnd Kennedy's right it's totally grotesque [noise]\nWhat is going on here [noise]\nHow does this man is just getting it's getting tarnished [noise] crazy [noise]\nI mean she has no information [noise] hey that that was that was a good part it gets worse [noise]\nThe interviewer snow from NBC went out to say a\nExcuse me was sweating there are some differences between your one statement ah\nOf efforts by Kevin ... and mark judge despite punches parties in our interview she said\nShe saw them near the punch but did not specifically say she saw either man spike at\n\nThis is unbelievable [noise] this is like saying hey bank was robbed and you live in the neighborhood therefore you robbed the bank\nSpike was punched I never saw the spike it but they\nWere they were wandering around [noise] uh it was a party [noise]\nSweating says well I certainly given red tops the quite a few girls during that time frame and there was great punch those parties I Would not take one of those classes from mark having\nA Brett Kavanaugh excuse me I saw him in and\nAround the punch containers are knew what he did but I saw by them yet or maybe he was serving ... because he was a gentleman I mean when you've got to be kidding me this is the evidence they have tea served punch [noise]\nI mean it is unbelievable [noise]\nSweating and claiming their statements you'd see Kevin on others waiting in line to participate in a gang rape\nBut she she she says she came to this conclusion because it high side it was in hindsight it was too coincidental\nStanding in line outside of rooms sweating like not lines but how long before the doors and I didn't understand what it could be snow\nAnd you describe British Kevin ... and his friend mark judge standing by the door yes with other boys [noise] so you're suggesting that in hindsight threatening yes you think he was involved\nI Would say yes I did see um but it was too coincidental okay so they were\nA party they serve punch and they stood around I mean this is really unbelievable [noise]\nThis is unbelievable that we're even talking about this [noise]\n\nThat she goes out to say well I'm quite a shy person [noise]\nAnd quite a private person and it wouldn't be here today except for about six weeks ago I happen to learn about\nBrett Kavanaugh becoming one of the people who were short list or to go to the Supreme Court [noise] so snow says this is in July

dead and the other two have not responded [noise]\nKnow weighted by saying this morning sweating provided for names of strategy says what's the parties with him one of them just not really call a Julie sweating it doesn't know who she is another is deceased the other two we haven't heard back from that the evidence\nIf you don't think this is a circus cloud showing like Senator Kennedy said it's grotesque what they're doing it is to man with no evidence that you're living under a rock you're on the John ... radio network ...\nYour calls when I get back eight eight eight for you know five six or six stay with us live Washington DC\nBut tonight NBC News has not been able to independently corroborate sweating explains and when we asked to have an oddity for any witnesses who could backup

News just reached out to the other two and it's not her back to Brett Kavanaugh's be interviewed by the FBI\nI think so I think it's fine if they do I tell you what I happen to know some of the United

they train them\nHas a lot to train them they've uh they've given them arms\nSurreptitiously through ... and um I think they want to keep that conflict going in Iran has said repeatedly that they think Israel is an illegitimate state so they believe it has no right to any territory anywhere so uh so long as they repeat that position you're ... you're not going to get anywhere\nWhere with Edward uranium here to John triggers radio networks he's alive and Cairo, Egypt he's our\nCorrespondent for the John triggers radio network in the middle east is also with the voice of America and he's a CBS News correspondent for very long time covering a Middle Eastern affairs [noise] so let me ask you this and we're Hamas\nWhy would the Hamas not being favor of some sort of a two state solution to give the Palestinian people their own nation why would they be opposition to that what's the alternative just perpetual war\nUm I think many a radical\nMilitant Islam is uh the the Hamas people or the Muslim Brotherhood and they ultimately believe that they're going to a bank push Israel anyway um but what they're aiming for right now is to have their own little independent conclave enclave in Gaza\n'em and they are are they were going to sign a deal with Israel for a long term truce agreement which I think suits Israel because they don't really wanna see Israel doesn't really apparently wanted to see a two state solution\nAnyway so they wouldn't be happy to see guys that guy's a stand and West Bank is than to end up have those two sides not reconcile a but God's job the ... people found that to Egypt was pushing them to come to some sort of an agreement with a with a president a bath\nAnd then they just stuck their foot down and that sort of squashed the long term truce deal with Israel so I think they're willing to have a long term truce deal with Israel but just not to have a um a two state solution\n[noise] so it sounds like what you're saying is that the president's grand plan here to bring jeeze\nThose two states they link that what you're saying is that uh in your estimation urinalysis the Geron cushion your plan is going nowhere whatever that might be\nI don't want to be that pessimistic I mean it looks that way but I mean you know the middle east are very unpredictable or anything could change in a matter of moments I I think what we've seen over the years is\nThe change on the ground is mostly been the result of complex and I shudder to think that that's going to happen again but it could very well because the\nMiddle East tender box in the garden any minute in any particular place the Hamas people keep organizing their their protest on friday and they keep playing the Arab News stations that there are people are getting killed after they marched them into the into harm's way um\nAnd the Israelis are not budging inch on a two state solution so I don't think either side is willing to make the necessary um moves towards a peace deal and die as I said once again we could see a conflict that would set the whole place up here I Am a conflict that could ultimately have results on the ground\nWell the only hope here is that I think what the president has done in moving the embassy to Jerusalem the U.S embassy is he gangs Israel the biggest shift they wanted right at the outset and it got that done and of course President Abbas was saying at the un in his speech that based on that\nHe doesn't want the U.S involved you can't trust them he doesn't have their best interest he said or one hundred percent aligned with Israel so why would I Do share with them\nBut the other side of this coin is that the president now a is a in a position where he can ask\nThe Israeli government for a number of concessions because he's already given that the ... the one big thing they want it right so that I think that's what the strategy is now whether or not Edward that's got to play out I have no idea but\nIt's look it's a plant right I mean at least it's a plan and we'll we'll see what happens but I think your analysis is spot on President Abbas\nIs um he's really in a lose lose situation because\nHamas is not going to sign off on anything you know so then the other question becomes in are you better off getting a facilitator and they're just um just the ghost shades Bing West Hamas are you better off of\n\nI think that they they are\nA lot closer to an agreement with Hamas than they are with a bath [noise] um and a bath isn't a bad position a internally with respect to his own party and if he made concessions with his own party could could toppled him he's an old man and I think he's eighty three now\nReady for getting close to eighty four\nThe pressure the Egyptians are put on him I think he would have come up with a deal that he could have a so I think logistically a with respect to his own party he's not able to come up with a deal never mind with Hamas um so you've got a lot of players here that are unstable\nUm I don't want to analyze the Israeli situation because Everytime you you you turn a there are there\nPeople who are trying to pull down prime minister Netanyahu is well um and you remember of course a prime minister Rabin who was shot 'em so ultimately or if he were to making a deal make a deal and they work to agree on it to God God only knows if there would be someone out there to shoot him as well so um [noise] there's so many\nSo many factors in this kind of a a situation that it's difficult to see how you could move it forward but President Trump to the merits of trying new things every time you look at him so I mean I I give him credit for that and who knows you might think of a new a new plan [noise]\nWell look at least she's trying we're trying to do something [noise] um so I I\nI really do though like the fact that the president leads that he was he was a he was going towards a two state solution because many of us that really want to see the solved that don't have\nUm some of the viruses that go with either side you really can't see this ever getting solved without without each country having their own state I mean you just can't see it and I thought the president was spot on\nWhen he says the Palestinian people have a right to be self self rule they certainly shouldn't be\nYou know what it's all over the Israelis and I think that makes I think that makes a lot of sense and we're only got a couple more minutes I Want to get very quickly to um the Turkish situation\nWhere you're the Turks playing now in in this whole thing like in ... I've only got two minutes but to find\nTurkish foreign policy right now as it relates to the Gulf and Syria and then left where where where where are the\nTurkey is divided because they were trading main trading partners are\nIran and Iran is in trouble so they need to you know they need to find new\nOutlets the countries that are there other main ally ...\nA president or the one he's a Muslim is he's a Muslim Brotherhood guy and he's in a corner in a bind because he he's he needs to come to an agreement with the Russians I despite the fact\nThat they're opposed to his positions in Syria and with respect to it'd be a sonic world in general\nUm he had to walk the line and a cut cut deals with a president who did and that's what they sort of dining in not in Lebanon north of Syria a so he's struggling aligned with everybody\nSo I think are under the surface he's trying to come to terms with both the U.S\nBecause they keep saying that they're going to be a you know patrolling the north of Syria together it hasn't happened um I suspect it may not happen but I think they're trying to repair those bridges they tried to repair bridges with Israel despite the fact that there are bad terms about been\nOpposed to each other on a lot of different issues um so I think he's in Kabul economically with his current trouble ah with its trade with a with Iran and a lot of people want to putting gas and oil pipelines and so he's sort of trying to cut deals here and there are the ship afloat\n[noise] All right we'll see what plays out in the Arabian live from Cairo\nR.

meantime deep Dave Brat campaign [noise] under some fire yesterday because they had announced that there were three debates one debate in coal pepper on C SPAN one debate was supposed to be in\nRichmond with the CBS\nTV affiliate though that was supposed to be televised so that was October twenty fifth and then the third debate which was the radio the bank which was hosted by myself\nAnd NPR's Kathy Lohr [noise] ah we don't have a date for are the other two actually had that [noise] so the spanberger campaign as you know Abigail Spanberger who'll be with us on Thursday Abigail Spanberger by the way uh with us on Thursday an Abigail\nOr she her staff put out a statement saying\nThat the bride campaign had cancelled all the debates and they weren't having any including by the ... campaign that responded to that and let me read their statement [noise]\nThis is from the Dave ... for Congress reelection campaign [noise] uh they said this is nothing more than the spanberger campaign\nTrying to distract from the real story that span burgers own volunteers were caught harassing Dave Brat and his family\nIt was our campaigns unjust\nTo debate with the spanberger campaign\nWe simply want on his terms with both candidates having equal opportunity to present their arguments in a fair for them so here's what happened and I got out to them was spared burger champ paint told me\nThe ... camp [noise] agreed to the first debate on October Fifteen which will be covered by CSPAN and colpepper [noise] they said the second to bait which was October twenty steps in Richmond by CBS or that\nThey had not they had backed out of that commitment and\nI was pushing for a date for my debate and the spanberger campaign was saying we can't get a date from day [noise] so I called the ... campaign and here's what they said\nThey said the fifteenth there's good we never agree to the twenty fifth\nAnd we've never agree to a date for her Frederick says radio debate that's what they told me they agreed to have it\nBut they didn't agree to date that's true [noise] and what the ... campaign told me is they were going to do the first debate of the Fifteen [noise] and see how it goes\nAnd they were also criticized the spanberger campaign they said they were negotiating in bad faith [noise] and that they want it to dictate the terms [noise]\nSo\nUh that's where we stand right now so both camps claiming blaming the other um [noise] but the ... campaign absolutely denying that the TV debate on the fifteenth has been cancelled they said that is still on and that they wanted to go forward\nAnd see how that debate goes on what they were concerned about is\nFree than the spanberger people stacking\nAudience with anti brat\nActivists [noise] I'm liberal moderators not giving each candidate a fair opportunity\nTo engage in express their views [noise] and uh basically biased format that turns into a sideshow [noise] so that's what they the ... campaign said they were concerned about\nThe spanberger people basically started that's just not true we don't want to dictate anything\nI can only talk from my experience in negotiating the format of my debate I submitted it today they said fine I submitted the spanberger and they had a number of changes they want it [noise] so\nI can only go from my experience I don't know what happened with these other the other debates but I have a format that's proven successful on the radio or\nShe had she said five signed off on it [noise] then center to spanberger I'm Justin ... communications director and they have certain revisions but the rivers were not a big deal I mean the only thing\nThat I'm not agreeing to but that doesn't work on the radio is questions from the audience I that that just that that works on TV like I've been through a hundred days that simply does not work in a radio format so we're not doing that now they you know we'll have something where the audience can submit questions but\nYou know giving people microphones extent standing up you can't follow it on the radio so we're not doing that so I reached are rejected that other than\nI think that had a few minor changes I mean they were cosmetic a time and things of that nature and it was like an hour and Fifteen minutes anyway\nMy a debate or both camps signed off on it with minor revisions and that was that so I don't I don't know what went on with the Richmond debate with CBS I have no idea although I did try to get CBS engage with me and they turned it\nDown and so they had this whole big set of a debate rules so I'm not sure how that how that wet but um [noise] here's my general position on this right this is a very competitive race\nUpset by the way it's been dumbed down from\nPeople writing go where the hell on cars and putting it that David George to forty a request to substitute teaching to town hall meeting the whole thing is ridiculous I mean these are very intelligent candidates with a lot to say and we should be debating the issues", "show_name": "Mark Levin Show", "year": "2018", "city": "Portsmouth", "day": "02"}
