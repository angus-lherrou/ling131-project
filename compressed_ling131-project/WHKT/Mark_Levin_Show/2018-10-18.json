R. V. A. W. N. I. S. or whatever my other competitors are or you can be with me and you can get this kind of analysis this\nIs why this is not going away let me just tell you watch the understand because they got a lot of text about you know somebody just taking the den if he was a plumber it wouldn't have mattered here's why it's not going away when you have an alliance a policy of this magnitude\nBetween Senator Rand Paul who like me is a non interventionist and wants to get us out of all these foreign entanglements suspect in the military industrial complex wants to get out of Afghanistan\nOut of Yemen out of all these wars and he is aligning himself on this issue with\nSenator Lindsey Graham from South Carolina who is a new Khan who is a military industrial complex supporter who is in favor of a muscular foreign policy around the globe\nAs you know and you can get those two\nIn the Republican caucus as senators to agree on an issue of this magnet\nJust Rand Paul and Walter Jones right that will be one thing if you had\nLindsey Graham on the other side that will be one thing but when you have two people that\nAs far as foreign muscular foreign policy Neal conservatism entanglements hole and Graham come into alignment on an issue or like this both coming at it from very different angles\nIt's a very powerful\nCoalition in the Republican caucus of us that and grab that messing around Rand Paul's not messing around and so you just heard what Mike Pence said\nHe's not messing around I'm telling you doesn't matter it was a journalist or a plumber a day of reckoning is going to\nThen uh when she when I'm going to laugh my town\nI'm going to be laughing for five hours just just just like it didn't do thousands sixteen at a Trump Tower at the Hilton when he wants to be fun so I'm really looking forward to it and ah anyway joining us now Barbara Comstock hey Barbara great to have you with us\nAnd learning that you think about you\n[noise] okay so let me ask you this um for the Democrats are saying that you voted for President Trump Ninety eight percent of the time and they're trying to tie you with that I Wish I could get a good thing I voted for him a hundred percent of the time he voted for Ninety eight I think that's pretty\nGood but uh the majority of those votes were not partisan votes right so explain that\nWell you know the proud and thank you for asking that funny every time we talked with the parents about this we said how can you look at the boats regardless of how you feel about the president or not but you could really do is look at what a good policy for the American people and certainly for my constituents eighty two percent I didn't tell their\nParty for your listeners haven't heard that now that they're there for the first time it gets attractive and covering\nOn and so one thing that matters but first there are six to cut your taxes don't you think\nAbout it on my part of that because we know Democrats trying to raise your taxes not cut down so will make that departure that I Am going to cut your tax at my opponent has already prompted to raise that take that child tax credit of two thousand dollar raise rates out and everybody you know it'd be devastating to our great economy\nThat you know going so well right now but the other girls on that score card him credit for up there on the opioid crisis that I Would just working out last night with our local sheriff and girls or the ...\nBusiness red tape or not there's a lot that that was your car to the bail I can keep the government\nPrices is tiny medical research at at my age you know what we're doing all that great amount of funding cut all the time he has certainly search diet but they are all great investments that rather than the Republican Party or the president or getting credit for and that results that we've gotten on a bipartisan basis\nYou know it also has things like my stocks I got the criminal aliens gang members out of the country hospitals stop school by like you know the people want something done\nScaling record violent my opponent has failed on every bill she put forward on that issue when you've had three girls but the president of the time this year that\nOur topic called by like you know I Hope they get the background check system updated and then my project safe neighborhoods fell on there are things that my opponent oppose it gets to a party\nAnd the press doesn't want to record\nThey throw out that number and they just want to read that and they kept saying no to everything but these are good holiday is making our country stronger economically their national security and play some read things that policy is close to the great thing not resent thanks\nSo what let's make the comparison congresswoman the Jennifer ... who was one of the most liberal state senators are in the comic\nRated number one this year liberal and they're raising their taxes than burger Jennifer Wexton is supporting it caused a doll that and I asked her\nWell look at the end of the day they're all supporting him because like I Would yell spanberger has taken six hundred thousand dollars over money you're not going to take a half million dollars over that and then say oh I'm going to vote for somebody else and by the way there is nobody else to\nTalk about the whole thing is a ruse if the Democrats snake over and pillows you said this over and over and over the takeover by one vote she has the votes in the book to be speaker and the whole thing about not going for her if you're a Democrat is a complete ruse so let's get to\nLet's get your record which is really what are the ... campaign is challenging now are saying look I'm Barbara Comstock runs around\nSaying she votes independently she votes in favor of the district a but look we look at the record she's voted Ninety seven point seven this at the times for Trump but let's give\nA couple of examples where you went the other way let's start with salary increases for federal workers explain that\nHey ready to get federal employees there was talk of the Trade Center and I tell you that you know in our budget for federal employees which I\nHappen to think it's a great thing and I bought for ... and I've been a leader you know my father\nAnd then she went about trying to put her on twenty dollars either it's gotten a hundred and fifty million dollars for every year that are pressing for reform my opponent\nAnd the Washington area for the first time in decades and if I'm not there to fight for our region and this is going to be a Republican straight and I think it's going to be any how majority also where we certainly know is going to be the kind of maturity so if you don't have\nAt least one Republican in there fighting for the region are you jealous airport as I got to make sure\nThe airport was protected by her money things with our federal employees but also our whole just I couldn't just trade my opponent has not had relationships with our parents um businesses and this is such an important part of our economy but also are\nOn national security and the one national security debate the primary\n... Democrats town she said well yeah I really don't know about any of that [laughter]\nAnd so that's certainly true but this is a vital part of our local economy and I have that kind of experience there but I think for the rich and we need to be able to have\nSomebody who had a relationship with any traction as well as relationships with are very diverse economy and including are just kind of technology in our\nAgriculture which you see the door in the western part of the district which has a large agriculture sector also\nWith Barbara Comstock congresswoman construct she represents tend to district of Virginia that's the northern sphere going from a Westerner Fairfax Winchester she's running for third term her democratic opponent Jennifer Wexton or the most liberal say the most liberal state senator or in the commonwealth they will not come\nOn a show ... afraid to answer a legitimate question I suppose I don't ... I don't really have any idea but you can't find her anyway or Barbara let me let\nMe tell you she said you know in Westchester they major political event you know for decades um it's so hot in the valley which the chamber skipped dot about and this was something that you know Democrats and Republicans alike all gone to their local\nDemocrats city council people when they were very frustrated that they didn't turn out put that\nSort of ... percent means that even Democrats\nTook notice you know she didn't show up at any of the county fairs where you really ... with a chocolate our agricultural community and there you have to understand the entire district not just on her part\nOf the things that she had spent time with the resistance crowded but you know there was a death threat the rain threats important in college you know it's got to raise taxes\nAnd you know we have people who are getting signed down in their front yard where people trench their yard and drive over its time and [noise] you know they're afraid to put up\nA sign your neighbor well yeah let them the resistance crowd I don't think God I have some ability here regardless of what Hillary Clinton by the way I Want to Clinton\nInstead of having a subject like people like that I mean this is the hardest thing crowd and we need to have some bipartisan leadership here in our region\n[noise] well congresswoman there's no question of the angry mob mentality that's going around the country right now which is very concerning to a lot of people that do not Collins from Maine getting death threats rape threats are now we find out that\nAh somebody allegedly sense I'm a poison power to her home in Maine where family lives I mean all this stuff is just beyond the pale it it's it's it's it's beyond the male and that isn't going to stop\nBecause there's you know until until the until the Democrats are condemn this that and Bernie Sanders kind of like halfway said well it's not a good idea\nBut you know you got to Hillary Clinton coming out saying look we're fighting for the Republican so we we got to get rid of all these Republicans and so\nYou can be on the whole I mean as long as they can do and it it's going to keep happening until they stop I mean it's a it's it's I Know you're a student history it reminds me of the sixty eight campaign Humphrey Nixon and walls and ah you

to overturn the decision and have space and you're not going to get them get them out this is why the economy\nAnd the force going to turn it to seven or eight\nAnd once eighty percent of those get in successfully the next wave will be twenty five thousand\nMeantime there's no war\nAnd nobody nobody really wants to talk about this\n\nAnd are short sex then it says the ... the caravan this company for the future I mean you would think you would think that if this caravan of invading illegal aliens and that's what this says this is an invasion\n\nThis is an invasion coming to the United states\n\nI don't I'm not going to call it anything but what it is an invasion you would think that that would motivate people to get out and and vote for Republican so that you have some kind of a security on the border of what other people think it's actually going to hurt the Republicans\nOf moms were babies that that you you can't script is out mom's with\nBabies and they're going to call them economic refugees seeking asylum asylum means you're a political prisoner or you were at risk in your country of some sort of a\nPolitical situation that will ... when you are in a bad place\nThere's no such thing as an economic reputation because there's ... billion of them\nWhat what are they all just kind of combination for asylum because they can't get a job in their ... corrupt country\n\nThat we give billions of dollars to these people and it's the corruptions beyond the pale\n\nYou would think that this would motivate Republicans and independents that come out and say look this isn't right and I send my child to third grade\nThere's twenty five kids in the class Nineteen them don't speak English with the help kind of an education is my child going to get my public school which are paying for\nThey're not paying anything well you know you're a racist\nWhy because I Want my son or daughter and the third grade to be taught in English with other people that speak English so we can have some kind of a a learning environment yet you're you're a racist\n\nI had a peanut butter sandwich for breakfast like what marmalade on at the heritage\nRacist only white people eat ...\nI mean it is this thing is going to go on and on and\nAnd so it's all these mobs and what is going on is intimidating regular people from just looking at something reasonable\n\nTo be called a racist because you don't want your country invaded by four thousand illegal immigrants on the southern border\nNow it's just like you want to obey the law\nI guess we have two sets a lost cause for people that the Democrats won in and that was very body of I don't really understand it\nThis is a real issue\nAnd there's no answer to this and we're really you would think that our ally Mexico wouldn't let them come into Mexico\n\nI mean think about think about think about what what would happen in the U.S if these five thousand a caravan of invaders said well we really want to go to Canada soon as we can\nYou let us in the United states and give us just a a a sixty they are status here so that we can go up the highway and uh get to Canada and we can invade them\nI mean what what what would they Canadians said well sure you know I understand I understand it's our problem no they'd be like well why are you doing this\nAnd this is just a logic\n\nAnd open borders crowd\nYou would think that this would be the major issue of the day and because of Goldman Sachs has salivating and looking of their chops at the prospect of more cheap labor nothing is going to be done at the end of the day they're all going to stay because the Republicans hands are tied\nJudges will overturn whatever their what whatever ... Jeff Sessions decides to do judges will overturn it\nAnd you can't separate anybody now from their children especially before the midterms as the disaster\nEven though if somebody today in the Bronx or in horror fuck or Richmond\nOr Lynchburg or anywhere in America\n\nShoplifting ... a seven eleven on camera and his apprehended by the police and they have a child in the back seat of the car they will get separated from the child the child doesn't go to jail with them that's the laws that we have in America you want to change it I guess change it but that's the current law but laws don't matter now\n\nI mean if you ever had more evidence why there shouldn't be a wall this has it\n\nSo the Republicans are attempting to make this a\n\nA election issue where they're putting a built together for thirty two billion dollars to fund the wall but they're not getting their message out as far as I'm concerned\n\nI mean you you really think about you what do you think about how any other country would handle and organized caravan of illegal immigrants coming into your country and expecting a fully expecting that they will be allowed in and taking care of\n\nIts crazy and uh\nYou would think that this one issue alone would sink the Democrats\nIn the election but many people think it's going to have the opposite effect so you know you just start scratching your head\n\nI mean I think the debate over this issue in this country should be whether or not you want to border or you don't\nAnd you know there is an argument for not having one and the argument is cheap labor and we have a big heart and we'll take care of anybody that comes in and eventually when the country collapses then it is what it is\nI mean that's one argument you in the meantime the elites will continue to profit off of it and then obscene fashion\nAnd the gangster benches and make more money and Wall Street executives will get more wealthy than they are and if you work at Goldman Sachs you'll be able to buy an island\nI mean I guess that's the plan and you'll continue to fund the Democrats who will then have on unlimited power in perpetuity and remember it was President Obama who said er my goal was to transform it ...\nMitt by changing its make up its demographic makeup you change it by allowing 'em unfettered illegals to come in and\nChange the culture whatever the\nAmerican culture is those who want to change it wanted to be something else I'm really don't know what they want it to be or what you think but that's the objective of this whole thing unholy\nAlliance of Democrats that won cheap votes Wall Street Republicans at one cheap labor and the third\nIn the open a open borders one world government there's that want to change and wipe\nOut cultures they want to wipe them out so they don't exist they just want a land\nMass and the free\nMovement of people and goods between land masses that's it John Frederick radio network in your heart you know I'm right there's no argument to oppose what I'm saying but if it doesn't matter the Republicans are ineffective and articulate idiots anyway\nAdvisers in order to discredit them this this is scaring and this is your deep state right here a senior official working for the treasury department's financial crimes enforcement operation network\nFind sad I got a lot of acronyms here so hang with me has been ... this is a senior official has been charged with leaking confidential\nFinancial reports on former Trump campaign advisers Paul Manafort Richard Gates and others to the media\nNow\nProsecutors say that Natalie Mayflower sours Edwards that's a lot of names there her name is Natalie Mayflower sours Edwards a senior advisor to find Sen\n\nPhotographed work called suspicious activity reports or SARS and other sensitive government files and sent them to an unnamed reporter in violation of US law thanks\nFile SARS which is basically if you're a changing money around\nAnd agreements have over ten thousand dollars thanks file SARS confidentially in order to tip off law enforcement to potential illegal financial transactions the on authorized document disclosures which began last October\nSaid to have provided the basis for twelve news articles published by an unnamed news or\nNatalie Mayflower sours Edwards the lady with three name\nFor names here let's just go to Natalie Edwards Edwards is being charged in the southern district of New York with one count\nOf unauthorized disclosures of suspicious activity reports in one count of conspiracy to make unauthorized disclosures of suspicious activity reports both of which carry a maximum of five years in prison\n\nI mean if this person does not go to jail and prison I don't know what the deal is here because I don't care what you think if anybody's activity you cannot have people in the department of treasury that\nCherry pick information on political people they don't like and send them to reporters I mean that that that could happen to your tax return\nI mean you think about this you think it but you could be a Trump supporter and somebody in the IRS could be copying your tax returns on a on a photo put them on a thumb drive and send them to the New York times\n\nBecause you're a Trump supporter I mean and it's an amazing thing this is never done the liberals like this was never down to Obama's supporters or Clinton supporters if only done to Trump supporters\nOr anybody affiliated with ah the president or likes him or whatever whatever they think maybe\nThis ... this is incredible\nI mean there's ... there's there's one thing to have a deep state here's another thing to have this level of corruption and they they worried oh John\nEight eight eight for a though five six four six eight eight eight for a though five six for sex\n\nEdwards is a is is is being charged here we'll see what happens the charges or the latest indication of the Trump administration's effort to root out alleged leakers within the government something that prosecutors emphasized in announcing the charges on Wednesday\n\nAs it is an incredible according to the criminal complaint agents in the treasury inspector general's office detected and\nPatterns get that a pattern\nOf on authorized the media disclosures\nOf the center the financial files beginning in October two thousand Seventeen and continuing for a year the disclosures were related to matters being investigated either by Mahler or by the U.S attorney's office we're the southern district of New York or the Justice Department\n\nThey included leaks about suspicious transactions\n\nAh they included ... leaks about different things that were on authorized that are illegal to leak\n\nAnd ... related to the case of Maria Butina the Russian Women charged with acting illegally as an unregistered agent or the Russian government\nWe're not really covered it that much but um I mean it's really unbelievable\nThe alleged leak announced Wednesday would be the second major suspected breach of fights that reported this year after a federal law enforcement official told the New Yorker in may that he leaked SARS on his show companies set up by Michael Cohen Trump's\nFormer attorney after two similar bank records appear to be missing from the fights that database\n\nEdwards is also accused of sending the ... Puerto internal emails from the Treasury Department investigative memos and intelligence assessments Edwards allegedly used an encrypted application to send files that contained or described the financial reports prosecutors\nAlso say Edward save the documents on a flash drive that they believe she has in her possession or had in her position at the time of arrest on Tuesday I mean this is unbelievable and ladies and gentlemen\nThis is the tip of the iceberg I mean this is this is beyond the deep state this is the dirt deep corrupt state\nIn the political should I mean you go back to the IRS with though Lois Lerner what they did there and you've got an entire federal beer per bureaucracy\nLinking things in order to hurt anybody associated with Trump or his agenda in order to harm that\nI mean why would anybody go get a job with a government now in the White House why would you do that\n\nSo that you're you know information can get leaked\nOr anything negative on you that the government has in their background check that's going to get leaked now\nIt's just beyond the deep state this is like an internal coup against the president I tell you the stakes here are so high the stakes are so high if\nThe Democrats win and they get ... ward it for this kind of behavior\nI don't know where we're going as a country I really don't I mean if there's any independent out there or any moderate I mean do do you really think this is the right thing to do for your country regardless of whether you like Trump's tweets are not do you really think this is the right thing to do\nWhere we have embedded bureaucrats harming us citizens simply because of their political affiliation is that where we're headed and we have angry mobs running around chasing people out of elevator spitting on them\n\nThreatening them sending a allegedly poisonous substance to Susan Collins home\nThey don't like how she voted on a particular issue\nEditor I mean is that the America that you want your children living in because that's what's gonna happen with this basically ruled out by angry mob deep staters leakers and corrupt\nBureaucrats that have a political agenda\nHow many Edwards do you think are out there you think it's just an isolated incident or do you think there's thousands of thousands or getting exposed you can't but it's too many\nAre going to go to ... our sponsors I'll be

lot of allegations from the Turks saying that he was murdered chopped up some even saying that he was just chopped up and put into a bags while still alive just a a a horrific situation and\nA

wants to link to all the facts come out\nShare with us your perspective on this as it is now\nWell John yet you're like really troubling I'm a member\nOf the Senate Foreign Relations Committee I Am the lead Democrat on the kids on subcommittee that oversees the U.S Saudi relationship and this this has the potential to dramatically change the relationship between our countries um you're right that I'm a mother of a journalist\nHas to be taken seriously this is a journalist who was living in northern\nVirginia right near Tyson's corner in Fairfax writing for the Washington Post and be murder of anybody\nConsulate which should be a safe haven but that wouldn't take place a is shocking I'm so there's a couple of things that were there weren't any Congress first on Foreign Relations committee we sent a letter to the president would trigger\nThe Mac it's yeah I think you know the Magnitsky Act was named after a Russian dissident who was murdered by the Russians while for his political activity how Congress sent a letter to the president that gives the president twenty days to make that ruling about whether\nThe murderers of human rights violation and if so what sanctions would be imposed we sent that letter about two weeks ago the other two issues that are currently under consideration I'm her somewhat related or whether the United states should stop\nOr put a moratorium on sales to the Saudis we have significant arms sales to them and they have for years um and ... and this\nIs one that I'm very focused on because it was a significant\nPassion of your market share user's whether the United states should stop supporting any Saudi efforts are in the war in Yemen the civil war in Yemen that's going on between Lucy minority in the Yemeni government and Saudi Arabia is very very involved out in favor of the government against the\nWho sees it that the United states is providing a support for the Saudis in that position refueling aircraft and others and um we had some\nVotes to try to stop us but just the patient and that yeah we had recently uncle got up to forty\nSeven votes in the Senate not fifty not sick it got crazy Africa goats um and I am insanely up the opinion that the war is a humanitarian disaster in the United states should not be the Saudis and the prosecution or that we're\nWe're going to get more facts but partly I think the burden is on this\n... or out of this journalist enough facts are out there enough information and collaboration is out there it's a burden on their shoulders they're going to have to prove that they weren't involved in any harm and if they don't I think it's going to fundamentally change the relationship is that countries Saudi Arabia\nCenter king is this now the day of reckoning for the U.S relations with the Saudis\nI Believe it is you know you're on the way you asked that question I I think I Know what you're thinking there at the very very significant challenges in a relationship in recent years worth the overwhelming majority of the nine eleven attackers were Saudis yes um and then you is\nForward to a whole series of other instances Yemen um those are Saudi behavior in recent years um especially since the ascension of the crown prince NPs to his position\nAs you know when in within the last year the Saudis were involved in a bizarre kind of air kidnapping up to the Lebanese\nPrime minister prime minister Hariri right up where they sort of as he was visiting Saudi Arabia he gave sort of a\nForce televised interview announcing his resignation from the position of Lebanon and that was widely viewed as a Saturday pilot light and I'll tell you when I go to the region um what I hear I hear a lot when I hear it in Iraq I here at talk Syrians in the region is that if every other problem in the region are solved\nAs this terror van gets through Mexico and guess at the southern border of the United states senator Kaine what should authorities do what should we do\nWell well first I mean let's let's not wait I'm getting to that seat watchers or not to the wider mowing Mexican border yet so we need to work with a government some Guatemala and Mexico\nI'm On yes and you know I Hope that the president's especially you know often tough talk about Mexico et cetera it's not hurt our ability to reach in accord with Max Baucus I think one of the issue that's important is you gotta have allies in the world and\nIn when you have allies you can work together on joint solutions got famous for like Caribbean people ate and Honduras or or not even get to the border with United States but that would\nInvolve the U.S having a cooperative relationship with Mexico for example and not spending time trashing Mexico which the President Abbas does so\nI Know that a U.S military and north command which basically is everything north of the Mexican Guatemalan border um our own uh we we do have like a chess and other a U.S presence in Mexico\nI Would hope that we would work with a Guatemalan and Mexican government's to uh to have that caravan of folks remain in place I I\nKnow the president hunger as he always points out no country wants to export its young\nUm there are also things that we can do to help\nPromote stability in Honduras Guatemala and El Salvador and if we do that we can reduce people who are leaving those countries to come to the United states\nYou know center I'm you spent time as a young man in missions and judge who admissions and I really respect what you've done and you're\nWhere do you think about these these violent left wing mobs that are going around chasing people out of restaurants spinning and Lindsey Graham sending a packages and and horrific emails to Susan Collins and\nGoing to make it make what is it just it's so discouraging job it really is I had an event last night I'm Out in Fairfax County where there were sort of a disruptor protest or it was just a happy hour for young Democrats in Fairfax and disruptive protester try again in my face\nWith a camera and light up and yell at me hoping that I think that I Would say something in Tempe right that they could then put on video and\nWhether it's somebody doing that to me whether at some of the sending something the Susan Collins is home whether it's a colleague gaining accosted in a restaurant um and it it's it's really really\nI don't know it's just it's just sickening [noise] um and you see a you know an escalation of all kinds of I was a hate Europe we saw Nineteen swastikas painted across the front of a Jewish community center in Fairfax\nTwo Saturdays ago that was very shocking so I think we have to those of us in elected positions you what we have to do is maybe\nTry to be better role models bring down the temperature bringing down the rhetoric you couldn't disagree with somebody without being you know in temperature\nAnd civil to them I I really try hard to do that and everything I Do I disagree with the president on a lot he signed Seventeen and my bills you know either that I've been able to put on his desk I'm I I Try not\nTo get into the name calling saying but you're right any violence has to be condemned and whether it's probably once on the left on the right violence that you know not political in nature I'm asked to be condemned one of the great things about our constitution as you know\nYour your favorite part of the constitution is in the first amendment freedom in the press\nAnd my favorite part of the constitution is in the first amendment to which is the right of the people to peacefully assemble the right of the people to petition the government for redress or creative says we we give citizens\nThe right to peacefully assemble\nIt's got to be peaceful or to you know write letters to congressman but it's it's gotta be peaceful and I think that that the framework realize what engagement was necessary for democracy at work but they understood that the engagement had to be peace for any kind of disruptive or wall Kennedy wants to be more\nPotential when a when your former running mate Hillary Clinton said that an civility is acceptable in this environment doesn't that adds fuel to the fire I mean we're like a democratic society and they very\nMuch yeah I disagree with what's happening on the table I think uh I think you gotta maintain civility especially at the pop 'em let me just let me use to role models on my\nSide of the aisle to fix role models on your side though nobody would say Bobby's God is not a very progressive Democrats very progressive Democrats dairy farm and his point of view points out what he thinks is white points out what he thinks is wrong bodies God\nHas had a political career where nobody thinks of Bobby Scott as an unstable person or anything\nI think is right that in mind calling out some somebody thinks is wrong but nobody calls Don pirate name caller nobody thinks he's on several [noise] so I think I can look at examples and and look I got colleagues on my side and I can take their Senate colleagues on the Republican side more Alexander Mars might\nShare of the health education labor pension committee he's very much a Republican and he's going to say what do you think things are going to point out of it you know if he sees something that he thinks is wrong or something the other Democrat wants to do he didn't like he'll be pointed at it now but he says that Lamar Alexander is an uncivil person so I think\nI I think the right or if it's out there that says you know well it's time for a holiday from civil or the wrong law I think we need a damn all\nWith the sample of Bobby scouts an extra one he's my congressman uh and he's been right on some of the biggest issues in America in the past two decades so yeah you can become a progressive\nAnd John reinforce that even when you disagree with Bobby ... nobody thinks of Bobby Scott\nAs like a name Paul or something that's not that's not who he is and we need we all we need to act like that\nI mean I Would I Would put a I Would put your colleagues centered Johnny Isaacson in that category uh same thing everybody knows where he stands he's very conservative the votes with the president a hundred percent of the time but everything is done in the ... civil respectful manner\nI we're we're very short on time but I got to get to the election because that's\nThat's coming up in Nineteen days you have a a what looks like the beach center and insurmountable lead in both the polling numbers but you know nothing is certain the only poll the matters is the one on November six tell me about your reelection campaign what you've seen how it's going and what you think the outcome will be\nWell as you as you pointed out Nineteen days and yeah polls are looking pretty good but I always tell people calls her about preferences and elections are about energy and preferences there isn't the same as energy so what you want to see is energy um I've I've loved serving in the Senate\nMy my campaign theme that I chose this I'm trying\nTo reflect the way I've lived in the way I've served in Virginia that works for all about Virginia about what some travel day of work and honoring work and having good policies about working in the workforce but it's also about this Virginia that works for all been kind of obsessed with the last two words and the pledge of allegiance\nThe notion that uh you know if it's not working for all of my work and if it's not working for all we have more work to do so I'm going to continue should I be a lot about the honor to be reelected I'm going to continue to work on these areas armed services Foreign Relations project and then health education labor pension I'm I have\nSeen release during this calendar year twenty eight gene or maybe no surprise given the elections that results in last November's\nElections in Virginia I continue to see very strong energy turn out in advance voter registration for an interview or seeing pretty strong energy it fully vote was taking place but you point out nothing for granted to to go back to grow poppy Scott he says\nThere's only two ways to run election either run unopposed a run scare I'm opposed to I'm running scared say that's the way I'm going to do it all the way we all watch\nFor president campaign of twenty twenty\nJohn I really want her to be working but junior politician on the national league Eighteen forty and twenty his team that I definitely came back from that can't get any like at the end of the wizard of Oz there's no place like home there's no no\nI really I loved it working I'm [noise] love being able to live in which may and June work that matters which is low level like your person in a way that people don't take me a little I think that they could be a ...\nSo I Am very focused on if I'm standing with long continuing shortly\nOkay Senator Tim Kaine our thank you for your time or at a time today a great dialogue with use or as always it's always great to have you on for more information\nOn dissenters reelection campaign go to Tim Kaine dot com Tim Kaine dot com and he's up for re election on November six that's the midterm struck with on your calendar if you're in Virginia and listen to me right now early voting and started\nSo you can go and take care of that right now go to Tim Kaine dot com Tim Kaine dot com for more\nInformation chain two thousand Eighteen and by the way that's came within a\nSenator thanks for being with us John right to be with you got what foreign partnership John triggers radio network we'll be right back\nBut a here's why I respect the center and kind of like I respect Bobby Scott they come on my show whenever I ask a there is no topics there is no scripts uh I I mean I just had the center on here for what twenty\nFive minutes unfettered asking them anything and you have\nA conversation and that is\nThe definition of civility we don't agree on a lot of things most things but uh we can still have the civil conversation disagree or agree we can have a dialogue we'd have a conversation we didn't have a relationship of the center and I have a relationship we have a friendship\nAnd just because we don't agree I mean look I ran\nTrump's campaign in Virginia against them and\nWe did good enough where Tim Kaine and Joe Biden had to come to Virginia on Sunday and Monday because we're closing the gap but that doesn't mean we're not friends and that doesn't mean you can't have a conversation and\nI'm told his answers were very interesting or we agree on the Yemeni situation we shouldn't be there there's a lot of these Secret Wars that the U.S has and that we shouldn't be\nAnd then I'm going to go into any minute and certainly the Saudi episode was Joelle could show he's bringing all of a simple light but uh you know we're in we're in the secret war is it good though\nIt's like they're all under the radar screen and we're in so many of them now\nAnd the military industrial complex is so big\nAnd we've been in wars for so long that nobody really thinks about him until something goes ... arrive like us\nHear about it on the news\nBut I hear about it every day because I'm a senior contributor now for the al Jazeera Arabic\nNetwork and so what we talk about on a daily basis is wars going on over the world and I get to go on panels with military generals of various countries and their representatives are debating of various hot spots that are around the globe and so you get a little bit of\nA different perspective is one thing that al Jazeera Arabic does that al Jazeera satellite news does\nIs it really brings the world news home and they don't really have an outlet in the U.S you've got to go on the Internet but uh when I go on an algae zero and I'm On several times a week yeah I've had to turn this week down most of my assignments because I'm busy with the family stuff\nAnd opening up this new radio station which is a lot of work by the way for that but a typically when I go on a an al Jazeera Arabic prime time you know the average the average Seventy million viewers Seventy million not\nSeven ... seven hundred thousand Seventy million that's their average\nReach prime time on an average week say\n\nCNN region about seven hundred thousand on a good night they might get one of the prime time shows
