Gillespie um so I can last year um but I'm the one path or a Democrat there isn't an wrinkle in Chesterfield with the suburban women\nUm and I think Abigail's at the match for them\nAnd I think that the Republicans are doing everything they can to lose that block naturally right now um and so I haven't is gossip\nI think many crew laid on this Kavanaugh's nomination in terms of I mean I interviewed me just say yeah in in terms of what this is doing\nAnd I think we all live in our own echo chambers and we all have our own perceptions of how it's done but what this is done in the ... and some other polling demonstrate this in the Republican base is now activated enthusiasm gap which is favored the Democrats for the last year and a half is now closed substantially\nAnd I think that works to perhaps paper ... David Wright has two two issues though outside the demographics\nDistrict in the DNA that district is Republican number one he is not close the deal with some of campers people and they were just as soon thrown under the bus and rent that seek out for two years\nAnd bring back or ... you know somebody it's more in line with their thinking and and even some scores and secondly Tim Kaine is going to be exceptionally strong in that district he was mayor of Richmond if he has a political he's widely ... either\nThat had to Mark Warner that that that the I think that's right this this jacks up that democratic turnout there so you got a factor that into this thing I still think at the end of the day that the DNA of that district establishes itself and brought wins but but this was a close race in Democrats have nominated ... she's very\nUnder or whatever happens you're talking about uh somebody that's got to be involved in democratic politics for some time I think I think Abigail Spanberger is going to happen every somebody's got to be reckoned with a in a democratic circles for some time\nNow I you know I don't ... I don't know a ton about the district or a you know I Will say I was driving down the south side Virginia to go to an event last weekend and going through some of the rural counties and it seems like ... ... margin in those counties are but obviously the critical mass of the the district has been a gesture film and right go so\nYou know I I Would probably say you know robotically it's a Republican district but obviously if it's a wave here than it could be one that the Democrats deal then would have to defend a twenty twenty\nI get the second district Taylor Maria whatever happened with Scottsdale or the other day I had him on my radio show or the ... campaign put my [noise] my name and their TV ads so I appreciate the PR for that what's going on in that race but\nThis is my first chance to respond to Scott right after he had his meltdown on your show um that went viral yet I'm Upset about our analysis last time um and now says has not changed he's still journalist [noise] um and\nUm I don't think I don't believe in New York Times poll I think it was you know I had up to this point I'd stuff new controls are pretty good at the last week they've they've not been um I think there's some noise going on\nUm but I think we're is gonna win and she's gonna win going away [noise] um so I think she's going to win going away I think it's going to be a [noise] a secular up until two months ago I was doing everything um and he's really blown it\nAnd he's not going to win reelection and so are you saying because of the whole the validation as soon as she was just you and the way he's handled it and remember that this district is one of the few in the country\nThat nominally sits in the ... side a media market but is in a media market that doesn't really stretch too many other districts\nSo the media has been all over this is on the evening news every night you know if Barbara Comstock at a petition scandal in Tempe district it would have made the CD for forty five seconds one night\nOr maybe a week later they quickly re mentioned that you know it goes way you you cannot\nWith something like the tide water it's been on Hampton Roads so let me let me look I think a New York transport property rights taken is fixed ... district very well\nOr you know it was a Navy SEAL all kinds of stuff is ... issue matrix that he has chosen I think you're in line with that district is not a far right kind of guy he understands a suburban Virginia Beach in those areas so we have all that going\nThat's very good candidate and you have a year that favors Democrats or what's in the Republican what scares me about this is the fact that if you look nationally Democrats just a ton of cash\nAnd drop it a couple of million dollars on that race in the last week that megaphone just can overwhelm at this point in exaggerate these things I think I think they are trying to post correcting papers up today\nA again if I were betting I I I think he wins but in this environment with a kind of money Democrats she put down a you've got to be nervous about this you're going to watch this on election night\nIf the Democrats win this seat\nIt tells me it's going to be a pretty good year farm in terms of we're talking thirty five forty yeah\nI just think about [noise] the thing about this district is different than Comstock and it's definitely different than a rat is the turnout model is totally different and I think it's hard for Democrats to win the seat in a non presidential year\nI just based on who votes democratic and Virginia Beach Norfolk it's you know the the typical democratic voters going to be a minority down there and unless you get an outsized performance it's not I think it's tough for the Democrats to win that seat I mean Glenn Nye one or two thousand they he got flushed down the drain and twenty ten\nAnd the reason was democratic vote came out in the presidential year for Brock Obama it wasn't there the next cycle for Glenn Nye 'cause nobody knew when I was\nUm I think Scott Scott in advantages that the turnout I remember back when I was in the house carcass we'd look at the turnout bottles and the numbers and [noise]\nYou know Virginia Beach in Norfolk the numbers are just forty percent of what they are in other parts of the state so it's just that it's you got a lot of people that live there that are you know enlisted men or women that are registered to vote elsewhere so it's just it's hard you know to to bring people out in that type of environment even though his bench correct you have what media market and\nYou know they could possible Scott from now till the end of the time but there's going to be a conservative there's going to be a conservative votes is going to come out\nAnd whether I'm a ... Maria I don't know how to pronounce it Luria whether or not she can get people out based on her name as opposed to you know Tim Kaine is not as big a magnet there as he is enrichment um so I I still think it's October to Democrats even though I agree that looks like Scott's kind of watch this one issue\nNineteen Ninety six and Tom Davis one member this well um we had a scandal um state wide where John Warner put a television ad up against Mark Warner who was John Warner was far ahead and um he photo shop Mark Warner and drew a picture\nOr who's in the ... I Can't remember who he ... he thought it was up but Clinton I think yeah you ... with Clinton but was it was while her eyes ... there was a racial aspect to it too I Can't remember what they did but they do to Mark Warner into a picture he wasn't in and um ended a television ad\nAnd it was a huge went national scandal for John Boehner who had a moderate brand and was a\nGuy that you know everyone looked she likes either what you're trying to say it's got Taylor is there like had a friend okay and and and that people you know like respected John Warner much higher than Scott Taylor them [noise] and and his numbers collapsed\nAnd he said I'm a navy person and and the captain my ship and I'm responsible for what happened and I apologize and it's got telling her down that he would want ... [noise]\nSo I just I was worse campaign chairman that year and it was a it was a close race Merck worse than fourteen million dollars at his own money that year that made this really a much closer race than it might have been otherwise good strong or it was news on ... to ... or ... or the math and you kind of heard it after running a close race there but I remember it out and I mean they fired\nThe people that were involved in the ad and everything else and you broke it in it [noise] it was an issue for a week or two and then John took accountability accountability [noise] fatal his mishandled this thing I think convinced is kind of destruction and tapping his people take the Fifth Amendment doesn't help it just keeps it in the news\nIs that enough to bring down somebody with a good reputation has done a good job in their first term or not\nUm and also I think the ... when he turned out they talk about a new wave I think you're really talking about a ... that's really what's happening with the Democrats is in the suburban female voters have swung radically or to the Democratic party and that's\nI think I'll forget our predictions rowing in fact the next thing we got to get to the reds yes yes I agree with us [laughter]\nI'm an ... million Thirteen were there but not that popular when they're running and libertarian broke five percent and libertarians the automatic ballot access to the next five years in Virginia was sure if that was going to charge their public and that was going to expire this year 'cause there'll be trying to backtrack five percent again\nNow they're taking a course where there'll be another five years the libertarian automatic ballot access while they're\nGreat and why is that a good point and then come back we're going to get over five no no question probably seven godfather ... somewhat feel happy when you think you think five or it's going to winter when\n[noise] uh what what ... what about\nMaria [noise] going on [noise]\nAnd uh uh uh the alert\n[noise]\nWell [noise] [noise]\nAnd uh [noise] stand a terrorist got nothing but negative publicity from a over the last several months and I don't see 'em climbing out of that whole could be wrong but I don't see that and I also don't\nI mean you know a cop stock can talk about her internal all she wants that's not what people were picking up going door to door [noise]\nOr what have you heard it\nIndependent doors I'm not talking about you know going to try to bolster the Democratic but are going to democratic doors\nThat those people are telling her there with her\nAnd when it on occasion they've asked what's the main complaint or if this is for Kavanaugh 'cause I talk to anybody since then [noise] uh it was the n._r._a. [noise] those ads have been effective but this capping off thing\nI mean that's all you know the door to door and that's all I get\nThat far apart [laughter] but ... got to go when we got to get the rest yep we've got to be getting money nice ride Carolina right hunt just start with where they are early in the right you have to be happy so far\nYeah generally happy I think the defence like I said a month ago yawn fast a [noise] good and and they're going to get better I think they're deep Pence will get better [noise] um I I think they need to give a couple of guys more snaps a couple of guys less naps but\nBy and large I liked their defense to be a top ten deep answers yearn for the next few years going forward that makes it for us\nI think they do they have one issue that need to solve and I can solve it if they listen to me they all week on the ends they don't have any big play receivers that can go down catch the ball you know catch eight balls for a hundred yards\nAnd you need to have that too when consistently in the NFL you can't just keep throwing too you're tied into your backs especially with a\nTight and like Jordan read the genetically going to get insurance if something\nDoesn't on the street [noise] he's been on the street I in you know Bruce is my from Brazil I emailed him literally within twelve hours if they're being caught by Dallas begging begging them to pick up jazz I have repeated it every time I said um [noise]\nThe day he sets foot on Redskins park you'll be their number one receiver they could get rid of Josh Fox and yes I said it they could keep Jamieson and crowd or in the slot they can get they keep that get retro Senate they're number two receivers fast\nBut then you need a big receiver who can pull down eight nine Templeton game for a hundred yards desk and do it and so if they put him on the team they will be the best team the NFC East and will make the playoffs sweating\n[noise] Dallas like losing um I think it's [laughter] I Know they don't like to when they like to lose a why did you know why do they do what they do what do they keep patient care to head coach you know I mean\nWhy did they get rid of Tony Romo and it's just I I think somewhere Jerry Jones just decided he was tired of winning the waters start losing for a while and so that's that's why does what he does\nThat what what do you think that it or not I mean is that the answers that dependency\nYeah I'm I'm favorable and dance and I can't believe we're talking about the Redskins are not referring to them as the first place yeah that's true first place and authorities are like the first like type ... that's right I I'm going to say at this point a lot better than I thought there'd be this year still\nVery very tough schedule next week I'm going to say nine and seven and\nBecause of all this year so I'm not that I'm actually\nOne of the things that's always heard that\nOver ... you're going to the game since Ninety four and one of the things that the Redskins are black for some time there's a speed demon than\nI Can't remember the last time I'm sure I probably missed something but I cannot remember the last time I've seen the Redskins Redskin return upon or kick off for a touchdown\nAnd a while and it's been a long time\nAnd I remember well one of the hallmarks of whom party era was that he always had pets he called it one burner\n[noise] whether it was you know on your nerves whoever I mean it was he always had at least one burned [noise] and we don't have that and uh it it shows\nHow many how many ... when they're broken getting bad not to Tom I got fired last one I Know that my from my accent\nYeah yeah I think [noise] they do have working [noise] never dream on [noise]\nAh they beat New Orleans at the superdome and on the waiter and eleven o'clock season [noise]\nNo I say not\nAll right I'm going to go in the middle I think they're going to win ten games I think you've got to make layoffs and here's your here's the thing about Alex Smith [noise] I'm not a fan of it because he can't win big games in the playoffs and so we got an exciting quarterbacks but you know I've watched them now three weeks I'm not a fan one way or the other but they're on TV [laughter]\nBut I mean imagine games and he's never going to be you know he's never going to beat himself\nHe kind of ...

Trump won two years later he's still can't get over got let me think what am I\nMarried Garland well let me let me talk about America I think might bite every indication is a very honorable straightforward made a good Supreme Court judge an image traditional sense with these balanced not completely a liberal he was a democratic operative before he wanted the bench but\nBut met the criteria for it for a judge\nBut what is better not holding a hearing on are doing what they've done in this case and that it's bringing putting the sham of of hearing him and then finding a way to ... reputation and voting no they worked at a confirming middle election year Republican senators were confirmed school youth seat and putting on a more liberal members just wasn't going to happen\nIn a presidential politics here not a big time who knows who knows what the rules are writing about it but the president is the president United States who nominate somebody from the frame court out the set up their rights that threat\nSo therefore I think McConnell's argument is out when he says look a that was the presidential election yeah like a lot of voters inside it that that\nBut I'm just saying they they stretch it each time I don't know who started but it keeps getting worse and worse and worse\nAnd once you do it for one year you could do two years you can do it three years I I don't know what they're already guard rails long enough I think it was they moved it from sixty votes to fifty votes for everything but the Supreme Court of course they're going to do it for the

I'm ... by either by train abroad I the first to where I was in the first two were not read allegations anyway the point [laughter] the message that\nWomen are getting around the country is that this is okay and Republicans are now into a debate about the definition of ... I mean they will try and ended up all struggle I mean it is a is this is on the official Senate district ... look everybody knows what blew the nets\nAre they're not you have to first of all I don't
