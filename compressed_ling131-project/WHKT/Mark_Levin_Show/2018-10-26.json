nonsense we're going to bring you the truth just like we do every day thanks for joining us today eleven days to the midterms eleven days are linked Parker coming up momentarily\nHey we're really excited today a because when you get through these pipe bombs and you just heard the president this is no time for violence we have to have a conversation in this country a dialogue respectful of people's views I don't\nKnow the nature of this I don't know the facts are not in um no one else but I have full\nConfidence that or the Federal Bureau of investigation it's not a very quickly get to the bottom of this Mike Pence saying yesterday whoever this person is it's going to be brought to justice now a new pipe bomb or potentially a is a the Associated Press the saying has potentially bend your lips\nDelivered to a New York apartment complex where Robert Deniro lives\nSo all those facts are going to come out until we get to the bottom of it we don't know it's all conjecture and conjecture is fine but let's let the facts about let's see what the nature of this is what all violets much the contempt whether it is chasing a people out of restaurants are chasing him down subways\nHave a legitimate political dialogue in this country these midterms are only eleven days away and there's a lot at stake these are the biggest ever and folks you know what I Know this is the biggest mid term election ever this segment brought you bought\nOut of his Republican Congress ministry and that if we if we put those types of policies were going to go backwards\n\nYou're on the job for his radio network trucks insurance across America I'm a delaying park hurling as they can\nBe a cheap communications officer for the job creators network she has gone around the country on a tax cuts plus tour for months talking to a small business owners or just regular people trying to figure out what is going on and there is definitely a right on your show going on here Elaine ah\nJust talked to a lot of people cat Republicans is their chance that Republicans could actually hold the house forty seconds\nYou know I'm I'm pretty optimistic and talking directly to the small business owners and sit there and and the people who showed up at the rallies that we held and I are not going to think that we heard that people are benefiting from the ceiling it on you know in the tiny her\nI'm optimistic and that's the thing that we can\n\nAnd what were the other thing that we're seeing is when you look at the generic ballot numbers that they favor the Democrats but there's a lotta fink polls out there and the other thing that\nWe're seeing internally is in the fifty or so races that are going to determine who controls the house\nTo remember the Democrats really have to pick up twenty six states away that twenty three twenty six because there's three things now that the Democrats hold that um my sources are telling me are leaning very strong every Republican those are going to slip\nSo the Democrats are going to have to pick up twenty six seats what I've heard right now\nIs uh twenty six states need 'em that are toss ups that all of them are now trending towards Republicans now in the last four forty eight hours part of it is you know people are looking at the economy\nAnd they're saying do we really want to go backwards do we really want to go back to the bottom of regimes that we really want to go back to getting rid of the tax cuts\nAre half a percent growth savings are down nobody has any money family comes home father comes over mama jak come home on a Friday nights or they can't take your family to a movie they don't have any money there is fear of their jobs the other\nThing is a way that you have to look at is not\nOnly or jobs or an unemployment is at the lowest it's been since Nineteen sixty nine you don't want to do in Nineteen sixty nine wasn't land that was one of the New York's miracle Mets won the world series Nineteen sixty nine I mean\nI was a kid back then I was uh\nFull Elaine that have entered the job market that had basically given up on getting a job sixty two thousand and one or two thousand one sister two thousand and eight recession dropped out of the job market are now coming back and let me give me some other ... the number\nOf former balance that have been released out of prison getting jobs is at a record high you know how great it\nIs for people that made a mistake and now they're getting a second chance let me give you and others that the hiring of handicapped people in the Trump McConaughey Elaine it's up to thirty five percent use are handicapped people getting jobs I mean this is an American\nEconomic renaissance that Trump has now that it's it's sunny and of course nobody wants to talk about it so how do you get the message on the line\nFor like I said I charge every person at every single stop for hearing these stories and take this information and I'm not surprised that we're seeing that link says\nIncarceration and Hitler to find jobs and that's the way we can it can help them to Ecuador back into society from the reality is we have a seven point one million jobs out there and we don't have enough people to sell those so I think it's fantastic\n[noise] get nice to have the training that they need and getting the child will keep them out of trouble and keep them from the hunting repeat offenders that's the best credit grant but that's program if it ever get anybody to get the job nothing yeah that\nHappens when you have a job and you're making money and you can do to society\nAnd the thing is that line or a job for a family uh raised I'm a better pay raise more take home pay the job is not read and it's not flew in your your you know what it is is great and so when you get a job\nYou're right and when uh when when men and women feel better about\nTheir ability to support and take care of their family things look out for people and uh this really this is the jobs economy I mean it is incredible the number of people the other thing the other\nAuto storylines Parker with is a trumpet economy and the resurgence we're having\nIs the number of people now that in in a middle income jobs or um lower to middle income jobs who now feel comfortable in changing jobs because there's a better opportunity for that you know before this\nWhen you looked at the numbers nobody would leave a job they already because they were scared like the next job would be there will walk now that's changing so people that are have a better opportunity at another employer they're now\nMoving to benefit themselves that's another atoll story of this economy do you agree\nAbsolutely and and more people to have those kinds of choices in ...\nAnd because of that we're seeing wages rise and people are making changes in their jobs because\nThere are better opportunities says Haim or an even under the tax plan that took effect this year we're going to see 'em ordinary families to be able to keep two thousand dollars\nMore each year out of their earnings and one of the thing that that kind of an untold story and it doesn't get a lot of [noise] a lot of pressure on and that's the the new a deduction for small business owners past their small business owners partnerships\nSole proprietor sets on as corporations they're able to actually feel twenty percent of their business earnings from taxes which is what you were talking about you're a small business as well and they're able to reinvest that money on it now they have to reinvest it more into\nInto higher wages because they're competing for scarce labor Alistair for jobs and so in Queens do you feel good about their choices out there and and that's that's a great thing to me they see the good news coming in more and more and more and\nWe'll keep reminding people where I was on the road is that if he wanted he says his progress going this prosperity\nAnd we do have to vote for these types of policies\nAnd for the Republican Congress for his cookies policies in place I've actually never seen a party run on results taxes that's essentially what\nDemocrats are doing and the public needs to open their ears and listening to the fact that they are running on raising taxes\nIt's amazing raising taxes open borders lower wages unfettered immigration sanctuary cities\nIt's it's it's their platform is insane and I don't even know what your platform is other than sanctuary cities open borders get rid of tax cuts I I mean I have no idea and basically their their their whole policy is Trump sucks I mean that's\nTheir platform unbelievable never seen anything like it but here's the thing you got to vote and land because if you don't vote you don't matter but the other thing is you got eleven days you got to get involved because the other side they're working really hard you got to get involved and here's the best way to get involved with the tax\nCuts worked dot com I mean I\nDon't know how would you make it easier for people you don't have the people say I don't want to join a party I don't want to go to meetings you have to run against any of that I don't know where to go go to the tax cuts worked our top it's all there you can do whatever you want you can handle\nLiterature you can make phone calls you can send us an email you can help take people to

I work a first agenda and the president's policies and so as you know over seven\nThousand legal immigrants are marching right now through Mexico to bump rush or southern border of the United states it's an invasion and more\nAre joining them every day it's going to be ten thousand by the time it hit the southern border now these are ... are determined to crush the border and if they get through there are millions\nMore behind them by the way they went in front of a U.S embassy and burned tires that's why you need to build a wall now look if you don't have a ... a country Congress just\nPut this off for months but said you're about to take up the funding for the wall liberals want to abolish ice they want to let everyone\nIn they watch sanctuary cities they don't care who comes in whatever big business and big donors gangster bankers on Wall street Goldman Sachs oh vein\nLet him into you know why she labor better shareholder value bigger bonuses and this is the unholy alliance of our time that we can't let them have that they're all the way Congress\nNeeds to hear from President what certain terms this is our country corps Congress tell them to build a wall now too old to two to four thirty one Twenty one for more information you can go to America First policies dot org this message page for an authorized by America First of all things incorporated joining us now\nYet at the beginning of this campaign people like me had written him off her dad said he couldn't win dark mceachin is the incumbent I went through this last year that Sheryll was running\nAnd he's a good guy sheriff waited they thought they were going to when they got crushed and so I'm like no way you're going to win this or\nYou're going to with his sister but again he's doing this in a little bit of a different way this guy is everywhere\nYou Don they teach in strongholds he's in their churches he's in their communities knocking on doors you know he's got to win the Republican areas but he's given John or one for his money in the fourth just he just had\nVice president Pence on Saturday\nCame for a rally for the cat and plus the vice president's time here with Fifteen temptation that go into very limited they don't go and help candidates they don't think it will because they don't have\nThe time and he's with us now we've got some woods behind his back and something that's uh Ryan McAdams running for Congress Republican district poor against incumbent\nDemocrat John McHugh agents that will be determined on November ... keeps running for a second term Ryan good to have you with us Matt\nJohn good morning it's great to be with you congratulations on your your radio show being expanded into the acquisition appreciate everything that you said I I Love the elite in and um thank you so much to do with being with you this morning [laughter]\nWell I think you're you're trying to do with race I'm not saying that you're going to win but you're turning it into a competitive race and you're working hard also a couple of things let's start with these pipe bombs what are you are making the yeah\nWell you you said uh well uh I was listening to you and\nYou know there's no place for some politics I think that that we've gone too far maybe on all sides of the ... demonizing one another and I think we need to get back to talking about ideas and solutions and and what about the American people\nAnd stop trying to paint each other you know as a year you know their enemies and you know we are competitors and races but we need to get back\nTo well what is American and that as a matter of just kind of activity that we're seeing 'em right now with bombing or what the just the hyped up rhetoric I'm On that we see in politics today\nSo I'm definitely for a more moderate tone and and\nFocusing on the things that really matter to Americans American Soldiers and\nTell me a little bit about um your position on this caravan\nRight we've got ten thousand people that's basically going to bomb Russia border the United states and write\nAs you know even though the president said he's kind of put the military there or or um or or the or the national guard it's a it's not likely that any closer supporter because that would close off trade and\nOur laws are such it's very odd wise because when you have to watch what over the border without your documents you've broken a U.S immigration law right you're here illegally sewage is up for it\nProtecting you Thanksgiving the spores law so\nThere's nothing we can do we can't catch and release you can only keep it for twenty days and if they say the word asylum you can't turn them away you have to process it\nAnd you can only what you can only detain them for twenty days and the asylum process\nThing the backlog now right two years so basically you get a piece of paper and you get released into the interior of the country if you were in Congress what do you do about this caravan how do you deal with is\nYeah well there's two different issues there but let's talk about the ... period and first number one\nIs we've got to stop them I think the president's going to stop 'em there's no doubt in my mind that he's going to follow through with what he said that he's not allow them to come in I mean I I think the continuing to put pressure on Mexico um I I Love what he's he's done with Honduras and brought them all and said look if if you can't stop them and then we're going to start taking\nOur money away and our phones that we've given you or whatever that looks like but I agree there's got to be consequences countries just allowing this type of thing this caravan\nLawlessness that to happen across the border is coming up our way so I think continuing to push ... number one puts pressure on Mexico the doctor's care\nOf and I don't know if they'll be able to do that you know if it's the Fifteen thousand strong now or whatever it is [noise] um but we're going to have to stop them at the border and then the recognition\nIs what you said is I think that we need to change those asylum or our laws that when someone comes in and and I know you know this but [noise] eighty percent or ability to claim asylum will will get it um and they'll go through the process and\nThen most of them eighty percent of them will get turned away by the court and so there's there's just there's a you know this connection between\nThose claiming asylum and then does actually going before the court and then then being deemed that it's completely erroneous and so uh I think but but like you said the problem is is that one day they've gotten that the status\nPer se men they never show up for court and\nThen they're running amok in our country and so we've got to change that so that uh and I don't know exactly what the solution will be but we've got to change that to to wherever that you know they have to be more stringent policy for people seeking asylum once they cross the border\nRummage Adams you're right we have to close loopholes and uh\nIf you just read some of the facts here in two thousand or one half of one percent of all the illegals that cross the border claimed the silent now fifty percent climate filed by two thousand Nineteen it'll be eighty percent I mean they they did they just figured it out you coming\nIn the in the United states you get Africa look if you come in and you don't get apprehended then you don't get apprehended and only Fifteen Percent are apprehended eighty five percent just\nCome in all of the fifty percent that actually get apprehended eight fifty percent of them claim asylum and then I even though eighty percent don't qualify it doesn't matter because they're already God I mean they're ... they're handed a piece of paper and they\nGet on a par [laughter] I mean it's it's it's\nIt's it's Saturday what is going on that the president said that and like you can't get the Democrats the back and you can't get Republicans are backing them those that are sponsored by big wall street donors and Goldman Sachs that\nThey don't care about it they just want cheap labor to drive shareholder value so they can make a higher bonus and screw the U.S worker they could care less about the er the holy alliance going on why we have to talk about a lot of other issues I got to get a quick route from our sponsors stay with us Ryan McAdams running

I'm\nJamal can sharply appeared to have been premeditated wow really what do you do slash\nWow like he would any did come out you had somebody else go in and talk about in his clothes you can't find his body the guy had the wrong shoes on you had Thirteen in intelligence officers\nFly in and out the same day camera footage you flew in a forensic doctor with a chainsaw or saw\n'em\nAnd you gave everybody the day off you gave all your Turkish or poison that sample the day off in both the embassy and the comfortable home I mean the cops work and the and his own and now you're acknowledging that it appears to have\nA dream meditative wow that's a real Dick Tracy right there\nHe's a regular uh he just Sherlock Holmes man this guy either next pressure cholesterol virus all one wow I mean what great investigation that is this you're about to show me saying for the kingdom is such an absolute\nJoke it is it is just a a bumbling it's bumbling and here's the deal and I said this on\nAl Jazeera yesterday I don't know what the president's going to do about this was going to do something that's number one number two what every guys you got to consult the secretary of state Mike Pompeo he tried just fill Gina Haspel but they're going to do something they have to do something you have to react to this now\nI don't think he's going to cancel the arms deal because he said look I got to deal with that it's economically benefiting the country and\nIf I can say well there's certainly going to buy the weapons from China or Russia so why would I Do that here's the other people said oh the president's position has or has keeps changing no the president hasn't had\nA position other at the end he discovered the idea of scrapping the arms deal everything\nElse around the table including withdrawing or support from the Saudi Emirates coalition in again any civil war so everything else on the table so to say that well his position keeps changing he hasn't had a position he started commentary\nWhich is involved based on new facts to come out and the Saudis have changed their story temp jobs did they change it again yesterday and they'll change it again tomorrow as more facts come out\nSo I don't understand what they're saying the president has changes because you have\nA position he's waiting for the fact that President Trump is not a politician he's a businessman here's our businessmen make decisions facts numbers spreadsheets and Matt so as the facts come in\nAnd the mathematical equation gets put together his\nCommentary evolved as information changes that's what are you supposed to do the end of the day I don't know what the final outcome\nOf the U.S reactions you got to be but I've been saying this all week in the middle middle Middle East on TV this president does it take well to being lied to and\nI don't think there's any doubt crown prince Mohammed bin Solomon why don't I don't think that goes over well with President Trump he doesn't like being lied to here's the other\nThing doesn't like dealing with it competent people he doesn't have a lot of patience and I'm telling you crown prince\nMohammed bin Salman\nIs incompetent everything the guy at thirty three years old has gotten involved in has been a complete Arden mitigated disaster for the Saudi kingdom so eventually the father just have to say you know what my son is in the top earners bumbling fools and I got to put somebody else in\nThe country to saline because it's crazy\nThe nation allegedly\nThe or Saudis have now said that'll I guess not a final story they're saying but that's kind of\nChange again so who knows what\nThe uh to showcase has here's what it's tough it is really brought renewed focus\nTo the Saudi emirate tactics and the support that we're giving them and getting involved in the Yemen's civil war which is causing a horrific very disturbing very growing humanitarian\nCrisis where I just got tired of the um on algebra zero every day I see the pictures you do say because uh the fake news networks today they don't want to show your real news they want to talk about\nYou know President Trump Stormy Daniels or whatever they do\n\nBut I I see the pictures on TV and I'm and it'll really tear out your stomach and you've got children just starving I mean they can eat that'd be like they got mother's stripping park from trees bark and boiling it just matching it up just so there's\nSomething and that's and that's in the summer reading grass\nI mean there's no food\nI mean you think about how to get your child is sitting there they starve to death and you think about how the sales missing this thing is is a horror show it is worse than the area it's worse than anything I've seen and\nOur involvement in it is shameful and it's absolutely shameful and if there's anything that's got to come out of the show the affair or\nWe're going to get the hell out of there as we should and it's just it's horrific that the United states is involved in something of this nature all because you know we've got the Iranian bogeyman with their nineteenth street post or whatever they\nI looked at the ... Mike in Oakland you're you're on the air Mike\nHey John yep\nI agree with you on the him and say I think that's you're exactly right about that so I'm I I Do know that comes out with this for anything that's good to come out of this thing I Would be good but\nI have to point out though the irony or something you said just a few minutes ago I'm sure you didn't pick up on it because you don't agree but um you know you said the president do the\nThe two things he doesn't like he doesn't like to be lied to and he doesn't like incompetent and I I Can't help but think he must be he just wants to all that to him so [laughter] I'm\nSure he likes to lie to us and I feel they're using competing for the job so she just doesn't want to share those two things with others [noise]\nI guess uh I guess you think this tremendous economic renaissance and this full make tremendous economy we have an all these jobs I guess you think that's the homework governed confidence I guess you'd think the fact that we haven't heard from ISIS in that\nOnly can throw a tiny part of her story yet when he took over it was a massive I think that's a topic I guess you think the fact that\nThe wacko and North Korea has not done a nuclear test and see threaten them I guess\nYou'd say that's the top of that I get to take all these new jobs and we have in the fact that we just keep going up in the confidence and there's the tax cuts and you figure that's and confident so I guess your nice definition of incompetence Mike\n... is just a little\nBit different\nI guess uh you know some of those things are not\nSure I see\nGod I mean I wouldn't want\nSomeone who is competent than that and what kind of position right now you are right now that\nThank you for straightening yeah its economy Obama leaves office supply wages are Rob savings is up jobs there are people are moving out of the things that kids have jobs everything or governor's record bought on you for pointing that out\nOn January ...

subcommittee on sea power reading this for the United states that will be decided November six his challenger Democrat van Julie Williams connoisseur let me ask you this uh\nThe evolving story of the Saudis it's now clear this was a premeditated murder this guy got chopped up in a\nBasically got out of there and some kind of doggie bags and they very to the garden or something the whole thing is to just a horrible situation but look a\nCrown prince Mohammed bin Salman the administration has put a lot of things in the sky that Jared Kushner has\nAnd a lot of people are saying\nYou know maybe this guy is just a competent capable of running the country\nEverything you touches turns to craft whether it's the Yemen's civil war that's a disaster the gang of four embargo against the state of guitar that backfired and blow up in their face guitars better off today than they were now he's got this thing where they changed their story nine times\nWhat are we do here\nJohn as you point out it's clear that a show was brutally murdered it's clear that it was premeditated it's clear that uh that I think the crown prince knew about that a NBS Mohammed bin Salman\nDay I think\nHave a lot to answer for and I think they have to be held accountable so I Do think that there has to be significant a penalties yet they suffer\nI Do think to the question has to be asked is like does the United states believes that it can carry on a continued relationship with Saudi Arabia which I Do think we need to but can that be with the crown prince I I think that's a pretty compelling\nQuestion I think the administration is going to have to ask that I think Congress will eventually addressed that an asset to you know what will be the penalties eye to eye to Saudi Arabia I was I understand the impact of those of those contracts for what we're doing\nJust supply a military uh\nEquipment to Saudi Arabia I\nThink Saudi Arabia I can be a like a a force on that is is a is a is an ally to us in the in the middle east but I don't think that it can it can be that type of ally that we want and that indeed if this is how they're going to operate\nI mean we have you know we have principles in the United states that we\nI just don't see Saudi Arabia doing that you know you you point out the issue with Yemen chewing you and I have talked about that before a those are all questions I think that come out and how we see Saudi Arabia operating in the region policies\nBeing played out and are are they are they doing the same ... in that region that create stability and that and that are working in the in the best interest of all involved not just Saudi\nArabia but uh other allies in the middle east and listen I I I understand what they're doing that to push back against the Iranian but are\nAre they doing things that in the long term moving in the middle east in the right direction I think those are questions that we have to ask ... foreign policy\nStandpoint and I think that U.S policy toward Saudi Arabia you know needs to be directed by those I think very a very sobering issues that we have it for us\nSo it seems like congressman and Whitman or were drawn agreement and it seems like what you're saying is the best way to solve this is a four crown prince NBS will hammered the common to maybe a step aside for someone else had his father for somebody else in their final question I\nOnly have half a minute and I got to get your will not let out so very quickly or is there going to be a vote in Congress on our involvement in the Yemeni civil war and backing the Saudi amorous coalition yes or no\nI'm John I I I Can't can't predict that because I don't know where the discussion is going to go over all Saudi Arabia but I Would say that it it will be part of the debate in Congress about what our policy is a wish Saudi Arabia and conflict there in Yemen\nOr they got to go more information Rob ... dot com\nRob Wittman dot com early voting and started in Virginia you get out and get it all go to Robert The dot com congressman thanks for being with us I got to go\n\nWith me keeping up on the topics because no fake news year just the truth great to have you with me John triggers radio network your Godzilla of the truth in America boy that\nNonsense what's going on up there every day got a people I compete\nWith host like if he were they just get up every day they read the paper you got the fake news you've got fake polls movies are the big poll yesterday from the Washington Post is unbelievable I mean the Washington Post like when did they get to learn like they don't want to work people say well what are they going to change the polling methodology to get it right never because they don't want to get right because it's not about\nIt accurate poll it's about the poll driving fake news to get a fake narrative draw the conclusion that's all it is it's all why\nThe Washington Post actually putting out a poll yesterday actually putting out a poll showing Barbara Comstock\nTrailing Jennifer Wexton and the jets district by third gene point now there is no way that ... didn't have the third gene point lead over Barbara concept every a journal poll that I have seen\nMoney shows this race a dead heat or Comstock slightly ahead and the Washington Post has got Comstock down by Thirteen this is a complete and utter lie and if you can fake news is energy on the audience it's beyond the national Enquirer what they tried\nOr do they have cops not so much they want that seem so bad\nThey want the liberal do nothing Jennifer watched it in there so bad they can taste it they want their\nLesson is in that seat so much that they will actually conducted poll make things up do it in such\nA way to getting results that they want so they could put it out there and say the races over don't give Tom start getting the money and don't work for her it's a lost cause so they\nDo a big pole in order to do things now it's unbelievable nobody in that district is going to look you in the eye and say that they think the general Washington as a ... point lead this racist tied\nAnd I think Tom stock is going to win\nWhat was your posed as a care do
