coming in and get your ... and I hear your and I'm going to represent the\nWebsite again Barbara for Congress dot com\nAre back to oppose sort of the deep state from getting on our information and there's been good at that as well\n[noise] well I just want to remind our listeners that\nEverybody knows that listens to me I was a vehemently opposed to Patriot Act one\nSon of the Patriot act when it's sunset it or you were a lonely\nVoice in the U.S Senate I remember you did the filibuster for sometime in opposing in questioning\nOr the ... the Patriot act you were right then you are right now I was right then I'm right now and just so my audience knows this whole Pfizer thing\nA with Carter Page and uh he's dropping the Trump campaign and the phone he finds that Warren none of that could have happened without the Patriot act that set that up\nAnd you were the one that said you keep covering giving government this unlimited power of surveillance and its eventually going to come around and bite you in the bud center that's exactly what happened\nI had the same very saying the conversation yesterday with record yes the odd because I asked him point blank argue gathering information including suppressing some calls and of course he fired arquette that's without setting\nAnd the answer for him I said the answer is yes there was an article about two or three years ago saying that they recorded Fifteen hundred of President Obama's\nCall [noise] and then they minimize him which means sort of markets bailout but how hard is it to tell when President Obama or President Trump was talking to a foreign leader your ear their voices [noise]\nEven if you lived or you know a parked out and you can't tell her the voices are but we shouldn't be doing that\nIt's not in my conversation and they're recording and then they're out there and then the FBI can search this database with our joggers Warren and my point to him was and I think he did not understand it or didn't understand it is if you're recording things on potential terrorists from overseeing the costs because it really apply\nBut if they're talking to American torture random people are talking to Americans we do get constitutional protections ... million on called our discussions with terrorists in fact the vast majority are innocent international phone calls\nAnd so we have had this discussion with them and uh it should be protected by the knocking back some say the Fourth Amendment like John Adams set of the spark that led to the revolution we didn't like the British soldiers coming into our houses you know breaking down the door and see if we paid our champ tax [noise]\nUh we really wanted protection that we wanted to say the government and never come to your house or take any private\nConversations are belongings without talking to a church first\nWell that's a that's why you were so adamantly opposed to when you were a predictor of the future with this whole thing senator\nYou've also been a very strong voice on the disappearance of juvenile to show the there's a lot of talk about what should be done and we want more information\nAnd like I get that but as a member of Foreign Relations committee you're the only senator that has proposed action which is until we get answers on his disappearance because\nThe thing is we haven't videotape showing that he went in there's nobody else have shown that he went out and I'm a crown prince NBS Mohammed bin Salman says the camera footage was corrupt or the battery went dead\nThey can't really only by that is like the dog ate my homework or I didn't get ever ... battery and so the battery died\nNow you have more in a meeting at suspension of ah the arms sales to the Saudis until we get some kind of a satisfactory answer can you elaborate on that ...\nI think everybody should remember that Saudi Arabia is the largest state sponsor of radical Islam around the world what I mean by that or they had been funding for mature authors in Pakistan and India needed a civil teams even in the United states\nTeaching hatred of the way through the Christianity and continue radical violent jihad just hear the Saudis are we shouldn't be selling a weapon simply because of drought\nQueen of the Nineteen hijackers who came here were from Saudi Arabia Saudi Arabia is a part of our terrorism problem they are gay funders of terrorism and teaching of radical Islam around the world this latest episode\nUh actually no way that this could have happened without cutting government being your dog to private planes with the guys on on some of them have been linked to Saudi security services and intelligence I'm now it doesn't pass the smell test and you know we just clean\nThat's the only thing they listen to in addition to them killing a journalist [noise]\nThere are many tens of thousands of civilians killed in Yemen they're doing it with our bombs when we're we feel when they're flying there\nAnd it fired and two weeks ago or three weeks ago the great they kill the school bus full of children school children were killed a year ago they killed a hundred and fifty people in a funeral procession\nAnd we wonder why someone in Yemen wants to drop a bomb on and kill a laser a salary or kill an American because they found the fragments of the bombs here say made in America\nAnd so we have to realize that reaction or something and and that's a blowback\nFrom us being involved in some Mr gotten civil war\nA is one that we actually create more terrorists but here's the other possible thing that's going to happen again or what happened in Libya when we toppled Gadhafi\nWe got chaos and more terrorism and became a breeding ground for terrorism my fear is that there is some remnants are fairly fairly strong runners operator India and we're not fighting them that were Mitchell are stricter\nCivil war between ... and the Saudis and also with Iranian influence as well the ... century kiosks\nAnd that you get the rise of al ... says the same thing that happened in Syria is that civil war that we got involved in the house you got the rise of ISIS\nWill actually uh the network that I go on June near a couple of about a month ago was reporting that al Qaida fighters were actually given safe haven 'em by the by the Saudi forces in Yemen in ... in in order to find who the so\nCalled this wouldn't you wouldn't be surprising because here that the Saudis support\nIn Syria they supported the Neuse River which is essentially an offshoot of al Qaeda so the Saudis are always poor people who hate America to go through a western ways and\nYet we kinda big arms deal the president took a job for creating jobs that's not something that we should be considering what we argue arms deals we need to be considering our national security not trying to have some sort of Keynesian job scope\nYou're on the John triggers radio network truck in the truth across America we're with Kentucky Senator Rand Paul Republicans on the Foreign Relations committee or he's been the strongest voice in the un center on how we react to the ... disappearance\nSo have you recommended this to the president\nCenter have you want to direct conversation remember a look then when I was a an original Trump supporter everybody knows day when it came down the escalator he campaigned on getting out of these entanglements not staying in the have you had to direct conversation with the president on how we should react to this\nNonsense for killing of the journalist um he does know my feelings are talking about once every week or two and we have our conversations are a generalized by\nUh he has the same instincts that idea that we've been out of the Afghan or to last\nSyria or that we should stay forever and yet he's surrounded by stay forever crowd and that's the real problem there I think the president's instincts are good I'm sort of in the crowd at what the credit and a bigger president right and yet the people surrounding him are\nThink God to offer and you know part of the traditional foreign policy around here which is go stay forever and bankrupt and\nSenator Paul the president has invested a lot of political capital in the Saudis and it was the first place then he went in his first foreign visit a MPs came to the United states you did as media\nTour within the Saudis spend a ton of money on media PR as you know uh in in in the swamp\nAnd so he's put a lot of uh and and you know we kind of looked the other way when NBS rounded people up jailed them in that hotel whatever they did\nA mystery ... has looked the other way is going to affect our relationship with the Saudis and my ... and tying it to that is it going to change the president's position on the Saudi ... book Fargo of the state of Qatar where we have our\nBiggest military base in the middle east [noise]\nYeah I'm not so sure it does change his mind he seems to be ...\nOn a continuing to sell our to Saudi Arabia I think Congress has also the same way they're going to put up some protests and say they object to the journalists being killed but uh [noise] there's there's billions of
