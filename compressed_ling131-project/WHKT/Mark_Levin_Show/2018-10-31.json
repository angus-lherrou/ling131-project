than we got these pipe bombs such crazy crazy people doing crazy things the fake news the Washington Post runs an editorial basically blaming Trump\nFor all of this number one what is your reaction to this\nTo me and you know I I Do want to give her little credit to some of the media outlets\nOver this weekend to call out the Washington Post on there disgusting not only their editorial but they're headline which appeared on Saturday morning playing little Trump or for the pipe bomb issues\nAnd your Chris Wallace from Fox News held up the new states where it was a it was the lead story on Saturday morning in Chris showed it on Sunday and that set your Trump supporter you know it's it's farming\nWhatever it was it to remain in return me\nBecause the trail of some of the members of the mainstream\nMedia who want to blame the president for things that he has nothing to do with I don't ever recall I don't I'm not trying to pass the buck up or diverge here but I don't ever recall them saying you know Bernie Sanders supporter motives down tries to kill to harden crude members of Congress\nAt a congressional baseball practice or you know you don't see that you didn't see and I'm disgusted by this\nBut the individual who committed these heinous\nCrimes at the synagogue or is it lets you have to make these crimes what the Trump anger you don't\nSee Democrats support our permits atrocity at synagogue as the headlines for the media wants to go after this president for all the wrong reasons they don't want to give them credit and then we are at some level we're ... for the headlines and the editorials that states branch\nOf driving a narrative which has a victory all against the president and and it's shameful and they need to be held accountable to and I hope it's American people do that\nWell I'm not sure if they will but look I go to those press conferences as you know I'm a White House correspondent\nI was there yesterday and the questions you get from some of the media the fake news media and the front row especially CNN it's just it's just ridiculous and um that's just part of the problem is out of ten questions you're going to get three that are legitimate all the others are just too embarrassed to president or show something out\nOr some other such nonsense um now you have the bombings a pipe bomb a\nCrazy guy that got arrested you had a horrible shooting in the synagogue is you know the president and the first lady going in Pittsburgh today this the right thing to do a lot of people telling me look this has slowed the Republicans I met some down that people are now\nThe Mets and the Republicans of that is true or\nNot it it's false as a matter of fact our country is going to become stronger after\nA national tragedy it always does and what I have called for and I said this last week and I said again is we need to be able to disagree with each other but not be disagreeable the president is the console er and chief he and the\nFirst lady as well as his daughter and son in law who happened to both the Jewish are going to Pittsburgh today to be part of the the comforting\nProcess for those families who are impacted by this in the nation as a whole we can never tolerate this but this is where the president is his strongest when he sees something that is wrong he doesn't look at Republican or Democrat independent black white yellow green it doesn't matter he just wants to fix it and what took\nPlace in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania was horrific display of atrocity is anti Semitism which will never be tolerated by anyone in this country should never be tolerated by anyone in this country and this presents going to go there and remind the world of why we're the greatest country we are going to unite when tragedy happened\nHe was going to be a he is the president of everybody in this country and toning down their rhetoric\nIs important we have a very important are watching and seven days but no one election his work what is taking place in a she was like that synagogue or attempting to have quite farms kill elected a former\nElected officials were the greatest country in the world were not up the mantle republic we need to understand that we are better when we are stronger and we are together and that's the president's going to talk about um Pittsburgh\nWhere it was horrible and now the senior advisor for the vice president's lashing out great American whether you get more information or just go to great America committee dot com Corey I've got about\nOr the president in an interview with actually as we understand last night said that he is ready to do an executive order to stop a birthright citizenship see her baby ID A lot of lot of us have been saying that's one of the biggest problems we have an immigration website you\nAt it is an issue with immigration are unfortunately I don't think the president has the legal authorities are assumed to amend the constitution the United states and what will happen is\nMy guest enrolled was exactly what took place when he issued other executive orders is a sort of a court is going to step in and they're going to stay on it immediately will ensure the White House has already thought through what the legal challenges are going to be this and ultimately this is going to end up\nBeing litigated at the Supreme Court at the highest levels of the land and they're going to make a decision but that decision will not be reached in the next seven days or credit all the return next three months but the president and his team a White House counsel et cetera believes that there is a cork in the amendments that says that\nThey the individual born here are subjected to the laws of of the country that they're in and there was a quirk there that says these people with your illegally so they're not given citizenship through birthright and that's what I think they're going to litigate in the court system\nMy guest or local state's predominantly a federal judge in this will make\nOr break for [noise] [noise] [noise] right All right I think that's exactly it we've got seven days or want to thank you for being with us thank you so

potentially\nEighty one hundred seats it would be a likes this team and thousand ten with aggressive just waste your Congress then we went to sixty they want to see a similar to forty journals on your show I think three or four weeks ago we talked about thirty five to forty we now down to twenty five it's a very narrow very narrow case\nSize that has to uh uh the Republicans are prepared to go through but it's tough when it's over his house represents that result in Virginia in your audience his rights and they love it you know that Barbara Comstock terror alert he's got brass needs\nThose three and we're going to know psychologically you earned over ... I think the polls Virginia close at seven o'clock right so we're going to do very early in the evenings and sickly some tell whether it's which are going to be ... brass and Taylor\nWe're going to know and I can't have a real feel for this is going to go but I've seen those results from those congressional districts you know all of them are tight and that's why every vote is going to San jose and what's your heritage is if you do support the program\nAnd he just had the job creators network which is a terrific organization I'm very well has the has the thing about the San jose run for it to get involved and you know the brats\nTaylor complex all these congressman or have an interest groups around the world around caring for people run a false thanks to people about putting down

know they don't like saying it's teaching them because they know what drives us to Trump's base was there you know sharing the Adler\nHe's already said he's going to take over the Judiciary Committee

your friends don't take your neighbors don't take your colleagues are\nOut the vote on the on the sex but if you like the Trump programs do you like what you see a sudden you've got to do it and so I

stop that cycle will towards zero tolerance or\nA zero tolerance policy but it's clear I think it highlights\nThe issues we had was illegal immigration issues we have with even with legal immigration\nAnd I think President Trump says no court front up getting controlled is just so out of control system right now the United states in the you know I think it's also going to you know really uh it's Trump's going to demand from the Republicans when it comes to act that we got us in Studio appropriations process started quit so getting around you know as Trump says no more games and\nFocus on building as well so I think that's how it plays a selection is is I think really kind of the size of point of a it's a national emergency for our country and I think President Trump showing\nLeadership in I Would hope that would advocate each\nGo to the borders this weekend I Would love to see him go down there and lay out his someplace metallic taxes on the way up his principles

there's a constitutional amendment in the United states basically says if you are born in the United states regardless of the circumstance\nYou're a U.S citizen so this is what we call what is what this has turned into is aggravating so all you have to do was get to the United states and have a baby you just try to get in your even if you're pregnant\nWhen you're getting here you've got to just get to the U.S and have a child and as soon as a child\nIs first comes out of your home and it's worse than that child is a citizen of the United states that becomes an anchor the parents should be illegals it doesn't matter as soon as a child is born there a citizen of the United states back\nThat's in the constitution\nBut this is actually pointed and it's called anchor babies because I'm a legal or illegal we come to the United states where do you are legally we should be or we drugs for walks\nWe have a baby now because of the baby they can't take the baby from the parents so you can't

of crazy stuff like getting rid of the second amendment so I'm In no uh\nI had no way in favor of any constitutional convention because you don't know where it ends up and so I'm not in favor of what I Am in\nOf though is just executive order because there is a loophole and it's going to end up in the Supreme Court and then you're going to find out at sea Kavanaugh's bike was worth it or not first right citizenship for the U.S is just no longer makes any sense\nWhat is being exploited by illegal aliens who break the law it's just being is what it was in there for a reason that reason is passed it was in the Eighteen hundreds of God there's a loophole and there was a roof over there for a reason that loophole was\nPut there that warning was put there for a reason that the reason was something like this so it's going to be it's it's going to be an executive order others\nGoing to be five judges that immediately stop it just got to be a state's gonna get argued up the court system it's going to go to the Supreme Court and they're going to decide that basically you're going to need five chores to say yes this wording that was in there was in the air it's changed a\n... there has to be an exception I think sanctions you got to be for illegal aliens or maybe just tickets logically you broke the law and again in the country you're here illegally or a lawbreaker and now the incentive\nIs to have a baby the baby is a citizen and then you're going to be a citizen and then all your family could come over and they can all be citizens and\nYou don't even have to have a job you know you'd have to work now how does that make sense it's illogical he'll logical that this was an issue that I bet\nIt's MORNING in the states do you think they should be a citizen Oh yes ...

an authorized by America First policies incorporated\nAmerica First policies in corporate joining us now a senior advisor to American first policy action former sheriff of Milwaukee County sheriff David Clarke sheriff Clarke great to have you back ...\nCloser to be with you and your listeners once again\nSheriffs so many topics so little time right six days before the image of let's get right to some of the big issues okay let's start with the caravan this job\nGriffith jackets is reporting a last night that a Mexican states reportedly providing charter buses to drive\nThe migrants faster to the border so they can't get here before the election on Monday and Bobby Rush the border jak you're saying and showing photos that the ten thousand strong migrant caravan is now being shorter boss to the u._s.\nFor a jacket showed multiple professional boxer allied outfit and boarding migrants take them to the border so they could get there before the midterms why does going out who is paying for this\nWell first of all this abuse at our southern border has got to stop I Believe these reports that are coming out of this has been a political and voice from the beginning of this has been a political construct a in time\nFor the November six election this president has made it very clear he has to remain for protecting the southern border from this trespassing this was an eastern or southern border it's a national security threat I think the president is handling\nThis ah the just the way you should\nHe's working with these other governments Mexican Mexican\nGovernment or Guatemala Honduras he's looking at all these options and that's what he should be doing that's what an executive does that was an executive position as a share of electrical Milwaukee County when people ask me what should the president do hotel nobody should tell the president wants to do what what is it wise to do is give\nHim options three or four policy options given all the information and say nearly three or four things that you could consider Mr President here are the pluses of those things here at the minuses and the president alone as to make this decision and that's what's going to\nHappen so I'm putting my trust him I said in the decision of president Donald Trump he is or not let us down before this decision making I think he's going to win this thing again\nArt sheriff Clarke so ah what the president also sending five thousand troops to the border your share a pharmacy or you were in law enforcement there very long time sheriff Clarke so we got five thousand troops or to the border twenty two hundred national guardsmen going to the border plus we have our\nOwn border patrol what did they get there what's the thing too like how do they stop ten thousand people from just coming in and what exactly are they going to do why are they there how do they start yeah my question is how do they stop it\nYou know that's an interesting uh an interesting question first of all the storm the border that's an invasion and I'm not going to set up here and say that the military should should fire on them so on and so for those decisions of the commanders\nWill make but the fact is you cannot you illegally enter the United states do not have a right to come into the United states they can request to come in through asylum but they're violated all the principles of asylum anyone he declared\nAsylum in Mexico they weren't interested because it's the political or construct sold remains to be seen what they will do oh I've heard a couple of things mentioned they'll set up some tent cities or you know entertain them until their their immigration\nThere's no doubt in my mind that there are some activists storage will probably already has the stay written out uh the the the pros illegal immigration folks on the less we'll run the record and just some judge some activists\nJudge probably in the Ninth Circuit to say that the president can't do this can stop can't set up tent cities ancillary\nMen and I think it's at a point a push us to come to show because that's an intrusion upon the violation of the separation of Powers Act I think it's an intrusion on the authority under the constitution at the president has in these situations so I figured this president\nHas shown that I think he by by throwing out yesterday or a potential into\nBusiness or the tanker baby situation is birthright citizenship equal to push the issue has\nTo push push the issue because nobody else well this is the fault of Congress John you know the right this is the fault of Congress's\nInability or the will to fix this broken immigration system so this is what we have but the president does have some options but I think what he's trying to do is he's trying to force Congress to act\nOn this thing so he'll throw some things author make the court to get involved make Congress getting bothered maybe find it will get some action on this but I think that if at some point if the court strict continue to intrude on the executive authority under the constitution I think the president has to push back I don't know how that will be\nIn one form that will take but I think he has to push back\nSo the the er\nPresident yesterday sheriff David Carr so former sheriff of Milwaukee County sheriff Clarke the president yesterday saying look this birthright citizenship\nThing makes no sense a lot of people I've been saying that because if you end up with her babies now we've got hotel we we've got a whole cottage industry of the legal companies uh\nOn the west coast basically pay income to the United states to that get put in a\nHotel in hidden you have a baby and that becomes an egg or maybe it makes no sense what the president says I'm going to do an executive order because there is an opening in the fourteenth amendment\nNow we know that's got to get overturned immediately by the dice district in Hawaii and everything else but uh that's good as I've gotten Supreme Court what do you think if if if you talk to an average\nPeople um where do you think this is going to fall politically do you think average as Americans are going to say yeah it's a good idea to aggravate me to make themselves or you think you're going to say no I don't want to mess with the fourteenth amendment or that's the constitution that's who we are how do you think it'll fall\nWell this anchor baby saying there's birthright citizenship just part of the views All right and so this has to be rectified so there's a lot of moving parts in the illegal immigration thing and so he's just taking these one thing one at a time because you have\nTo solve the whole thing you can't just take one thing and say well we'll fix this will be okay because there won't be okay this is the use of our immigration system the anchor baby such a way some people will be on the side of the American people will be on the side of the president listen\nBorder border wall so on and so forth um pools heavily in favor of the president's last one I saw nearly Seventy percent of the people want to southern for to secure the ends\nOf the sanctuary cities they want an end to illegal immigration so I think the politics of it he's going to be spot on the American people will be on the side of things things take time for them to work their way through the American public and so I don't know if the anchor babies they\nImpact on next Tuesday but I Know that in the long run this president as co sports Congress to sue them jobs while they're not\nQuestion about
