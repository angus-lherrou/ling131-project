Iraq so it's it's that kind of procedural stuff that's just search for why how could that happen\nBut I Would argue that\nYou know sticking with the logic of systems ... Manuel is the way to make sure that your debate\nOn track to make sure you don't have a lot of that are related to the doctor a piece of legislation people go or how did that get in there or it's like you know crawling everything on the last train leaving the snake shows like all that stuff doesn't doesn't belong there are not related to viewers\nYou know as the as old as a vehicle to pass things that aren't aren't related so I I agree and that's that's one of the I think the problems up here is that it doesn't it doesn't require that necessarily pay the clubs piracy when you're using that mechanism when you have on related or aspects\nOf legislation or language to bill or people will just you know look at it and go how how could that happen\nWell I Hope you all will take a look at some of the rules and get more to wherever coverage in your way of governing up in the city because I I one of the things that are when you pull back from politics and and watch sports people get upset\nWhen they see rules violations because they know the rules right you mean last night there was a he has just in Berlin or through as a wider was\nBeautiful water that you and and Ron Darling you're the pitcher for the Mets and the other teams that that is a pitch you when you are warming up to you put your Mitt down and say grab Patel I'm drawing a perfect pitch and it was it was called the fall and the next pitch the Boston Red Sox guy\nHit at Pearl home run and as far as I'm saying you go that's outrageous only because the the the teleprompter had on there and the strike zone\nWhat happens in people in in politics people got they don't know the rules to get upset about that's just not cricket you're not doing it the right way guys you know we deserve better and so they pulled back your eyes just the city they shrugged their shoulders and throw your hands\nYou know it's just it's just not working I'm On my behalf you know I I don't get it right in the distance and or anything you can do to to to change that would be for the benefit ended my rent let's get back to the absolute let's get back to the national district what what are your voters telling you\nWell you know we're hearing a lot of ... well I think Chris Locklear very interested in how to win\nA continual um increase in our economy I think people are are very positive out where the hotter style I think they appreciate what's called by Congress lessening regulatory burden changing the tax code\nOf some of her business his whole but the things that they\nWant to see going forward or what I call the stinging park so many comedy and first of all those who knows how much system that assures that our children students get the loss of surgery or educational experience to want to\nAdopt or seven point one million new jobs open gay Christ\nAnd Seventy five percent of those jobs will not require a four year degree and that means we have to emphasize career and technical education as much as we do construct education because that's where the jobs are at those jobs today are skilled jobs that have occurred as far as her career\nWhen you go from an apprentice your journey to a pastor and have a career there scarred well in many instances better than you wrote\nHim a job that requires a\nCollege degree so I think people look at that and say that's where we have to go here and so looking on the Glenn how it's going to make sure that my child is soft on like how to make sure the education system gives them that knowledge skills abilities to compete for the jobs that are available today entered the church and and I think they will say look at it and\nSay hey the other things to me how to be going really well of course when I talked to some sort of\nAcross the district I can tell\nYou the top three things they talk to me about our workforce workforce and workforce or you know they say we could grow up business to a point I just find workers to do the job was you know there are more job openings goes into our people to build the job openings so we're going to happen here but I'm not going to happen in one other element to this article\nIs brought ability for people to come\nBack is important on such a court of education so that quite a lot of ups for families children go to school in the Catholic or is it going down how well they can't connect which is hard for duty assignments that they've been given or the\nSoap operas or equal take one of the library bottles wife by business\nIs only ... areas that don't have\nHigh speed can't do the business they needed to be successful and her one of the ways to bring in a while\nYou can't connect with patients without going to go to an office ... miles and miles away and can get care and quality of game change right so we really what brought on the maturity of education system emphasizes Korean talking legislation as much as that goes college truck education\nAnd these are these are these are the tough issues because people don't go broadband workforce development those those don't get the people out to the\nPolls and they're just like that that makes sense I like that because when people get down into the the granular already talked about with other\nCallers that I mean politics in the garbage complex and people don't like complex there like fiber bumper stickers because they're pretty busy trying to make their lives working and putting that into the context of their daily lives come out and vote whichever way is a tall order for a lot of politicians right\nSure [noise]\nThe policy and complicated it takes time of loss halt her to offer for anybody anybody in the social whether a lecturer op housing office tower so ... and you know those\nThings that I really just hang out here\nFor or something like that I come up with some people say\nHey let's just hope and yes they\nCompete soundbites waves help our economy the thrill down is okay we want to help you could always said All right you can talk about the last I don't think people are uncomfortable I don't want to go into that office or asking\nFor people to stop things I found that is quite close\nTo an ACC that's great but what people want to hear to\nWork if I'm going to play softball here again what are you going to do in the future how do you want things to eat on\nWhat are you going to do to accomplish that what do you what you want to come back to us or if you are we allowed as you approach the power of the things on a home but I was able to accomplish\nAnd and I just don't want that they want you to understand what support they want you to project location for the future about how they're still got to be addressed so it's not just on the list dot it's what are you going to collect a lot of people's concerns about the challenges facing your all such\nAs I tell people Ortiz is all the time I was talking politics is about the future not too bad it is\nAnd you can like look what happened to various the economy is great you know unemployment is historically low and they just threw out the government pretty much there's some there's some there's some under two currents that you just have to go out there and pound doors you understand and listen to people\nBecause the elections are about tomorrow night yesterday that seems awfully right Rob I really appreciate your calling in today we wish you the best out there and the campaign trail you got what Eighteen days left\nEighteen days left for everybody because we've only got four hundred and Seventy two days to the Iowa caucuses that there isn't that fun [laughter] I Know it at all\nThey're already out there are already out there getting their campaign strategist wind up never ends Virginia's that\nWas for people offer themselves up for public service regardless of party we thank you Rob thanks for calling it will be joined by Dr Robyn Wilder school joined us\nAnd one nominating convention in their hypothetical would have done better than some people anticipated certainly did in the last ... primary does that make him viable going forward because people\nSay well he's got a built in base of support in the party and has to be reckoned with or what people say you had your chance on the stage and you've lost several\nTimes so a lot of times the exits great\nQuestion Julian um central calling and I would suggest that it is dependent upon how well he actually\nDoes relative to the national spreads\nAnd the Virginia I'm nor does I think that the north some race last year was a point that's a big number if you're a Republican especially because three years before that that Gillespie got within the hairs breath and feeding more corn I\nThink if he's in double digit losses very difficult for him to to ah to run again a statewide but who knows I Do think the Republican Party is going to be going through some changes are going to look at some soul searching after this election you know um\nAnd there'll be looking at at new directions new candidates or to to go forward I don't know how\nMuch staying power Korea would have\nWith a double digit wash and I'll just after three statewide offices thanks for calling it\nThe other questions you know sir\nHave a good thanks man hey uh NBA what do you when you you you like to have the warriors\n\nPosition if anybody by civil war [laughter] the throne golden stays in the in the finals or the playoffs\nWhat's got to be one of a couple of the Boston Celtics looking pretty good\nWho else in the west gap\nBoston most people will see what happens with the rockets that they can integrate their new pieces including Carmelo Anthony or a lot of people are\nDown on 'em there's a reason for that not very good what you've ever\nPay less than I think has shortcomings but I think a sort of moving up in\nA recent bias overlooks a a pretty pretty impressive tenure in the league or despite some of his uh his recent a sort of downgrade enhanced\nIn his game so we'll see you know as as you know I got from Philadelphia connection so I've always got a soft spot in my heart for the Sixers I I'm not sure if they're quite ready to make the leap but we'll see other than\nAnybody by the warriors and stuff I I\nLiked the Sixers we used to have a song in a in in college hey Philadelphia five six seven so if you're Seventy six or something like that we also used to dance each other's shoulders some sort of ingrained and in Seventy Sixers\nYou're used to say OK as a doctor McDougal patiently waiting for us Yes sir I\nAm very you know are you Robert yes\nI Am happy to the late ... birthday by one day [laughter]\nStores are still open\nI exactly I I Will make sure that I make my you know purchase and get it you know drop to your doorstep eight

that publicly traded\nThe mixed cardboard boxes that Amazon buys by that stock because we have so much cardboard box in her garage backed up with what we're we're right there with you I'm sure\nSo Dr Robert ... is with the Virginia Commonwealth University ... Wilder school does briefly about the water school what youre doing\nYes Israel where we're at school of government and public affairs\nAt UC here I'm raising the top fifty in US News and World Report for schools the public affairs he's got for undergraduate and graduate programs focused on criminal justice homeland security and emergency preparedness public administration as well\nPrograms and the master's level and urban and regional planning and a PHD program and public policy and then we also have our Center for public policy which I direct which is our consulting and community engagement arms of the work we do in the wild or schools that you will see a lot of things around\nEconomic develop a leadership in training look when the government outreach and things like public policy polling that we deal with in the center for public policy in a while there's full\nWell going we're coming up pulling real quick but you guys actually go out and work with other local governments and businesses that you helped him not just I think people don't understand that about higher education the value that you bring to the community and the stakes yes\nWe really do I mean we're done\nEverything from helping that localities looking at potentially providing incentives for certain business to come into their community and doing a return on investment of what that economic impact would look like on the proposal stage with regard to incentive then come back and provided them that actual economic impact\nIf they went forward with a business and the impact that it had on the community with everything from revenue to job creation other aspects and that way out we've done\nValuations of um you know criminal justice programs here the implementation of a mental health program or a drug treatment program on reducing recidivism for a local jail or or or\nA community partner we worked with a non profit from everything from there are ways terms of the programs in projects that they view to our federal court dating and combining the\nActual help that they need with regards to our students and our staff or with in their community programs and then we've done some work with the public sector and private sector as well and the business community are looking at a third party evaluations of programs in projects for the private sector looking to pitch to the general assembly and eat it\nBeing able to provide that report for that company for the general assembly to look at legislative into so we do we are continual partner\nEvery single day with our local and state governments around the commonwealth um and it it really is what we live and breathe in the wild or school specifically um we do it at a much more\nCost effective rate than our private sector\nCounterparts if you are because it really is our mission our vision and it allows that could bring that there are\nAcademic experts he says well within the Wilder school you know we have over thirty academic staff who this is their area of expertise and you want to talk about the economic impact I've got four economists in urban and regional planning program or you want to talk about the impact\nOf an opiate programs a treatment program I've got two criminals that says a academically that's their area of expertise and they get asked all around the country to look at present their research and were able to bring that expertise sit there for our localities in the commonwealth in Virginia\nSo whether you're a full service higher education school let me we are we are\nYou know we we provide at all give us your education for freshman in college\nThrough graduate school and teach you program give us your workers that we will train them in executive leadership and made a bet preparations give us your legislators and you're a lobbyist and we will train them and policy analysis for the impact\nOf a variety of legislation and give us your community that will help come up with good solutions and then give you the evaluation of the impact on the show that we really are\nUm the one stop all encompassing education and consulting academic arm for a local and state government and our our citizens and the students around the block\nAnd that's why I brought it up and we'll go to the polling that you're with your operations down there because I think it's so important for people to understand the totality of a lot of\nThings that governments especially heritage which has a ... on his back around the country but in Virginia we've got a great higher education system we really need to be proud of it even though it's you know it's it's appropriate to hold them accountable tough questions but a lot of things you're talking about are free\nAnd they are exclusive of usual operations and they are a complementary to what you are doing and actually facilitate what you were doing in higher education I think it's wonderful I think it's misunderstood not understand at all but most jumping to some polling uh that the Wilder school has done what are you sitting out there or what have you seen what's direction are we going\nTo talk a little bit like Clinton on earlier so let's talk about policy and and pulling and public policy that we did on this summer we were out in July we'll have another call right here after the election in November but in our in our public policy you talked about higher\nEd so let's talk about that for a second when we look at it we surveyed over eight hundred for unions around the entire commonwealth a true representative sample of all five Reagan's um of our commonwealth and when we look at and ask people what they think about the value of higher education in Virginia over eighty percent\nWork their costs over sixty five percent believe that our public four year institutions are worth the cost and then right under fifty percent believe that our private schools and the comment about the worst of the car so it's really important that you said that question around\nDown in Virginia we value higher education and not only did we value it but we're putting out a product that citizens around the common law is age appropriate return on investment they believe that the cost that we have for higher education and forgive me I think everyone can talk about costs in general for higher\n[noise]\n[noise]\nThere's this hour from town all dot com [noise] I'm wrong derived from President Trump says she only for the United states from the international\nRange nuclear forces treaty

which is actually I ran into a [laughter]\nGerman political teacher who weekend fancy that right you're going to exchange program I didn't want to go to the vet and like I'm not talking about like I really don't want to go somewhere much football I Want to chill out Sunday night it was a great game on Bob oh go you'll have fun okay find some sort of just two German teachers\nTrying to have a conversation and thinking I don't know any German right what are you gonna do ... you know you have all the [laughter] house Hitler you know [laughter] you know ... where do you go with that conversation well it turns out they speak beautiful English and he probably better than than we do structurally\nAnd um and I and I said so who how are the electricity in Bavaria because they're very they're lectures on Sunday it was a very important election in Germany\nAnd that's the kind of guy and that's what I followed and well this one teacher was a teacher of politics so then we went down a rabbit hole two hours later at the dinner table we just we're just we're chewing up politics\nAnd when he was telling me about the very was is that is extremely successful economically it is the richest region of Germany for full employment like three percent unemployment youth unemployment is extremely low\nOr their school system is set up to get people to work straight away um if if you're like a tenth grade and you're not you don't really want to go to university you don't have to take it to make it you can go right into a a a trade school with apprentice program and you're gonna get a job and you get a diploma so they get um really it's a very work intensive area they\nThey pride themselves culturally on work and productivity an organization and good government\nRight there it was like a it's not like a shining example of how you would want to have a state where a region actually be everyone's employed and has a job\nYou have any functions ah and it works well they had this major upset in the very end election Neal what are you upset about what what could you possibly be that concerned about\nThat you basically blow up this I don't know if they blow it up but how does major upset in the ruling party that had been has been in control\nFor decades last probably the ... the ruling majority in Bavaria and it was stunning to me to realize that we're not immune from that here and here in America so people say\nYou know the economy Republicans are the economy's going so great vote for us\nPeople don't vote on yesterday's news they don't vote on today's news\nThey vote on the future where are we doing where what is going to be happening that's my fear that's my concern because things are going well you know with Donald Trump got elected gasoline was about two twenty five a gallon now it's around two eighty a two thousand eight was four dollars a gallon or better but are we getting better are we getting worse\nGrowth and that has a factor on the human psyche about how how's it going manifested itself in my life you see these commercials they're not all about you know skills and here's my dad says there about this guy's awful she's horrible their ... but there's no big overriding issue like\nHere's what we're going to do in the future it's just that the other person's really bad therefore they're not going to be good for you um and therefore because the economy's going so well they're gonna hurt the economy I guess this is what the extra Appalachian isn't the subconscious\nBut I'm going what is the big driving issue other then obviously Donald Trump and it's a fascinating time in American politics or one of reasons why do I do because it's so interesting but also to teach people as I used to tell my students\nI really don't care I'm really don't care [laughter] what you think I care that you think\nIf I can encourage people to be more interested about what they're talking about to read another article to dig deeper to challenge themselves\nThey will in turn create a better outcome for the rest of us and I tell my students I don't care who you vote for I just care that you vote but if you don't vote I understand that's also a vote in itself because you were saying I'm not I'm not doing this I vote none of the above\nAnd it's and that's and that's fabulous and it'll aggregate itself just like the boat will and that people do that doesn't make any sense\nActually it does if you don't show up for something the two political parties going to try to get you to show up next time we're trying to reach out to you in some way shape or form that data point will register I tell us through a of a family I was at a baseball game\nAnd they were so upset or I just can't stand voting and I did not vote\nIf they haven't earned your vote don't vote and tell them that you don't\nIt on social media like he would anyone else anything else say I'm not voting you haven't earned\nMy vote you haven't got me off my couch off my dogs to go down and say I'm voting for this person you don't register it'll aggregate data\nAnd that raw data collects and is dissected by the political class to determine what they want to do um and there and that's an ... swings on the undecided voter right the independent voter in October is like oh we're going to\nStop talking about these issues that motivate our base to a degree we're going to focus on these\nOh I'm really happy to work with the other side received is now in certain cats I work with the president why shows up at the polling independence they've been out like President Trump but when they agree with something you'd better work with him to get 'cause that's just you know all politics is personal not just walk anyway this is Chris action and filling in for John\nFedEx if you tuned in to hear me drawing on\nAbout politics me going is this guy a I'm a former member of the house of delegates I'm filling in for John ... as I Am wants to do a as John is on vacation with his son down in Florida in a baseball tournament a John is a baseball fan probably looking as well but he was a pitcher in college and his son Joe Joes a picture\nOf you want to call and ask me some questions love to hear from you eight eight eight four five six four six eight eight four to five six four six eight eight eight for eight oh five six for six or you can taxidermy straight away five four zero to nine four zero six eight zero\nI'm going to have some great experts on later today quaint and can't CRISPR Newport Jack was simply Republican Party with congressman Rob Wittman\nA doctor Robin McDougal from the Virginia Commonwealth University of while their school and Jesse Harris from Iowa who is a political operative and that was on the Democratic side in from the Republican side from New Hampshire will hear from identity\nAnd Susan slacker or my good friend from the Central Valley uh we're I'm no citizen for you know gosh early nineties I think\nWhen I started aging yourself there's there isn't\nA Democrat a chair a chair of the Democratic party Virginia\nIs from highland county to county I used to represent\nAnd they've known citizen for for decades and so we have we have a great friendship and I and I'm looking forward to having all these callers calling today\nStir up the conversation a little bit go a little deeper we're going deeper today in politics we're going to go deeper dive in not just you know the polling the top one numbers but how those posters got to those numbers who are they listening to who are they calling why are they calling because it's a very different\nWhen a university does a polling like CRISPR Newport you'll hear Clinton should talk about this they start with a very broad universe um and it keeps coming down to a smaller University of actual likely voters\nMinutes and we'll get\nTo that we're getting to the nitty gritty will be able to get you take you do a deeper dive so when you look at the polls when you go to real clear politics which which I spend unfortunately way too much time on 'em but I guess it's healthier than other websites right [laughter]\nThis is a healthy Internet\nAh it's it's a a ... you look at these different polls and and you got like let's just take a look at the uh\nThe polls on a generic ballot it's insane what uh what what we're looking at here hold up its it's fascinating like generic ballot follow this truck plus Democrats ... Democrats plus five Democrats plus eleven\nDemocrats plus eleventh Democrats plus one what how do you get there did you say the polling is wrong well poems always right it's just data you're collecting other people call\nWhat the differences isn't the methodologies who you're going I talked to one leading I'm democratic\nSource and I said okay what's your polling showing me he said\nDemocrats are around mid low thirties thirty four thirty three percent certainty that range Republicans we've never seen the self identification for Republicans is while it's around twenty four percent and what used to be you know thirty four thirty four is now thirty four twenty four and independents are up around\nThe world have been forties he goes Republicans have never been lower on self identification but we haven't picked up any of those voters they're all self identifying now as independents\nThat is huge\nAnd when you get down to it with people when they understand what's really going on that's when they get more exciting more engaged this is Chris X. men selling for John Frederick it eight four five six for six states it would come on back\nIt said you know happy birthday I have a beer you know put a picture of his numbers have her brother with this with the Budweiser so I'm just reminded me so much to my friendship and I'm a black how blessed I was to have it in my life but also\nA what a what a blessing and it's just to be alive right to be able to ah just to be experience at all and I'm Wondering is I I enjoy coming in during his radio show where they get to hopefully get people excited about politics I'm against it does govern their lives it is important\nYou know we can't break down we have to work with each other or to get good things that we should have the debate though we should have a vibrant vigorous debate that right moves the country forward um and we shouldn't be afraid to have that debate but we should have in a in a civil manner and I think today we see it or a lack of civility more and more and that's difficult\nIn my professional life I Am the executive director Virginia freed the foundation for research in economic education and uh uh we're following the three see sex and were nonpartisan which is a great lane to be in these days because everyone is\nYou know red or blue and I'm like okay for you well you know aren't you might not really I don't have to be actually I'm paid\nNachos [laughter] they've been battered right oh yeah they get healthcare so [laughter]\nWhat was it was we represent businesses and ah we have membership and we tried to do is educate them on politics and as a former teacher and a former business person in my family had a bottle of water business for years old a couple of years ago a blessing like\nUm\nYou know I I like getting people excited about learning about politics seeing it differently and what's that makes me there was on an even deeper like you know when you when you go to teach a subject you better than other subjects you have to really get engaged in the subject so it's an every day I get to learn more and more about politics it's\nIt's a it's a deep interesting topic because it brings in culture and a economics and history and I was a history major\nAnd so I I get to bring out altogether because it manifest itself is Andrew Breitbart said the last ... last segment you culture is down politics downstream of culture so if you want to impact culture or their politics impact culture first and foremost Saffir culturally don't\nLeader you'll be you'll be a political leader give us a call it eight four five six for six we got some great guest calling in today are not just constant Rob Wittman but also the leaders of the two major parties here in Virginia posters quaint and kid and Robin McDougal\nAnd then two operatives one from Iowa and one from New Hampshire we're only I hate to say this because you're probably second tier the elections already the midterms we are four hundred and Seventy two days away from the Iowa\nCaucuses\nHundred and Seventy two now it seems like a long time but let's be honest as soon as this election is over you're going to start hearing reports back from Iowa and New Hampshire and we're going to be at the forefront of that we're going to get calls and you're going to shoot up with with uh some operatives their Republican and Democrats\nTo see what's going on the ground I think Trump's got the lock on the nomination you never know\nYou never know you never know goodness knows you never know what Donald Trump because I'm ... that that's that's who knows who's actually does what he says it says you can do but you never know what's going to happen around it and I think that's one of the more interesting parts about politics today is because he's\n... days in school or or at work you know when the leader changes and it's like a substitute teacher what's this going to be like your\nYou know you get you get a new bars or whether it's a it's there's just a newness and from\nSince June fifteenth of twenty Fifteen this has been a very different political dynamic are not necessarily unhealthy because it has made us think and react differently and respond differently and I don't think that's necessarily on healthy\nAh but we do have you ever vigilant to make sure it does not become too unhealthy and I think people are recognizing that we have\nAh some some discourse in this country\nOr that can be improved we can get better at that as a people and how we do that is every day one on one with each other if you want to impact politics if you want better representation be better people sort of comes down to um they represent us and if you want them to be better it's up to us to be better\nSo let's call it in a four five six for six we'll talk about polls goodness knows was more polls and I don't know what to do with these days the generic ballot what I pay attention to first and foremost that's what I check every day\nI'm On the real clear politics they give you the um average of all the different polls and they break down to the individual polls\nI'm now post should be looking at what are called Elvis likely voters holding company should have an understanding of\nWho they imagine her going to be showing up on election they should have a pretty good handle on that main battling began in Virginia about a month ago so that we should know who's actually voting I'm In Virginia in or you can always tell the Arlington because they're the tabulation their uh their absentee ballots some friends of mine who are tracking that to see what kind of\nA who's voting relative to the last round of elections to see what the intensity is\nWhen you look at the er the averages of the generic ballot them and this is why I Do this is why I Do that\nIn my twenties Seventeen when governor Ralph Northam defeated at Gillespie he won by eight point nine three percent a point nine three points the generic ballot on that day was nine point one if I'm trying to instruct\nThe class what do you want to follow\nFox News Reuters Rasmussen CNBC Emerson Maris Quinnipiac\nWilder pool poll a Christian Newport which one do you follow follow generic ballot right now because that that is fairly proximate to what happened last year and the year before and twenty sixteen\nIf you look the generic ballot in twenty sixteen\nIt was very close it was like Todd and Republicans over performed on election day by about a point and they won an engineer congressional ballot I'm obviously Trump lost by about three points a nationally three million votes um so that's something to consider when you're saying okay where is this going to go I think\nI think the the objective view here is look at the generic ballot look at the average and you can pretty much extrapolate where it is right now\nIf election they were held today and because it's on that basis it it takes away the the partisan lines you might have or a would be inclined to it\nThey point nine that's very close and they are at seven point six right now it is safe to assume that they will not perform as well as they did in twenty Seventeen but still will win and likely when the house of representatives given the the dynamics in the Senate very different because the individual races\nLikely that Republicans a hold on to the Senate what's the dynamic that if the Democrats have a house\nAnd the senator that Republicans have the Senate\nWhat's going to have the next two years and that's how you can sort of figure out\nWhere this thing is going so that you can understand what you need to do or not they like myself I don't watch cable news I don't watch broadcast news every papers in the morning Washington Post Richmond Times Wall Street journal and I get mine on information what's going on in the economy and politics and culture and whatnot\nAnd then leave it alone don't listen to\nYou know the the uh the national\nTalk radio shows I go to work right yeah I I thought it was my eyes I see what's going on and I think most voters do that if you look at the aggregate numbers of\nYou know the Fox news of the world and the MSNBC it's a very small subset of the American population but they're the they're the most active\nVoters they are the ... that the activists so those shows are pretty much you're broadcasting to the activists about what they want to hear about the all the messaging points that they're they they they're supposed to repeat so when you watch it when you go to Facebook\nOr Twitter or snap chatter Instagram or whatever they're very different social media platforms you see the replica the repetition of the message and you're like wow I I go to a town hall after I got like a congressional town all my friends you know if there is now in Congress the receipt made some I\nI watch them and take questions from the audience is like where did she get misinformation fundamentally wrong but they're really upset I mean angry not pleasant not understanding\nBut what\nThey show up for do they show up because they're angry they are concerned but more importantly like anyone else in the world they just wanted to hurt right how important is that in a conversation to hear what the other person is is really feeling it get down to okay\nWhat is that what what is what is making you that say oh 'cause there's no no no that's that's the operative subject matter what is triggering this fear and when you get down into the into the nuts and bolts you ... you really can understand\nWhy people do what they do and hopefully get them to a better place than station life and it's not easy to do but it's a it's it's what we do it in a democracy in the Republican former democracy which we have\nIn in America thank God\nI'm so we can just live more peacefully amongst each other governors self self governance I think it's really important a historical and concepts and I think we've lost sight of that a little bit it's easy to uh but more importantly and suffer for\nFolks have pointed out that he was like what we can do better we can do better calm down we got this I mean are are you have too many TV channels at night do you have too many options are they are too many\nI mean it's it's crazy how\n\n\n[noise]\nThis hour from Donald dot com I'm

getting people because of of cell phones this is the this is a question from a from a texture short\n... we're not we're not having any more difficult to time than we had been having 'em in the years leading up to um today\nSo Virginia is about two thirds cell phone mostly or a cell phone only users and so our sample we we actually draw samples of cell phone numbers and so we do quotas on her cellphone versus landline sample\nSo we basically go into the field with the batter to third one third self landline split already um and we haven't found our response rate on cell phones to be any different than it has been which is\nNot great um you know people typically aren't taking cell phone calls to do surveys like they were landline calls in the seventies surveys show\nWe're not finding it any more difficult than we were already um I Do have college around the country who are finding cell phone number is being blocked more um and and it's driven by this um all of this fishing that's been going on with our cell phone numbers lately\nI Can't remember the name of my phone number you know the money's recall from Idaho where I'm driving\nAnd we we do there are two things that we do to try to help us with that we're done it by ourselves at Christopher Newport university so we're not we're not an anonymous number or were not\nAn analyst number you'll see who we are when we call\nAnd then if you said look put me on your do not call list will put you on argue not call is that we won't call you back or we don't have to do that because you know according to the federal regulations were doing research academic research we're not working we're not getting paid to you know do this we're not making a profit show were considered\nUm researchers so we don't have to comply with the do not call it when we do keep our own do not call list and if somebody says don't call me I don't want to do surveys they will put them out or you're not call it so we try to be transparent in that way as well\nWell that's fascinating 'cause most people go uh yeah I'm On on on those do not call was so they they are because because you are academic nature you you get around interesting so your turn\nThe campaigns are they're hoping it's going to be around forty eight\nWell that's so that's ah so it depends on who you talk to 'em it could be forty eight um it could be higher I mean they're so here's the real sort of question that I have in my head right so\nIf there is a big blue wave if there are a lot of voters that are engaged right now who didn't even vote in twenty Seventeen\nThen we're missing them in our survey were not capturing that right and that's some of the pushback I got back um when we want to put out our second district poll showing Taylor leading Luria some Democrats push back and said well you're not even capturing some of the voters that were newly registering in and they're going to vote okay fair enough\nBut we have the luxury in Virginia in in that we had a twenty Seventeen election that we think captured that surge pretty well it it ... it brought Ralph Northam into the governor's mansion\nRalph Northam on the second district by four percent first time a Democrat or one that district in about a decade\nSo we think we twenty Seventeen captured that surge pretty well but\nIt may be even bigger than and also Republicans may have responded 'em by by engaging their base voters already know if they've done that we think we capture them because they were already voters anyway um but if turnout is higher\nI think it's going to help 'em I don't know that helps one party over the other all the way it might be helpful to Democrats because it might be that extra surge that we might\nThat might be a lot of new voters were not capturing\nSo you ... you you saw the surge I called the suburban tsunami I'm twenty seven to ... you saw that you saw\nI think you had an aunt yeah we we were remodeling\n'em in twenty Seventeen like we are likely model this year or what we were doing and twenty Seventeen as we were we were modeling the same way but we were also looking for new the registered voters\n'em in twenty Seventeen because of that was that was that surge that was the difference between twenty six year twenty Seventeen with a lot of those new suburban voters\nUm and so we did see the surgeon twenty Seventeen we all know what it looked like in Virginia\nAnd so there's nothing that says to me that that's going to be any less this year than it was in twenty Seventeen and there are things that say to me it might be a little bit bigger than it than it was one twenty Seventeen and by the way in twenty Seventeen the Republicans were as engaged as as you would want them to be interest that Democrats were a little bit more engaged\nSo you think it might be even bigger this year\nVery well could be I don't think it can be much bigger but it very well could be um Democrats in particular are trying to register new voters or they they were until the deadline and Republicans\nI'm work trying to register new voters as much as they were trying to mobilize their their base voters that already there so I mean look if both parties it's not likely to be because we don't have a really robust statewide race going on 'em and we have\n... competitive congressional races some places and not at other places so so that's part of the reason I'm thinking for you\nThere was massive turnout going on and some of these really competitive congressional races um I don't know if you're a if you're if you're looking for a competitive statewide race to drive a turnout we just don't have that this year and so that's part of the reason I'm hesitant to say it's\nGoing to go as high as forty eight but look I've been wrong many times um and I'll be wrong many times in the future\n[laughter] goodness no that's what I'm Talking about the same ones not close\nNot close um it I you know I did what I find interesting about the statewide races that um it's not close yet you see Tim Kaine campaigning\nIn his ... his campaign campaigning as if it were close he's running ads on on every in every television network in in the commonwealth he's campaigning like he's got a a more for a bit of both formidable candidate that he has\nAnd I think there are two things going on I think Tim Kaine\nNeeds to send a statement that I've moved beyond twenties sixteen\nUm and and and sort of the difficulties of being the vice presidential candidate on the ticket in twenty sixteen but I think he's also recognizing that in some of these are really close congressional races um if he can pull any coattails um if you can let out any curtails\nIt can be really helpful to democratic candidates down ballot and so I think oddly enough Tim Kaine is running a campaign to get reelected to the U.S Senate\nAnd running several congressional campaigns to elect Democrats um in in in some of these competitive races at the same time um and he doesn't really have a challenge for that has a lot of money but Corey Stewart is\nAll over local talk radio which is where his voters are going to be and so I think Corey stewards running the kind of campaign that he needs to run to give voters out given\nUm how difficult situation he hasn't had a little money is\nSo you're the one pulling that\nWaste we pulled the Senate race several times and then decided it wasn't going to be competitive enough support 'em throughout the final stretch from Labor Day on instead decided to pull these congressional races because\nReally for the first time in probably decades in Virginia if if if a hundred and some odd years we've got a lot of a lot of really competitive congressional races going on so we decided to pull the congressional races instead of continuing to pull what doesn't appear to be a very competitive Senate race\nBut we're we're wrapping up here in the segment with what you get a final call here on what the Senate race is going to look like in the day\nWell probably somewhere Fifteen Fifteen ashes mine is where my ... I'm at right now it could be a little bit higher could be a little a little bit lower if it's a little bit lower it's going to\nSome of these congressional races are going to look really good for Republicans are going to be really tight if it's if it's higher if it's closer to twenty than some of these democratic congressional candidates are going to have a better night I think fifty\nSix yeah OK anything moving a libertarian front making an impact at all\nIn a in in in we we anticipated they\nStewart but at the end of the day we're in we're in a very tribal area by your name a lot of Republicans are going to vote for that and not actually I'm a libertarian their their votes and we don't see any among libertarian candidates either state why or\nThe gradual races there's a libertarian attempt there's libertarian seven right we're not seeing any uptick with either one\nOkay thanks Quentin Kidd recalling it looks like an opportunity last with Libertarian Party they had a chance to to crack the crack the market here a little bit in Virginia they might have fallen short this is Chris X. men filling in for the vacation and John Frederick come on back\nI'm doing well Chris I Hope you're doing well\nIs there a third day this week we've seen each other I Know I think you're talking here I'm Talking here I haven't figured it out yet let's not go there [laughter] you're the elected got it right now so uh you know if you heard the last second with Clinton kids from Christopher Newport or are you seeing anything different than what Dr kids seeing out there\nWell I heard that the the back end of his um interview and not you know I I sort of got the sense from a discussion that perhaps these seeing more of a blue wave and I'm seeing I'm you know I'm In in regular contact with all our congressional campaigns um throughout the commonwealth and frankly most\nOf them are doing really well um and I I\nWill be a you're surprised if it doesn't really come down to perhaps just two congressional districts being really in play when we get to election night\nTo just to which too\nI think you know the seven summits hands clearly are the two battlegrounds right now I think the other ones that perhaps people are looking at are the fast but I think Denver Riggleman is clearly running a far superior campaign there and so I think Denver a\nWill uh will be fine I'm election night on there have been some chocolate Scott Taylor's race scotch really working hard um I mean perhaps we'll be close to them we otherwise would've hope but I think at the end of the day Scott should be fine as well so\nThat's where it comes back down to Barbara Comstock in the town um and Dave Brat in the seventh as the way I see at this point\nBecause uh because Dr kid he didn't mention Nebraska spanberger race in I live in a district I see it every day at least in West Maricopa County and there's a stark difference in what's going on the ground at least but I I pull back and try and do the objective follow the data if you follow the data that Clinton kids right in falling what you're saying\nUh the Taylor and ... are the ones that are most important as far as\nYou know changing I'm changing a party\nRight if they're accurate um you've got to tell my seven and ... down by half a day or night tens of like that so if that's consistent than his polling is accurate um it would probably should\nObviously the quality of the candidates important local issues are important but also what he pointed out was he didn't see the big Kavanaugh kicker or that every\nOnce in a is talking about this is going to have this big search for Republicans or if it is is pretty quiet people are making their mind just going to vote and as he said Republicans are show up in midterms\nWell and and I sort of see the ladder I mean obviously what I'm looking at is totally um but during the\nPrior to the to the judge now justice Kavanaugh hearings\nUm there was some um perhaps apathy on the part of the Republican base um but that changed almost immediately or with those hearings and I think the Republican base in Virginia and I think the Republican base around the country saw what a Democrat majority in the United states\nSenate and the Democrat majority in the house representatives under Speaker Pelosi would look like\nConstant um investigations calls for patients or the president's investigations of justice Kavanaugh\nAnd so what I saw as a state party chair with a clear up tech and enthusiasm responses to email fund raising jump significantly as a result of that\nAnd I'm as it's been said before somebody's going to write a check or send some money to the party or a candidate they're more likely going to vote for that person as well so\nIt may not be showing up in the polls quite yet but I Believe that there is a renewed enthusiasm they're clearly wasn't enthusiasm gap between Republicans and Democrats prior to the Kavanaugh hearings but I think that gap spent a lemonade it's now it's just a matter of turning our folks out\nSo you're seeing the enthusiasm kick if I talked to Morgan Griffith about a week and a half ago and he said the same things and you know it was a if you were doing a scale of one to ten ten being you know absolutely out of their mind showing up no matter what\nA he said you know Democrats were around Ninety and my folks around thirty said but my folks are now up around Katie a so he he he sensed that he felt the underground inclined told me the same thing\nOr so from the anecdotal standpoint I Do think there's a renewed a server in the in the Republican base that quite frankly is getting a lot of what they want in the last election as part of the hard thing to politics you know\nWhen you get what you want to show up are you satisfied or you know you're fat and happy new stay home 'cause things are going pretty well what what's the point\nUh but I think that the cabinet things from the re energized refocused or at least the Republican base on uh wanting to come out and vote but you're seeing that throughout the state\nI Am and I and I think you know again what I think that folks realize you're right I mean are they got what they wanted and twenty sixteen we have the president and acting tax cuts and the economy is booming lowest unemployment and in decades and said it was probably some complacency in that but then I think now the Republican base seeing\nAll that can get on done very quickly with the Democrats control the house and Senate and so I think Republicans are saying we've got to roll up our sleeves and if we want to keep what we've got we've got to go to the polls and vote for it\nUsually the cycle of politics right so what has the new chairman of the Republican Party in Virginia\nRepublicans in Virginia Beach got because when you look at Virginia and Maryland you have to you Susan very strange electorate you have a democratic Marilyn's with a Republican governor who looks like he's gonna win three Fifteen and twenty points in Virginia which has been a battleground trending now towards a blue state\nTim Kaine couldn't get things who's gonna win by Fifteen offers probably maybe twenty points as well you didn't really do have this dichotomy don't you all across the Potomac we're we're the the the dynamics in politics are changing Massachusetts has a Republican governor\nWho's up polling are the leading Democrats in the steak Charlie Baker you have a governor a Republican governor of Illinois\nUm is is is the ... other Republicans in Virginia sit right for the electric\nWell I I think what you're saying I obviously I don't know that in our current climate in Virginia whether any of the three candidates you mentioned governor Hogan and others who would which secure the Republican nomination in Virginia right now but\nI think what we're recognizing and I and I've sort of sense to perhaps a more pragmatic approach among Republicans I'm again coming out of the Kavanaugh hearings um\nUh somebody you know six months ago had mentioned you know Susan Collins and Lindsey Graham the I'm sort of a stalwarts of the Republican Party people laughed but now I'm getting request is how can we bring Lindsey Graham in to speak in Virginia for candidates and\nAnd have him that it's a feature speaker and places it's so\nI think the Kavanaugh hearings may have challenged that what we need to do is have a broader based in the Republican Party that can bring conservatives to gather around core principles and perhaps uh if we can agree on eighty percent of the issues we can disagree on the other twenty later on after we start winning again\n[laughter] again the cycle because look both parties are having their their ah Internet signed battles right I mean the Democrats have their own bottles and Republicans are having their battles were going to have some posters\nAnd that pollsters are some operatives from Iowa New Hampshire calling in the nine o'clock hour should listen to that we have one calling in from a Democrat from Iowa Republican from New Hampshire is going to tell us what's going on there since the national caucuses because that's really what they are only\nOnly I say I don't have time to worry about that I Do I sold the house of delegates to the same set it up for reelection but nothing now worried about twenty twenty after we went and preserve I bet you're already in the house next year in Virginia and the\nGently push back here because the dominant theme in American politics is what's going on in Washington DC is being reflected back in in the states and then the local to the districts because Trump is the issue right now since\nSince June fifteenth of twenty Fifteen\nThat man has driven the conversation every day in American politics\nAnd if you know four hundred and Seventy two days away from from the Iowa caucuses people are going to be focusing on those issues but it's going to get very retail very quickly why all the Virginia races are going on and that's the beauty and the dynamic of Virginia politics isn't it because we are we are the pulse\nWe take the temperature all the time\nThat's exactly right and I think um for a congressional candidates this year I think uh last year gave them sort of a wake up call and they could say OK perhaps we're after all\nThis year will sort of perhaps give us a preview of what we can expect in twenty Nineteen but that will be as sort of a pulse of the of the country as you say\nBecause we have the entire general assembly up in this time next year ... all one hundred and forty members of the other a district in the general assembly are going to be up for election and there's so many issues at play what Clinton kid was talking about what he's seeing in his polling is that\nQuality candidates matter and local issues matter I got an email last night from a former colleague of mine talking about a Corey in northern Virginia\nAnd uh basically local developments and he was engaged on he also sends out emails on traffic patterns in potholes and I'm like this is not what you do in the general assembly but if that's what the voters want they want someone talking about it right\nBut I I think that's right people are really looking for\nResults from their elected officials and the things that are impacting most people today with a booming economy and job I'm strong and wages\nGrowing people are looking at some of those other issues that impact them on a daily basis traffic and tolls up in northern Virginia and as you say the plot holes and and and more rural areas of the country those are things that people are focusing on now because their kitchen table issues are doing great",
