that three weeks ago the race right now is about a two and a half to three point race um nobody thought that Scott Walker\nHe was going to that's moving in the right direction America positive for the

Hope come through in the election I think they will a pretty good at this stuff and then you'll see shortly right right after you'll see some extra cash right after that\nOkay and are we or anticipating that whatever happened\nGoing to clean house and get people in there that or actually helping drives his agenda forward tell me I'm right\nA year a hundred percent correct look I think

smell flaking milk politically correct guy he makes fun of these people what the big deal but again\nWhen you talk about mockery about going after people it again I think people think what is going on that's not presidential that's not the way that anybody would think\n\nOur immigration laws and our inability to ... what was the loopholes part a magnet\nAttracting these people are we ... we have is anyone there who's funding there is no a legend eventually got to come out my take is it's kind of\nCome out before the election and I'm not even going to conjecture about who is funding in an organized here put somebody is I mean ten thousand people just don't show up on a two thousand miles march in the heat somebody is organizing this paying\nFor it funding it there's food there's water there's clothing their shoes somebody's paying for that\n\nWe can only conjecture right after the facts are in it\nBut what appears to be is probably people that thought that this would be the end all be all for the Republicans because we have kids\nIn cages after zero tolerance that the border which proved to be a public relations catastrophe for Trump in the Republican but it's gotten too big they ... they ...\nTime is done now it's an invasion and that one of the Democrat's gonna do it was blown up their face and it's their policies and the loop holes\nThat had been the reason that the instructor\nI mean these migrants who were coming in there in Beijing every Taliban they know the law they have been schooled on US law and the loopholes you stepped what you put one little Cho over that border and us laws protect you was that crazy those are the laws you're protected\nLet's go to a quick word from our sponsors Mike and I'll be right back on the job triggers radio network truck

with\nThe best analysis in America and now back to good John Frederick ... a great to have your\nBack here and the judge burgers radio network more than seven million people have already voted in the midterm elections and it looks like the turnout is up for Republicans Democrats and independents are like now the victims have to report this was a true\nBut the kind of been this is going to be\nThe next twelve days at the Democratic blue wave\nCrumbled for nothing because Republicans are going to hold the house now I'm convinced that it by five and they're going to gain ... seats in the Senate five in Alberta to remember five Democrats lose five seats in the Senate and\nCome within five states of power in the house but Republicans hold on by by by the number\nYou're good\nSo uh so far more people like you to vote Republican are thought to have cast ballots\nBut the New York times is telling you don't run against Bush or don't journey conclusion it's still good for the Democrats even Republican turnout is bigger than ever in the early voting precincts that's an anomaly they say look at our polls\nWe have every Democrat winning everywhere and history of ever\nThe um meantime the to show the affair um\nSee aren't you glad I covered this stuff right you don't want it to blow it under the carpet and it didn't matter and then and I say it was a big deal I didn't I covered for two weeks straight nonstop and now look it's a bigger mess than ever that's why you to me in and out the\nFake news right so what's happening with this so uh yesterday the a\nCrown prince of Saudi Arabia who seems to be responsible for this Mohammed than solving who was incompetent that's I'm I'm just going to say at the guys and confidence me that\nTrump's problem with the sky and Jared course tears problem with the thirty three year olds Kirk crown princes you simply incompetent so now they don't trust them I don't know about Jared I've no idea but I don't think the president ... trust them I don't think he believes them\nAnd I don't think he's competing and here's the problem with Trump when he doesn't think you're confident then you're in big trouble if we can deal with the not trusting thing he can like navigate his way through that but if he thinks they're not competent forget it you're done and that's\nI think that's the conclusion\nThe president is drawing eight eight eight Corey though John eight eight eight for eight oh five six or six and if you want to comment on fake polls fake news and fake narrative coming out of the legacy media\nBut that's all it's all fake uh\nMade that many single ticket holder in South Carolina we understand one the mega millions Julian dollar jackpot\nBillions of dollars one point six billion\nA one time cash option a nine hundred and Thirteen points seven million I think I take that where do you think you get the shot measured getting the ticket and like you see the numbers and you you read the numbers at the bottom and\nGot that one got that one got that one got that one got that when I'm On my God I just wonder what point six federal where do you think about that like I\nDon't think we'd be on the radio the next [laughter] I'd probably finish out through the election and that will be it then there'd be like see you'd never hear or see for me again the president calls like every\nAs soon as a cover up the worst cover up ever like the Keystone Cops President Trump to this is the worst\nCover up ever it's just like a bunch of bumbling fools and then they tried to cover it up but that was a disaster now they've found pieces of the bodies buried in the garden of the cop\nMacho Reno\nAnd when the president says the worst cover up ever well here's here's what you draw from that he met we talked to Gina Haspel who went to its Danville turkey or a CIA director you have to assume that uh she gave them enough information for him to make the statement\nThe worst cover up ever which means he gave her information that the Saudis tried to cover it up and it's inconceivable to anybody would have a brain\nIn their head that Mohammed bin Salman was not calling the shots so to simply say was wrote people gonna rise ridiculous they planned it they had body doubles their they blow it and the guys incompetent because everything he touches a disaster simple and\nThe president's going to react when they follow the facts come out by pulling visas than putting various sanctions are those who are involved as you should\n\nBut I think the relationship with the Saudis going forward or is not going to be based on some grand\nRelational a reality between Jared Kushner and Mohammed the dominant I think President Trump is probably done with this guy we're not going to change anything it's not going to make the arms sales balance of power in the middle east we're not going to cancel treaties or pull out a deal but I think\nGoing forward it's going to be very difficult for president\nTrump that take Mohammed bin snowman seriously because I Believe after the series of events you know I Believe he is just simply incompetent John ... radio network trucking the truth everyday right here you're Godzilla of the truth and America watched the fake news\nState polls there'll be coming out you every single day\nTelling you how big you're going to lose they would look\n\nGodzilla of the truth that America you're commander commonsense great to have you with us it is Wednesday ten twenty four that means twelve days of the biggest midterm elections in history to the crisis our border right now with the caravan did juniors to move towards the invasion every status or the United states recent illegal limited immigration data\nIs very clear that the urgent need to address the crisis at our border park like cats you release loopholes back by Democrats\nDemocrats want Bob's Republicans want jobs Democrats want illegal immigration caravan invasion\nAlong with a Goldman Sachs lower Manhattan\nDonor big ego driven gangster banks are Republicans in New York that's the holy alive\nInto the United states is a direct result of an outdated laws demanding what it's called catch and release\n\nNow customs and border protection yet they're apprehended Ninety five thousand Central Americans as part of family your unit at the border last year\nOkay so customs\nAnd border protection apprehended Ninety five thousand Central Americans who came as part of family unit at the border last year you know how many of them are in the United states now Ninety nine percent\n\nI just want you to grasp the reality of the situation Ninety five thousand were apprehended Ninety nine percent are still in the United states\nJust last year\nThis is what I've been saying our laws are such you don't understand that you've touched on us soil you're you as an illegal war breaker we have other laws that protect you\nIt's crazy customs\nAnd border patrol apprehended thirty two thousand unaccompanied minors from the northern triangle of sexual America last year you know how many are in the U.S today Ninety eight percent the number of illegal aliens family you know and it's we can't remove any year\n\nIs roughly equivalent to the number that come over our border illegally in today's\nToday's\nThese democratic back loopholes for the release of apprehended aliens from Central America is outrageous these catch and release laws in court rulings have resulted in de facto\nImmunity for illegal alien minors in adults from Central America who arrive at the border with her\n\nDie of San Francisco push the what she called the trafficking victims protection reauthorization act which prevents the speeding return of unaccompanied minors from not contiguous countries\n\nJudicial orders interpreting and Clinton Eric consent decree known as the war is settlement agreement blocked they blocked the US's ability to detain and removed alien family units you only going to do is covered the kid you're in it doesn't matter\nThat you broke the\nHistory that interesting unbelievable input sell any of our border laws by stepping foot in the United states without any legal status or paperwork you break the law but as soon as you break that law there's\nOther laws that protect you so you can't be remote\nThe thing you can't be thrown back then you can only be detained for twenty days max\nYou can only be with your child for twenty days Matt\nWhat's that twenty days is up you got to be released you're not released back into\nThe country are you from your not repatriated you're simply released into the interior the United states I mean this is crazy there's no point it's something that's why the\nPresident wants the oil\nI mean this is the most interesting thing you didn't even realize until you get into these laws what they are this is the most outrageous thing you know it you can imagine\nThe effect is that the U.S government is forced to release entire family unit the interior of the United states after which they fail to appear for court hearings\nThey're just really yet they\nCame here legally and broke the law but that was that the Democrats fact protect them because they want open borders\nBecause eventually every one of these people will vote for Democrats and they will work for them\n\nAnd so here's the plan lemon so the Democrats getting eventually have a permanent majority and who's complicit Wall Street donor banks strict gangster Republicans\nBecause they want cheap labor and hey all of their real estate holdings guess what they got to live somewhere where the government pays the rent\nWhere's that want to go to shareholders of the companies for bigger bonuses\nThey're living in a mansion west guards and gates\nYou're living in a neighborhood where your school is overrun by children who don't speak English\nAnd are on welfare that you're paying for it and\nTry to go to the food lion on the first to them up and see how that works out for you is is I mean it's ... it's unbelievable\n\nThe government is powerless to anything that's what I keep saying you argue with people that say no to this do that just you can do nothing you have laws\nEighty percent\nEighty percent of illegal aliens claiming a fear of return to their home country get through the initial credible fear screening just three phases of silent\n\nBut only twenty percent of voters claiming asylum actually ended up being granted it but it doesn't matter because all you have to do was claim asylum reached the first eighty percent threshold and you're done\n\nRegardless Ninety nine percent of asylum seekers as family units are able to remain in the United states\nOn your route Ninety nine percent are really after twenty days max never be seen from a heard from again illegal immigration in this country has gone from a dramatic shift from what used to be mostly single adult\nFrom Mexico now to central\nAmerican family you know and it's an unaccompanied minors\nIn fiscal year two thousand Ninety eight percent of aliens apprehended by the United states at the border were from Mexico get that that was two thousand and two years later sixty percent are from Central America open border structures are the congressional Democrats who solution to the crisis\nHas been obstruction because they don't want to solve it\nTwice science bill would effectively get amnesty to any legal rarely in court within a hundred miles of the border as long as their company by monitor so all you have to do is get a minor doesn't matter if it's your minor or anybody smarter you get a minor if you're a hundred miles from the border and you're caught your relate\nJust Jenna minor by the way of miners to find it under Eighteen [laughter] let me\nThink about being I mean what we have an open borders country that is now being exploited by this caravan which is going to hit with ten thousand people and the country can't do anything to stop it because of the after nine\nHard that we have so even though you break\nThe law or to get in and five other laws protect you after you break the law and you can't be deported or returned is this the most crazy insane thing you've ever seen and I want to know why there's ten thousand invaders coming and you know what\nThis was going to succeed and the next time it's got to be a hundred thousand and then one but it's

created that was it's all good Steve Bannon ... coming up at eight thirty five are really looking forward to that\nI Love the ban and gets fired up it's fun man he is fired up All right let's go to my good friend Steve Negron who's running for Congress in New Hampshire second district he backed by Corey Lewandowski and he's running against a democratic in combat [laughter]\nAnd customer I'm Sorry I'm laughing at a text from Mike in Richmond [noise] um I'm I'm he's running against an Custer who won last\nTime by four point six percent which is in play and she's got all kinds of million dollars would fund raising but seems raising money's got Corey behind him and of course we've got a shot he's got to shut the polling upset twelve days away\nAnd he's with us now when the John fragments radio network trucking truth across America Steve Negron great great to have you back Steve up\nA John thank you you know she graduates is on the other day a fan of super so a good luck to you\nI Know I gotta get Bruce Benton involved in our maggot network radio investment team [laughter] I Know we try to tell people I just I talked to him early is quite\nAll right and and now I'm part upstate but I Want to talk about your rates are going to do politics and policy okay let's start with politics a recent polling I've seen in that district shows you down by about eight how do you win\nWhile we win certainly by doing that thing that we're doing you know John one of those polls show and I love the way I Would characterize it earlier\nYou know we're calling heart dams for the for is that what we're getting at about sixty percent Clinton is that they're not going to vote for enter the undecided um and that's very telling\nYou know I had to individual call the campaign\nOffice on Saturday and one of my staffers pick up the phone it said what do you want to talk to him on them and the guys they sure are picked up the clients that I served it was\nJust really the candidate Mike absolutely it goes you know I got to say something I'm a Democrat and I probably don't agree on Ninety eight percent of the six years I've never been able to talk and\nCuster I call you want to pick up the candidate I pick up and start pockets don't have my vote and that's what we're hearing there is a lot of people that are higher John in New Hampshire or the inaction of representative\nUm Custer you know under her are not gonna watch the old got worse\nUm it it's crazy you know she doesn't stand up for the immigration issue that are important to get on the answer so we feel that we have a target rich environment we're reaching out to them that it's representing with the with the voters\nOutlook I I think there is an under current Republican vote out there you look Steve Negron right now you should have a little bit of bringing your step because you're looking at your early voting returns and they are up dramatically and Republican precinct strongholds that means that Republicans are motivated\nThey're excited also independence up not a good sign for the Democrats now Democrats strongholds Europe also what Republicans up more that's been the issue in in the midterms from day one can you get the Trump voters out and\nWe're all independence job and it seems\nBecause as the president is saying\nRight now the ... the Trump agenda jobs\nThe Democratic agenda is mobs and invading caravans that's basically the choice that people have okay so sounds like you're districts and play let's get to politics let's let's start with the caravan ten thousand strong now coming\nTo the United states um that Mexico would appears incapable\nOf stopping it the laws are such steam when you get to the border if you step foot over the border a catchy rulings there are laws that protect miners families with minors they can't be sent back in Ninety nine percent of them\nEnded up staying in the U.S so they break one while but then other wants to protect them the president has said he might to point the military why Steve Negron so Lucian\nWell absolutely you know you're you're not that you want to get a great character I see this as an invasion about what you have that many people are coming into our borders you know we have a fundamental responsibility in the president's national security strategy right the four pillars of it the first one is to protect the American people\nAnd that's what he's going to do and if we have to do for the military down there to provide that sort of protection I'm all for it you know there were people that I Want to come here um and follow the laws of the land and and do it right way then I'm all for it you know but we know that that that\nGroup of ten thousand you know you think that they all have masks on their own undecided on one day to start marching in one of my ... I don't think so so I Believe that what the president's doing and what he's saying\nI'm all for it of course I'm ... representative Custer says you know just opened up oil at everybody and end up or sorted out afterwards it's not in the right\nOf way of protecting American people and people are resonating want that and I think you don't want this sort of ... show the differences between us and Democrats that we want a fundamentally a let those people and that that are allowed to come to the right way and all those people that aren't you know you gotta wait until we forgot who you are\nWell the reality of this is is if you let ten thousand in the next wave is going to be a hundred thousand because certainly becomes a magnet now but I Want to get this specific what specifically do you recommend the president doesn't if you're in Congress what action would you want to specifically takes these\nAbsolutely well I haven't oh and you know first of all you're going to put this is unbelievable pressure\nOn on the U.S border and crossed the border patrol agents that are down there right now I'm asked or they're going to need some assistance you know they're not going to be able to set to actually process and do what they need to do and all those people and I would have the state department I'm John getting on on the line and talking to all those countries that these people are traverse eight\nI'm starting with Mexico and working my way back all the way to go walk them all up\nAnd say you know what it says it it's just that the way we need to do things the president talked about um rescinding some um that those countries that they're they're coming from so I Would absolutely deploy some military down there to augment\nOn the border the border patrol they're the ones that are they lead agent on this they're the ones that have responsibility but we cannot let them I'm hanging out there and swinging the buying do those kind of things about the president is doing right now is absolutely on the right thing and you know what will will show you that we will have to put up a temporary\nI'm understanding of those situations that are there but we cannot read this this porous border that the Democrats walked up pretty", "show_name": "Mark Levin Show", "year": "2018", "city": "Portsmouth", "day": "24"}
