Mohammed bin Salman very critical now we have we have FBI intel leak that or into sources said\nThat the Saudis were attempting to lure him back into Saudi Arabia in an effort to interrogate him and then we would assume put them in jail\nHe goes in to the extent bowl a Sony constantly in Turkey to get paper work\nSo that he can get married or that he can a show the Turkish authorities that he is legally do [noise] course in Saudi Arabia so that he can get married to his Turkish fiance and do the do the right thing we have footage of them going in we have no for the job of coming out\nTurkish

think having been solve them just kind of underestimated the media frenzy here he thought it would kind of die out\nI thought the president or President Trump is doing a mass strictly brilliant thing in fighting\nThe Turkish me on say of ... or to the White House that's going to put more media focus on this land hall has called for an immediate suspension of sales of or any arguments for Saudi

from [noise]\nWe're all the time like you Barbara for being with us a Republican congresswoman Barbara Comstock representing the temperature ... district of Virginia she's up for a third term on November ... Barbara people want more information or do they go\nBarber her partner dot on what may have probably getting a lot for example a lot of the Clinton waited about\nHer yesterday morning it's really weird [noise] and get your your um [noise]\nWeb site again\nBarbara for Congress dot com\nTo how long we talk to them without a warrant and so there is a group of actually bipartisan Republicans and Democrats are trying to sort of the deep state from getting on our information and there's been good at that as well\nI just want to remind our listeners that uh everybody knows and listens to me I was a vehemently opposed to Patriot Act one son of the Patriot act when it's sunset it or you were a lonely\nVoice in the U.S Senate I remember you did that filibuster for some time in opposing in questioning\nOr the ... the Patriot act you were right uh then you're right now I was right then I'm right now we're just so my audience knows\nThis whole Pfizer thing a with Carter Page and a easy dropping out of the Trump campaign and it's only five ... Warren none of that could have happened without the Patriot act that set that up\nAnd you were the one that said you keep government ... giving government this unlimited power up surveillance and its eventually going to come around and bite you in the bud center that's exactly what happened\nBut I have the same in the very same conversation yesterday with the director of the odd because I asked him point aren't argue gathering information including suppressed at some calls and of course she buttered said oh I Can't answer that are there Saturday\nAnd the answer for my answer yes there was an article about two or three years ago saying that they recorded Fifteen hundred of President Obama's a phone call and then they minimize him which means that sort of markets name out but I ordered it to tell when President Obama or President Trump is talking to a foreign leader here they're out\nOf their voices even if you minimize or in a parked out there that you can't tell her the voices are but we shouldn't be doing now we're listening to members of Congress\nThey're recording and then they're out there and then the FBI can search this database without her joggers Warren\nAnd my point to him was and I think he didn't understand that are in there [noise] if you're recording paintings on potential terrorists from overseeing the cost\nOf government really apply but if they're talking to Americans who are just random people are talking to America and when you do get constitutional protections because many of the phone call our discussions with terrorists in fact the vast majority are innocent international phone calls\nAnd so we have had this discussion with them and uh it should be protected by the cost in fact some say the Fourth Amendment John Adams set of the spark that led to the revolution we getting like the British soldiers coming into our houses you know breaking down the door and see if we paid our stamp tax [noise]\nUh we really wanted protection that we want to say the government and never come in your house or take any private\nConversations are belongings without talking to her at drug stores\nWell that's a that's why you were so adamantly opposed to when you were a predictor of the future with this whole thing\nSenator or you've also been a very strong voice on the disappearance of juvenile to show the there's a lot of talk about what should be done and we want more information\nAnd like I get that but as a member of Foreign Relations committee you're the only senator that has proposed action which is until we get answers on his disappearance because\nSenator thing is we have a videotape showing that he went in there is nobody takes showing that he went out and I'm a crown prince MPs Mohammed bin Salman since uh the camera footage was corrupted or the battery went dead\nTheir chance really only by that it's like the dog ate my homework or I didn't get ever ready battery and so the battery died\nNow you have more intermediate suspension of ah the arms sales to the Saudis until we get some kind of a satisfactory answer can you elaborate on that sir\nI think everybody should remember that Saudi Arabia is the largest state sponsor of radical\nIslam around the world what I mean by that is they have been funding for decades Madrid authors in Pakistan in the Philippines\nEven in the United states teaching in the west to the Christianity and teaching them radical violent jihad this is the salaries are\nWe shouldn't be selling a weapon simply because of drought here's queen of the Nineteen hijackers who came here were from Saudi Arabia Saudi Arabia is a big part of our terrorism problem they are they funders of terrorism and teaching of radical Islam around the world this latest episode\nI I see no way that this could have happened without there\nBeing a [noise] private clients were team a guy's on on some of them have been linked to Saudi security services and intelligence I'm now it doesn't pass the smell test and you know we just cleaning it out to the president this morning\nAddition to them killing that journalists they're paying tens of\nThousands of civilians killed in Yemen they're doing it with our bombs\nWhen we're we feel when they're flying there\nAnd it's a big flyer and two weeks ago or three weeks ago they killed the school bus full of children's school children were killed a year ago they killed a hundred and fifty people on a funeral procession\nAnd we wonder why someone in Yemen wants to drop a bomb on and kill the Saudi are killing American because they found the fragments of the bombs that same maybe in America and so we have to realize that for every action there's action and that's a blowback\nFrom us being involved in some ... civil war or is one that we actually create more terrorists but here's the other possible thing that's going to happen\nAgain or what happened in Libya when we toppled Gadhafi we got the house and more terrorism it became a breeding ground for terrorism my fear is that there is some remnants fairly fairly strong remnants of al ... and yet we're not fighting them that were Mick Jagger stricter civil\nWar between those who do you come to salaries and also with Iranian influence as well the ... cents into chaos and that you get to ride out period at the same thing happening in Syria is that\nThe war and we got involved in the chaos you got the rise of ours\nWell actually the network that I go on a gym near a couple about a month ago was reporting that al Qaida fighters were actually given safe haven a by the by the Saudi forces in Yemen in ... in in order to fight the who the so\nCalled this wasn't nearly as wouldn't be surprised if you just heard that the Saudis support in Syria they supported out news round which is essentially an offshoot of al\n... the Saudis are all these poor people who hate America who has a western ways\nAnd yet we found a big arms deal president because I Do it for job creating jobs that's not something that we are considering when we argue arms deals we need to be considering our national security not trying to have some sort of Keynesian job scope\nYou're on the John triggers radio network truck in the truth across America where we're Kentucky Senator Rand Paul Republicans on the Foreign Relations committee or he's been the strongest voice in the un center on how we react to the uh Jamal to show ... disappearance\nSo have you recommended this to the president center have you went to direct conversation can\nRemember a look that was the original Trump supporter everybody knows day when it came down the escalator he campaigned on getting out of these entanglements not staying in the have you had a direct conversation with the president on how we should react to this\nNonsense the killing of the journal after he does know my feeling was talking about once a week or two and well we have our conversation as a general ours by saying that uh he has the same instincts that idea that we're going to have the Afghan or too long the Iraq War was a mistake you shut down\nHe's surrounded by stay forever crowd and that's the real problem as I can to presidents instincts are good I'm sort of in the crowd at what the president be the president and write and\nYet the people surrounding him are are thank God to offer and [noise] you know part of the traditional foreign policy round here which is go stay forever and bankrupt America\nSen Paul the president has invested a lot of political capital in the Saudis and it was the first place that he went in his first foreign visit a MPs came to the United states he did his media\nTour with them to Saudi spend a ton of money on media PR as you know uh in in in the swamp and so he's put a lot of uh and and you know we kind of looked the other way when NBS rounded people up jailed him in that hotel whatever they did\nA this ministry ... has looked the other way is this going to affect our relationship with the Saudis and my entire to that is it going to change the president's position on the Saudi ... Largo of the state of Qatar where we have or\nBiggest military base in the middle east\n[noise] yeah I'm not so sure you got to change his mind he seems to be ...\nOn a continuing to sell our to Saudi Arabia I think Congress is also the same way they're going to put up some protests and say they object to the journalists being killed but there's there's billions of dollars involved here and you know like I always say followed them and there's so much money being made on selling these arms to Iraq\nJake due to the house [noise] shepherd Seventy to me and my twenty two [noise]\nThirteen twenty
