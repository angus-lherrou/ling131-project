[noise]\nI'm John from the time your whole life and Washington DC as those in the nation's capital great to have you with us today trucking the truth across America your Godzilla of the truth\nRight here Curtis Ellis coming up a few moments are we going to be doing a victory dance on this great trade agreement know born after we've been fighting it for thirty five years I hate to after\nI never thought I'd see the day or that was done ... gone and replaced by something better than actually helps the American worker and more good news [noise] if you're working in America today and you have a job even more good news if you're under three hundred and fifty thousand people that worked for Amazon gets what you just got a raise\nIf you are below Fifteen dollars now you're going to be starting November first at Fifteen dollars Amazon saying you know what we have to raise wages we have to fight to keep people think when the economy is booming and you have more jobs\nThat people to fill the jobs that means companies are searching for good people\nTo applicants for three jobs and if they're good applicants they're going to have to pay them so I'm In favor\nOf the Fifteen dollar minimum wage as you know but here's with even better when you don't even have to have been mandated by the federal government when the market driven by Trump thinking of it is so vibrant\nThat companies have to make decisions in their best interest to raise wages to keep good people that is a great\nThing to think of all the entry level people that went to work for Amazon or are going to work for Amazon as I could ... a couple of good things to grow that just got a rain is because of the Trump autonomy they didn't have to put on the air\nHappens because wages are rising so now Amazon has to compete with other companies UPS FedEx whenever they have to compete and they have to pay more\nAnd that's what Trump nominees serious and that's how the rising tide lifts all boats so wages continue to to live this is this is great it was just an amazing thing today and we finally got rid of NAFTA\nOh my God I just a story you don't want with NAFTA was first going down Curtis Ellis is with us so we're we're going to bring him in our credit salad a senior policy adviser with America First policy and you could go back to the nap today [noise]\nI mean I remember the severely was like Nineteen was the Clinton they got elected\nAnd then getting rich came up like Ninety five and speaking NAFTA thing was going on and\nYou know it was going to be like the panacea in all the jobs are going to be creative and and you know we were going to be the service it kind of nonsense they were telling us and back then you know how many Republicans were fighting NAFTA like three like me Trump and Pat Buchanan that's it [noise]\nIf you're against NAFTA in the nineties you were looked at as like some kind of an economic Neanderthal\nLike jumping in a box of rocks like you couldn't see the future you're via word mired in the Eighteen hundreds and you wanted to bring back a black students or something the horse and buggy like you just couldn't get with that you could understand the global world economy and\nThe wall Street Journal editorial page and the wall Street Journal is of course the the the mouthpiece of the global corporations who I Believe in open borders no countries at all just let us rape and pillage anywhere on earth without\nUh any any people like a national legislature or national board or getting in the way of our ability to just exploit the cheapest labor anywhere and rape and pillage all over all over the world as as we wish the wall Street Journal\nEditorial page invented this lie that the Smoot Hawley the the terror fact of Nineteen thirty created the great depression\nWhy [laughter] why\nAnd and now has become accepted gospel wisdom everywhere and he's still pops up and you find Republicans saying it you find Democrats saying if you find that were saying it in Texas\nYou find every moron idiot who doesn't even understand\nEconomics but they know for sure\nThat you know the the the the Great Depression was caused by terrorists\nRight that's what causes the Smoot Hawley terrorist act and that's what caused the great depression and it's a complete like complete fabrication and no basis in truth whatsoever but that is now the excepted wisdom and anytime anybody attacks\nDonald Trump's for standing up to China\nAnd putting terrorists in place for defending American industry to say well don't you know that terrorists caused the great depression and how do you know that well I read it somewhere you know where you're at a well everybody knows that\nCage close and so that all happened as a result that all came out of the debate over NAFTA in Nineteen Ninety four thank you al\nGore another lie from the Democrats and well made by the Republican at the wall Street Journal editorial page all the Republican\nI mean I mean back then Curtis that Republicans were totally complicit in this this was driven by Newt Gingrich I mean Bill Clinton basically came along for the ride a Gingrich Republican majority John taste that they all drove it people forget that I remember I Can't remember the Republicans drove this\nAnd they really believe that you know this was open trade open borders everything was going to be fine and\nLook at Wall Street driven right they got they got big donations by the wall street lower Manhattan\nOwner things will be good for you because you make more money and they you workers as airplane take commodity the first thing you learn in economics one on one is going to\nA junior in high school and they they talk to you about diminishing resources and so that supply and demand and they say the number one big it cost to the\nY. labor labor labor right\nI mean you learn that as a sophomore in high school\nSo it never stops no uh we're with Curtis Ellis he's a senior policy adviser for America first policies he's also the chairman of amber richest of the American jobs alive Curtis or worked in the Trump Administration and the department of labor he was also on the campaign\nCurtis so way out for us this is a great victory for American workers American farmers laying out like the top three or four changes\nAnd housing positively affect the Americans going from and then you have to be able to United States Mexico candidate or us and say hey\nThe top ah some of the top changes increases\nThe amount of a car a that must be made in North America it increases it up to Seventy five percent three quarters of a car to enter the United states duty free\nThree quarters of that automobile must be made in the United states it increases the amount of dairy products that the United states\nCan sell in Canada so that our dairy farmers in upstate New York Wisconsin and the northern tier in California a lot of daring California number one dairy state in America\nWill have a greater access not just to Canada\nBut to third countries because Canada under this agreement will reduce subsidies to the dairy products\nDid exports to third countries it subsidizes its excess theory production\nAnd a hundred cuts are prices in third countries are you there yes gun okay\nI heard a click that wasn't true and ah it it it increases are protections for more digital trade intellectual property rights in the digital trade which of course did not exist at all and the previous now after ... there was no digital trade\nThere was no Internet ah there was a ... and what's happened over the last twenty five years\nIs Canada put in all these crazy a protections in requirements\nThan regulations so that Americans couldn't even sell stuff to Canadians on ... ... it became virtually impossible so a e commerce there's now increased we can now actually sell stuff to Canadians over the Internet and um [noise] ... that we couldn't do before\nAnd there is a stipulation in this us MCA that if Canada or Mexico enters a trade agreement with a non market economy now means China right there the biggest non market economy out there\nIf they do all bets are off we can withdraw from NAFTA we can withdraw from our trade agreement with that country so basically what they say you can't set up the Mexico or or Canada\nCan't enter into a trade deal with China and then trying to be ... and they use NAFTA as a way to get there is\nThe subsidized goods into the United states\nRight that's that's what that's what was happening on NAFTA\nAnd that was also what was going to happen on steroids if we if we pass the the the exactly the Chinese a cheap bike rather than shipping to a stranger the you'll you'll you'll you with us they go to Mexico or they go to Canada and becomes part of that and we have a trade deal right\nYeah they just like yeah you know the\n... the other huge thing about that since it's on a step back for a minute and look at the big picture NAFTA was supposed to be the first step in the free trade area of the Americas Frank first we bring together North America countries\nThen we get kept or Central America free trade agreement\nAnd the next step was going to be the free trade area of the Americans from\nFrom tierra del sway you go to the north pole one big happy free trade zone\nAnd then we saw with ... with TPP the Trans Pacific partnership we were going to bring in the other side of the Pacific as well\nAnd see all of these things are part of the of the vision the grand vision of creating a border was world and I am not exaggerating Mrs on some John birth society conspiracy taught us his\nAge the fact the wall Street Journal again they have said on the record there should be a law or they want to amend the constitution to add\nA their sprays there shall be no borders that against the dream of the global is of the global us corporations the porch and fifty the fortune five corporation they want no borders no nations\nThey don't want pesky things white\nCongress or the president or ... making it difficult for them to do their thing anywhere on earth fine cheap labor over here find cheap minerals over their combined them into third place and sell them into fourth place that's their vision it's been laid out before\nIn front of Congress this is not a conspiracy\nThis new deal recognizes that we have a country and we are entitled to have a country and it didn't take privilege for people in other countries to sell their goods in America is not\nLaws labor laws environmental laws whatever laws that are good for the American people can decide what are the conditions in situations for making stuff in this country treat everybody right treat the workers' rights treat private property rights respect at all\nAnd you can make things and do well and have a good living in this country if you're from another country and your company is from another country\nThe privilege to be allowed to sell stuff in this country not a right\nAbsolutely something better than anyone we could have had\nA thank you for being with us I've only got twenty seconds so I got to change the topic and asking for a yes or no answer that's correct\nCommon I get confirmed fight Saturday afternoon yes yes yes Curtis says yes I also say yes I think he gets from Saturday afternoon Josh ... radio network for cops are coming out of it right here\nEverybody's predicting a western victory except me are predicting a Barbara Comstock victory and I'm a good start fight this and we're going to bring Iran but uh I think it was a week ago or two weeks ago like two weeks ago [noise] I covered that yeah two weeks ago or ... I don't remember I covered\nThe a lot of um county debate between uh Jennifer Wexton\nBarbara ... and we ran out live on the radio and\nTo tell you that was that was the biggest thing crushing I've ever seen in my life partner is that the top of her getting\nAll all property was rattle off solution after solution after solution success after success after success plan after playing after plan and Washington has nothing I mean I was embarrassed for actually uh I went to Paris for Jennifer it was so bad it was like she was a diner waited and\nThere was a lot of talk after that debate like who prepared or and what the deal was but um you know what is what it is so okay ... joining us now we declared her the huge debate Victor Barbara Comstock hey Barbara good good to have you with us\nGreat that they wouldn't have Johnny morning\nUm what was the deal in that debate I mean I\nI really expected Jennifer did you better than that I was embarrassed for her\nWell what can we focused on results versus read that they could you dont end when the results that I heard a guy that I worked out as part of who promoted our prosperity you know the tax cuts and the economic growth we have ...\nPercent economic growth a booming economy\nHave a record funding for things like Alzheimer's research and I H cancer research\nTo court for veterans the largest military pay raise some of these things are good things that she can't\nSay anything about of course these are all things that she resisted the agenda that I'm getting attacked on the ads that they have up right now attacking me is an eighty two percent bipartisan agenda that included things like you know records funding for opioid\nAddiction treatment and education and the ... and do all she's doing is resisting and when you actually look\nOn her legislative record it has been cruel she doesn't have any job\nAccomplishments nothing on our website about anything she's done jobs ... jobs because it's not as focused and so when she was there with the chamber is was never something she focused on you know that the job they read this they\nLeft wing number one liberal candidate who's opposed things that it's reasonable as that's just too soon for victims\nFor victims of domestic and sexual abuse ship pose that a justice here as opposed to oppose the bill one of the first things he of code when she was elected in the state Senate was a bell I had to help victims of domestic here's a bill that God's ... told me it was a great bill and um and he voted\nFor go this is how far out of touch she is and she doesn't have a record I mean a bunch of her ... she\nStarted her bills Joey says I vote I have a bunch of bill passed for things like moving the borders of Herndon and all of these little you know changing papers the file in court you know there's nothing to ensure that she's passed she's a follower NATO leader who thinks they\nTalked to she has not been able to get\nTwenty one vote to understand that 'cause I Need to get to pass a major pedal and this is somebody who cannot\nGo out work across the aisle to get anything major with Twenty one painful and when you go to Congress you need two hundred and Eighteen and I've done that and I've gotten my bills and things like my two thousand dollar child tax credit got it into the tax bill got my colleagues report that my\nProject steak neighborhood which has provided more\nFunding for a crime and put down\nThe pike gun crime drug crime I term is Thirteen gang crime see her that that's been the score card that they're attacking so she just doesn't have a record to run on towards all resent spending Saddam negative and it's going to\nFail because people are just as much someone focused on their priority and getting resolved and prosperity public safety and national security not already been tearing his guts out fighting you know and you know to everything\nWell look I think that was obvious that the thing and\nYou know which is why you're part of the crowd and resist and Trump shocks and all that you're doing\nWe just want to resist the other guy and\nI think that's where she fell down in this debate is she really didn't have anything and then her closing statement she attack 'em your record on women which I thought was laughable to be honest so I don't think she did her yeah\nThis is somebody Jennifer Wexton has been campaigning with former\nRepresentative Jim Moran now this is the man\nWho had not one but two I called the police telling them for abusive behavior\nKnown for buying and this is somebody\nHypocritical a campaign is seen as not called out if they can go Democrat not\nBill Clinton not John Conyers not ours than do I still you know that he hadn't seen a coach hair and other members of Democrats who are still there that I have to have casual and get on the elevator which she hasn't called out a single wanting to them\nFor their behavior in shape hypocritical a silent\nPartner then I don't think as we discussed before this is someone who mindlessly attacked George Mason university for naming their law school after Justice Scalia and you know getting thirty million dollars for a scholarship as a result [noise]\nLet me ask you this the last ... times the hometown newspaper a senator west or from the county and then a forum that day in front of you and Jennifer to be at a\nApparently they're telling me that senator west and turned it down or were you were willing to be there [noise]\nYeah we had accepted that's been something that ... north than than I did last time\nIt was you know a discussion on our local insurance and you know I think back to bed she is um [noise] you know important I mean listen\nSeries go to a single [noise] nine eleven Mario ceremony to be in the in the community she didn't go to a single national night out I'm not going to a public forum\nAt all like putting her heart at the end of the things that are in the fight over the line\nAnd you know they're they're trying to keep her head and then I think you saw that debate why\nThat that that was pretty bad I mean I I mean I've seen\nI've seen senator west and other venues and I know she was the prosecutor\nAnd the communist silks attorney and uh you know she did run for the rest of champagne in a special election so I mean I've seen her speech and she's really not that bad it was just that day that morning or I Would say she was shot at the top of the game and you work\nAnd that's why it was such a a last minute\nNever see represents a very democratic just pray that wind sixty seven percent per round north and I'm I'm well I'll tell you that is right in the head of of other Democrats he's actually around eight to ten points behind chicken hunger performer he had a district

Republican congresswoman from the district Barbara Comstock running for a third term just to see that Frank last forever demographics have changed [noise] it is flipping to blue however\nAre we protecting that far but it's going to win this thing even though the pundits ever someone of another dog\nAnd she's running against a state senator Jennifer Wexton it'll be decided on November six you want to be sure mark that on your counter turn out and vote no matter what your preferences have to get involved\nSo I'm Barbara Comstock let me ask you this the president finalizing the trade deal yesterday no our protection and so we come from different angles here so we're going to uh\nNot debate that but I hate after I was glad to see it go I did champagne dance [noise]\nUh when we finally

that was not true that is\nA under penalty of perjury and you know I think it's becoming clear it that's all the things she told there's a lot of equipment it may not have been true and to quote Richard Blumenthal astonishingly\nOne untruth does indeed undermine a person's credibility and if she lied about the polygraph if she lied about travel who knows what else he lied about I think if

Republicans monitor their interests\nShift to the right on the Supreme Court which of course what all their mayhem is about it for the first see about future of this is a very\nImportant Supreme Court choice and the nomination men and confirmation because it will indeed impact our country that liberal\nProgressive agenda that has merrily written along with the Supreme Court for many years is about to end and I think that is why you have people really debating themselves trying to make sure that this nomination doesn't go through\nIt obviously it comes down to ...\nCollins and Murkowski I think those comments and Murkowski will vote for Kavanaugh\nIf there is nothing in that report\nBreak I have no idea he is so compromise but at the end of the day she portrays himself and in fact his ratings and voting records show he is a conservative so is he really willing to squander that possibly unique opportunity to put a conservative on the court\nAnd guarantee as I say quite a few years of conservative buyer from the court\nIs he willing to throw that away a because he is so\nEager to people loved by the left I have no idea the man is so full of hatred for Donald Trump\nDid it appears he'll go to any lengths whatsoever to confront him but honestly I Would be shocked if he voted against him\nWell where are we differ on that he's going to vote\nNo yeah it would be the opposite where he wants to be lying in the New York times Washington Post or some kind of the Republican hero\nOf our time and so you're going to write a book and the whole thing\nAnd make a lot of money he's going to vote no it really comes down to Collins and Murkowski there'll be a it was just this is no secret\nAnd um I Would be personally shocked if there's nothing in this report and college voted no I I just could not even things are getting on TV and try to explain it\nBecause she never says anything stupid I mean if you follow suit in college like I Do I Love following her because every time she speaks like okay that makes you wonder I don't think\nYou're right I don't think she have any grounds for doing it and she has kept an open mind from the start\nAnd she has basically said unless something's surface you know there's no reason not to vote for him what do you think about Murkowski\nI could not imagine if calling the police or she's going to vote yes yeah that Lisa Murkowski all alone in Alaska stinking this nomination and seeking the fate\nOf the last two years of the Trump Administration up to twenty twenty because it'll it'll destroyed the Republican Party as we know what I Can't jak Trump voters and neither should anybody else if this guy goes down with no weapon\nI don't know how you take somebody down where there's no evidence because\nYou basically ward said Democrats\nYeah that I think it's almost the most offensive part of that scenario I totally agree we'll show boating health promoting a heinous behavior the lack of decorum the lack of decency dining find science sitting on their information simply\nBecause it made it for a more potent gotcha moment there's that\nReally is I think he's right that the Republicans are going to condone I sure as heck hope not and I think I agree I think Mitch McConnell in the other a card and a stack Mitch McConnell has been absolutely\nFerocious about getting judges on the Supreme Court and lower courts he has made it his paws he has basically refused to put through a lot of other\nA senior administration officials who are awaiting confirmation because judges have been his priority and I think he's very smart to do it I think he's ... I mean the Republicans across the country should be applauding this because nothing more than\nThe judicial branch needed to repair it more than that and so I think it's\nIncredibly important but he's doing that um and I think he will get more can ski and Collins in her room and promised them\nThe moon politically or if they go along with it and I don't mean that he should have to because as you point out if there is no evidence to support any of these charges shame on them for even wavering mean whether you've got drunk in high school or not\nWhat we know now is Steven briar was arrested for underage drinking that\nDidn't seem to stop his confirmation and yes it's not necessarily equivalent but let's get a grip here folks and look at what we know about this man what we know is it for Thirty years he has behaved with unbelievable dignity integrity\nA decorum he has had no charges ever leveled against him like anything like that as an adult so on the other side of that ledger we have hundreds of opinions that people think so highly of that they're frequently used as a reference point\nIn a other judgments and other arguments legal arguments this man deserves a place on the Supreme\nCourt I really hope it gets there\nOkay we're we're teaching to tribute to\nThe newspaper the hill and also the hill on line and also Fox News she has a new column out called Trump's America for Paul scored big win with a new NAFTA you're also I Love your new website I Love the flu\n[laughter] me in the mood and\nAgain I I asked her to a it's a kind of thing that you know you put off

all of us has shown me is that we have an issue with using the justice system to legislate instead of the legislative branch joined the jobs that might be the point to great cabinet\nSo it was written opinions are not use is a scorched earth policy\nMight be the plan\nBut I don't think it matters once he's confirmed it doesn't matter what you think of it doesn't matter I mean you saw that with

as it gets [noise] which I don't think there will be at least at least you know a lot of [noise]\nYou know that's a great point Mac where's the Bush family wears George Bush where the Laura Bush where's all the places where Jeb Bush nowhere to do\nWhere's the Bush family does anybody know yeah there there's there's certainly not shy about criticizing President Trump would they don't like something that he does write they jump right into that pray I mean they got time James [noise]\nI don't want to ask lose that was awesome I was like I'd be ... percent on that [noise]\nYou should have texted me I Would have answered that question I don't\nKnow man I Will take to drive your good now but\nWhat you're the first caller that's raised that issue\nAnd I gave out there thank you because we're the place you where are they now want to be out now that we're going to any of them not think you're right they're not a good show man came back\nAll right joining us now former sheriff Milwaukee County as senior advisor to\nFirst policies action sheriff David Clarke hey Sean Clark great have you back man\nTakes a lot of listeners again\nSheriffs um I\nOf I Can't get your comment\nMatches central Richmond one of our callers you just heard that he said look this whole confirmation process with judge Kavanaugh he worked in the Bush Whitehouse ordered his wife where is the first ... what do you think\nWhat we're talking we're talking about politics or in politics do expect anybody to have your back you can't trust anybody in this political ... spoke to Washington DC so when you ask where the bushes hiding somewhere you know this hiding somewhere\nTrying to figure out a hate on Trump some more that's what's going on with gene pool but you know like I said you know expect this sort of thing in politics you know you have to have your own back don't expect anybody to have yours\nOkay so\nLook some of the some of the comments that are being made by the left are appalling\nOf course it doesn't get any play in the media you can imagine sheriff Clarke if Republicans were saying any of this stuff but um you know we've we've got this one a lady in in Georgetown here in Washington DC where I\nSays that white GOP senators deserve miserable that's after cabinet like hearing that you did a profanity laced Twitter tirade against Kavanaugh calling him a rapist and a perjure\nShe described the Republicans as I'm a death cold and filthy swine and she's teaching at Georgetown University what's the deal show\nWell you know what the deal is here to get away with whatever they want and then when something mild by somebody on our side the nickel so to me look at this associated assistant dean at Catholic university says something queen and some things he got suspended by the university university has a right to do that\nBut at the same time what you said was nothing near nothing close [noise]\nAnd uh you know our site when I say our son is qualified that conservatives there were tired of the tactics used by the left but instead of sitting back and whining what we need to do it you know and and getting out where he's what we need to do is\nDefine better counter measures counter strategies to deal with this stuff more effective ones but I see different kinds of strategies because to sit back and pointed out is one thing and that needs to be done because the lying liberal media won't do their job but\nWhen you know individuals see some of the things that they do like we're talking about somebody called the um\nThe other day um\nScored a tank I think it was the guy from Fox News who got fired that well Sam ...\nA little bit of a little older cop there is no doubt about that fire but then you look at the New York times or that one woman\nWho said she hated white man\nYou don't get away with whatever they want that to one of the ways that we can counter that at ground level in fighting back it will make sure that we get this a judge Brett Kavanaugh confirmed this job one any people to stay focused on the task and it's getting just\nKevin all come from a new one he's been put through and he said best I think when he said this thing has turned into a joke I Wonder if these senators on the Senate Judiciary committee and I'm Talking about both GOP and the Democrats that one of the proud\nOf themselves as to how they conducted this search and destroy mission which is another thing another crazy that took care of and I use that's what it's become a um you know this man it's been put on his family's been through enough this\nCruel and unusual punishment is I'm as far as I'm concerned that is prohibited by the eighth amendment to the constitution so all these constitutional issues that are involved in this uh you know guilty before proven innocent\nOf the rule of law do crisis is trash the rule of law has been thrown out we live in a country where you don't have to prove your innocence but all of a sudden now when it comes to judge Kevin how you got to present an innocent these charges so there's some things but pastor died\nI say enough is enough I was disappointed when Chuck Grassley initially move that date from September twenty fifth and you move to the Thursday and then they moved it again in your own trying to appease the Democrats nothing's going to have peace them you see what they're doing now the Democrats\nCome up with a list of twenty five people they want interviewed their job I don't know if if if I Know Mitch McConnell understand in the Senate or the other day but you know\nPiecing the Democrats and well why John think about this three senators flake Murkowski income was reportedly went to the president said hey we need political cover to hold why don't you just do this this ah\nFBI investigations so we can get by this one in ... why would you need political cover to do the right thing but see that's where politics in the swamp has become\nThe doing the right thing would have just been following the world but in any political cover I think this\nYou're saying and sharing that perspective because I hadn't thought of it\nWay and you're right and what happened here's the problem with being in DC all the time like me is you take that for a grain of salt because it is kind of the way the swamp ... so I I never really reacted to that but your one hundred percent on target\nWhy would you need political cover to vote for somebody who has false allegations against them and I say they're false because they're not proven they're not\nThere's no witnesses and the witnesses that were um that were identified either denied it or refuted it so you're right sheriff Clarke what political covered you need for that\nYou don't you just need look there's there's no evidence and it's incredible and uh\nI think Jeff Flake is going to vote no he's he's he's got some I\nSaid this earlier today it's got some imaging his head where he's got to be you know lying eyes he's going to be the darling of the New York times it will be you know featured on CNN has some great free thinker or something\nSo it really comes down to a Collins and Murkowski I mean that's what it comes down to what do you think they're going to do on Saturday sheriff Clarke\nI don't know what to think in terms of what they're going to do is pretty cool it flip flop around they don't vote their conscience it's really hard to say I mean we'll go to John McCain made it so rest in peace was going to vote a tool eliminate Obamacare and he came in there\nAnd that's the deciding vote to keep it alive so it's hard to say that the politicians you don't know where they're coming from it it's all of them are in the swamp and and you know the market by the minute so in terms of Collins and Murkowski probably whoever gets to where we're going to vote\nYou know what that that that might very well be it so I guess you could say if the FBI re port is released we think it'll it it it could be this evening early tomorrow if there's nothing in it then they have the whatever it is political cover they needed and you would think this nomination would go through\n'em let me just ask you this if it doesn't go through what type of the fact you think that's going to have sheriff David Clarke on Republican turnout on November six only thirty three days away\nAnd that sort of an effect because political fatigue is sitting John you know that yes we've done everything we again conservative voters the", "show_name": "Mark Levin Show", "year": "2018", "city": "Portsmouth",
