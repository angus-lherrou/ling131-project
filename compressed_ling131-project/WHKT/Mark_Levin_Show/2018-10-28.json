not big for that you know they're trying to portray me as crazy based on I guess Halloween costumes and you know me John I have a good time so\nIt's ... it's just it's amazing that last week she pretty much apologizes for marginalizing veterans says she's going to stick to issues then she puts out a commercial\nOr calling me an extremist and trying to make fabricated things up again this is what the left does their own hands it's desperate ploy by desperate candidates and that's why common sense is back that's why conservatism is back and that's why I'm going to win the fifth\nCommon sense back in your commander of commonsense Dennis ... without running for Congress step district Virginia let's get to the caravan I'm the president with my later today saying you've got to deploy a thousand troops you\nGot to do a series of executive orders that would stop the caravan from coming into the United states the problem is as soon as they step foot and say the word asylum we can't do anything or ... wars in the loop holes in them Denver are written in such a way that all they\nHave to do was get a job when get their hand grabbed and say asylum and then we can't do anything they could not go back what you've seen the president's proposed action\nHere if you were in Congress now what would Denver Riggleman being proposing on the air about twelve\nOr a rule of law and uh we're we're we're a nation of laws and we believe in the rule of law and the way the law was written written right now you're exactly right John I don't know you know how we we don't honor that based on what we believe us conservatives in rural and and people who follow the rule of law however\nI think Congress needs to start fixing is immigration laws as soon as possible and I also believe once that happens or vetting process for any of these people that are coming through has to be extreme vetting\nUh we do have some of the technology in place now but we don't put time limits on this if there's that many people that are headed towards the border or we don't know what to do better than those in John my biggest fear um it's easy you know it's like a Trojan Horse right listen Ninety five\nPercent Ninety nine percent of those people could actually be seeking asylum um does that you know our hearts sort of go out to and with compassion however if you have people inside there that are bad actors and they're able to hide you know within this caravan\nWe have to a fair amount and my guess is this going to be sending some pretty healthy intelligence assets down range I think we're going to be monitoring and my guess is I can only speculate\nSeeing any type of emissions that are coming out of there talking about radio emissions or any kind of been told that we can glean this is not a good situation this is not good and at some point I think we have to fix our immigration laws in a way that again are are\nMuch more common sense than the sort of as sort of ridiculous since we have now are going on on the border\nUm the\nI think the concern that everyone has Denver is that okay there's\nTwelve or Thirteen or fourteen thousand people we have to deal with it and uh everybody wants to be concerned everybody's concerned about the humanitarian aspect but a lot of my color is he has what their concern with okay if they get in\nIs this Fifteen thousand gets in the next one is going to be a hundred and fifty thousand and you're not gonna be able to stop that either because we'll never get a wall up in time and even if you have a while to get a hundred and fifty thousand people that it's just a lot of people so um are you in favor of the president\nTaking action now to stop a that's a mob caravan from bomb rushing the border and coming in are you in favor of stopping them from coming in now\nYes yes I mean it's it's I mean this is a matter of national\nSecurity or it is a matter of precedent um and again this comes back to that was a normal American\nWill say hey you know we understand people want to come to the United states but there is a legal process [noise] um and we're gonna have to we're going to have to file that legal process you know we we think that legal process needs to be applied all immigrants and you and you're exactly right John this would set a precedent that could really be damaging\nTo the United states' security to our policies and to our\nRole of law or you're right it's the ... we just allow everybody in we're actually sort of acknowledging that open borders what we want if we don't follow the rule of law and we don't stop these\nThese migrants sadly we we have to stop them from coming in and set a precedent Denver\nThe birds are in about five or ten minutes the U.S government is going to release the new economic numbers or GDP expected to grow again this quarter at so\nOver four percent could be four point one four point to four point three a bomb autonomy was choking along in about a half percent growth this growth unprecedented where do you look for in that report in ... which can close and you think you might draw out of it on the economy gender recommend\nWell the thing up first I'm going to look for [laughter] and it's just because I'm\nA geek out on the stuff is I'm going to look at the specific whatever report that I have I'm going to look at the number of jobs are based on that are open right now and I look at Virginia but I also see where we're going as far as the unemployment but GDP gross I'm going to look at manufacturing I'm look at agriculture\nI Love looking into the numbers to see where that grow Dennis and if we're continuing on this line John if we're continuing with the lowest unemployment claims in forty nine years of her continuing with Los minority unemployment for continuing which he ... he grows four percent of every quarter which you know is amazing a it's a new normal was too I mean is this\nLet's work on the job for for Mac worse opportunities zones can be lovers here in the in the commonwealth a ... and opportunities on investment all the things that we look at to encourage opt entrepreneurship to encourage people keeping their own money is working and that's what I'm gonna look at it this report is is this just a continuation\nOf this amazing amazing surge\nOr are we seeing an even more positive future for the people enough that district but also in the United states and then the commonwealth of Virginia I think we are I think we're just seeing the beginning of this economic boom and um I I'm\nReally just really excited to see what those numbers say based on where job growth among sectors are growing right now\n[noise] well it's going to be interesting to see these are coming out momentarily we expect that that we're going to get over four percent growth and it's really really tough for a Democrat\nRight now they're talking about economics the economy or any of the issues that pertain to jobs and prosperity in America so they'd rather talk about something else that's why your opponent was Coburn is talking about your Halloween costumes\nBecause he doesn't want to talk about the economy she doesn't want to talk about job she doesn't want to talk about growth doesn't want to talk about kids moving out of the basement she doesn't want to talk about the boom and small businesses doesn't want to talk about the deregulation she doesn't want to talk about the number of investments that are going on because of the\nTax cuts especially as it relates to one hundred percent deduction of capital investments Rob didn't even understand it and so she doesn't want to do with any any of that she'd rather\nTalk about your Halloween costume in two thousand five\nYeah and I mean which I Will not take down off the net by the way so here's what she would rather talk about she'd rather talk about forty million dollars in spending not only for Medicare for all but also for forgetting student debt right which is one point for a trillion dollars right now free community college for all are free college for all\nEverything she had an even a debate she was like I Want to give away this she doesn't understand the taxpayer money is what you're using I get so limited based on what I thought for you know in government overreach she says she loves government I fear government\nI think government should be limited I think government should be a fish and she's also said that taxpayer money for the middle class is nothing more than confetti she's compared eyes to the Nazis I mean I I find it's a stunning John ... anybody would vote for Leslie\nHer views are great for San Francisco and maybe a three square mile area there or somewhere up in Georgetown right in DC but for the fifth district it's absolutely appalling\nThat she thinks these values are actually a political ball to the people the fence is not every day and work for a living and don't give a rat's with the chattering class is saying on CNN or MSNBC or any of these other far left\nAnd then they are now they're just they're just propaganda machines and I think at some point uh that's going to break through that you have comments you have this coalition of common sense against progressive ...\nAnd I think that's what's happening in the fifth district and we're going to win this John because I represent American values I represent conservative values but I represent what the fifth wants to do right now\nAnd that's why we're going to win this\nDenver Riggleman I Want to thank you for being with us what's your website\n[noise]

they're simply going to buy the weapons from China or Russia so why would I Do that here's the other people said oh the president's position has or has keeps changing no the president hasn't had\nA position [noise] other than you discourage the idea\nOf scrapping the arms deal everything\nElse was on the table including withdrawing or support from the Saudi average coalition in a you have any civil war so everything else was on the table so to say that well his position keeps changing he hasn't had a tradition he's done commentary\nWhat'd you devolve based on new facts to come out and the Saudis have changed their story ten times did they change it again yesterday and don't change it again tomorrow\nAs more facts to come out so I\nDon't understand what they're saying the president has changed his position as I have a position he's waiting for the fact that President Trump is not a politician he's a businessman here's our businessmen make decisions facts numbers spreadsheets and math\nSo at the facts come in and the mathematical equation gets put\nTogether his commentary evolved\nAs information changes that's what are you supposed to do the end of the day I don't know what the final outcome of the U.S reactions you got to be but I've been saying this all week in the middle middle Middle East on TV this president\nOut crown prince Mohammed bin Solomon like ...\nI don't think that goes over well with President Trump he doesn't like being lied to here's the other thing like dealing with an incompetent people he doesn't have a lot of patients\n\nI'm telling you crown prince\n\nMohammed bin Salman is incompetent everything the guy at thirty three years old has gotten involved in has been a complete undone mitigated disaster for the Saudi kingdom I put somebody else in\nThe country to to lead because it's guys and capable of being king because he does stupid stuff including this assassination allegedly\n\nThe Saudis have now ... settle but I guess on a final story they're saying but that's going\nTo change again so who knows what\nThe uh the show ... case has here's what it's tough it is really brought\nRenewed focus to the Saudi Emirates tactics and the support that we're giving them and getting involved in the Yemen's civil war which is causing a horrific very disturbing very growing humanitarian\nCrisis where I just tried to tell you the\nUm on outages here every day I see the pictures you do see because ah the fake news networks today they don't want to show your real news they want to talk about\nYou know President Trump and Stormy Daniels or whatever they do\nBut I\nI see the pictures on TV and I mean it'll really tear out your stomach you've got children just starving I mean they can eat that they they got mother's stripping bark for trees bark and boiling it just matching it up just so there's\nSomething and that's and that's in the stomach green grass\nI mean there's no food\nI mean just think about having a child you're sitting you know they starve to death me thinking about how that feels in this thing is is a horror show it is worse than the area it's worse than anything I've seen and\nOur involvement in it is shameful it is absolutely shameful and if there's anything that's going to come out of the show you fair or\nWe're going to get the hell out of there as we should it just it it's\nHorrific that the United states is involved in something of this nature all because you know we've got the Iranian booking men with their nineteenth street poets or whatever they have lifted the phone lines Mike in Oakland you're you're on the air Mike\nHey John yup oh yeah I agree with you on the up and say I think you're exactly right about that so I Hope that comes up with this for anything that could come out of this\nSomething you said just a few minutes ago I'm sure you could pick up on it if you don't agree but um they said the president or the two things he doesn't like he doesn't like to be lied to and he doesn't like incompetent and I I Can't help it must be he just wants all that to him so\nHe really likes to lie to us and I feel that he's incompetent for the jobs is doesn't want to share those two things with others\n[noise] well I guess uh I guess you'd say just tremendous economic renaissance and it's full make tremendous economy and we have an all these jobs I guess you think that's the work of incompetence I guess you'd think the fact that we haven't heard from ISIS in that\nThey've been kicked kicked out of the majority of their caliphate and they they not only can throw a tiny part of terror tore yet when he took over it was not to get you you think that's a topic I guess you\nThink that the fact that the wacko when North Korea\nHas not done a nuclear test and see right now my kitchen thing that's on top of that I guess you think all these new jobs and we have the fact that when did you keep going up and the confidence and there's a tax cut and you figure that's an confident so I guess your nights definition of incompetence Mike\nUntil just a little bit different I guess it is\nYou know some of those things could have happened whether he was in office are not\nSure that's the\nMain one night there was\nSomeone who is competent in that position what kind of physician BMI Libyan right thank you ...\nThank you for straightening yeah it's your economy

this guy got chopped up and uh\nBasically got out of there and some kind of doggie bags and they buried him in the garden or something I mean the whole thing is it just a horrible situation but look a\nCrown prince Mohammed bin Sommer the administration's part a lot of things to this guy Jared Kushner has\nAnd a lot of people are saying\nYou know maybe this guy's just incompetent and capable of running the country everything he touches turns to crop whether it's the Yemeni civil war after disaster the gang of four embargo against the state of guitar that backfired and blow up in their face guitars better off today than they were\nNow we've got this thing where they changed their story night time what do we do here\nOr John as you point out it's clear that show was brutally murdered it's clear that it was premeditated it's clear that that I think the crown prince knew about that a NBS Mohammed bin Salman\nIs I think have a lot to answer for and I think they have to be held accountable though I Do think that there has to be significant a penalty that they stop her eye\nI Believe that it can carry on and continue the relationship with Saudi Arabia which I Do think we need to but\nCan that be with the crown prince I think that's a pretty compelling question I think the administration is going to have to ask that I think Congress will eventually addressed that an asset to you know what will be the penalties are to uh to Saudi Arabia I Wish I understand the impact\nOf those of those contracts for what we're doing to supply a military uh equipment to Saudi Arabia I I think Saudi Arabia I can be a like a a force on that\nIs is a is a is an ally to us in the in the middle east but I don't think that it can it can be that type of ally that we wanted that we need if this is how they're going to\nOperate I mean we have ... you know we have principles in the United states that we that we stand by and our allies have to have to abide by those and I just don't see Saudi\nArabia doing that you know you you're pointing out the issue with Yemen too and you and I have talked about that before a\nThose are all questions I think that come up and how we see Saudi Arabia operating in the region house policy\nIs being played out and are are they are they doing the sayings necessary in that region or that create stability and that and that are working in the in the best interest of all involved not just\nSaudi Arabia but uh other allies in the middle east and listen I I I understand what they're doing that to push back against the Iranians but are are they doing things that in the long term about moving the middle east in the right direction I think those are questions that we have to ask\n... foreign policy standpoint and I think that U.S policy toward Saudi Arabia you know needs to needs to be directed by those I think very a very sobering issues that we have for us\nSo there's like congressman Whitman or were killed agreement and it seems like what you're saying is the best way to solve this is a four crown prince MPs will hammered than solving to maybe a step aside for someone else had his father put somebody else in their final question I\nOnly have half a minute and I got to get your weather right out so very quickly um is there going to be a vote in Congress on our involvement in the Yemeni civil war and backing the Saudi Emirates coalition yes or no\nI'm John I I I I Can't can't predict that because I don't know where the discussion is going to go over all with Saudi Arabia but I Would say that it won't be it will be part of the debate in Congress about what our policy is I Wish Saudi Arabia and conflict there in Yemen\nOr they got to go more information Robert ... dot com Rob Wittman duck out early voting it started in Virginia you

has the thirteenth point lead over Barbara Comstock every journal poll that\nI have seen on top stock every internal poll that his pay four and a lot of money show this race a dead heat or Comstock\nSlightly ahead and the Washington Post has got ... down by Thirteen this is a complete and utter\nLie and it's been on fake news and it's beyond the onion it's beyond the national Enquirer
