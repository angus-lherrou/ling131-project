I'm doing fine I'm this is a little bit different because normally me six days out here's what I've been saying for a decade or all the early ballots are coming in and they all play with the ... the Democrats are all in the heavy\nHeavily democratic populated areas the Democrats do a better job of getting all the early ... blah blah blah blah but I've been saying that for a decade now though it's different early ballots\nWhat they are cutting at a at a at a pretty high paid and\nYou know we don't ... you might stand to early voting because of course that's not accept following it doesn't it only holds a party essentially it only reveals the ah the party that's floating but you know well I we think you know Republicans are obviously going to likely vote Republican so it's it's encouraging signs you see and it also might indicate that\nThe public polling is going to crack as you well know\nPublic calling was often typical Michigan Wisconsin for the president of the sixteen he prevailed despite what polling sad that\nMaybe at work here as well or to state like Michigan where we have a rock star candidate John games oh we're in New Jersey for instance where that is within two points according to internal falling from the humane can't taste so those races which aren't equal territory might very well lives go our way and hope you know of course you know it's a hot\nHistorically seeking but nevertheless accuracy early voting numbers like you said and if I hadn't Trump voter being real really don't know what happened on election night it might be a far stronger than I've been ... for Republicans in the media will tell you\nAll right let's get to the house failing it looks a just be honest here um this is talk past way the Republicans are playing defense in the house\nThey have since the first special election I think that was and chances are ... or something or the Republicans are plays for the entire time unlike the U.S Senate which will join them than it with her own office so here's what Scott Ross wants to talk of the other day he said look\nRepublicans the progression he's twenty three seats everybody knows that she said well she each are gone the Republicans are not going to win those those are better flipped veiled women is already over other almost by double digits so he says it's not\nReally twenty three if you love it and he said uh so there's Lebanon sees that the Democrats have to wait to get the dance she was she the gamble and then he said there are thirty seats that are toss ups are in place or\nTwenty nine of those Republicans of which Democrats have to win the limit of the twenty nine or twelve of the story if one looks the other way is that an accurate analysis\nI think that is that spot on Iraq of course with the most accurate falls at twenty six you know ... I thought where\nHad it was you know I I was getting a liberal school serves a little more leeway to lower expectations are that the liberal whole search six yes that lean democratic and likely democratic seats which would be pick up on\nOur ... our number ... Seventeen of Republican pickup such huge so basically that means that the Democrats to start with the Fifteen feet advantage I Know you said Scott's at eleven I trust his numbers on board that the liberal pulling I was looking at let's say they start with Fifteen basically they're twenty nine times that's see some Republicans have\nTo win two thirds as does the encouraging thing though is up to twenty sees in Eighteen is that President Trump won that district in many cases by double digits so if the Trump voter become the Republican voter we can hold on to the house that might be just as he sees it can certainly be done\nThe rest of us are said well we're God you're you're basically estimating seeing her gun rights\nAnd I just cut political record at my face and I don't really believe that will get off track number four and you know I I was going off the hook but I think probably more accurate to say a lot\nYeah well it's I mean that's it you've got a eleven seats that the Democrats are going to have to win but you know we might be up to very late now there's a there's a there's a juicy says Minnesota that could slip for the Republicans are that that adds to the number both of those I'm\nScott has a one leading jammed the other Todd that\nWas one of the ones you have tied but I've got people in Minnesota telling me the Republicans are going to win those two states that changes that have been so it's ... who knows here's what we do that when you got to get off your job and you got to go vote\nAnd bring all your friends to the polls that's that's what you have to do and then we'll see what happens right okay I'm going to get a quick word from our sponsors want to get back we're going to talk\nAbout the U.S just a U.S senator or see ground game watch different gee what is going on with his robs them robbing I was getting all this money like what is it up with this woman all that when\nI get back on the job triggers radio networks\nTrucking the truth across America fake news here I'm your Godzilla of the truth in America be right back stay with us\nPeople Bernstein I'm spending twenty two million dollars to get permission to raise our taxes my town [noise] and when they need to to try and kill them were [noise]\nGive me the plea bargain to finally [noise] like [noise] for the union are independent police is Barbara Comstock\nI'm Barbara Comstock candidate for Congress and I approve this message paid for it like contact the kind of thinking it was just saying this is a blue wave prominent Democrats are going\nTo win a huggers for Republicans and Democrats don't bother to work don't knock on doors nobody don't do anything he throws the polling numbers show the Republicans do enjoy the weekend's game and have a they connected on line I think um wherever\nYou go to get the free John Frederick show ads on radio show all the way here from your emails you don't have been American to me [noise]\n[noise] [noise]\n\nThey don't call of the commander of common sense or another thing\nI'm not a holy city area of the Republican National committee Democrat National Committee any campaign or anybody else so I'm going to call it like I see\nIt [noise] make sure to get your big boy parents don't cry baby diapers [noise]\nHere that John Frederick show [noise]\nFirst radio network truck the truth across America Kelly vaccinated with that I you know from a she\nThe oldest CNN that I'm going to do for a while I'm done with that three times a week for how many years whatever is enough but you know from CNN a defending President Trump or back in the day and now she is the chief spokesperson of the Republican National committee a\nLet's get to the U.S Senate where the Republicans are on up as I've been going to pick up five seats I wouldn't be surprised if you pick sixteen so let me give me the races and a judge George ... let's start with ... with a whole a\nHow're against Rosen can you hold that seems", "show_name": "Mark Levin Show", "year": "2018", "city": "Portsmouth", "day": "01"}
