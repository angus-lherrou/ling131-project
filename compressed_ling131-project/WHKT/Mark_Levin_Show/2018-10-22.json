[laughter] I'm over ... are you this morning you tell me how are you\nI'm doing well doing well busy busy these days but uh but but doing well\nGet mad at me and I tell ya I work as a model endorsement but there's a a reflection of what I saw when you were in the general assembly working again I think we're in the ad commuted together you're always justice energetic smiling go get them kind of guy you know like the um like Mickey Rooney was put on the show you're always just like vibrant are you able to maintain that\nYes you know I I Am you know I'm blessed to represent great post and the and the first district you know I I get my energy from that they are very very passionate individual that they work hard every day and uh do do great work so it's hard not to be motivated by that but it it's hard\nNot to be motivated to ah by the by the troop honor that it is to represent them\nAnd I appreciate that and I'm having been in that position\n\nWell you know Chris I mean I think at certain times it it it does it does give you pause as to you know where we are at the country and the divisions that are out there but but I always work every day to try to find places where we agree I think I think today it takes a little more effort to do that but\nIs that you have deadlines are constitutionally a enacted that hold the line on these things you can't go to continuing resolution that's an awful turn\nOff but they also have I I Love the single object rule in in legislation ... where do you deal with one subject and that's it you don't have this big mash up coming back from the other from the Senate or vice versa\nThat just just blows up the whole deal\nNo I agree and and probably be a good good good is that in the in the U.S house we are going under the same rules you operate during the general assembly justices you and I both know that as your\nSpeaker said throughout the rules about how things are happening around but the site has different rules so it's kind of get combined together and you look at and go with Alice is related in any way shape or form in the the the the\nThe most highlighted example is an airport or Iraq passed the title of the bill was not the sort of Iraq they they they took they took custody bill ... all the language you out of it kept the number and the title of the survey or the house version of the ...\nSo it it it's that kind of procedural stuff it's just shake my head what how could that happen\nBut I Would argue that\nYou know sticking with the logic of systems like you see injustices Mandy what was the way to make sure that your teeth debate on track you make sure you don't have a lot of you know Don related after a piece of legislation people go how does that get in there and it's kinda like you know throwing everything on the last train leaving the stage fright\nAnd all that stuff doesn't doesn't belong there are not related or ... years you know as the ... as as a vehicle to pass things that aren't aren't really so I agree and that's that's one of the I think the problems up here is that it doesn't it doesn't require\nThat necessarily debate in clubs players see when you're using a that mechanism when you have unrelated\nAh aspects of legislation or language make their way into a bill\nOr people just you know look at it and go how how could that happen\nI Hope you all will take a look at some of the rules and get more to wherever of Virginia way of governing up in DC because\nI I one of the things that uh when you pull back from politics and and watch sports people get upset when they see rules violations because they know the rules right up to me last night there was a pitcher Justin Berliner through as a slider it was beautiful water\nAnd and Ron Paul and use the pitcher for the Mets and the AIDS and some other teams\nSaid that is a pitch you when you are warming up to you put your down and say grab Patel I'm drawn that's a perfect pitch and it was and it was called the ball\nAnd the next pitch the Boston Red Sox guy hit it for a home run and as a as a fan you go that's outrageous only because the the the teleprompter had on there and the strike zone\nAnd people in in politics people they don't know the rules to get upset about not just not cricket you're not doing it the right way guys you know we deserve better and so they pulled back behind the ... they they shrugged their shoulders and throw their hands\nYou know it's just it's just not working I'm On my on my behalf you know I I don't get it right in the distance and or anything you can do to to to change that I Would be for the benefit of my rent let's get back to the absolute let's get back to the national district what what are your voters telling you\nWell you know we're hearing a lot of state I think that they're that they're very interested in how do we getting a a continual I'm including\nShould our economy I think people are are very positive about where the top down I think they appreciate what's been done by Congress lessons regulatory burden in changing the tax code to make it easier for businesses and visuals\nAre the things that they want to see going forward or what I call the Stanley Park Germany economy and first of that I was\nHaving an education system that assures that our children students get to watch the series uh educational experience to be watching them\nTo feel the jobs are there are seven point one million jobs so Chris and Seventy five percent of those jobs will not require a four year degree and that means we have to emphasize career and technical education\nAs much as we do common strike education because\nThat's where the jobs are in those Josh today are skilled jobs that have ... as far as a career when you go from an crime is journey into a pastor and have a career there and do start early well in many instances\nBetter than you wrote him a job that requires a college degree so I think people look at that and say that's where we have the right\nHands are looking at going how it's going to make sure\nThe child is soft on like how do we make sure the education system gives them the knowledge skills abilities\nTo compete for the jobs that are available today enter the future and I think businesses look at it and say hey the other things and the economy are going really well the Chris and I talked to instances across it this way I can tell you the top three things they talk to me about our workforce workforce and workforce or you know they say\nWe can grow up business today if we can just find work has to do the job it was you know there are job openings to go into our buildings job openings show where am I going to happen here but I'm going to happen in one other element to this article\nIn today's broadband Hillary for people with the connection\nIs important and that was a supporter of education so that a lot of families children through school or their tablet computers and bring them home\nAnd they can't connect it's hard for them to do the assignments that they've been given or the soap opera get equal taken one of the library Donaldson why five businesses many times the areas that don't have high speed can't\nDo the business they needed to be successful\nAnd her one of the ways to bring about health care\nThis can connect with patients clock on how to go to an office going ... miles and miles away and can get care in quality time with those things are gaining changed right so we really what brought down but we have to make sure we have education such a size is Korean talking legislation as much as that goes college truck education\nAnd these are these are these are tough issues because people don't go broadband\nWorkforce development those those don't get the people out to the to the polls I mean they're just like man that makes sense I like that you know 'cause when when people get down into the\nThe ... talked about with other callers today in politics in the garbage complex and people don't like complex they're like five were bumper stickers because they're pretty busy trying to make their lives working in putting that into the context of their daily lives come out and vote whichever way is a tall order for a lot of politicians right\nSure\nPolicy and complicated and it takes time of the heart of her off\nFor for anybody anybody in our leadership position whether electorate up positive outlook on power stations and you know those things that aren't project are really still on the things I hear up or it's just something that I come up with some people say\nHey let's just hope and gas companies soundbites in a way to help our economy\nBut drill down is okay we've done the economy and you can always say I'm not quite shocked about the last\nI don't think people are in law I don't want our own office or asking for people to say one of the things I've done that's great you know chocolate set up to an ACC and eat that's great but what people want to hear to work if I'm going to place\nNow when you were getting on what are you going to do in the future how do you understand\nThings yet to eat on and what are you going to eat to accomplish that what do you what you want to come back to us or\nIf you are re election as approachable nocturnal last sort of things on on what I was able to accomplish and and I just don't want that they want you to understand what's important and they want you to project additional for the future about how they're still going to be addressed so it's not just on the list of questions on it\nWhat are you going to connect with Arnold stolen people's concerns\nAnd the child she say she ... she says she should\nTell people audiences all the time I talk to him politics is about the future not that bad\nIt is and you can like what could happen to various the economy's great unemployment is historically low and they just threw out the government pretty much there's yeah who's going to ... there's some there's some undertow currents that you just have to go out there and pound doors\nYou understand and listen to people\nBecause the elections are about tomorrow night yesterday that the company right Rob I really appreciate your calling in today we wish you the best out there in the campaign trail you got what Eighteen days left\nEighteen days left\n[laughter] everybody 'cause we've only got four hundred and Seventy two days to the Iowa caucuses that day and isn't that fun\n[noise] well there was already out there are already out there getting their campaign strategist and consultants lined up for them for the caucuses and people are starting backs and all that kind of stuff that never ends Virginia is always a test case and\nNow we're blessed for people who who offer themselves up

joined up\nWould have done better than some people I says\nThe painted certainly did in the last ... primary I did that make him viable going forward because people will say well he's got a built in base of support in the parking\nLot to be reckoned with or will people say you had your chance on the stage when you've lost several times show or a time to exit great\nQuestion Julian thanks for calling and I would suggest that it is dependent upon how well he actually does\nRelative to the national spread and the Virginia I'm nor does I think the the the north some race last year was a point that's a big number if you're a Republican especially because three years before that\nThat Gillespie got within here's breath and a beauty mark Warner I think if he's in double digit losses it's very difficult for him to\nTo ah to run again a state wide but who knows I Do think the Republican Party is going to be going through some changes are going to look at some soul searching after this election you know um and there'll be looking at new directions new candidates or to to go forward I don't know how much staying power Korea would have\nWith a double digit loss and they'll just after three statewide offices but thanks for calling it\nGot the other questions no sir have a good broadcast\nThanks man hey uh NBA what do you like to have the warriors or you know my condition if anybody but the war [laughter] Heathrow in Golden State in the in the finals or the playoff let's got to be one of a couple of got to be Boston Celtics looking pretty good\nWho else in the west yeah\nI bought Boston most people will see what happens with the rockets that they can integrate their new pieces including Carmelo Anthony hold a lot of people are down on 'em\nThere's a reason for the very good well RIMPAC\nLesson I think Carmen Carmelo has his shortcomings but I think the sort of move up in a recent the bias overlooks a a pretty pretty impressive tenure in the lead a despite some of his uh his recent a sort of a downgrade in his in his game\nSo we'll see you know I'm you know I got from Philadelphia connection so I've always got a soft spot in my heart for the Sixers ah I'm I'm I'm not sure if they are quite ready to make the leap but we'll see other than anybody but them lawyers or\nFive six seven Philadelphia Seventy six or something like that we all these advantage over the shoulders\nSome sort of ingrained in more than Seventy Sixers culture back in the day but the proceeds Conan joins argue circular you too thanks okay as a doctor McDougal patiently waiting for us Yes

folks if you're listening to stock in cardboard boxes whatever the company is publicly traded\nThat mix cardboard boxes that Amazon buys by that stock because we have so much cardboard box in our garage backed up every ... oh my\nGod we're we're right there with you yet are I'm sure\nSo a doctor Robin McDougal is with the Virginia Commonwealth University ... Wilder school tell us briefly about the Wilder school when you're doing\nYes so uh where we're at school of government and public affairs at least here um rented the top in US News and World Report for schools the public affairs for undergraduate and graduate programs focused on criminal justice homeland security and emergency preparedness\nPublic administration as well\nAs programs in the master's level and urban and regional planning and a PHD program on public policy and then we also have our Center for public policy which I direct which is our\nConsulting and community engagement arm of the work we do in the wild her school say you will see a lot of things around economic development of leadership in training local and state government outreach and things like public policy polling\nThat we deal with it in the center for public policy in the wild her school\nWe're going we're coming up pulling real quick but you guys actually go out and work with uh other local governments and businesses that you helped him not just I think people don't understand that about higher education the value that you bring to the community and the state yes\nWe really do I mean we're done\nEverything from looking at helping ... looking at potentially providing incentives for certain business to come into their community and doing a return on investment of what that economic impact it looked like on the proposal said with regard to incentive then come back and provided down that actual economic impact\nIf they went forward with a business and the impact that it had on the community with everything from revenue to job creation other aspects in that way I we've done valuations of um you know criminal justice programs to the implementation of a mental health program or\nA drug treatment program on reducing recidivism for local jail or or or\nA community partner we worked with a non profit from everything from the valuation of the programs in projects that they do you are so coordinating and combining the\nActual health but they need with regards to our students and our\nPrivate sector as well in the business community\nAre looking at um third party evaluations of programs in projects for the private sector looking to pitch to the general assembly and need an actual third party non biased evaluation of that\nWork being able to provide that report or for that company for the general assembly to look at legislative impacts so we do we are a continual partner\nEvery single day with our local and state governments around the commonwealth um and it it really is what we live and breathe in the ... school specifically\nUm we do it at a much more um cost effective rate than our private sector counterparts if you will because it really is our mission or vision and it allowed to bring to bear are academic\nExperts he says well within the Wilder school you know we have over thirty academic faculty who this is their area of expertise if you want to talk about the economic impact I've got four economist\nIn our urban and regional planning program or you want to talk about the impact of an opiate program a treatment program I've got to criminal justice or\nAcademic see that their area of expertise and they get asked all around the country to look you know present their research and were able to bring that expertise to bear for our localities ... in the commonwealth in Virginia\nSo that when you're a service higher education in school\nWhen we we are we are\nYou know we we provided all give us your you're going to say we will educate their freshman in college through graduate school and teach me program\nGive us your workers that we will train them in an executive leadership and management preparation give us your legislators and you're allowed to us and we will train them and policy analysis and the impact\nOf a variety of hanging on legislation and um give us your community that will help you come up with good solutions and then give you the evaluation of the impact on this list that we really are I'm not one stop all encompassing education and consulting\nAcademic arm for a local and state government and our our citizens and students around the common law\nAnd that's what I brought it up and we'll go to the polling that you're with your operations down there because I think it's so important for people to understand the totality of a lot of things that governments especially hurricane which has a bull's eye on his back around the country than in Virginia\nWe've got a great higher education system we really need to be proud of it\nUh even though it's you know it's it's appropriate to hold them accountable and ask them questions but\nA lot of things you're talking about are free they are exclusive of of usual operations and they are a complementary to what you are doing and actually facilitate what you were doing a higher education I think it's wonderful I think it's misunderstood not understood at all but most jumping to some polling\nA while the school has done\nWhat are you seeing out there or what have you seen what direction are we going\nWhy don't we talk a little bit under Clinton on earlier so let's talk a little bit about poverty in in polling in public policy that we can get on this summer we were out alive we'll have another call rolling right here after the election in November but in our in our public policy arena you talked about higher ed\nUnions around the entire commonwealth so a true representative sample of all five region um of our commonwealth and when we look at and ask\nPeople what they think about the value of higher education in Virginia over eighty percent of our responded believed that the community colleges that we haven't\nForgetting yeah or work their costs over sixty five percent believe that our public four year institutions are worth the cost and then right\nUnder fifty percent believe that our\nPrivate schools in the commonwealth of work the car so it's really important that you said that question around down in Virginia we value higher education and not only did we value it but we're putting out a product that comes around the commonwealth bank is age appropriate return on investment they believe that the cost that we have for higher\n[noise]\nBreaking news is our from town hall by Tom I keep leader President Trump says

interesting things here or that is going on is this caravan which many of these migrants have\nCrossed Mexico I'm not sure I'm not sure really how steadfast the Mexican effort was in order to stop the caravan but we understand the others it's about five thousand people strong\nAnd many of them have gotten through\nThe Mexican authorities they were stopped on a bridge they jumped in the river many of them now just getting through than the other way to the United states now the Trump Administration has got to make a decision in a very short period of time\nOn this caravan I'm just going to say this straight out when you have four or five thousand people storming your country and this is what this says they're storming the border their strength in numbers they're getting money along the way they are being encouraged\nAs the president said we don't know who's part of this certainly CNN is gonna play mom with babies that's all they're going to play they're not going to play the traffickers or anyone else that happens to be involved in it that might not be the type of\nPerson you want the United states are open to show the mouse with the babies but at the end of the day you have five thousand people crashing the border of the United states where I come from at sixty years old I think that's called an invasion I don't know what else do you call it a migrant right at what is it a like may we come in\nI mean we have laws in this country the president kind of have to act out as he has no choice and he threatened to send the military there uh hopefully they'll turn back hopefully they'll turn back and they have to turn back and fix their own countries everybody would love to come to the United states as an economic refugee\nWe'd fill the country up with five being people and it would collapse you simply cannot allow five thousand people to simply storm over the border and then be fed clothes that occasion and who's paying for it\nAnd the minute you do that the next year\nComing that is absolutely coming and it's coming sooner than you think it is because thousands of these um what what you want to call them migrants or a\n... resume their journey on Sunday despite a Mexican Government or just submit\nTo processing by the immigration authorities they simply ignored or just like the will ignore ours and the differences CNN will be there with cameras and God Forbid and all they're going to do is take pictures of moms with babies that's it they're gonna put all the miles with babies up at the front and take all the pictures\nAnd I don't know one or the CNN people and all the other liberals just take them into their home and go through but just drive your car down there take five of them in driving through the process of yourself spending money how's the feed them clothe them I don't know maybe you do that they're not going to that they're not going to do it\n\nAnd all of the news that you're going to see is about how mean we are and not letting them at\n\nIt's incredible now this was going to turn into a major campaign issue and to be ... this is the worst possible scenario\nYou're talking about an October surprise here it is you're watching five thousand people trying to innovate the United states from the southern border and there's no wall and President Trump got elected on this issue and now here comes a week before the election a week\n\nAnd a James says there's the timing of this caravan interesting yes I think maybe it was put together they thought it would help the Democratic wraps because we have kids in cages again it's going to blow up in their faces are back fire\nI mean average Americans look at this and they're like I don't think it's a good thing for tens of thousands of people just stormed the country I mean that's where the Taliban is your storming the country\n\nIt's just not like you're just a group of people in an orderly fashion or they sneak through a rancher there's a handful here and a handful there\nI mean you get five thousand people that's a mob and that's an invasion and what are we going to do there's no way to I mean what are you if you put the military and straighten them out at the border how are we going to stop and you're not going to shoot them so we're going to stop them\nThe confrontation goes on TV and the Democrats were screaming about how mean we are or Trump is it\nIt's a it's a powder keg it's a powder keg and you've got fourteen days away fourteen days but it's going to blow up because look if you looked at me right now I don't think you're excited about five thousand people just storming into the United states\nAnd breaking all of our laws and some of their nose at everything and then say take care of me I mean you don't have a country if you allow this to happen and Trump said something to get the relative agree with him he said\nThey're not going to stop it and the invitation is come on it he said the next ... will be fifty thousand is right because the Democrats are campaigning on what they meant basically they don't want to stop them I don't care what they say when they come on my radio show about secure the border chump change secure

all\nWell know number one others or even the president said at his rally that we're getting money he didn't know where you're from but there there's no evidence of coming from the United states doesn't mean it's not okay so let me just stop there doesn't mean it's not\nBut there is no direct evidence right now might come out this afternoon but right now\nUh there's no evidence linking to that the churches that make money off this the reason they make money is because they set up businesses in order to take the refugees in feed them close them and then they charge the government and\nThey're making very tidy profit off but then we got a lot of money means is this a migrant refugee illegal immigration thing\nThat people always find a way to make money off the government and so there's plenty companies associated with plenty of church is making a lot of money off the government because they provide for the food the clothing that housing in the education\nAnd they get more than they put out so it's becoming a very profitable business for people and these are short term is right\nIt's a very profitable business for\nIt it's almost all going to get back on it and then [noise] sending people down south\nTo get organized the rallies to bring people nor then you can say oh it's a [noise] it's organized crime\nAnd I think what you're going to take 'em very close to who's organizing these people who is finding these people and see if there are cities organizations here in the United states than profit off of them mhm once again here no good for\nIllegals coming means no meaning\nMake it ... Glen you make you make a very good are you making very good argument for that I mean they should get looked into now if it's being funded by drug runners and sex traffickers and other uh bad people that are have a better themselves in a caravan and if their funding it then there was a lot that we can do about that\nAnd there's a lot of people um who have inferred that that's where they're getting the money in order to make the trip to the United states is by bad actors or they\nHave access to resources that have a better themselves in the caravan whether it be sex traffickers drug traffickers meals if you'd call them uh you know there's been rumors that there's a a that there is other people from parts of the country in this caravan\nThe way that I like that it doesn't really matter who's there good bad or not it's an invasion at the end of the United states and if you let the stand if you let the stand if you let them come in\nI'm In the political pressure become such that they get in or the majority of them to get in five seven thousand to get in and you you know apprehend five hundred of them\nThe next terror van is not going to be seven thousand glad it's gonna be Seventy thousand and the one after that is going to be seven hundred thousand and then they're simply going to craft the United states and you can't do anything about it\nThe zero tolerance policy which was the antithesis of catch and release was put in place by the Trump Administration and Jeff Sessions in order to act\nAs a deterrent and for a short period of time it did until they have to go back to catch and release because they separated the kids from the parents are we got the CNN kids in cages headline and it all blew up and it was the PR disaster and that was the end of it\nAnd so you know there's that we have to figure this out\nAnd some kind of immigration reform in the hole in the Congress isn't going to do crap when you got seven thousand people ready to crash the border they they're going to have to figure it outside your blend but wants to see how that goes right\nAh meantime the uh the caravan is becoming an election issue the Democrats think it's going to help them they really do they think that the fact that these people are coming and there is moms with babies\nAnd it goes back to the kids in cages and don't you have a hard and Trump's meaning that over Trump supporters I mean they don't want help the kids will debate the moms with the babies are they think it's going to help them I think this is a disaster if you're the Democrats right now\nEvery day this caravan gets closer to the United states they are losing votes\nBecause people looked at this and they say the same thing I Do this is an invasion into our country\nThat we're powerless to stop powerless powerless because of the media and because of what happened with zero tolerance and so I don't think the president is kidding what he says he will put the military there\nBut you're gonna have to have a wall and then all gonna be camped out right at the border and they're going to need food or water and they're they're not going away they have to go back they have to turn back\nIt's got to be a very it's we we don't know how this is going to turn out but right now for the Denver crabs right now at the snapshot in time this is a political catastrophe for them\nTwo weeks before the election now what they're hoping it turns into is more kids in cages propaganda so then they can blame Trump the administration and Republicans on having the heart\nAnd separated kids from ... that's what they're hoping it turns out too but if it doesn't if it's just a humanitarian catastrophe on the border and people see pictures of ten thousand migrants tried to invade their country the Republicans going to hold the house\nBecause no one in their right mind tend to think that that is a good idea other than\nThe most left wing partisan that believe that every one that comes over as a potential democratic vote that's it and that does not represent the majority of people in America so the president regardless of the political ramifications\nPresident Trump ran out of this issue this was a signature issue it's coming for ... there is no wall\n[noise] but they have to do it in a way that is a ... in our value system if that makes sense\nGiven Williamsburg says this could be a powder keg if they get to the border before the election imagine troop stopping this that's what the Democrats are hoping I mean that's why they were behind this at the beginning to figure okay if we can get this and it's a PR catastrophe\nA with a military with bayonets and miles with babies\nI then uh it's it'll be great for the Denver crabs New York times poll CNN LA Times will be a beside themselves with clean so you're right\nThis is a powder keg uh Jennifer in Norfolk says\nThe gets back into the transgender issue has really complicated things were for the majority man just won the women's you see a cycling championship he identifies as a woman and won't suppress is just tossed around\nAny compete says a woman with a male body science is simply science we are different if as an adult somebody once a week that the fight as whatever so be it\nBut they shouldn't be identified as what science themes them at birth and should be listed as a male or female or their birth certificates\nI just don't have a lot of passion for the ... I'm Sorry I don't I'm pro gay rights or you want to identify as a woman and when it's cycling contest\nOr I guess eventually women that are real women are going to get mad over and filed a suit or something\nBut I just I'm passionate about this and that ... somebody wants to identify as a transgender and married other do whatever they want I just don't care I mean that's how they're made it and that's what they want to do and I have\nNo interest in it and uh I'm In favor of people identifying", "show_name": "Mark Levin Show", "year": "2018", "city": "Portsmouth", "day": "22"}
