anything or ... wars in the loop holes in them Denver are written in such a way\nThat all they have to do was get a toe in get their\nHand grabbed and say asylum and that we can't do anything they cannot go back what you've seen the president's proposed action here if you were in Congress now what we're Denver Riggleman the proposing on the ...\nYou know a rule of law and ah we're we're we're a nation of laws and we believe in the rule of law and the way the laws were written right now you're exactly right John I don't know you know how we we don't honor\nThat based on what we believe us conservatives in rural and and people who follow the rule ... however I think Congress needs to start fixing his immigration laws as soon as possible and I also believe once that happens\nAre vetting process for any of these people that are coming through has to be extreme vetting uh we do have some of the technology in place now\nBut we don't put time limits on this if\nThere's that many people that are headed towards the border uh we don't know what's in better than those in John my biggest fear um it's easy you know it's like a Trojan Horse right listen Ninety five percent Ninety nine percent of those people could actually be seeking asylum um though is that you know our hearts\nSort of go out to ... with compassion however\nIf you have people inside there that are bad actors and they're able to hide you know within this caravan we have to a fair amount and my guess is this going to be sending some pretty healthy intelligence assets down range I think we're going to be monitoring him I guess as I can only speculate right now my\nMissions that are coming out of there talking about radio emissions or any kind of been told that we can glean this is not a good situation this is not good and at some point I think we have to fix our immigration laws in a way that again are\nAre much more common sense than the sort of\nSort of ridiculous since we have now are going on in the border\nUm\nThe I think the concern that everyone has that ever is that okay there's twelve or Thirteen or fourteen thousand people we have to deal with it and\nUh everybody wants to be concerned everybody's concerned about the humanitarian aspect but a lot of my course here's what their concern with okay if they get in\nIf it's Fifteen thousand to get then the next one's going to be a hundred and fifty thousand and you're not going to be able to stop that either because we'll never get a wall up in time and even if you have a while to get a hundred and fifty thousand people have been a lot of people so um are you in favor of the president taking action\nNow just stop these uh that's a mob caravan from bomb rushing the border and coming in are you in favor of stopping them from coming here now\nYes yes I mean it's it's I mean this is a matter of national security or it is a matter of precedent um and again this comes back to that was at a normal American\nWill say hey you know we understand people want to come to the United states but there's a legal process um and we're gonna have to we're going to have to follow that legal process you know we we think that legal process needs to be applied all immigrants and you and you're exactly right John this would set a precedent that\nCould really be damaging to the United states' security to our policies into our rule of law or you're right if the if we allow everybody in we're actually sort of acknowledging that open borders is what we want if we don't follow the rule of law and we don't stop the ease of migrants sadly we we have to stop them from coming in and set a precedent Denver\nAbout a in about five or ten\nMinutes the U.S government's gotta relates to the new economic numbers or GDP expected to grow again\nThis quarter at so over four percent could these four point one four points to for twenty three a bomb autonomy was charging along in about a half percent growth growth unprecedented where do you look for in\nThat report and ... which includes you think you might draw out\nIt on the economy gender Brigham is\nWell the thing at first I'm going to look for [laughter] it's just because I'm a geek out on this stuff is I'm going to look at the specific whatever report that I have\nA hard look at the number of jobs are based on that are open right now and I look at Virginia but I also see where we are going as far as employment but GDP Growth I'm going to look at manufacturing I'm looking at agriculture\nI Love looking into the numbers and see where that growth and we're continuing on this line John ... with the lowest unemployment claims and forty nine years of her continuing with Los minority unemployment in for continuing which he did he grow four percent above every quarter which you know it was amazing a it's a new normal was too I mean this is pretty incredible\nThe job for format worse opportunities zones can be lovers here in the in the commonwealth a ... and opportunities\nOn investment all the things that we look at to encourage opt entrepreneurship to encourage people keeping their own money is working and that's what I'm going to look at it this report is is this just a continuation of this amazing amazing surge or\nAre we seeing and even more positive future for the people know if that district but also in the United states and then the commonwealth of Virginia I think we are I think we're just seeing the beginning of this economic boom and um I\nI'm really just really excited to see what those numbers say based on where job growth on one sectors are growing right now\nWhat kind of interesting to see these are coming out momentarily we expect that that we're going to get over four percent growth and it's really really tough for a Democrat\nRight now to talk about economics the economy or any of the issues that pertain to jobs and prosperity in America so they'd rather talk about something else that's why your opponent\nLovely Coburn is talking about your Halloween talk to him because he doesn't want to talk about the economy she doesn't want to talk about job she doesn't want to talk about growth should want to talk about kids moving out of the basement she doesn't want to talk about the booming small businesses you want to talk about the deregulation she doesn't want\nTo talk about the number of investments that are going on because of the tax\nCut especially as it relates to one hundred percent deduction of capital investments Rob doesn't even understand it and so she doesn't want to talk about any of any of that she'd rather\nTalk about your Halloween costume in two thousand five\nYeah and I mean which I Will not take down off the net by the way so here's what she would rather talk about she'd rather talk about forty three million dollars in spending\nNot only for Medicare for all but also for forgiving student debt right which is one point for a trillion dollars right now free community college for our free college for all everything she said and even a debate she's like I Want to give away this\nShe doesn't understand the taxpayer money is what you're using and I get so limited based on what I thought for you know and government overreach she says she loves government I fear government I think government should be limited I think government should be a fish and he's also the taxpayer money for the middle class\nIs nothing more than confetti she's compared eyes to the Nazis I mean I I find that the stunning John did anybody would vote for Leslie her views are great for San Francisco and maybe a three square mile\nArea there or somewhere up in Georgetown right in DC\nBut for the fifth district it's absolutely appalling that she thinks he's values are actually a political ball to the people to fit it every day and work for a living and don't give a rat's\nWith the chattering class is saying on CNN or MSNBC or any of these other far left and they are now\nThey're just they're just propaganda machines and I think at some point uh that's going to break through that you have comments you have this coalition of common sense against progressive ... and I think that's what's happening in the fifth district and we're going to win this John because I represent American values\nI represent conservative values but I represent what the fed wants to do right now and that's why we're going to win this\nDenver Riggleman I Want to thank you for being with us what's your website\nA Denver for Congress dot com\nOn this morning and you\nKnow again

doggie bags and they buried him in the garden or something the whole thing is just a horrible situation but look a\nCrown prince Mohammed bin Salman the administration's put a lot of things in the sky that Jared Kushner has\nAnd a lot of people are saying you know maybe this guy's just incompetent and capable of\nRunning the country everything he touches turns to craft whether it's the Yemen's civil war that's a disaster the gang of four embargo against the state of guitar that backfired and blow up in their face guitars\nBetter off today than they were now he's got this thing where they changed their story night time what do we do hear\nWhat John as you point out it's clear that job the show was brutally murdered it's clear that it was premeditated it's clear that ah that I think the crown prince knew about that a NBS Mohammed bin Salman\nBank I think have a lot to answer for and I think they have to be held accountable so I Do think that there has to be significant a penalties that they suffer I Do think to the question has to be asked is like does the United\nStates believes that it can carry on a continued relationship with Saudi Arabia which I Do think we need to but\nTend to be with the crown prince I think that's a pretty compelling question I think I'm going to strengthen is going to have to ask that I think Congress will eventually addressed that in that too\nYou know what will be the penalties eye to eye to Saudi Arabia I Wish I understand the impact of those of those contracts for what we're doing just supply a military uh equipment to Saudi Arabia I\nThink Saudi Arabia I can be a like a\nBoy that nonsense going on up there every day got um people I compete with hosts people they just get up every day they read the paper you got the big news you've got fake polls\nWe've had a big poll yesterday from the Washington Post is unbelievable I mean\nThe Washington Post like what are they going to learn like they don't want to learn people say well what are they going to change a pony methodology to get it right never because they don't want to get it right because it's not about\nAccurate poll it's about the poll driving fake news to get a fake narrative to draw the conclusion that's all it is it's all why\nThe Washington Post actually putting out a\nPoll yesterday actually putting out a poll showing Barbara Comstock trailing Jennifer ... than in the ... district by third gene point now there is no way that western had the thirteenth point lead over Barbara jobs like every journal poll that\nI have seen odd Comstock every in trouble with his pay four and a lot of money show this raised a dead heat or Comstock\nSlightly ahead and the Washington Post has got to start down by Thirteen there just a complete and utter why it has to be on fake news it is and it's beyond the onion it's beyond the national Enquirer what they try to do they have come starch so much they want that seat so bad\nThey want the liberal do nothing Jennifer watched it in their do bad they can taste it they want their\nLeft us in that\nDr poll make things up doing in such a way to get results that they want so they can put it out there and say the race is over don't give Tom start getting the money and don't work for\nIt's a lost cause so they do a fishing pole\nIn order to do think it's unbelievable nobody in that district\nIs gonna look you in the eye and say that they think that general Washington has a Thirteen point lead this race is tied and I think Tom's started during a win for the Washington Post to care they'll not own up to any of this and neither one of the New York times or ABC News or read the singer MSNBC\nOr any of the polling companies that run through with a fake news and that's what they are it's it's ... it's the fake news network and it's designed to drive in conclusion to make you not\nWant to do anything to help\nIf you're in an attempt district go volunteer for cops like she is going to win this race if you get\nHer but they live on a daily basis and that's why the president says it's fake news editor he says it's an enemy of the people when you live in the people and masquerading as a legitimate news network was that legitimate poll is right now\nThe enemy how would you define that this poll for the poster so\nAstronaut that even westerns most staunchest supporters\nThink it's a joke because they know it's not true so let me just let me just ask\nYou a question if they're putting out purposely putting out the information driving it so that is fake is they're not an enemy of the people it's certainly in hey it's an enemy the truth maybe the president needs to change one where\nIt's an enemy of the truth it's certainly an enemy of fact\nIs unbelievable they're doing it again they did it in two thousand sixteen and they're doing it again things you learn nothing you know what the Democrats have\nLearn nothing from two thousand sixteen the legacy media hasn't learn\nNothing in fact what they're doing now is they can't believe they were wrong and so they're doubling down\nAnd here's the thing if the Republicans don't relinquish the house bill legacy media after two elections in a row going all in for the Democrats and losing them both on a federal level will become\nIrrelevant just one of the street for them are so high that will become a relevant\nI Am\nThan they are because I certainly tell you the truth good bad or ugly there'll be relevant they are doubling and tripling down on ...\nOn more fake polls and more fake news again to drive to result they want on election day again and it's got to\nI mean they actually think that somebody sending pipe bombs or don't go off at like at a change the trajectory the election maybe get a life\nWe're going to get an economic report coming out in about forty five minutes that it's going to show another over four percent GDP Growth\n\nAnd their banking on hatred of the truck and somebody sending pipe bomb the don't go off targeted at Democrats had already been influencing anything right now it's very bizarre it's very the whole thing is very suspicious and it's very bizarre\n\nRight now if you're any national Democrat here's what you have to deal with mobs and caravans and you're running against Republicans who are for jobs and country bondage versus jobs in country versus caravan\n\nAnd if they really think the caravan crossing the United states and bump rushing the border at\nA clip of Fifteen thousand just coming in and getting food clothing shelter education hospital care and love let's just open up our arms if the if they really think that having\nTens of thousands of illegal storming the country is going to help them get elected know see what they were hoping for is a couple of thousand\nWhich kids and babies and they'd be separated and it would be chaos and a Trump would be a meaning any put troops there they'd have bayonets and everybody will be outrage and he's got to go in standard has backfired they can't control\nIt a thousand people they could can troll Thirteen fourteen Fifteen thousand that's a mob you can't control that who's funding\nThis let me ask you this question I just have to Rob Wittman let's start after Labor Day who's funding this what is just coming off the train or just falling out or you know Apple's and coke and not sort of falling off the trees all along that route celebrating is putting up a lot of money to finance\nI Want to know who don't you find that interesting I Want to know a lot of things I wanted a whole lot of things\nRepublicans are gaining the Democrats right now or in a dead\nPanic\nThree weeks ago it was a done deal they were going to get power they were going to do investigations that we're going to do that all of a sudden start slipping away they have a cabinet debacle\nThey have a caravan debacle\nAnd Republican get energized just start showing up and all of a sudden you got early voting in democratic precincts at a level never been seen in history\nOf measuring the stuff\nIs what's going on here this is why I'm telling you I don't know if the Republicans are going to hold the house what's going to be darn close
