you know you're going to um ...\nJune and African American churches and other things obviously you have to get Democrats crowds to consider voting for you in order to win\nAs you're talking to Democrats Ryan what did they say well\nWe have a program on his back up a little bit one of the things I think that makes me unique in that I'm a pastor must have been a social worker I care about a lot of the things that I Believe the African American particularly urban area's really care about\nLike we've already talked about welfare public housing I care about criminal justice reform I've seen that close and so those are things we're talking about the economy is and you believe in I Believe it was just\nGoing through the roof is booming and that's good for all Americans really been good for African Americans actually the unemployment is you know as long as it's ever been\nSo we talk about the economy and as you know a lot of African Americans particularly the the conservative African Americans and the church are very conservative socially so we talk about her life and rebel ... ... what does that and when you have to\nOr telling them but when you go to a Democrat who voted for McCain Asians voted for Clinton there a democratic voter and you go in a rich man or Petersburg and you say I'm Ryan McAdams I'm a Republican running for Congress blah blah blah what are they saying what\nAre they what they said to me is you're right because I'll tell them you know what the Democratic Party has done anything for you they made a lot of promises but they really haven't produced anything and they say you're right and then I say you know what and Republicans haven't come and talk to you and message to you and ask for your vote and they've taken for granted in that sense\nAnd they say you're right and I say well I'm here and I started I to me I'm not about Republican or Democrat about solutions that I have solutions for you I have conservative solutions for you\nI've got different solutions to the Democratic party has but I've got solutions for you and I believe that the work I Believe it's going to give you the jobs that you need in this community I Believe it's going to give you the redevelopment that you need opportunity zones and we talk about that I Believe\nIt's going to give you the portable housing that you need I mean we get we're not going to solve all their problems but I Believe that hey compared to what the Democrats have given you which is nothing I mean we are a huge step up and I'm actually here I'm president you know that's the one thing that they say is you know what you're here and I appreciate that\nAnd then when I tell them after when I tell them been a social worker their eyebrows go up you know they're like oh really and they want to know more they want to know they want to know why I'm In this race they want to know well how do you feel about the president and I tell them I said you know what I Love the president I Love his policies but I'm not the president on my own person\nI have a different tone or you know I have a more moderate tone I'm One that wants to be a bridge builder I Want to reach out I Want to bring us together on our divisive voice\nAnd say whatever you think about the Democratic party or your current congressman Indians divisive voice all he has to do is tear down tear down the president\nI said I'm here to build up I'm not here to to talk even to tear down the Democratic party for the most part I'm here to tell you the solutions that I have for your community and you know what it resonates with people because you know what people see in me is that I'm often it just like the president I Know that you love that about the president I Love that about the president that he's an authentic guy and what are you\nWe believe and that's how I Am I'm just going to tell you straight amok and try to\nPaint it you know just to tell you what you want to hear\nA but I I Am solution I really believe that we and I believe they can party should be going into these areas with solution and that's what we haven't done the past and that's what I'm doing I Need to do it but you know what I'm a unique candidate because I have a hard to do it and I'm Nicky qualified to do it as a pastor I've worked with the African American community\nReally my whole career and a social worker I worked in public housing I work with at risk youth mentor to African American kids we we rented taekwondo program with the police department so I've credibility is not like I've just come lately you know I've been there I've done it\nAnd they see that and they know that and we're going to an African American churches same thing and um\nSo it resonates because you know what I think African Americans are very sensitive they they can they can ... people and uh I think they they I think most of them can read where I'm coming from and my heart and so a lot to me we're getting traction what's your website Ryan McAdams for Congress\nDot com rhyming jobs for Congress dark comedy the Mike Pence coming in for a rally seven forty five PM at sun trust building enrichment on Saturday October twenty and Saturday October twenty that will be on his website one of the like running the catalyst for being with us Denver recommend coming up you'd rather\nFor more information go to America First policies dot org this message page for an authorized by America First policies in corporate and joining us now Denver Riggleman [noise] you know just when you thought it wouldn't get worse\nAfter big foot Leslie Coburn his Democratic opponent in the fifth district what are you crazy campaign this has been because\nUh I guess when you're down so you gotta like from\nHell marriage or something but luckily Coburn on that debate Monday Night a week ago she went after Denver's military service on the grounds he was three thousand miles away from Afghanistan\nAt naval support facility Diego Garcia\nWhile he worked on plans as you know for bombing missions um apparently applying that they didn't play a big role which of course we know we did and I'm Mr Culver Leslie's coauthor\nHug than a dangerous liaison said that uh he was snorkeling I mean this is a really crazy campaign that ... running I mean that we're going to like say Denver like didn't serve okay uh what else are they going to make up joining us now do that again is the truth\nIs Denver Riggleman he is the Republican candidate for the fifth district in Virginia that's the Lynchburg area through\nGarrett Denver Riggleman great to have you good hey good morning John how are you\nOkay so I'm Lesley conference has been said no you didn't put any bombing missions or after the nine eleven attack in Afghanistan that you were snorkeling and ... Garcia\nYeah I mean I'm you know maybe I think um I think the co burns have a problem with tweeting and they seem to they seem to to get angry and lash out on Twitter but that's how they run their whole campaign is they\nThey say disparaging things they make up things whether it's big foot erotica or white supremacy or making fun of military service or saying I don't care about women are taking things out of context and then they rushed to Twitter to the Hollywood friends and I try to make it national news because\nYou know they have such extreme policies um and I think they're true believers but they're just so out of touch and for a\nAndrew ... co burned to get involved to talk about my military service for somebody who's biggest service has been you know making a fantasy books I tell you almost get to the point\nYou just start shaking your head it's hard to take them seriously I'll tell you that and and you know they they just disparaged a lot of veterans to and by the way John Diego's not the only place I've been in and that's the other thing I just I don't have to defend my military service to the likes of them\nWell uh it was thrown you're desperate attempt I mean you've got a very very well documented military service and you were the one that was the um group that was the other one I mean yeah the\nThirty four desks expeditionary bomb squad during the amount of Diego which you know what I mean you talked about many times before and you know like I always told you you know there I've been in situations el ... in harm's way there you know I wasn't\nI was supporting a bunch of just um awesome individuals' I'm never going to battle one when you talked to some of the other guys who objected over the Indian Ocean or I was trying to keep them safe but the threats in Afghanistan and you know going after the caves and also all kinds of other things that I Can't talk about honesty then yet um\nYou know it's just funny because they don't understand anything about military service everything they've always done has been about themselves and now they don't understand they enjoying the war against the war fighter and they thought this would be a walk over when I came as a new candidate and they're finding out right now that I'm an alley fighter and um plus\nYou know I mean I I've had a gun stuck in my chest so you know what the Coburn sorry I don't think they understand\nThe gravity of what they've done and they made this personal level I never thought somebody would\nWell they're desperate or do you what are some of her you you mentioned at the beginning of the segment Denver Riggleman you mentioned that some of their positions were extreme liberal or can you just name already several several of them for\nSure I mean there I mean everything they are extreme\nYou know with the Medicare for all you know I'm forgiving student you know there's one point ... trillion in student loans or\nA debt free community college um the fact that they she called 'em I stick to stockpile um there's other things that we have that we're going to roll out I'm open borders um my goodness um you just go down the line\nAnd that's what's scary about this is that she can't come across as moderate now she's trying to run into the middle or she knows her possessions or extreme so that's why she stays in Charlottesville she doesn't really go outside the district much anymore she likes to stick in her ... her career and then\nI think it really comes down to she's a true believer and I and I know what I got to respect that I mean she's a true believer and these causes but I'm I'm a true believer unconstitutional you know policies but also and individual liberty so it is truly a war of ideas now and uh I just hope that the Republicans get out and vote because she is dangerous for the district\nWere with the Denver Riggleman Republican candidate for Congress in the fifth district is running against his Democratic opponent allegedly Coburn uh she's an author and has a lot of friends in Hollywood\nAnd a Denver running for the seat and him to retire on retiring Tom Garrett Denver let's get to uh some of the pressing issues on the world scene today I don't want to get your\nOpinion on a let's start with Joe ... show the a so called a\nJournalist if you were living in the United states living in Virginia doing a column for the Washington Post very critical of the Saudi Government goes to the consulate in this day and both for routine paperwork to get married and it's like the older Roach Motel he went in but he'd ever came out\nA hurricane up never came out so it's like the the Saturday Roach Motel\nNow this tape spaghetti elevated\nBecause President Trump said over the weekend um if he gets clear evidence that the Saudis were involved in this cold blooded murder within their conflict and he's and their stand bolt\nHe said there would be severe punishment then a prince Mohammed bin Salman MPs thirty three years old turns around on Sunday fires back\nAnd if there's any ah sanctions against us or any retaliation or we're going to double down and we're going to affect the economy's in world markets and pull our sovereign fond and\nRaise the price of oil and a ex cetera or we bought this arms deal with them a hundred and ten billion dollars worth of only spent Fifteen billion\nWe've also were backing their war there are civil war I'm with the Emirates in Yemen where we go with it\nWell number one I think I'm Sherry used to have the Saudi Arabia to have a lot more leverage\nUh but now the United states is the number one oil and gas producer in the world\nUm it's very difficult for them to I think it sort of exert that kind of leverage on us as far as President Trump's concern I think he's very serious I mean uh it found out that the Saudi Government sanctioned um this type of behavior I don't I only think gee I don't think you're just to spend hours payments I think she'll talk about pulling any type of support\nI'm against the ... in Yemen and I you know and that is that's Dennis\nI'm just really interested to see because\nIt as a to try to extract Iran from what they're doing a state sponsor terrorism is a very important goal of the United states government but on the other hand um if the Saudis are doing this type of behavior now you're talking about things that we just can't get down and and I think President Trump would go all the way I\nThink he would not only sanction them and and take away their arms sales I think you would ignore this red on oil and I think he would start to extract support when you\nKind of military stuff that they're doing over in the middle east any type of military exercises or or any type of operation so it's it is serious\nDenver the other side of it is that uh some people are saying that well look or the president and the Trump Administration has invested a lot in the Saudi\nRelationship and the Nineteen months he's been there and we do have this hundred and ten million dollar arm so I I Want to keep pointing out that it's on paper it's a memorandum of understanding for hundreds of dollars but they've only spent you know you yeah it's an Emily only spent Fifteen\nSo it's it's not I mean there's there's no sign deals or anything it's just an understanding right right so it's not really want it\nSo uh so somebody was saying you know why maybe we just we just started under the rug and move on\nBusiness as usual but a Marco Rubio the other day said that whatever action we took could not be symbolic what is your take on that\nHe's he's right I mean if again if the Saudi Government participated in killing somebody and it was sanctioned and we have the proof is my guest that or it's going to be much more than symbolic um I guess there's probably remove all support on multiple fronts\nAnd I would say that that is going to happen if if we if we find that's been proven and you know I don't actually\nBlood

special interest money millions and millions of dollars coming in the last thing we want to do is have the government running\nPharmaceuticals the best thing to produce competition and to produce patents which makes sense and will eventually generics and low prices is a lot of firms competing against each other to produce low cost outcome\nAnd so the contrast between me and my opponent could not be clear tonight my opponent for example on the tax cuts wants to return the money from the tax cuts back up to the federal government\nMy philosophy is to take the government and the federal dollars and bring them back down to the state at every opportunity and back down to our local officials to know how to deal with them better\nAnd it was when it comes to drugs the opioid crisis is exactly this problem we passed a ton of rape built up at the federal level but the problem is the money is trapped got our community service sports at the state level and it's not making its way down\nTo our uh our local sheriffs in Chesterfield in Waco and all kinds of our county and those drugs are vitally needed and we need low cost drugs and so the basic idea is to return power back to states and localities\nThank you congressman brat I'm Sorry when remind our audience that we do have reception penalty seven seconds for Mr branch Dave sorry or Mrs spanberger Abigail if you would um would you like the question again\nWhen I travel across the number one issue that people are talking about the rising cost of prescription drugs kind of thing and the cost of health care across the board is number one thing that people are talking about and how it is that we can actually addressed the prescription drug ... issue is we need\nI'm a suitable companies to do what's called patents ticketing where they are Longate the patents and they they depressed competition Medicare for example needs to be able to negotiate it's prescription drug prices\nThe Veterans Administration is able to do so in some drugs are up to eighty percent cheaper on the Veterans Administration than they are on the Medicare side\nIn terms of what we need to do overall with health care and\nI think we'll probably be talking about this quite a lot we need to strengthen our current healthcare system and we need a public option you won't hear my opponents very frequently if some expensive program that I Do in fact not support I support the public option but we're talking about the cost and special interest money I\nThat in our tax bill the twenty Seventeen tax bill that added to the deficit to the tune at one point nine trillion dollars pharmaceutical companies the top five pharmaceutical companies got forty two billion dollars in tax\nAnd so when we're looking about at\nThe reason we cannot find a we cannot lower the price of prescription drugs and Medicare cannot negotiate at the prescription drug prices it is because of the pharmaceutical Audi it's so great it is so great that when we had a congressman like congressman brat\nWho said he would not add to the deficit who voted against spending bills because they would add to the deficit is willing to add one point nine trillion dollars to the deficit in order to get tax cuts to the tune of forty two billion dollars to pharmaceutical companies\nLike indiscriminate right outta here were attorneys are next question which has to deal with immigration what impact if any has the current administration's immigration policies had on for juniors workforce\n[noise]\n\nAs a country need comprehensive immigration reform\nIs something that has been talked about for years we have not achieved bipartisan comprehensive immigration reform and right here in colpepper\nI have heard stories from people in the agricultural business who are concerned about whether long term they will have the employees that they need\nPeople threw out or district are concerned about the way immigration has become such a politically divisive issue the truth of the matter is we need immigration reform comprehensive bipartisan immigration reform that achieves a number of things first that secure our borders and our point of entry I worked at CIA as a former\nAs a former CIA officer I worked undercover I worked counterterrorism I worked in our contract gang traffic\nUnderstanding the drug cartels working throughout Mexico I Am well aware of\nThe threats that present themselves up or southern border and it's for that reason that we need comprehensive immigration reform that is strong on border security and strengthening our coincidental but we also need immigration reform that will meet the needs of the employers here throughout the seventh district\nHere throughout the commonwealth of Virginia and we need comprehensive immigration reform that give certain teaching dreamers children who were brought here through no fault of their own by\nAnd that's what bipartisanship should look like this is a pressing issue that is impacting communities\nAnd we need bipartisanship to actually drive\nA change on this issue but when we look at what my opponent has been advocating for it is not a bipartisan solution the the bill the compromise bill that he says frequently talked with out it was a compromise between the far right and the more moderate\nAnd the more moderate Republican there was a compromise though there was a bipartisan bill that was put forth in Congress they couldn't get out of committee this time around\nBut it was put forth by a Republican and Democrat there are people who are willing who were working to try and find ... bipartisan solutions but there are currently not enough of running Congress\nThank you out of jail they've\nYeah thank you for the question I think had to do can you repeat the question labor force\nTrue what if what impact if any has the current administration's immigration policies Adam Virginia's workforce\nYeah as I say we achieved a huge result by first of all avoiding a huge amnesty bill which would have had a devastating impact on wages for the nation as a labor supply goes up with a huge amnesty American wages go down American Jobs go down and so our efforts on that front had been very positive\nAnd show a my opponent just brought up comprehensive immigration reform we had the good last ... this year and she says that's not bipartisan Obama would support that the Clintons were for e verify and the major components in that bill every one to tell the last couple of years left has gone off the rails\nAnd show every major Democrat including Barbara dropped Jordan the great civil rights leader was in favor of all the components in that ... it is bipartisan compromise we took care of seven hundred thousand DACA kids gave them a legal status that's a compromise no Democrat would vote for it\nThen President Trump up to one point eight million Dr kids the Democrats said no to that compromise than I did it feel that United parents and kids at the border with Senator Ted Cruz and Chuck Schumer the Democrat said no to that bill\nSo if you look at the facts of the matter and the actual legislation that came up and the vote it's very clear that my opponent falls to the very far left\nOn this issue of immigration she's been on the record in favor of sanctuary cities she said the states and localities can deal with these issues we don't need to cooperate with federal government that's what's sanctuary cities are you don't cooperate with the law the land we have plenty of write laws on the books if we would only follow the law\nAnd so it's just a matter of simple law enforcement\nAnd of course we need our federal ice agents working with us at the state local\nHurt her objection there is very radical if you think about your saying don't follow the law the land we should not cooperate with federal law enforcement and that's done it\nThe ice agents are the ones who are protecting us from the three hundred million lethal doses of fat and all that came across the border last year that heroin the ... the human trafficking\nThese are real and talk to the sheriff's up here in coal pepper talked to the sheriffs in his wake up and down in Chesterfield if you don't think it's a serious problem we have a hundred and fifty badge and hit right go alone for this and it's on ...\nOne of a red cards you have one minute to ...\nThank you so much and Congress and bread I appreciate you explaining to me the role of federal law enforcement agent because indeed I used to be one I used to work jointly with ice I worked joint drug cases in fact in the DC area with a high intensity drug trafficking area taskforce often end its high to\nI'm well aware of the role of federal agents I Do not support safe haven for criminals or gangs I Do not support anything that would make our community is weak or hurt our enemies in fact I used to work every single day to keep the community I Lived in state\nTo keep our communities free of drugs on the street so for me to read anything else is is frankly comical\nBut in fact I Would like to state for the record\nThat I support law enforcement in all its foreign because I used to be among them and I am the daughter of a career law enforcement officer [noise]\n\nYou're listening to what is your [noise]\n\nOwn drink reviews were in\nCharge [laughter] [noise]\n[laughter]\n\nAnd we paid for the entire liberal order that has brought us all together for ... when when we made friends with our arch enemy the Germans and the Japanese and now we all our friends and play when when together on trade and economic growth and it's been great for our country\nAnd so that is the result that we've achieved with this executive and our Congress this year the economy is now booming we still have work to do with China\nUh but when it comes to our agriculture is the largest sector in Virginia and so we worked very hard with our foreign bureaus across all my ten counties to protect them and to ensure that any tariffs negotiations are short lived in a matter of months not years\nBut we have to do that it's basically more a matter of geopolitics and not a matter of trade policy trade we all want zero tariffs and the White House that that that is the goal for the long run\nI think Dave I appreciated Abigail same question\nYou [laughter] you know it's been updated version of NAFTA which has some positive benefits particularly for\nThe notion that we would move toward zero terrorists\nA trade war is not something that I understand and in fact we have antagonize\nOur trade partners by creating and starting a trade war when we look at the fact\nAs congressman brat just said China is a big threat if China is such a big threat why are we comfortable with the fact that they hold the most amount of our debt debt that we have now just chosen thanks to the tax bill is twenty Seventeen to increase by one point nine trillion dollars and these parents and the changes that they've made how\nIt's been great and if you don't believe me after\nTwenty thousand Ford workers who just lost their jobs because for that they couldn't handle the steel and aluminum tariffs that depleted their income by one billion dollars and then we can talk about the soybean farmers right here across the seventh district soybean farmers right here because of these terrorists\nHave decreased prices proposal it costs about ten dollars in five cents per bushel for soybean farmers to break even prices since the terrorist one into place I haven't been above nine dollars we're creating challenges in our community and to answer them\nThe president's desire the president's choice whereas in fact to put a twelve billion dollar bailout\nOn the American taxpayers back at twelve billion dollar bailout farmers don't want bailout they want to sell their crops\nAnd so the notion that we would start a trade war to begin to get ourselves to the point where we\nDoesn't make any sense to me it is reckless foreign policy it creates detrimental relationships with our friends our allies and our trading partners and long term is tremendously detrimental to our stability in the world\nBut if you have if you are Dave thank you very much we're going to move to our next question I'm when I'm Sorry I Apologize this question is for you [noise] Second Amendment and Second Amendment prop said there continues to be a growing public concern regarding gun violence and school safety\nWhat measures would you put in place to provide a safe environment for students\n\nAs I've mentioned I Am a former law enforcement officer I get to carry a gun every single day I Am well aware of the responsibility of gun ownership I grew up in a house with guns I grew up in a family a sportsman\nBut we can have Congress stations in our community about how it is that we can balance our Second Amendment right which I firmly support\nThe rights of our school children to go to school and feel safe in our county Indian rights our county I say our because the Congress and lived there as well one of our schools had\nThe day that I put my children on the bus\nWhen there was a threat of gun violence in our county which is a hard day no parents should feel that way No Child should feel concerned that they might die\nThree out of four do paying NRA members believe that background\nShould be in play background checks on all sides\nTown like that was written by at a gun show that is a first step forward that we can take the other thing that we should be doing when looking at gun violence in ensuring that our schools have the resources to deal with students who might be facing trauma or who might be facing strap\nMight be at risk for violent behavior this is a comprehensive issue is not one that we can solve any day but it's certainly not one that we will be able to solve it we do not have leaders in Washington or willing to have\nConversations but the good news is there are already members of Congress who are willing to have that conversation there is a bi partisan background check bill in Congress couldn't get out of committee because there was not a critical mass of people willing to have cars conversations\nAnd so I Want to go to Congress would be a part of this discussion again I understand gun ownership I understand the responsibility of gun ownership and neither congregations we can have about ensuring that people who are a risk to themselves their community or other are not able to do harm our schools\nYou have a gal Dave is thank you very much this is a tough conversation to have and we've had plenty of them in the seventh district I have a daughter in the audience that goes to public school as well and of course we all work hard every day on this issue to keep our kids very safe\nSo I can be a major group but all the folks across all ... counties school resource officers school councilors mental health experts sheriff's police first responders\nEveryone who was in a room with school councilors so that we had all voices dance and they came up with three solutions and then I'll share with you tonight at first and this was after the Parkland, Florida incident and a lot of this was in response to the failure in Parkland and we don't want to repeat that\nIn our counties here and so the first ones to hardening schools with school resource officers the second was to enhance significantly mental health\nEveryone was agreement that that was probably the major peace we need to work on and that's connected to the third piece which is to connect the dots between the federal government state government the FBI their local the localities and law enforcement and then the schools themselves\nAnd that was a total tragedy in Parkland, Florida case they connected note that the FBI did not talk to the state to state didn't talk to them all the ... still look at the local police force visited that young boys home twenty times\nAnd no dots were connected the school resource officer was not in the schools in our districts and across our counties we have outstanding lawful law enforcement you see them with us today the FBI is in constant communication with our state leaders\nAnd I'm very proud of the work our law enforcement does on these issues and so those are the primary solutions that I received by listening to my constituents those are the experts in our community and that's what they came up with\nA when it comes to gun if you want to follow the Nancy Pelosi liberal agenda and if you look at blue states\nCan I finish the question I have a few more seconds that when if you want to look at the liberal Nancy Pelosi agenda and my opponent will be a vote for that entire agenda all you have to do is look at the ...\nHave conversations about it but up in those blue states they want to take away your guns and they have taken away guns and crime has not gone down at all in San Francisco or Chicago or New York\nCongressman thank you again there was a ... there was a family of nine seconds on that answer thank you actually\nOur next question is does do you as well sir I'm dealing with education and workforce readiness\nAccording to the Federal Reserve national student debt reached one point five trillion and the first quarter of twenty Eighteen\nBecause of this and the challenge challenge recent college graduates are facing and finding fulltime ... unemployment of adequate uh implemented adequate pay high school students are headed were skeptical in a row in a traditional two or four year colleges\nWhat plans do you have to either provide insurance to future collegiate or expand higher education funding to college alternatives such a CD and trade schools\nRight thank you very much for the question that as you know as a professor ran for Twenty years at Randolph Macon College\nAnd I work with students every day on a career planning and got to work with community colleges with senator stylish and not to ... years our our districts are blessed with great current technical programs already an excellent programs in the trade but we have huge ah moves we can still make Andrew Mann is part of that solution\nUntil last year our results we improve the K. to twelve education bill by taking away federal mandate and so now our states and localities are not under all of the federal burns for high stakes testing constantly and they have the latitude to add these courses an internship in on the job training and career technical education\nAnd that's step one and it stuck to this year I'm On the education committee and we also\nProvided result in higher read by doing it he bill that enhanced and broaden all sorts of opportunities for kids to to follow new and improved path\nAt four year college is not

that he left and they couldn't find the camera footage now he didn't leave and instead and it was a mistake you shouldn't be that\nYou haven't got to be kidding me are you serious Saudi officials have repeatedly denied knowing what happened to his jokey President Trump suggested on Monday\nAfter talking to king Solomon that or he may\nHave been a victim of road killers as I said on Algeria yesterday\nObviously the president didn't get that from his own staff he got it from king Solomon is inconceivable to me that\nMohammed bin Salman crown prince Mohammed bin Salman NBS did not know about this and it's inconceivable that they would have set Fifteen operatives to Amsterdam bowl and they had no idea why they were there there was no\nCommunication back to the authorities are in the government of Saudi Arabia\nNow the new explanation seems intended to ease a political crisis for the Saudis and to diffuse some criticism of the Trump Administration which has refused to back down for billions of dollars in a weapon sales to the kingdom\nSo everybody here is looking to save face Trump Administration is looking to save face\nSaudi Arabia is looking to save face so they can talk to the story look the guy was murdered right he went in there to get a piece of paper and they chop them up into little pieces and put them in back and you're going to tell me that that was not
