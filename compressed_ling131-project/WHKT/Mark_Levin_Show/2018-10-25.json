way I Want to talk about a couple of it or you mentioned are usually during our last phone call about the Mexican wall with Donald Trump it kept his promise Mexico was brought to pay for the wall\nAnd uh Mexico is not paying for the wall because although Trump\nPass an agreement with Mexico and Canada to\nRenegotiate NAFTA or that that agreement has to be approved by Congress overnight papers criminals\nAnd I think it's very interesting that the Republicans\nHave the agreement with the habit loop in Congress on on a passing it and I think is a story there and the reason that a hotline or it is not in not move forward with a agreement that Trump has their own paper but it has\nTo be a a ratified by Congress or it's just it's just a just a piece of paper so Mexico's not paying the liquor for the wall and if the if Trump kept his promises and ah I got the billions of dollars from Mexico\nThen we will have a wall or we'd have one started\nAnd we wouldn't have to worry about this uh these people are coming up here or if until we get a wall if we could ah ah put sanctions\nOn TALK of any employer hiring illegal immigrants so that'll send them home to if they're not about to do that and uh just to just sort of else you know that um you know just just is not a shoe in a victory for the Republicans\nA November the six\nAnd a I don't see any polls that that are that are very prompts you at all for Comstock and not look before I called the ones that I could access the closest one that's six percent but the problem is is like constantly and went man and a tailoring\nRats they can't bring truck went to Virginia Trump is radioactive and Virginia and he says the reason for that and I don't think there's anything that done\nBy Donald Trump to rectify that since he's been in a in the White House so you know I Would advise Barbara Comstock it that's like she could to the beach or holiday\nOn at the White House right down the street last Donald Trump to come up there in a campaign for her but why why not you know why Rob Wittman says it was I was a big uh Donald Trump's order\nAnd uh I grabbed his Donald Trump like hands down so why are these people calling that Donald Trump to get some help when they got a a toss up a\nA ... writing in the in the polls\nAnd one other thing I just want to tell you this you know I watched part of the uh Williams a plant a fancy way and there's a lot with men debate yesterday you know that the the er the answer about Obamacare a given by\nA car liberal was pretty much a a joke we are still under Obamacare the promise for seven years to repeal and replace it with something\nBetter and uh the Republicans have all three branches of government they can even pass their own version of a truck chair or something better than Obamacare and even even the ... the Congress forget to Congress in the crowd\nTake care of every body which is is easy to go with your table watch it like the promise a none of that's been done and November the six\nDays to hold Republicans accountable for their lives to the American people and their biggest promise is affordable adequate health care you can get put as much money in people's pockets want health care will take it right back\nOK aging you got a time where okay no time limit okay I Can't let you do a monologue for Fifteen minutes here I've been I've been really polite or okay I appreciate your probably\nLike you were done now let me go let me go backwards number one you're talking about a a bomb of care and the Republicans promise\nTo repeal and replace it they had a better plan they lied to you for seven years Trump they told Trump had a plan they never did and now the president understands that\nRepublicans have lied about that for a seven year period to raise

oh five six for sex this or\nIs this a act a potential act here of a domestic terror I really want to get your thoughts on this what you make of it where do you think it came from what you do a little speculating\nToday but uh the FBI all over this that they're saying and various news reports that they're going to get to the bottom of it and the president did the same thing Washington's a little bit on\nThe edge as the FBI and that was investigating a string of attempted mailed bombings address to top Democrats or which was very odd because here's your they picked a bomb\nOn Clinton holder John Brennan Soros\nMaxine Waters and Debbie Wasserman Schultz ... it's just it's just very odd to me that are like half of these people aren't even an argument involved now I just found\nThat odd I just wanted I just uh the whole thing is um odd to me\nEleven days before the midterm the FBI now\nInvestigating the potentially destructive to devices because we don't know if they were actually set to go off either we have pictures of them but um none of the\nDevices thank God discovered this week exploded and no one was harmed so thank the lord for that these six cents want package Bob's a battery\nOut containing powders and broken glass\nWork instructed from a PVC pipe and covered with black tape this is what we learned from a law\nEnforcement official who saw the bombs or the X ray images of it and told the Associated Press\nThe\nWhite powder in the package that the CNN was tested and determined to be basically baby powder harmless\nSo the white Potter was harmless they um\nIt's not really determined right\nNow if these farms curve actually got off\nA\nThe FBI intercepted the packages for Obama Clinton and the Soros before they were received now\nAnybody that does one of these would be odd that they didn't know that you can't get to a bomber Clinton or Trump for anybody of this nature because uh\nThey have Secret Service protection and everything is screen before it ever reaches them\nSo that seems to me the package for Eric Holder was voted to return address where the offices of Debbie Wasserman Schultz in Florida package for bread and that was sent the CNN resulted in the evacuation of the cable Josh\nHeadquarters in New York City leading to the surreal seeing the bankers and journalists reporting on the breaking news event from the street\nAnd uh\nThe FBI says it's possible that other packages were male to other locations that are still in the mail string\n\nThe makeshift bombs are going undergoing test and inspection at the FBI Laboratory in Quantico, Virginia the Associated Press has reported that the trail of clues are are eventually going to lead to the would be bomber and\nA course of the time and get that's not good now speaking in the East Room yesterday President Trump condemned the axe or threats or political violence had called for unity as his audience to two apart\n\nAnd he said in these times we have to unify we have to come together and said one very clear very strong unmistakable message that acts of threats of political violence of any kind of no place in the United states of America that coming from President Trump\n\nThat was immediately condemned by Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer who that turned around and I said it was an insufficient response [noise] let me read it again in these times we have to unify\nWhat that's what you said I Want to go\nBut apparently the Democrats thought that the president's message of unification and coming together to stand a very clear strong unmistakable message that acts or threats or political violence of any kind of no place in the in the United states obviously they are\nThe ... statement that said it was insufficient and that he was part of the problem\nYou had and other democratic operative coming on TV last season who said that uh all of the people targeted by the pipe bomber in the mail you said you could uh basically get the list by following the president's Twitter me\n\nSee this is the Democrats are trying to take advantage of what could have been a horrible situation\nOr maybe not because of Jews in Germany the bombs could actually have gone off we don't know like the powers that to CNN was baby powder so I actually know that the bombs had the potential to go off and they could harm someone\nWho works out well we don't know we don't have anything\nOnly knows what we now so let's wait until the FBI if they're being honest about it I mean we're we're now questioning the FBI but if they're being honest about it let's wait until they give their reports\n\nThe Washington Post reports that Republican leaders were very quick to condemn package bombs that the rest of the politicians officials on the news media\n\nWhenever a campaign rally last night in Wisconsin [noise] I'm Sorry I had a campaign\nRally in uh Wisconsin President Trump's message of common purpose shifted to criticism of the Democrats and the media Trump's said people should not mob people in public spaces\n\nSeems like a pretty reasonable statement to me and that the press has a responsibility to set a civil town that stop the

couldn't get civil until you went back the house or Senate took control the government\nNow she changes your tone or a little bit now she changes I don't know I find this whole thing to you know the mic in Virginia Beach you know we're not talking about the caravan\nWithout talking about jobs the economy or talking about pipe bombs going they're Democrats\nI don't\nKnow it's an awfully odd timing awfully a suspicious that's all I'm going to say very odd don't you find this odd or is it just to make\nA name for a little John Indian age for you know five six were six like who would target Robert Deniro like what kind of a range person would\nDo this it's almost like um it's a two slick\nLike let's find all of the people that glass Trump and set up a pipe bomb\n\nWhich we don't know if it's getting to offer not uh\nIt's just it seems very strange to me that's all I'm very suspicious about this and those have been listening to me for ten years you know that I don't do conspiracy at all ever I say wait for tax to come out that's it I don't do it but this just doesn't add\nUp maybe I'm wrong\nAnd maybe it's some drainage wacko and I hope the FBI's whoever it is going to jail right left\nOtherwise I just find it odd\nAll right I'm going to get to the total recall up in a minute because she changed her to Jennifer from Norfolk again says\nI just heard your line of free radio show I'm really excited I used to live in Los Angeles and listen to trigger an elder of the local stations their love love love this line of congratulations again I'm looking forward to H J FM radio

Clinton a week ago saying well it's okay to be a shovel in the face of truck because we have trapeze socks and until the Democrats take over\nIt's tough to fight to be up several was split our people and and uh and harassed and the restaurants the stomach doubt subway holes that's okay now she changes your tune a little bit caught one Hillary Clinton\n[noise] thank you all very\nVery odd [noise]\nYou know the poor I [noise] I\nBegan a I Want to say you have to worry about the news this morning a suspicious package and being sent to bury a public figure and a news organizations many of

just to get her facts that are now let's take\nMy bench vice president Mike Pence saying the crude type pops up for CNN over Clinton a former President Obama and others were cowardly act and he can do
