congressman from Arizona extended the investigation he made a call or met with one Ron\nRosenbaum staying on a strange job not happened during that\nIt just seems like the fixes ban them from the state Manhattan network of Obama because all the bread crumbs of all of this corruption lead back to ... he and one Hillary Clinton and they're going to do what ever they can they find the steam water\nThe Democratic party traders within the Republican Party to protect these two and the only way we get to the bottom of this is to turn a light on and get ugly and John Dower is why the Supreme Court nominee suffering so badly\nIn public now because they realize if this man gets on the court that he will have the republic that the Supreme Court will be able to\nProsecute these criminals do you suffer favor are busy man\nLook up the executive orders of one former president for rock Obama giving themselves um executive powers [noise] pretty extensively to well investigate what they think that those towers transfer right to one Donald John Trump\nThese people are afraid because they realize at the end of\nThe day they're gig in overthrowing our government and overthrowing our way of life is almost over all we need is a few more dominant was in place because we do have a president who cares about the people in our country who is willing to make hard choices\nAnd be on how to write to shift I have a little bit of research on a couple of those things that I mentioned because it's worth noting that the executive orders that have been issued honorable rocket center bombing and under Donald J Trump's\nGive him the power give the presidency the executive branch the power to well let's just barely prosecute some of these [noise] above the law or individuals when you said last far [noise]\nWell uh let me read a couple of her text like Rick enrichment a colonel Mike number two in Virginia Beach says I'm into your quarter Rick\nHe's spot on people are waking up and their parents Eric in Richmond your neighbor says I agree with your quarter Rick I was about to say it when the president going to get rid of sessions De Niro Jay can get to work\nOr the answer is after the midterm shorter Newport News says\nWhat's the over under four new accusers this week\nUh five is the answer to that [noise] five Rick thank you [noise] could observation ... thank you\nLook I'm you're going to hear the Democrats shorter\nLaying about how this disaster for the Republicans in the ...\nAnd you know I give the strike they can keep doing that\nBut let me give it to you straight\nAnd so beyond the pale of what regular Americans who believe in the right thing to do at the end of the day when you get rid of the partisans on both sides and you look at middle America the people who elected Trump they have a sense of fairness\nAnd they think what this man has been through all the polls are showing this is beyond\nThe scope and they're horrified by it\nSo I'm telling you that this controversy I Believe had woken Trump supporters and conservatives up that would have otherwise stayed home they don't like the Republican Party they don't like flakes they don't like any of the Republicans are Trump supporters they believe in the sky\nBut they were not going to come out in the midterms they just they don't even know they don't care but this year we have litter match under Trump voters like I've said this I'm saying that again\nThere's nothing the Trump campaign could have done\nTo get these people out like the mistreatment that people are saying of Brett Kavanaugh and Josh Holmes who is the cheapest therefore Mitch McConnell said\nLooking at some point in he tweeted out looking at some poll numbers this morning it's impossible to overstate how important the Kavanaugh hearings have been to the voters it's like dropping a grenade\nInto the electorate teams in red states are not gonna like these numbers they're all going down you know Americans have a sense of fairness and it\nCuts both ways it's not partisan if everything was flipped and Republicans were doing this they would get punished by the electorate\nAmericans have a deep sense of fairness that's where the reactor to their kids being separated from their families and\nAll that they don't like that Americans don't like unfairness they don't like people not treated well I mean it's it's the American way they don't like it and so just before the midterms they're experiencing this you cannot get away from the Kavanaugh\nHarry I think this has been our major topic the last what three three weeks\nI don't even remember when I talked about something else so everybody is talking about that even people that are not involved in politics and there's a sense of fairness in this thing is going to blow up and the Democrats face like you've never seen it\nAnd there's going to be I predict it there's gonna be a massive turnout of Trump supporters and Republicans and in the country on the metro you're going to get the biggest percentage of voters turnout in these midterms than you ever had in that favors the Republicans are certainly going to keep the house\nAnd they're going to getting five or six teams in the Senate as a result\nTo get all next week\nAnd then not litter match it's like there's a gasoline can that over somebody overturned and the Democrats took a book on the matches let the book on fire and talk to that John truckers radio network with us we'll be right back [noise]\n[noise] [noise] without\nI mean the guy is I mean we've come to life or something and this is the finest moment I mean I'm not a fan of his for a long time ago one\nOf the biggest critics he drives me nuts he's an interim intervention on warmongering human McCain running\nAround with the Arab Spring cheering on the Muslim Brotherhood and wherever they were doing but uh this is grabs finest moment\nRemember was grandma was one of the prosecutors during the Clinton impeachment hearings when he was in the house right you got to go back there and it was he was pretty tough back then I was opposed to that I thought it was a dumb things for Newt Gingrich to do but uh they went ahead and impeached Clinton of course you're going to get a beach in\nThe Senate they couldn't get anywhere in here two thirds I'm\nSure they got fifty percent and that was the end of that but uh and of course the Republicans a lot because it didn't make any sense that was just me though back that I don't believe it was a good thing to do\nJohn perfect radio network trucking the truth across America a day for you know John\nEight eight eight four five six or six or calling number you can text us seven five seven six five two one seven\nOne zero Dave Brat joining us eight oh five Denver Riggleman eight thirty five stem Nunberg nine to five watts of\nAction coming up plus your calls [noise] and the segment brought you buy America First policy the number one political action committee that supports\nPresident Trump's America First agenda the administration just announced tariffs on another two hundred billion in Chinese made goods for total so far two hundred fifty fifty billion\nChina has violated every commitment made when I joined the world Trade Organization they use government planning in state owned enterprises they dumped their product subsidizes companies a target or industries to gain an unfair advantage over our country we will not allow or workers to be victimized anymore are companies to be treated\nAnd indoor well to be tortured those days are\nThe same failed the times for talk it's over America must act\nTo defend our national interest America doesn't apologized for protecting its citizens called Congress today at two o two two to four three two

authorized by America First\nPolicies and corporate the U.S and Canada last night before the midnight deadline Trump once again the president\nForging an eleventh hour trade deal late Sunday night that replaces NAFTA NAFTA is now dead\nThe president steady within poison and other promises made another promise kept nobody thought he could do it talented caved Mexico caved what do I keep saying\nThe president can't lose these trade deals\nBecause we have what they want consumers with money to buy their products China taming now taking terrorists down the ones they threatened coming down why like I've been telling you for two years\nThis is a trade war these countries including in you can't win all you have to do is grow a spot and saying no we've had enough the money is flowing\nOne way from us to that the new deal called the U.S Mexico Canada agreement or\nUs Sam said don't you like us them see a lot better than NAFTA us AMC represents a huge win for Trump and the validation\nOf the trade strategy that everybody said what's going to remember all the\nDemocrats and that and then never Trump of Republicans in the wall Street Journal whining about\nHow this was going to raise prices and it was going to be a disaster and the economy would collapse and it would be economic Armageddon and everybody would die because Canada well they're our allies we can't tell them they can't have a three hundred percent tariff on dairy products in the meantime\nDump their dairy products putting our farmers and it was in Wisconsin and Minnesota out of business oh we can't tell them that\nIt'll be the end of the world this is a great step for America\nThe stupid trade deals that have hammered us workers for years that nobody would do a damn thing about not George Bush that Bill Clinton none of them well Clinton's deal not not any of them\nAnd did nothing finally Trump comes along it stops at\n\nThe U.S embassies intellectual property provisions there's new rules for the origin of the automobile industry and labor requirements as ways to encourage advancement and production\nIn the U.S this is a great thing for our economy in a joint statement released a

conference\nAnd said he was done negotiating with them and he was dark see that's the other thing the president says he doesn't fluffy says I'm Talking about he said that the press covers I was there on Wednesday\nHe said I'm done negotiating with Canada I don't like to undergo shelters I don't like their chief negotiator I don't like their attitude I don't like anything about it so I've instructed\nMy team to stop talking to them they're out I'm going to go forward without a that was a Wednesday friday or by\nThursday Friday Saturday Sunday for games they have\n\nThe president saying last night it will strengthen the middle class it would create good well paying job the new opportunities for new for nearly\nAll Americans\nAnd uh it's a great day now they actually there was a joint statement actually put out and a joint statement by the two countries announcing this deal now the White House was required to give Congress the text of a proposed trade with Mexico by midnight to proceed under\nComplicated fast track trade rules given to the president because they gave it to Obama [laughter] oh isn't that funny I Love when Trump can take advantage of the power everybody gave a\nObama be careful what you wish for white\nHouse trade advisor and my personal hero Peter Navarro is the man told Fox News Sunday\nThat after hearing from the U.S to go shading team there was a broad agreement on some matters\nBut there was still things that have to get worked out and apparently they did that in off the record comments to Bloomberg in August Trump disclose you would make no traces concessions to Canada and he may not and again he called him out on a Wednesday in a life press conference\n\nAnd the his remarks with Bloomberg that was supposed to be off the record were made public he was mad about that but it worked to his advantage and Trump said last night that he was glad that Canada understood his position\nTen cents roughly Seventy five percent of its X. sports to
