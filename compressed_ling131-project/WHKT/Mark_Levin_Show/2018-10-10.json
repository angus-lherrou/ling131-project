right there front and center and\nI was kinda shocked by it and I thought it was great and then he also apologized to judge Kavanaugh and his family for having a job through the nonsense and a lot of polls showing Cory now that the Democrats overplay their hand backfiring that Trump voters are fired up\nWhat are you seeing on the ground\nOr young when things actually right look this president came out yesterday and apologized to judge Kavanaugh\nFamily for one endured and we know the mainstream we will never apologized the accusations the attacker character and went to his reputation with

times now no matter what when you catch liberals and what we thought it was the truth when they're using language that conservatives couldn't say well\nYou know that was when the person was young we stand by them or whatever it is it's always a double so with the press outlined yesterday\nWhen he was saying a judge Kavanaugh as Justice Kennedy was something different something\nAt older he has the ability to do which is to bring attention to it should be with you is the personal appropriate tactic judge Kavanaugh on his family received from Rochester but also for the main street [noise] and the premise of the\nBiggest one microphone world um what was it was the right thing to do and I can tell you John I've said\nThis many times there are multiple copies of the Republican Party\nEverybody right now it's full of four weeks from today because they see\nWhat the rest of wants to do what they're capable of doing and what they will do if they took back the house of representatives which is talking about impeachment both of our president and moreover jumped his cabinet already so the Republicans are United they're fired up and you're seeing that in the polling and this is going to be much closer election\nEarly December McCain who is the deputy director of the FBI who was fired for among other reasons you know running aligned to the FBI under oath on three occasions he was fired for that his book is coming up against all profit off of Donald Trump and one cell\nIn the book world stories about Donald Trump we've seen\nThat now with fire and fury in Woodward and all the other you know tabloids that have been out there and published but my guess is accurate Rod Rosenstein is going to do he will use his perch and number two person at the department of justice or took when he finally leaves whether he fired him quit\nTo go and write a book and just you know be skating against this president because that's how these guys stay alive and this is how these guys staying [noise] you know in the public arena and it really it's a terrible terrible thing to be honest with you\nAgree with the new allegations out now\nThe rock scene comments that he was going to attempt to wired wired to president and then go with the tape for Santa and then go to the cabinet to invoke the twenty cents and then get them out and I get to FBI as you said to be\nA senior official saying they believe them and they said he was serious they reported that to their\nChild to James Baker he thought it was seriously thought it was the origins of the way now to information\nThat's awful me when I just find this guy now\nBut I I think I think you're exactly right I think the president wants to get through this election cycle doesn't want anything to distract the Republicans have momentum on their side but I Do think you have to look wrong term at\nThe ability of Rod Rosenstein to stay in that position what it wants to leave the position you can do that anytime he can resign if he wants to but I think you have to call into question do you have the ability to continue in his capacity\nAs a deputy attorney general based on the information that we're hearing some other members others she remembers that served with him in official capacity in the department of justice or the FBI and if they're saying that if their accounting for\nWhat McCain said to be true that shouldn't be buried troubling to everybody and we do know unequivocally that Rod Rosenstein signed one of the fires application renewables which allowed them to continue to spy on American citizens\nIt's not on redacted that we need that we need to see that we need to see the three oh two news which are the FBI's note after they talk to Bruce or at the department of justice to see what's in there and we have to understand what the insurance policy was to keep Donald Trump from being elected to the FBI was\nTalking about and what role if any of those things in that because as a deputy attorney general he had the right to sign that find that application and from what I understand\nAnd what is becoming widely known now that's my application was riddled with mistakes and and it was based on the false premise about the dossier and that last renewable was actually signed when Donald Trump was the sitting president of the United\nStates and the American people deserve the right to see what was in that renewal application that Rod Rosenstein\nYou recommend to the program Robin Jones' November seventh\nAnd work I Would I Would recommend to the president is declassified all of the documents let the American people beside and see what has actually transpired\nThe FBI's credibility because of what Jim Comey and McCain and now James Baker and Peter shark and lead the page has done to an organization is just devastating it will take\nDecades to recover from what they have done jet organization\nTrying to use their positions people were already people were badges going after American citizens spying on American citizens because he didn't like the political affiliation of their opponents were anything that our country has been against\nCensus inception and guys like Peter Straub record the head of the counterterrorism\nUnit has more opportunity than anybody he was the one who botched the Clinton email investigation he won who led the team that it was called a crosswind hurricane that\nSaid that there's nothing just seeing these district hundred thousand clean the males there were all part of Anthony when there's a laptop and he's the one who said hey let's go after Donald Trump he's doing the best we can we see\nNow with the text messages between Lisa Page and the restaurant and they were at least minimum complicit\nWith what Jim Comey and McCain and Jim Baker and potentially\nRosen steam want it done and the question is and this is a very very big question how high did this go in the U.S government we know that the director of the CIA\nAnd the director of national intelligence and others were aware of their spine going on on domestic soil against us citizens but exactly how high did it go uh this is this is the biggest untold story\nOf the last two years you get this could lead right up to the very top of the government\nWhich leads to just what is your what what happened to I mean he's not doing anything launching any of these special counsel to investigate it with you\nPeople were to go all the way up to and everything else where Jeff Sessions and\nWell look this whole investigation has been by and large turned over to the ... the inspector general of the department of justice to find out if there's been any wrongdoing and we've seen some of that report already because it's been released publically the report that recommended\nThe number two person at the FBI not only be fired but charged criminally\nWe're waiting for that to occur uh we're waiting to see what happens to appear struck and Lisa Page and and and Jim Baker the general capital from the FBI we're waiting to find out what happens when Jim Comey because\nIt is very possible that Jim Comey has brought up on charges of potentially perjuring in front of Congress leaking of classified information even though Jim said he didn't think it was classified that's not an excuse wouldn't do that he gave his notes his work product which was he was not allowed to do\nTo the law professor to make sure that could lead to the media there's been no accountability\nAnybody at any level of the government for what they've done which was try they try to influence the outcome of the U.S election because what Clinton supported by and large and they did not want to see a candidate Trump become President Trump and I don't understand\nWhat the accountability is and why it hasn't come out yet\nNovember's are we going to\nBlow up so John I really hope so and I and I and I hope for the president's take\nOn that he has a team focused on helping him achieve all of the result which he's been able to do by and large almost singlehandedly if you look at what the president's been able to accomplish what three point\nSeven percent unemployment the lowest unemployment rate\nFor African Americans and Hispanics he's done some of this ah with the help of the athletes in lieu of her staff quite candidly and we've seen in the Woodward book or the staff tried on multiple occasions to stop him from doing things in stopping trying to stop him from being successful but he's persevering he's gone on and done things that historic\nLevels just think for a second is we understand that surround him that actually wanted him to be successful thinking about how much more he could accomplish he's done so much already but there are still people who don't want to see him be successful there are still people who serve\nIn the government or whether they're bureaucrats elected officials or people who have taken positions that didn't support him in the campaign and they're still trying to stop ... agenda at every turn and\nAll of the six restaurant he has had in the first two years of history and I can only wonder how much more he could have had if you had the right team around him supporting him every step of the way in all these government agencies\nFor the first to do on November Corey brings down the street and this is my goodness you're right you're thinking you're looking all over the top was seen in twenty months and he did that in spite of the staff\nChecking your cell phone could go to websites or not divulging information I mean it's almost criminal what they've done on this was his own staff just the people that are there to serve the president's agenda\nThey were nothing but an obstacle trying to stop he was doing and he still got all this accomplished it's an amazing that you can only imagine in the next two years what did you do if he has a house and he has a Senate and he's got people in there that actually are\nAdvocating for his agenda rather than doing everything to stop it or stolen unbelievable courting with Jackie thank you for being with us recordings booklet Trump the Trump got another\nGreat for coming out Trump's enemies that's wild in November I Believe that there\nWere twenty seven I think we I was going to be luck I promise you\nLot can happen to twenty eight days twenty games in an

know historical precedent has said the mid term election changes in the ministry and whether that cabinet members whether it's staff\nMembers in the building or whether it's senior member of different\nDepartments that historically has happened I think will happen again regardless of the outcome of the election that will happen but when we predict what's\nGoing to happen in my opinion\n[noise] believes in four weeks off for a month or two years or whatever it is he will go out and he will do exactly what Jim Comey what McCain did exactly what all these guys do\nThey go out and they write these books they get these massive answer and then they say about their time in the White House with their time in the department of justice and ah you know how to\nSave America from this president that's what they're going to do that's my prediction I'm certain it will happen in certain\nThere are other people who are the administrators have served in the ministry and who are going to do the same thing and this is this playing now John Lucy and for two years when people go in there to serve in that capacity and they're going to write a book what Jim Kobe book sold a lot of copies gyms very very wealthy and\nThat's what these guys want to do the caves book comes out in early December McCain who is the deputy director of the FBI who was fired for among other reasons you know when they're lying to them\nAll profit off of Donald Trump wants to sell in the book world stories about Donald Trump we've\nSeen that now with fire and fury in Woodward and all the other you know tabloids that have been out there and published but my guess what Rod Rosenstein is going to do he will use his perch and number two person at the department of justice or took when he finally leaves wedding firing quit drawing write a book and just you know be screaming\nAgainst this president because that's how these guys stay alive and how these guys stayed on you know in the public arena and it really it's a terrible terrible thing to be honest with you\nAgree with the new allegations out now that\nThe rosters seen\nComments that he was going to attempt to wired wired to president\nAnd then do with the Senate and then go to the cabinet to invoke the twenty something then get them out and get us to be a senior officials saying they believe them and they thought he was dead serious they reported that too and they're\nNow to James Baker he thought it was serious McCain started with the origins of your way now to information that's off I mean why doesn't the smartest guy now\nLook I think I think you're exactly right I think the president wants to get through this election cycle doesn't want anything to distract the Republicans have momentum on their side but I Do think you have to look long term the ability of Rod Rosenstein to stay in that position looked it wants to leave the position he can do that anytime\nHe can resign if he wants to but I think you have to call into question has the ability to continue in his capacity as a deputy attorney general based on the information that we're hearing from other members other senior members that served\nWith him we spoke about in the department of justice or the FBI and if they're saying that their accounting for\nWhat McCain said to be true\nThat she was very troubling to everybody and we do know unequivocally that Rod Rosenstein\nSigned one of the fires application renewable which allowed them to continue to spy on American citizens on us soil application has ever been made available to the president's not redacted that we need that we need to see\nThat we need to see the thrill choose which are the FBI's milk after they talked to Bruce or at the department of justice to see what's in there and we have to understand what the insurance policy wise to keep Donald Trump from being elected to the FBI was talking\nAbout and what role if any thing in that because as a deputy attorney general he had the right to sign that five application and from what I understand and what is becoming widely known now\nThat's my application was riddled with mistakes and it was based on the false premise about the dossier that last renewable was actually signed when Donald Trump was the sitting president of the United states and the American people deserve the right\nTo see what was that renewal application that Rod Rosenstein\nLook I\nWhen I Would recommend to the president declassified all of the documents let the American people decide and see what has actually transpired the FBI's credibility because of what Jim Comey and Amy McCain and now James Baker and Peter Struck at least a patron of guns that organization is just devastating it will take\nDecades to recover from what they have done that organization trying to use their positions people within the party people badgers going after American citizens spying on American citizens\nBecause they didn't like the political affiliation or their opponents everything that our country has been again centered in section\nAnd guys like Peter Straub core the head of the counterterrorism unit had more than anybody he was one box the Clinton email investigation keep one who led the team that was called crosswind hurricane that said\nHey there's nothing is being these extra six hundred thousand Clinton males there were all part of the winners and he's the one who said hey let's go after Donald Trump he's one of the investigation we've seen\nIt now with the text messages between Lisa Page and Peter Struck and they were at least minimum complicit with what gym called me and Amy and Jim Baker and potentially Robert was interesting one and done and the question is John and this is a very very big question\nHow high did this go in the U.S government we know that the director of the CIA\nAnd the DNI director of national intelligence and others were aware of this spying going on on domestic soil against us since but exactly how high gear to go uh this is this is the biggest untold story of the last two years you\nGet this could lead right up to the very top of the government\nWhich leads to Jeff Sessions what happened to just not doing anything launching these special counsel to investigate would you alleged to be the biggest scandal in the United states history ever spying\nOn people for political gain all the way up to do and everything else where Jeff Sessions\nWill look this whole investigation has been buying large turned over to uh the ige the inspector general of the department of justice to find out if there's been any wrongdoing and we've seen some of that report already because there's been released publically the report that recommended\nThe number two person at the FBI and they're only be fired but charged criminally we're waiting for that to occur\nUh we're waiting to see what happens to a rock and leaves a page and and and Jim Baker the general counsel for the FBI we're waiting to find out what happens to the gym combing because\nIt is very possible that Jim Comey has brought up on charges of potentially perjury in front of Congress leaking of classified information even though Jim said he didn't think it was classified that's not an excuse we know that he gave his notes his work product which was he was not allowed to do too\nBilly buddy level of government for what they've done which was try they try to influence the outcome of the U.S election because what Clinton supported\nBy and large they did not want to [noise] Trump become President Trump and I don't understand when Kennedy and Ryan hasn't come out yet\nNovember seventh are we going to\nHouse or not\nI Hope so John I really hope so and I and I hope for the sake that she has a\nFocus on helping him achieve all over the result which he's been able to do by and large singlehandedly\nIf you look at what the president's been able to accomplish what three point seven percent unemployment the lowest unemployment rate for African American and Hispanic [noise] down or when I went to help others down a little staff quite candidly and we've seen\nIn the Woodward book or the staff tried on multiple occasions to stop him from doing things and stopping trying to stop them from being successful but each person has gone on and I think historical level\nFor a second it'd be at a staff that surrounded and actually wanted him to be successful ticket how much more he could accomplish so\nMuch already but there are people who don't want to see him be successful there are still people who serve in the government or whether they're bureaucrats elected officials or people who have taken that didn't support him in the campaign and they're still trying to stop\nIt was a gender at every turn and all of the success that he has had\nIn the first two years of history and I can only wonder how much more could have had had the right to around him support him every step of the way\nAnd various positions who's goal is to undermine\nThe president's agenda and if if if you think this is not real\nThis has got to be the blockbuster book is one of\nBooks when the when the excerpts come on if it's got to be absolutely stunning Washington because all the other stuff was here say this is gonna be here's a list of the people that are undermining the president who put on a badge everyday and going in the west wing\nAnd they're basically a ruse or guy there spy if you will and they're working for the opposition and they're never truckers and they were put there by previous that's what's going to happen\nIf the if the Republicans can somehow managed to hang on to these midterms in its fasten your seatbelt because this president's gotta clean house and he's got to bring people in there that actually believe that it's America first agenda that will work tirelessly in order to pursue\nThomas shipments in the last twenty months in the stunning especially in the face of opposition within his own staff\nI mean forget the other party forget policy and Schumer forget the Democrats forget the never Trump present Congress forget them I'm Talking about people in the government and people in his own staff his\nTeam that come in their everyday in council had entered taking things off a desk\nAnd manipulating information\nAnd fighting him and a slow walking things installing things including his treasury secretary my notion is another one from Goldman Sachs who tried to undermine every single trade\nDeal that the president made by a is a free trader and his friends on Wall street and Goldman Sachs they want they want cheap goods and higher profits they don't care if you have a job or not what the\nCare they haven't cared about you in thirty or forty years old they care about is how big their bonuses and how much profit can they drive in the business schools now teach that they teach equity for ownership workers are commodity yeah Gary Cohn and they're fighting them I mean it goes on and\nSo I look forward to this and I look forward to finally the president being able to get in a position where we can actually get some things done\nEven though we have got things done but imagine how much more effective it ... if we could get to a point where the people surrounding him\nActually believe that his agenda and I for one hope that the court goes in there and some senior capacity because I think it'd be great John triggers radio network trucks in the truth across America [noise]\nSo we have a a resignation UN ambassador\nIn Nikki Haley now I'm not a Nikki Haley fan I don't like her I never did sorry she was never proper reformer on the campaign to embarrass herself by\nOr doing one of those uh uh ... what do you call it response speeches to Obama and trashing Trump instead of using it to respond\nTo the president's you perhaps for speech trashing Trump She was never Trump or from the beginning okay Trump is unique ability or being able to pick enemies that he thinks are confident she has been a confident a U.S ambassador\nAnd she's had to embrace Trump's policies but she's also publicly different with the president on a number of issues and deep down she doesn't believe any of this stuff and so I don't know why she left I mean she says she's tired or she needs to make more money in order for families in debt I mean you think about it I don't\nKnow I think your husband who was the military but she's got two children teenagers she lives in New York City you don't get a stipend for that you get a hundred and Seventy nine thousand dollars as a UN ambassador and you've got to live in New York City oh good\nAnd so she broke and I I\nI get her leaving to make more money in the private sector and why\nNot leave now where you can make millions of dollars and get rich because that's what everybody does do serve the government get out get rich become a millionaire then go they go back then serve again and get out make more millions produced nothing but make millions the\nWashington government swamp way and everybody's involved in both both sides of the aisle and all you only have to do is get them get appointed to a government position and you're guaranteed to have it make a mansion in northern Virginia or a\nBesides the Maryland You're guaranteed you gotta make millions of dollars by doing nothing\nExcept serving the government writing a book going on TV and\nYou know Nikki Haley will write a tell all book about you know how Trump socks 'cause that's what they all do\nThat is what's up I don't like it I never did and she was certainly a competent UN ambassador but I have no interest\nAnd why don't you leave it at this time I really don't know what ... have been better if she could have hung out for another twenty nine days twenty eight days now until November seventh and then decided to leave sure because it's another day\nThe tremendous economy while the accomplishments that Trump is having Kavanaugh\nIt's another day we're not talking about the success of the America First agenda it's another day we're just changing the subject talking about something else and it plays right into the Democrats hands that don't want to talk about\nAnything that has anything to do with the economy period [noise] you know now\nDemocrats big push is Obamacare now they're running on on that health care or they can't run on Medicaid for all because it's Twenty one trillion dollars [noise] excuse me so they can't one\nThat so what do they what are they running\nPreexisting conditions that stern anything they found in some polls someplace that people are concerned about getting rid of Obamacare because that would get rid of pre existing conditions so if you voted for a\nCan't replace whatever that monstrosity was that Paul Ryan had 'em that don't have pre existing conditions plus insurance companies could raise your right so that's the one issue now\nThat it's come full circle preexisting conditions and a Trump sucks that's their that's their that's their campaign platform to who's going to replace Nikki Haley well the front runner\nThere's two front runners and then there was a two choices I've got\nThe front runner right now is dean a pile she was um in the national security division she's a bushy um and I never Trump or but\nAnd the family likes her and she was just on you\nSo she is the front runner\nI Would say right now I Would suppose and certainly the establishment pick to replace Nikki Haley my two choices driving a clue Dana ... I'm sure she'd be fine [noise] uh but I think better choices or\nRent Grinnell the ambassador\nTo Germany also happens to be gay\nWho have the experience who's been in the state department who's been at the un\nWho shares Trump's America First a genuine all with a lot of enthusiasm especially at real as it relates to foreign policy or that will be choices number two my choice number one would be his daughter Ivanka Trump hands down\nShe would be the best choice no doubt I don't think he's going to choose their he's afraid of being used of nepotism especially before the midterms I don't see it happening but she's in my mind she'd be the best choice but if I can put a statement out\nYesterday saying that she's not interested in in the position that doesn't mean that can happen\nBut if you got to walk in there at least you have someone actually believe in the president's agenda I'm sure Dina Powell be fine\nI think a record that would be a better choice\nI mean at some point you have to start to reward the people who are with\nYou know from the beginning like Rick right now you know he was a high profile gay Republican who came out for Trump very early Nikki Haley Fort Trump the hallway so at some point in this administration you have to start to reward\nThe people who believed in you know what the beginning who stuck by you went to a beginning\nWho never wavered like right now and actually believe\nIn the things that you're that you're saying and don't have to retrofit their own policies to tell me a lot now there's no sense of urgency here John vote was in charge of it he was there and he was UN ambassador he knows what he's doing so it's not like the position has to get the show tomorrow\nWe've gone through the uh\nAnnual United Nations general assembly meeting so that's over but those would be my choices\nI had to elect somebody if I had to protect now I just got to be getting a pile and then if I was also very much liked by a\n[noise]\nBreaking news this hour from town halls but\nOn the feeder fish Okay Michael cannot break Florida that's Florida governor Rick Scott after the powerful storm slammed into the Florida Gulf Coast with winds of ...\nThousands without power he is worried about the people who did not evacuate\nBecame really fast um you know the first thing I Wish every everybody didn't evacuated so and I'm so proud that we didn't lose anybody a that was that was disappointing to me that everybody didn't didn't evaluate\nIt remains a dangerous storm with wins downgraded to a hundred and fifty miles an hour as it makes its way through\nAlabama and Georgia end of the Carolinas the White House says there is no reason for concern after us stocks suffered that were lost and eight months Wednesday at the five day markets my raises concerns but the record bull market maybe ending\nPress secretary Sarah Sanders says the fundamentals of teachers of the U.S economy remains incredibly strong the Dow Jones industrial average fell eight hundred thirty one points Wednesday on the NASDAQ Composite which has a high concentration of technology companies had its biggest loss in more than two years\nFBI Director Christopher Wray is defending the agency's background check of new Supreme Court justice Brett Kavanaugh\nRight says the FBI did what it was asked to do our only authority is as requested by the educating\nEight of my house in this case is the White House and recalled the investigation specific and limited in skill my folks have assured me that the usual process was Paul Ryan did not respond to a question on if it investigated whether capital have lied under oath\nCapitol Hill correspondent Wiley Heinz reporting the New York state police superintendent says the limousine service operator is solely responsible for a troubled lemme being on the road during a crash that killed twenty people superintendent George ... spoke at a news conference Wednesday after ...

spread\nHow can CNN say Thirteen and used a sex he said it's very simple\nWe use a likely voters model so we look at likely voters CNN just cause people up they don't call likely voters they call voters [noise] so what do they voted or not there in the mix\nAnd that only skewed towards the Democrats and he said it also they they manipulate the question [noise] so he said CNN doesn't do a poll they do a push poll the push pull means we want to get a certain result so we can spread that\nIn the news and the press Republican voters so they won't make phone calls work et cetera nobody wants to put time and it for a lost cause and so when he was telling me is the CNN polling is fake news it's a push fault it's designed to set a narrative\nIn order to influence a result that's why the network
