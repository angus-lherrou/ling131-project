then they basically are they become a\nThird political party in Virginia so the stakes for wars in the libertarians are very high maintenance shift gears a minute let's go to this caravan now\nFive thousand people make his way up through Guatemala if you are in the Senate or what would be your position right now with us\nWell I certainly I wouldn't I wouldn't you think a little differently I mean first of all that there's no doubt there's a crisis in Guatemala Honduras and El Salvador writers there's a there's a refugee crisis people are fleeing that country and I I think we need to have a Latin American\nI have to put Mexico in that mixture because we're coming right through Mexico um you know I think it starts there I I Would I Would I Would rather than a ticket and approach\nI Would almost fancy humanizing approach to this and and and very skilled approach why Trump is going I Would take much more diplomatic approach it how can how can we solve this problem together\nWell that's a very long term memory loss I sent her an entertainer of you you know that's a very long term view let's all sit down and I guess it ends up and getting more money\nTo uh to these countries that you just said you would cut off so no money's going to get involved according to Matt waters for thousands of five thousand people were coming right now just want to ask them can't they're coming now not tomorrow or next week now they're coming now their objective is to go through Mexico get the southern border\nFive thousand of them would cross a thousand or be apprehended we ever getting about twenty percent the other eighty percent you'd never find them again and up to twenty percent would you ever hit eighty percent of them\nUh ended up not returning for whatever the piece of paper they give them to go back to court or whatever\nAnd they can't separate them from their children we've already been through that kids in case Brian K drink before the midterms how's it going to happen\nSo basically they all get scot free if you don't do something what would you do\nYeah I looked at church or a party I mean some of us who are open border if I was actually I don't share that\nI see people even tighter border security we need to stop\nIt like I said a leaker crossed paths like you can't do that so so what would you to get anything I mean you need to have it either National Guard I lost my plan is to pull the forty two thousand troops you know out of Germany and put them on the southern border for fifty thousand Japan I put him on the southern border put for twenty eight dollars an hour south\nSouthern port we'd have a pretty good forced out there we spent our\nMoney in this country rather than any other countries around the globe\nNow we're talking that now we're talking see that's the plan\nLet's get or a troops out of Germany Japan and where else South Korea south girls get 'em out and let's put him on the southern border that solves the problem\nAnd there is no increase costs now there's an argument that you haven't been in South Korea for a lot of reasons but why we have twenty thousand troops in Germany and all those troops in Japan makes no sense whatsoever to anybody except those that want\nTo perpetuate the military industrial complex and make money off supplying these troops over the globe because of the other day man if you just follow the money in Washington it's really easy just follow the money and you follow what it's all corrupt you got to follow it and you're going to\nFind out where does who's backing who

up give it right here\nFor what he described as weak immigration laws that have allowed undocumented migrants to enter the U.S the Republican controlled Senate and house this year has rejected multiple immigration bills including one backed by the president that would have combined border security funny\nWith other measures short by the Democrats as I discuss was a Senator Tim Kaine acute cog in this chain migration the Democrats can go\nFor DACA and they can go for a wall and they can go for the funding but they absolutely want chain migration\nBecause that gives them democratic votes and the Republican donors on Wall street back that too because that brings them cheap labor along with the illegals\nBut the president says I don't want chain migration because that puts a lock on the American economy I Want migration that is based on job skill and job needs to win the immigrant comes into the U.S they have a job and they can contribute to society just like Australia\nDoes and the man child trigger do doesn't matter if the man child can do it so good way\n\nTo preserve goes out to say today I Am watching the Democratic party led because they weren't open borders assault on our country by Guatemala doors in El Salvador\nWhose leaders are doing real to stop this large flow of people which I'm calling in an invasion that's mean our Trump including many criminals from entering Mexico to the U.S\nThe president wrote into three parts week you said in addition\nTo stopping all payments to these countries all payments which seemed to have almost no control over their population I must in his wrongs of terms as Mexico to stop the onslaught and they've been able to do so I Will call up to you as the military and simply closer southern border close it means no one will come in and they'll be\nFifty thousand troops there you simply are not going to come in and there'll be a standard for days and they're going to have to figure it out and then there'll be cameras on the other side seeing people starving I mean this is what's going on here\n\nThe president and is that the border security is far more important to him than that then the recently concluded new North American free trade deal\n\nNow a a spending package passed by Congress a month ago put off the debate over uh getting the money for the for the wall and effectively pushing back fight to the Republicans want to avoid before the midterms\n\nRecord number of asylum seeking families from Latin America have recently overwhelms our corn border agents and immigration authorities or having another surge of illegals coming in border patrol facilities are crowded\nWith a newly arrived families bed space that family detention centers in Texas is at a premium and immigration court ...\nAnd we can't arrest them and send them back we already tried that and went through kids in cages and you're Nineteen days from the mid term so they got to be no more pictures\nOf kids separated from their parents so all you have to do now before that not Nineteen days is up\nIs grab a child if it's yours because it doesn't matter grab a child in your family and you're going to get an entry to the United states because the politicians are now on the Republican side petrified of kids in cages\nSo they're going to win again\nAnd the president knows he can't come back this politically because the PR the PR is a disaster Nineteen days for the midterms so he says well here's what I'm going to do I'm going to deport them military is a problem with that here's the problem every solution right now Nineteen days has consequences\nIf it was November seventh there would be easier to easier to do you're going to get the military at the border they're going to be with guns confronting miles with babies that's going to be all over the New York times because these people in the fake news media they want open borders open\nBorders even though with means that it's the end of their jobs and their businesses and they'll have no money in the country will collapse they don't care because they know that there'll be the elites and there'll be fine and then they will rule over the rest of us poor slobs the pro military it's\n\nRight I mean I I don't even know how to even put this in in the logical terms\n\nMean what is it even want to ask Tim Kaine he had to admit I'm not for overboard is I'm not for these people coming over I mean but you know that the Democrats are going to defend\nIt and they are now calling them economic refugees oh we're not accepting refugees we you know where's the richest

program I didn't want to go back and I was like I'm a why something like that I really don't want to go and watch football I Want to shell out Sunday night there's a great game on or off oh go you'll have fun okay fine subsidies to German teachers trying\nTo have a conversation and thinking I don't know any German writer what are you going to do ... you know\nYour whole [laughter] how's Hitler you know [laughter] you know or do you go with that conversation well it turns out they speak beautiful English they probably better than than we do structurally and um and I and I said ooh how\nAre the electricity in Bulgaria because they're very has their lectures on Sunday was a very important election in Germany that's the kind of guy and that's what I followed and well just one teacher was up or a teacher of politics so then we went down a rabbit hole two hours later at the dinner table we just we just were chewing up politics\nAnd what do you tell me about but very was is that it is\nUh Germany for folding point like three percent unemployment youth unemployment is extremely well ah the school system is set up to get people to work straight away I'm thinking if if you're like a tenth grade and you're not you don't really want to go to university you don't have to take it to make it you could go right into a a a trade school and apprentice program\nAnd you're getting a job as a performer\nSo they get um really mentioned it's a very work intensive area they they pride themselves culturally on work in productivity an organization and good government right there there was like a it's not like a shining example of how you would want to have\nA state where a region actually be everyone's employed there was a job you have any functions ah and it works well they had this major upset during the elections and you go what are you upset about what what could you possibly\nBe that concerned about that you basically blow up this I don't know if they blow it up but how does major ups and the ruling party that has been has been in control for\nDecades washed probably the message and the ruling majority in Bavaria and it was stunning to me to realize that we're not immune from that here here in America so people say you know the economy Republicans around the economy's\nGoing so great vote for us people don't vote on yesterday's news they don't vote on today's news they vote on the future where are we going where what is going to be happening that's my fear that's my concern is well things are going well you know\nWhat Donald Trump got elected gasoline was about two twenty five a gallon now it's around two eighty a two thousand eight was four dollars a gallon or better but are we getting better are we getting worse you know we hear the China news today about their economy is slowing down its growth rate of growth and that has a factor on the human psyche about how\nHow's it going to manifest itself in my life you see these commercials they're not all about you know skills and here's my dad says there about this guy off all she's horrible there ... there but there's no big overriding issue like here's what we're going to do in the future it's just that the other person is really bad\nTherefore they're not going to be good for you um and therefore because he got his going so well they're gonna hurt the economy I guess is what they strapped relations and the subconscious\nBut I'm going what is the big driving issue other than obviously Donald Trump and it's a fascinating\nTime in American politics of the reasons why I Do what I did because it is so interesting but also to teach people as I used to tell my students I really don't care I really don't care [laughter]\nWhat you think I kid that you think if I can encourage people to be more interested\nAbout what they're talking about to read another article to dig deeper to challenge themselves they will in turn create a better outcome for the rest of us now you tell my students I don't care who you vote for\nI just care that you know but if you don't vote I understand that's also a boat in itself because you were saying I'm\nNot I'm not doing this I I vote none of the above and it's and that's and that's tabulate and it'll aggregate itself just like a vote will and that people do that doesn't make any sense actually it's us if you don't show up for something the two political parties going to try to get you to show up next\nI told her to a a a family I was at a baseball game was and they were so upset or you just can't stand going and I didn't jump out\nIf they had an orange or both don't vote and tell them that you don't\nPut it on social media like you would anyone else anything else\nBut I'm not voting you haven't earned\nMy belt you haven't got me off my couch off my job is to go down and say I'm voting for this person you don't register ill aggregate data\nAnd that raw data collection and is dissected by the political class to determine what they want to do 'em and they and that's an ...\nSwings on the undecided voter right the independent voter in October it's like oh we're going to stop talking about these issues that motivate our base to a degree we're going to focus on these oh I'm really happy to work with the other side received this now and in certain cans I'll work with the president's\nWife shows up the polling independence they might not like President Trump but when they agree with you better work with them because that's the thing is\nYou know all politics is personal not just walk anyway discourse\nAccident filling in for John products if you tuned in to hear me drawing on about politics go who is this guy a I'm a former member of the house of delegates some filling in for John products as I Am wants to do a as John Otis on vacation with his son down in Florida in a baseball tournament a job as a baseball fan\nProbably looking as well but he was a pitcher in college and his son Joe Joes a pitcher if you want to call and ask me some questions love to hear from you in eighty four five six four six eight eight eight four five six four six eight eight eight for eight oh five six four six four you can taxidermy\nStraight away five four zero to non for zero six\nZero five four zero to nine four zero six zero I'm gonna have some great experts on later today quitting kid Chris report jak Wilson's Republican Party every congressman Robert Mintz a doctor Robin McDougal from the Virginia Commonwealth University while their school and\nJesse Harris from Iowa who's a political operative and uh as as on the Democratic\nSide in from the Republican side from New Hampshire will hear from identity and Susan slacker or my good friend from the Shenandoah Valley of we're a citizen for you know gosh early nineties I think when I started aging yourself there's there isn't a Democrat a\nChair a chair of the Democratic party Regina from highland county I kind of I used to represent they've known citizen for for decades and so we have we have the great friendship and I am looking forward to having all these costs calling today stir up the conversation all they go a little deeper we're going deeper\nToday in politics we're going to go deeper dive and not just you know the ... pulling the top one numbers but how\nThose posters got to those numbers who are they listening to who are they calling why are they calling because it's a very different when a university does a polling like CRISPR Newport you'll hear Clinton should talk about this they start with a\nVery broad universe um and it keeps coming down to a smaller University of actual likely voters\nGermans\nAnd we'll get to that we're getting to the nitty gritty well we'll get you take you do a deeper dive so when you look at the polls when you go to real clear politics which which I spent unfortunately way too much time on 'em I guess it's healthier than other websites right\nA ... you look at these different polls and and you go like to take a look at the polls on a generic ballot it's insane what what what we're looking at here although it's it's fascinating like generic ballot all district plus\nDemocrats parts that that was five Democrats plus the red cross the lab Democrats plus one what how do you get there\nYou say the pollen is wrong well Paul always right it's just data you're collecting of people call what the differences and the methodology who your goal I talked to one leading I'm democratic\nStores and I said okay what's your polling showing that Democrats are around ... ... thirties thirty or thirty\nThree percent or two that range Republicans\nWe've never seen self identification Republican this while it's around twenty four percent and what used\nTo be you know thirty four thirty four is now thirty four twenty four and independents are up around the world have been forties because Republicans have never been lower on self identification but we haven't\nPicked up any of those voters they're all self identifying now is independent that huge it when you get down to it with people when they understand what's really going on that's when they get more excited more years this is Chris\nMany just reminded me so much my friendship and I'm a black eye blessed to have it in my life but also a what a what a blessing and it's just to be alive right to be able to uh just experience\nAt all and I'm Wondering is I I enjoy coming and during this radio show is I get to\nHopefully get people excited about politics um I guess it does governor lives it is important you know we can't\nBreak down we have to work with each other to get good things that we should have the debate though we should have a vibrant vigorous debate that's right and lose the\nCountry forward um and we shouldn't be afraid to have that debate but we should have in a in a civil manner and I think today we see is a a lack of civility more and more and that's difficult in my professional life I Am\nThe executive director for junior freed the foundation for research and economic education and uh so we're probably once the three ... and we're nonpartisan which is a great lane to be in these days because everyone is you know red or blue and I'm like okay good for you well you know aren't you might not really I don't have to\nActually take nachos [laughter] even right oh yeah it can help care so [laughter]\nBut what we did was we represent businesses and uh we have a membership and what we try to do is educate them on politics and as a former teacher and a former business person in my family had a bottle of water business for years old a couple of years ago I bless Italy um\nYou know I I like getting people excited about learning about politics seeing it differently and what's that makes me there was aren't even deeper like you know when you when you go to the teacher subject are better than other subjects you have to really get\nInteresting topic\nBecause it brings in culture and a economics and history and I was a history major\nAnd it's like I get to bring out altogether because it manifest itself as Andrew Breitbart said in the last that last segment you know culture is down politics is downstream of cultures so if you want to impact culture or the politics impact culture first and foremost Saffir cultural legal leader you'll be\nYou'll be a political year give us a call and then a four to five six for six we got some great just calling into like a not just constant Rob Wittman but also the leaders of the two major parties here in Virginia posters Clinton kid and Robin McDougal and then to operate in this one from Iowa\nAnd one from New Hampshire we're only I hate to say this because you're probably second tier the elections already the midterms we are four hundred and Seventy two days away from the Iowa caucuses\n\nFour hundred and Seventy two now it seems like a long time but let's be honest as soon as this election is over you're going to start hearing reports back from Iowa and New Hampshire and we're going to be at the forefront of that we're going to get calls and they were going to shoot up with a with a some operatives their Republican and Democrats to see what's going on the ground I think\nTrump's got the lock on the nomination you never know\nYou never know you never know goodness knows you never know with Donald Trump because of that ... that's that's that's\nWho knows this actually does mean those are certainly going to do but you never know what's going to happen around it and I think that's one of the more interesting parts about politics today because he's brought that dynamic up ... max and that sort of with if you remember from your uh ... days in the school or or at work you know\nThe leader changes and it's like a substitution what's this going to be like your you know you get you get a new boss was it's a it's there's just an illness and from since June fifteenth of twenty Fifteen and she has been a very different political dynamics are not necessarily unhealthy because it has made us think and react\nDifferently and respond differently and I don't think that's necessarily on healthy ah but we do have to be ever vigilant to make sure it does not become\nToo unhealthy and I think people are recognizing that we have ah some some discourse in this country that can be improved we can get better at that as a people and how we do that is every day one on one with each other if you want to impact politics if you want better representation be better people sort\nOf comes down to um they represent us and if you want them to be better if somebody wants to be a better\nSo let's call it in\nA four five six for six we'll talk about polls goodness knows there's more calls I don't know what to do with these days the generic ballot what I pay attention to first and foremost is what I check every day I'm On the real clear politics\nThey give you the um average of all the different polls and then they break down the individual polls are now\nHomeless should be looking at what are called Elvie is likely voters\nHolding companies should have an understanding of who they imagine are going to be showing up on election they should have a pretty good handle on it may ... began in Virginia about a month ago so that we should know who's actually voting I'm In Virginia in or you can always tell by Arlington because they're the tabulation their uh their absentee ballots\nSome friends of mine that are tracking that to see what kind of\nAnd he is but when you look at the at the averages of the generic ballot them or this is why I Do this is why I Do that in twenty Seventeen when governor Ralph Northam defeated that Gillespie he won by eight point nine\nThree percent they point nine three points the generic ballot on that day was nine point one if I'm trying to instruct the class\nWhere do you want to follow Fox News writer as Rasmussen CNBC Emerson Maris Quinnipiac Wilder full poll a\nCritter Newport which one do you follow\nFollow generic ballot right now because that is that is fairly proximate to what happened last year and the year before and twenty six team it was the generic ballot in twenty sixteen it was very close it was like the tide and Republicans are performed on election day by about a point and\nThey want and the generic congressional ballots are obviously Trump lost by about three points a nationally three million votes um\nSo that's something to consider when you're saying okay we're just going to go I think I think the the objectives view here is look at the generic ballot look at the average and you can pretty much extrapolate where it is right now you have to election day were held today and because\nIt was on that basis that it takes away the\nThe partisan lines you might have or\nA would be inclined to set nine point one percent the dams one five three point nine nine point one eight or nine that's very close\nAnd they are at seven point\nSix right now it is safe to assume that they will not perform as well as they did in twenty Seventeen but still will win and likely when the house of representatives given the the dynamics of the Senate very different\nBecause the individual races likely that Republicans are just hold on to the Senate what's the dynamic that if the Democrats have the house and the Senate Republicans have the Senate what can happen the next two years and that's how you can sort of figure out\nWhere this thing is going so you can understand what you need to do or not to like myself I don't watch cable news I don't watch broadcast news every papers in the morning Boston College tuition times\nWall Street journal and I get mine on information what's going on in the economy and politics and culture will not leave it alone don't listen to you know the the uh the national\nTalk radio shows I go to work right you know I I go with my eyes I see what's going on and I think most voters do that if you look at the the aggregate numbers of\nYou know the Fox news or the world and to MSNBC it's a very small subset of the American population but they're the they're the most active\nVoters they are the their their activists so those shows are pretty much you're broadcasting to the activists about what they want to hear about the messaging points out there they they they're supposed to repeat so when you're watching when you go to Facebook or Twitter\nOr Snapchat or Instagram or whatever they're very different social media platforms you see the replica repetition of the message and you're like wow I I go to a town hall after I got like a congressional town all my friends of theirs\nWe're still getting information\nIt's fundamentally wrong but they're really upset I mean angry not pleasant not understanding but what do they show up for this show up because they're angry\nThere are concerned but more importantly like anyone else in the world they just wanted to hurt right how important is that in a conversation to hear what the other person is is really feeling get down to okay what is that what what is it what is making your data oh 'cause I don't know that's\nThat's the operative subject matter what is triggering this fear and when you get\nDown into the into the nuts and bolts you you really can understand why people do what they do and hopefully get them to a better place a station like and it's not easy to do but it's a it's it's what we do it in a democracy in public and form a democracy which we have in America thank God I'm\nSo we can just live more recently amongst each other governors self self governance I think it's really important historical\nConcepts and I think we've lost sight of that a little bit\nIt's easy to uh but more importantly it suffered for folks to point out to be with what we can do better\nYou can do better calm down we got this I mean are are have too many TV channels at night\nDo you have too many options are there too many restaurants and grocery stores around you is it too good are you going to lose all this to me it's it's crazy\n\n\n[noise]\nBreaking news shower from town hall in

then we had been having 'em in the years leading up to um today so Virginia is about two thirds cellphone mostly or cell phone only users and so our sample\nWe we actually draw samples of cell phone numbers and so we do quotas on her cellphone versus landline sample so we basically go into the field the batter to third one third cellphone landline split already on and we haven't found our response rate on cell phones to be any different than it has\nBeen which is not great\nThey were landline calls in the seventies surveys show we're not finding it any more difficult than we were already um I Do have college around the country who are finding cell phone number is being blocked more um and and it's driven by this I'm almost as fishing that's been going on with our cell phone numbers lately\nI Can't remember what my phone number is recalls Idaho\nAnd we we did it they were two things that we do to try to help us with that we attended by ourselves as Christopher Newport university so we're not we're not in an anonymous number or we're not I'm an analyst number you'll see\nWho we are when we call and then um if you said look put me on your do not call list will put you on our call us and we will call you back or we don't have to do that because you know according to the federal regulations were doing research academic research we're not working we're not getting paid to\nYou know do this we're not making a profit so we're considered a researchers so we don't have to comply with the do not call list but we do keep our own do not call list and if somebody says they'll call me I don't want to do surveys they will put them on our to not call it so we try to be transparent in that way as well\nLet's back because most people go oh yeah I'm On on on those do not call list so that they are because because you are academic nature you so you're a turnout model is showing forty forty five percent that's interesting because people I talked to some things and they're hoping is going to be around forty eight\nWell that's so that's ah so it depends on who you talk to 'em it could be forty eight um it could be higher I mean that's sort of here's the real sort of question that I have in my head right so if\nThere is a big blue wave if there are a lot of voters that are engaged right now who didn't even vote in twenty seven teams then we're missing them in our survey and we're not capturing\nThat right and that's some of the pushback I got back um what do we want to put out our second district poll showing Taylor leading Luria some Democrats push back and said well you're not even capturing some of the voters that were newly registering in and they're going to vote okay fair enough but we have the luxury in Virginia in in that we had a twenty Seventeen\nElection that we've seen captured that surge\nPretty well it it ran it brought Ralph Northam into the governor's mansion\nRalph Northam won a second district by ... percent first time a Democrat or one that district in about a decade so we think we twenty Seventeen captured that search pretty well but it may be even bigger than and also Republicans may have responded\n'em by by engaging their base voters already know if they've done that we think we capture them because they were already of the voters anyway um but if turnout is higher I think it's going to help you um\nI don't know that it helps one party over the other all the way it might be helpful for Democrats because it might be that extra search\nThat we might that might be a lot of new voters that we're not capturing\nSo you ... you you saw the surge I called the suburban tsunami\nYeah we we were we were modeling\n'em in twenty Seventeen\nLike we are likely model this year or what we were doing and twenty Seventeen as we were we were modeling the same way but we're also looking for new the registered voters 'em in twenty Seventy because of that was that was that search that was the difference between twenty sixteen twenty Seventeen was a lot of the new\nSuburban voters um and so we did see\nThe search and twenty Seventeen we all know what it looked like in Virginia and so\nThere's nothing that says to me that that's going to be any less this year than it was in twenty Seventeen and there are things that say to me it might be a little bit bigger than it than it was one twenty Seventeen and by the way in twenty Seventeen the Republicans\nWere as engaged as as you would want them to be interest that Democrats were a little bit more than you think it might be even bigger this year\nIt very well could be I don't think it can be much bigger but it very well could be um Democrats in particular are trying to register new voters or they they weren't until the deadline and Republicans I'm work trying\nTo register new voters as much as they were trying to mobilize their their base voters that are already there\nSo I mean look at both parties it's not likely to be because we don't have a really robust statewide race going on 'em and we have ... competitive congressional races some places and not at other places so so that's part of the reason I'm thinking forty five um but if it ends up being forty eight it's because there were ... there's massive\nTurnout going on and some of these really competitive congressional races\nUm I don't know if you're a if you're if you're looking for a competitive statewide race to drive turnout we just don't have that this\nYear and so that's part of the reason I'm hesitant to say it's\nGoing to go as high as forty eight but look I've been wrong many times um and I'll be wrong many times in the future\n[laughter] [noise] I'm not going to say why not close\nClose um if I you know I did what I find interesting about the statewide races that um it's not close yeah\nYou see Tim Kaine campaigning in his ... his campaign campaigning as if it were close he's running ads on on every in every television network in in the commonwealth he's campaigning like he's\nGot a a more for a bit of both formidable candidate that he has and I think there are two things going on I think Tim Kaine needs to send\nA statement that I've moved beyond twenty sixteen um and and and sort of the difficulties of being the vice presidential candidate on the ticket and twenty sixteen but I think he's also recognizing that in some of these are really close congressional races um if\nHe can pull any coattails um if you can read out any coattails it could be really helpful to democratic candidates down ballot and so I think oddly enough Tim Kaine is running a campaign to get re elected to the U.S Senate and running several congressional campaigns\nTo elect Democrats um in in in some of these competitive races\nFor sure is all over local talk radio which is where his voters are going to be and so I think Korea Stewart's running the kind of campaign that he needs to run to give voters out given how difficult situation he has and how little money yes\nSo you're you have a statewide poll in at\nLeast we pulled the Senate\nRace several times and then decided it wasn't going to be competitive enough support 'em throughout the final stretch for Labor Day on instead decided to pull these congressional races because really for the first time in probably decades and Virginia if if if a hundred and some odd years\nWe've got a lot of a lot of really competitive congressional races going on so we decided to pull the congressional races instead of continuing to poll doesn't appear to be a very competitive Senate race\nOkay but we are we're wrapping up here in the segment what what'd you get a final call here on what the summers are going to look like\nOh well probably somewhere Fifteen Fifteen ashes my where my ... I'm at right now\nIt could be a little bit higher could be a little bit lower if it's a little bit lower it's going to some of the congressional races are going to look really good for Republicans are going to be really tight if it's if it's higher if it's closer to twenty and some of the Democratic congressional candidates are going to have a better night I think\nFifty six fifty seven yeah OK anything moving a libertarian front let me get an impact at all\nNo in in in in we we anticipated they might given that you know a lot of the country club Republicans might not be interested in Corey Stewart but at the end of the day we're very tribal\nPeriod of our politics and if there is in our by your name a lot of Republicans were going to vote for that are not actually I'm a libertarian their\nTheir vote so we don't see any uptick I'm I'm among libertarian candidates either state wide or in these congressional races um there's a libertarian and the Panthers libertarian seven we're not seeing any uptick with either one of those\nOkay thanks Quentin Kidd recalling it looked like an opportunity wash the Libertarian Party they had a chance to correct the record marking her a little bit in Virginia they might have fallen short this is Chris and filling in for the patient and John credits come back\nI'm doing well crafted hope you're doing well third day this week between each other on\nYour stalking me around stalking you haven't figured it out yet let's not go there [laughter] you know they like to get it right now so ah yeah I don't know if you heard the last leg with Clinton kid from Chris we're Newport or are you seeing anything different than what Dr kids out there\nWhen I heard that um interview and I I Swear to God that sounds from the discussion\nThat perhaps they seen more of a way that I'm seeing in regular contact with all our congressional campaigns um throughout the commonwealth and frankly most of them are doing really well um\nPerhaps just two of the congressional districts being really in play when we get to election night\nTo just to which too\nI I see the sadness in the tens clearly are the two battlegrounds right now I thank God the other ones that perhaps\nPeople are looking at are the staff but I think Denver re going man is clearly running a far superior campaign there and so I think Denver a will uh will be fined come election\nNight on there has been some talk of Scott Taylor's race scotch really working hard um I mean that's perhaps we'll be close to them we otherwise would hope but I think at the end of the day Scott should be fine as well so\nThat's where it comes back down to Barbara Comstock in the tens 'em and Dave Brat in the seventh as the way I see at this point\nTo exercise because Dr kid he didn't mention Nebraska spanberger racing I live in a district I see it every day at least in West Maricopa County and it was a stark difference in what's going on the ground at least but I I pulled back\nAnd try and do the object to follow the data if you follow the data that Clinton kids right in front of what you're saying oh\nThe Taylor and ... are the ones that are most in place as far as changing a changing parties right if they're accurate or use got yelled at by seven and calms down by the state or nine times like that [noise] so if that's consistent than his calling as\nAccurate um it would probably show because if you were doing on bread spanberger imagine that he would but what he also pointed out obviously the quality of the candidates important local issues are important but also pointed out was he didn't see the big\nKavanaugh kicker or that everyone in a is talking about this is going to have this big search for Republicans for if it is is pretty quiet people make up their minds just going to vote and as he said Republicans would show up in midterms\nWell and and I sort of see the ladder I mean obviously what I'm looking\nAt is anecdotally um play during a prior to the to the judge now justice Kavanaugh hearings um there was some um perhaps apathy on the part of the Republican\nBase um but that changed almost immediately uh with those hearings and I think the Republican base in Virginia and I think the Republican base\nAround the country saw what a Democrat majority in the United States Senate and Democrats majority in the house of representatives under Speaker Pelosi would look like constant um investigations\nCalls for pain insurance other presidents investigations of justice Kavanaugh and so what I saw as a state party chair what's not clear up tick and enthusiasm response to emails fundraising jump significantly as a result of that\nAnd I'm as it's been said before somebody is going to write a check\nOr send some money to the party or candidates are more likely to vote for that person as well so\nIt may not be showing up in the polls quite yet but I Believe that there is a renewed enthusiasm they're clearly wasn't enthusiasm gap between the Republicans and the Democrats prior to the Kavanaugh hearings but I think that gap spent eliminated so now it's just a matter of turning our folks out\nSo you're seeing the enthusiasm ticket I talked to Morgan Griffith about a week\nTen ten being you know absolutely undermine showing up no matter what a he said you know Democrats are words were around Ninety and my folks around thirty said but my folks are now up around Haiti so he he he sensed it he felt that on the ground inclined\nTold me the same thing uh from the anecdotal standpoint I Do think there is a renewed a server and the and the Republican base that quite frankly it's getting a lot of what they wanted the last election that's part of the hardest thing in politics you know when you get what you want your show up are you satisfied or you know you're fat and happy\nNew stay home because things are going pretty well what what's the point [noise] uh but I think the the cabinet things sort of re energized refocused or at least the Republican base on wanting to come out and vote but you're seeing that throughout the state\nI Am and I and I think you're getting what I think that folks realize you're right I mean the got what they wanted and twenty sixteen we have the president and acting tax cuts the economy is booming lowest unemployment and and decades and so there was probably some complacency on that\nBut then I think now the Republican bases all that can get on die and very quickly with the Democrats control the house and Senate and so I think Republicans are saying we've got to roll up our sleeves and if we want to keep what we've got we've got to go to the polls and vote for it\nUsually the cycle of politics right so what are the new chairman of the Republican Party of Virginia\nAh what is the next step for RPG worry all going what should Republicans in Virginia Beach got because when you look at Virginia and Maryland you have to get to a very strange electorate a\nDemocratic Marilyn's with a Republican governor who looks like he's gonna want three Fifteen or twenty points in Virginia which has been a battleground trending now\nTowards a blue state Tim Kaine square thinks it's going to win by Fifteen uppers probably maybe twenty points as well you didn't really do have this dichotomy don't you all across the Potomac we're we're there's the dynamics in politics are changing Massachusetts has a Republican\nGovernor who's up pulling a\nThe leading Democrats in the states Charlie Baker you have a governor Robin governor of Illinois um is is is the other Republicans in Virginia ... writes for the electric\nI I think what you're saying I obviously I don't know that in our current climate in Virginia whether any of the three candidates you mentioned governor Hogan and others would would secure the Republican nomination in Virginia right now but I think what will recognize and and I and I've sort of sense perhaps a more pragmatic approach\nAmong Republicans I'm again coming out of the Kavanaugh hearings um\nUh it's somebody you know six months ago had mentioned Susan Collins and Lindsey Graham thing I'm sort of a stalwarts of the Republican Party thing for the laugh but now I'm getting request\nOr how can we bring Lindsey Graham in to speak in Virginia for candidates and and have him as a featured speaker and places and so I think the Kavanaugh hearings may have showers\nThat what we need to do is have a broader base in the Republican Party that can bring conservatives to gather around core principles and perhaps uh if we agree on eighty percent of the issues\nWe can disagree on the other twenty later on after we start with\nThere are ... battles right I mean the Democrats have their own battles the Republicans are having their battles were going to have some posters and that pollsters\nAre some operatives from Iowa New Hampshire calling in the nine o'clock Irish it wasn't that we have one calling in from a Democrat from Iowa Republican from New Hampshire and tell us what's going on there are states that have the the national consciousness because that's really what the\nOnly thing I said I don't have time to worry about that I got we got to hold out for now I guess they set it up for reelection but they're not worried about point Tony after we went and preserve I bet you're already in the house and Senate next year and Virginia\nAnd gently push back here because the dominant theme in American politics is what's going on in Washington DC and it's being reflected back in in the states and in the local to the districts\nBecause Trump is the issue right now since since June fifteenth of twenty Fifteen\nThat man has driven the conversation every day in American politics and it's you know four hundred and Seventy two days away from from the Iowa caucuses people are gonna be focusing on those issues but it's going to get very retail very quickly why all the Virginia races are going on and that's\nThe beauty and the dynamic of Virginia politics isn't it because we are we are the polls we take our temperature all the time\n... ... that's exactly right and I think um for our congressional candidates this year I think our last year gave them sort of a wake up call and they could see OK perhaps we're going to roll up our sleeves\nAnd work much harder than we thought we were going to have to and so I'm your rights ... this year will sort of perhaps give us a preview of what we can expect in twenty Nineteen but that will be a sort of a pulse of the of the country for as you say\nBecause we have the entire general assembly up this time next year all one hundred and forty members this other districts the general assembly are going to be up for election and there's so many issues at play and what Clinton kid was talking about what he's seeing in his polling is that quality candidates matter\nAnd local issues matter I got an email last night from a former colleague of mine talking about a quarry in northern Virginia and uh basically local development and he was engaged on you also thins out emails on traffic patterns same pothole something like this is not what you do in the general assembly but if that's what the voters want they want someone to talk about it right\nBut I I think that's right people are really looking for results from their elected officials\nAnd the things that are impacting most people today with a booming economy and job of um strong and wages growing people are looking at some of those other issues that impact them on a daily basis trafficking holds up at northern Virginia as you say the potholes and and and more rural areas of the country that was the things", "show_name": "Mark Levin Show", "year": "2018", "city": "Portsmouth", "day": "19"}
