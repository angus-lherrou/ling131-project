[noise]\nOkay let's get to juvenile to show a barber in this very troubling to me and a lot of people this is a journalist\nRight here in northern Virginia a he was an employee of an American company the Washington Post he was very critical and his ah post articles in tweets and other things\nAbout the current the Saudi regime under Mohammed bin Salman very critical now we have we have FBI intel leak\nThat or into sources said that the Saudis were attempting to lure him back into Saudi Arabia in an effort to interrogate him and then we would have to put them in jail\nHe goes in to the extent

get information when I said I Am\nNot I haven't ever really not that great credit something we value out somebody\nTrying to tell the truth about what's going on in this country you know he can be very concerned about [noise] I like um ... we find out how how\nAre you well there's you know finding out and that could take forever and I think having been solved and just kind of underestimated the media frenzy here he thought it was kind of die out\nI thought the president or President Trump is doing a mass strictly brilliant thing and inviting the Turkish fiance of your mouth to show the or to the White House that's going to put\nMore media focus on the Rand Paul has called for an immediate suspension of sales of ah any arguments to Saudi Arabia until they can they can provide evidence that he's okay or something are you in favor that\nRan away see\nRand Paul and or is one and he he's on with me in five minutes he has proposed stretching out\nYet but I got more than they are not satisfactory [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise]\nAll right we're going to leave it at that we're at a time I went to [noise]\nYou know I think we do a lot of different [noise] okay [noise] [noise] from\nWhere all the time that you Barbara for being with us a Republican congresswoman Barbara Comstock representing the temperature ... district of Virginia she's up for a third term on November ... Barbara people want more information or did they go\nHarvard huh [laughter] partner Kathleen but probably getting a lot from them because the Clinton oh wait a\nMinute wait a lot [noise] and get your eye on the\nWeb site again Barbara Congress dot\nArtist and Republican and Democrats are trying to sort of the state from getting on the information and there's been good at that as well\nI just want to remind our listeners that\nEverybody knows that listens to me I was a vehemently opposed to Patriot Act one son of Patriot Act when it's sunset or you were a lonely\nVoice in the U.S Senate I remember you did the filibuster for some time in opposing in questioning\nOr the ... the Patriot act you are right and then you are right now I was right there and I'm right now we're just so my audience knows this whole Pfizer thing\nA with Carter Page and a easy dropping the Trump campaign and the phone he finds that warrant none of that could have happened without the shapes your act that set that up\nAnd you're the one that said\nYou keep government ... Jimmy government this unlimited power of surveillance and its eventually going to come around and bite you in the bud center that's exactly what happened\nBut I had the same very saying the conversation yesterday with the FBI because I asked him for inquiry argue gathering information including suppressants phone calls and of course he fired and said oh I Can't answer that are they're setting\nAnd the answer for it but it's got the answer is yes there was an article about two or three years ago saying that they recorded Fifteen hundred of President Obama's up I don't call and then they minimize sandwich music store to mark his name now but is it to tell when President Obama or President Trump is talking to a foreign leader years out\nOf their voices even if you're minimized or you know a parked out the names that you can't tell who the voices are but we shouldn't be\nHere's this conversation and they record it and then they're out there and then the FBI tender and search this data without a judge is Warren and my point to him was and I didn't understand it or didn't understand it is [noise] if you're recording things on potential terrorists from overseeing the cost of government lawyer Clark\nBut if they're talking to American torture random people are talking to Americans we do get constitutional protections because many of the phone call our discussions with terrorists in fact the vast majority are innocent international phone calls\nAnd so we have had this discussion with them and uh it should be protected by the house getting some say the fourth of John Adams the spark that led to the revolution when you get in like the British soldiers coming into our houses you know breaking down the doors slammed tax\nUh we really wanted protection that we want to say the government and never come to your house or any private\nConversations are belonging without talking to a church first\nWell and that's a that's why you were so adamantly opposed to when you were a predictor of the future what this whole thing senator uh\nYou've also been a very strong voice on the disappearance of ... to show the there's a lot of talk about what should be done and we want more information\nAnd like I get that but as a member of the Foreign Relations committee you're the only senator that has proposed action which is until we get answers on his disappearance because\nCenter the thing is we have a videotape showing that he went in there was nobody on tape showing that he went out and I'm a crown prince MPs Mohammed bin Salman sent a the camera footage was corrupt the battery went dead\nThey can't really only by that is like the dog ate my homework or I didn't get ever ready battery and so the battery died\nNow you have called for an immediate suspension of ah the arms sales to the Saudis until we get some kind of a satisfactory answer can you elaborate on that sir\nI think everybody should remember that Saudi Arabia and it's the largest state sponsor of radical\nIslam around the world what I mean by that if they hit the funding for decades\nMadrid authors in Pakistan in the Philippines even in the United states teaching in the west of Christianity and continuing radical violent jihad this is the Saudis are we shouldn't be telling a weapon simply because of that\nIs coming of the Nineteen hijackers who came here were from Saudi Arabia Saudi Arabia is a part of our terrorism problem they are they find the risk of terrorism and teaching of radical Islam around the world this latest episode\nOr I see no way that this could have happened without there being your thought to private clients were clean guys are on some of them if they are a link to Saudi security services and intelligence [noise] um [noise] no it doesn't pass the smell test and uh you know we just\nThe only thing they listen to in addition\nTo them killing a journalist there in tens of thousands of civilians killed in Yemen they're doing it with our bombs when we're we feel when they're flying in there and it slide and two weeks ago or three weeks ago the great they kill the school bus full of children school children were killed\nA year ago they killed a hundred and fifty people in a funeral procession and we wonder why someone in Yemen wants to drop a bomb on and kill their salaries are killing American because they find the fragments of the bombs are saying you know America [noise] parents who we have to realize that reaction and and that's a blowback\nFrom us being involved in some Mr gotten civil war is one that we actually create more terrorists but here's the other possible thing that's going to happen\nAgain or what happened in Libya when we toppled Gadhafi we got a house and more terrorism it became a breeding ground for terrorism mind here is that there is some remnants of fairly fairly strong rent their character and yet we're not fighting them that we're missing or stricter\nCivil war between the ... and the Saudis and also with Iranian influence as well but my fear is that it sends into chaos and that you get the rise of\nAl ... the same thing that happened in Syria as that's the whole war that we got involved in the chaos you got the rise of ISIS\nWill actually uh the network that I go on a gym near a a couple of about a month ago was reporting that al Qaida fighters were actually given safe haven 'em by the by the Saudi forces in Yemen in ... in in order to fight the who the so\nThis wouldn't you shouldn't be surprising because who did the Saudis support in Syria they support her down news round which is essentially an offshoot of al Qaeda so the Saudis are all these poor people who hate America who have who have a western wires\nAnd yet we found a big arms deal the president says I Do it for a job or creating jobs that's not something that we should be\nConsidering what we argue arms deals we need to be considering our national security not trying to have some sort of Keynesian job scope\nYou're on the John triggers reading your network truck in the truth across America we're with Kentucky Senator Rand Paul Republicans on the Foreign Relations committee a he's been the strongest voice in the U.S Senate on\nHow we react to the ... to show ... disappearance\nSo have you recommended this to the president\nCenter have you want to direct conversation but remember a look didn't I wasn't in original Trump supporter everybody knows day when it came down the escalator he campaigned on getting out of these entanglements not staying in the have you had a direct conversation with the president on how we should react to this\nNonsense the killing of the journal after he does know my feeling was talking about once every week or two [noise] and what we have our conversations are in a general ours by saying\nThat uh he has the same thing so that idea that we've been out of the Afghan or to you\nSyria or that we should stay forever and\nYet he's surrounded by stay forever crowd and that's the real problem is I think the president's instincts are good I'm sort of in the crowd at what the president bigger president right and\nYet the people surrounding him are I think to offer and you know part of the traditional foreign policy around here which is go stay forever and bankrupt America\nSen Paul the president has invested a lot of political capital in the Saudis and it was the first place then he went in his first foreign visit a NBS came to the United states you did as a media\nTour with them to Saudi spend a ton of money on media PR as you know uh in in in the swamp\nAnd so he's put a lot of 'em and and you know we kind of look the other way when MPs rounded people are jailed him in that hotel whatever they did\nA ... has looked the other way is this guy was sacked or relationship with the Saudis and my ... and tying it to that is it going to change the president's position on the Saudi ... Largo of the state of Qatar where we have or\nThey get the military base in the middle east [noise]\nYeah I'm not so sure you got to change his mind he seems to be pretty gets trapped\nOn a continuing to sell our to Saudi Arabia I think Congress is also the same way they're going to put up some protests and say they object to the journalists being killed but there's there's billions of dollars involved here and you know like I always say followed them by Andrew so much money being made on selling these arms to Iraq\n[noise]\nBreaking news is our from down off I combine these feeders [noise]\nTheir media say American pastor Andrew Brunson as left turkey\nFollowing a court ruling the convicted him on terror charges but also set in free evangelical pastor from North Carolina and his wife Noreen arrived at a private terminal I nominate dares airport and go is mayor province late friday speaking with reporters in Columbus ohio President Trump says that the news of the pastors releases most welcome\nWherever you happen to have him and have him in good shape by here isn't\nVery good shape Turkish media since ... plane took off he was expected to be flown to the U.S military hospital in ...
