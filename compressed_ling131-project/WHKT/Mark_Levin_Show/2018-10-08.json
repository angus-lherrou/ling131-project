candidates when his most recent claim to fame and see what the only one that\nGot the two thousand Seventeen Virginia election right he predicted that the Democrats would pick up Fifteen since he was the only one that any what's anywhere\nNear that so we've got his finger on the pulse no doubt guys have you with us we got to get to the Redskins and the caps in this segment but I've got to start with Virginia there's three seats here and play a\nThe Democrats win all three many people think that'll be there's three seats that are close well I've got three maybe you've got others and you can certainly uh bring them up for you that you're going to claim the fiber complex competitive\nYes Barbara Comstock than in the tent or Scott Taylor being challenged by a Elaine laureate and the second an\nIncumbent congressman Dave Brat go against several Abigail Spanberger seven so let's start with the tent that's on everybody's mind ... complex but when I was at the debate in ... county and a Jeff from\nWashington was horrific I mean she was just absolutely address I'll go to dinner just bankrupted she I mean I\nIf you try to be fair in a debate\nIf if I dressed up as her and did that debate in my goal was to be horrible she did worse than I could have done it person or tried either what what's up with that\nBut this announcement that the temp district is competitive ... by Barbara Comstock for Congress I mean it is going to be a double digit race\nShe's reading from a script because he's trying not to screw up the fact that she's going to end by double digits um she obviously is capable of of doing more um than um\nThan that um you know she's in a state senator so I'm Talking on policy side I'm so she's not without chopped right but at this point in this race she's being told we just script don't mess up that's what happened in that debate I don't disagree with you that like you know\nDid was she a little plane at the debate yes did she make any major errors no and that's what Barbara Comstock so upset about the debate that wants to talk about oh she just so poorly Barbara's living Jennifer didn't make any errors that allows barber to get back and race\nIt's a landslide it's been a landslide the tenth district\nHad every single demographic group is breaking against Trump in this country over represented in it if the Democrats do not take the tent the Republicans will hold Congress at that I agree with I don't think yeah it's it's not an end right now that's not in the realm of possibility\nBut the Republican polling is telling me that she's tighter or slightly ahead\nBarbara is going to lose by double digits Tom when she's over perform for polling every time her whole career she's over\nYou and your ears the problem is in bend is every demographic group for the Republicans are losing market share right now are collected in for federal employees a high income educated voters that gun now she's a woman she talked\nWith the difficulty they have with the Republicans took away the one weapon Frank Wolf and I had to survive up here and that was\nI was not Tom Davis I was Mr guy can close the prison Mr Woodrow Wilson bridge Mr rail to almost\n... Barbara gets none of that uh because the Republicans get away with their constitutional obligation a on a do or you know to to designate projects\nSo this makes it more difficult race\nShe's with held a lot of her fire\nInto the closing weeks on a jet or for in terms of their operate search our market tell you what it is so I think this race quotas since I've seen rations close a lot more at this point but this is this is a tough race it's a tough atmosphere and it's a tough districts and remember\nA tribute band [laughter] somebody thing you said again just as\nShe wants to make the ... [laughter]\nI just I got to treat that out at eight thirty\nWere with French river Tom David ... Peterson and you've got a lot of the truth you John just rhetoric let's get to the other races let's get to the seven I just said Barbara I just said ... on my show yesterday in a very Catholic candidate no doubt\nI see a little momentum going for a day but I didn't think he was gonna win and we should go that way I think he is going to win a Ben how do you see that right [noise]\nSo I I had that one a slightly Republican up until the Kavanaugh hearings at this point I think it's a toss up um because what the Kavanaugh hearings did was really re energized and fire up the one voter block that's the problem for Dave Brat in some district which is suburban women\nUm and I think that the seven districts historically Republican should be Republican it put a Republican print left me I'm Still lichen last year but I'm the one path or a Democrat there isn't an right to in Chesterfield with the suburban women\nUm and I think Abigail's did match for them\nAnd I think that the Republicans are doing everything they can to lose that block naturally right now um and so I haven't had a tough one\nThink many crew laid on his cabinet nominations in terms of I mean I Am sure let me just say yeah in in terms of what this was during politically and I think we all live in our own echo chambers and we all have our own perceptions of how it's done but what this is done in the nearest polling and some other polling demonstrate this is the Republican base is now\nActivated enthusiasm gap which is favored the Democrats for the last year and a half is now closed substantially\nAnd I think that works to perhaps paper they bred has two two issues though outside the demographics the district in the DNA that district is Republican\nNumber one he is not close the deal with someone for cancers people and they were just assume throwing him under the Boston Red that she'd out for two years\nAnd bring back or ... you know somebody it's more in line with their thinking and and even some scores and secondly Tim Kaine degree or be exceptionally strong in that district he was mayor of Richmond if he has a political he's widely ...\nHad a ... that that the I think that's right this this jacks up that democratic turnout there so you got a factor that into this thing I still think at the end of the day that the DNA of that district establishes itself and bright wins but the but this is a close race in Democrats would nominate maple can't she's variable\nAnd whatever happens you're talking about a company that's got to be involved in democratic politics for some time I think I think Abigail Spanberger is going to happen is going to be somebody that has got to be reckoned with a democratic circles for some time Jeff\nDot die you know I don't I don't know a ton about the district or a you know I Will say I was driving down just outside Virginia to go to the vet last weekend and going through some of the rural counties and it seems like if Brad can pull margins out of those counties but obviously the critical mass that the district is in a gesture film and write goes so\nYou know I I Would probably say you know robotically it's a Republican district but obviously if it's a wave here than it could be one that the Democrats deal than would have to defend a twenty twenty\nOr let's get the second district Taylor Maria or whatever happened was a tailor the other day I had him on my radio show or the ... campaign put my [noise] my name and their team TV ads so I appreciate the PR for what's going on in that race but\nThis is my first chance to respond to Scott right after he had his meltdown on your show yeah and that went viral yet I'm Upset about our analysis last time I'm announcers has not changed she still is um and\nUm I don't think I don't believe in New York Times poll I think it was you know I I ... up to this point I stuffed nutritional are pretty good at the last week that they've not been um I think there's some noise going on\nI'm ... I think what is going to win and she's going to win going away um so I think she's gonna win going away things can be a [noise] a tailor up until two months ago I was doing everything like um and he's really blown it\nAnd he's not going to win reelection and so are you saying because of the whole the ballot issues as soon as she was just you know in the way he's handled it and remember that this district is one of the few in the country\nThat not only sits in the ... side a media market but is in a media market that doesn't really stretch too many other districts\nSo the media has been all over this is on the evening news every night you know if Barbara Comstock at a petition scandal in Tempe district it would have made D.C eating for forty five seconds one night or maybe a week later they quickly re mentioned that you know it goes way you you cannot get away\nWith something like the tide water it's been on the road here so let me let me look I think are the New York times poll property rights tiger is fixed that district very well\nOr you know it was a Navy SEAL all kinds of stuff is the issue matrix and ease chosen I think you're in line with that district is not a far right kind of guy he understands a suburban Virginia Beach in those areas so we have all that\nVery very good candidate and you have a year that favors Democrats ... watched as a Republican what scares me about this is the fact that if you look nationally Democrats just a ton of cash\nAnd drop it a couple of million dollars on that race in the last week get that megaphone just can't over Rome at this point in exaggerate these things I think I think New York times pulls correcting papers up today a again if are betting I I I think he wins\nBut in this environment with the kind of money Democrats put down a you've got to be nervous about this here to watch this on election night if the Democrats win this seat it tells me it's going to be a pretty good year for arm in terms of we're talking thirty five forty yeah I just think about [noise]\nThat I the thing about this district is different than Comstock and it's definitely different than a brat\nIs the turnout model is totally different and I think it's hard for Democrats to win the seat in an odd presidential year I just based on who vote democratic and Virginia Beach Norfolk it's you know that the typical democratic voters that'd be a minority down there and unless you get an outsized performance it's not\nI think it's tough for the Democrats to win that seat I mean Glenn Nye water two thousand and he got flushed down the drain and twenty ten\nAnd the reason was democratic vote came out in the presidential year for Brock Obama it wasn't there the next cycle for Glenn Nye 'cause nobody knew Glen I was [noise] um I think Scott Scott advantage is that the turnout I remember back when I was in the house carcass we'd look at the turnout models and the numbers and [noise]\nYou know Virginia Beach in Norfolk the numbers are just forty percent of what they are in other parts of the state so it's just a it's it's you got a lot of people that live there that are you know enlisted men or women that are registered to vote elsewhere so it's just it's hard\nYou know to to bring people out in that type of environment even though was benched correct you of what media market and\nYou know they could ... Scott from now till the end of the time but there's going to be a conservative there's going to be a conservative vote that's going to come out and whether I'm I'm Maria I don't know how to pronounce it Maria whether or not she can get people out based on her name as opposed to\nYou know Tim Kaine is not as big a magnet they're using Richmond um so I I still think it's a pill for the Democrats even though I agree it looks like Scott's kind of boxing is one issue\nNineteen Ninety six and tell me this one member this well I'm ... we had a we had a scandal um statewide where John Warner put a television ad up against Mark Warner who is John Warner was far ahead and um he photo shop Mark Warner and do a picture\nOr who's in the ... I Can't remember who he thought or somebody better shot but Clinton I think yeah you ... with Clinton but was it was while her was when I was glad there was a racial aspect to it too I Can't remember what they did but they sort of shut Mark Warner into a picture he wasn't in and um ended a television ad and it was a huge went national\nScandal for John Warner who had a moderate brand and was a\nGuy that you know everyone looked she likes either what you're trying to say Scott Taylor is there like had a friend okay and and and that people you know like respected John Warner much higher than Scott Taylor them and and his numbers collapsed\nAnd he said on the needy person and and the captain of my ship and I'm responsible for what happened and I apologize and it's got Taylor a done that he would want ... [noise]\nSo I just I was worse campaign chairman that year and it was a it was a close race ... worse than fourteen million dollars at his own money that year that made this really a much closer race than it might have been otherwise good strong when it was new to me to ... or ... or the map you kind of heard it after running a close race there but I remember that I mean they fired\nThe people that were involved in the ad and everything else and you broke it in it it was an issue for a week or two and then John took accountability in Egypt accountability [noise] said or has mishandled this thing I think it just kind of destruction in tapping his people take the Fifth Amendment doesn't help it just keeps it in the news\nIs that enough to bring down somebody with a good reputation has done a good job in their first term or not\nUm and also I think the wave turnout they talk about a ... I think you're really talking about a ... that's really what's happening with the Democrats is the is the suburban female voters have swung radically or to the Democratic party and that's the\nPart we're going to take off will get our predictions rolling it back the next thing that we've got to get to run again yeah I\nAn ... million Thirteen were there but not that popular when they're running and libertarian broke five percent and libertarians the automatic ballot access to the next five years in Virginia which is just going which are the Republicans that was going to expire this year\n'cause libertarians have not cracked five percent again another tactic or a state where there'll be another five years the libertarian automatic ballot access loud\nThey're great and why is that that is a good point and that water is going to get over five no no question probably seven father's\n... sounds like a good idea what was your thing do you think five or it's going to win or lose\nUh [noise]\nUh what what ... what about Scott Taylor Maria [noise]\nI don't know what's going on [noise]\nAnd ah I see you alert [noise]\n\nWell [noise]\nAnd uh\nStay in a terrorist got nothing but negative publicity from a over the last several months and I don't see 'em climbing out a lot of old could be wrong but I don't see that and I also don't I mean you're\nA cop stock can talk about her internal all she wants that's not what people were picking up going door to door [noise] so what have you heard of that risk [noise] I'll just\nYou know going to try to bolster the Democratic voters are going to Democrats doors that those people are telling her there whether and when it on occasion they've asked what's the main complaint\nAnd this was before Kavanaugh's I talk to anybody since then it was the n._r._a. [noise] those ads have been effective but this capping off thing I mean that's all you know I go door to door and that's all I guess\nIf you think it's going to backfire on your\nFor the shots or go we've we've we've got to get to the rest [noise] yup we've got to be getting Monday Night right Carolina right let's just start with where they are early in the right you have to be happy so far\nYeah generally happy I think the defence like I said a month ago young fast a [noise] good and and they're going to get better I think their defense will get better [noise] um I I think they need to give a couple of guys more snaps a couple of guys less naps but\nBy and large I liked their defense to be a top ten defense this year and for the next few years going forward that makes it for us\nI think they do they have one issue that need to solve and I can solve it if they listen to me they all week on the ends they don't have any big play receivers that could go down catch the ball you know catch eight balls for a hundred yards\nAnd you need to have that too when consistently the NFL you can't just keep throwing too you're tied into your backs especially with a\nTight I'd like Jordan read that's never gonna get injured some dance\nDead was on the street [noise] he's bet on the street I in you know Bruce was my from Brazil I emailed him literally within twelve hours if it'd been cut by Dallas [noise] begging begging them to pick up yes I have repeated it every time I said um [noise]\nThe day he sets foot or Redskins park you'll be their number one receiver they could get rid of Josh dachshund yes I said it\nThey could keep Jamieson and crowd or in the slot taking you get that keep that kid retro Senate they're number two receivers fast but then you need a big receiver who can pull down eight nine temples again for a hundred yards desk and do it and so if they put him on the team they will be the best team the NFC East and will make the playoffs White House\n[noise] Dallas like losing um I think it's [laughter] you know they don't like to when they like to lose a why did you know why do they do what they do what do they keep Jason gear to take coach you know I mean\nWhy did they get rid of Tony Romo and ah it's just I I think somewhere Jerry Jones just decided he was tired of winning the water to start losing for a while and so that's that's why does what he does\nThat what you're saying I mean is that the answers that dependency [noise]\nYeah I I'm I'm they were going down and\nI Can't believe we're talking about the Redskins are not referring to them is the first place yeah that's true first place for a different place type that's right I I'm an at this point a lot better than I thought there'd be this year still very very tough schedule next week I'm going to say nine and seven and that may be enough to make about because the eagles\nOne of the things it's always heard that over ... you're going to the game since Ninety four\nAnd one of the things that the Redskins are black for some time there's a speed demon Penn I Can't remember the last time I'm sure I probably missed something but I cannot remember the last time I've seen the Redskins a Redskin return upon or kick off for a touchdown\nAnd a while and it's been a long time\nAnd I remember one of the hallmarks of a ... a little body was that he always had her as she called it one burner\n[noise] whether it was you know on your nerves whoever I mean it was he always had at least one burned and we don't have that and uh it it shows\nHow many how many ... they're going to get back nine Tom I got fired last one I Know banquet from five Saddam\nYeah yeah I think [noise] able to do after working [noise] maybe three and one [noise]\nAh they beat New Orleans at the superdome and on the way to an eleven o'clock season [noise] no it's a non [noise]\nAll right I'm going to go in the middle I think they're going to win games I think they are like playoffs\nAnd here's your here's the thing about Alex [noise] I'm not a fan of it because he can't win big games in the playoffs so we got an exciting quarterback but you know I've watched them now three weeks I'm not a fan one way or the other but they're on TV [noise]\nBut I mean he managed the games I mean he's never going to be you know he's never going to be themselves and he kind of\nCould see one thing I can see quite\nThem I mean he does kinda fits what they're\nThe whole crew in the philosophy is now crowded out a win games [noise] and I think that I think the thing that kind of winter games are they they could get in the playoffs will be dangerous [noise]\nI got I got to sign off I got to be in court today okay thanks for sharing your events I guess we're going to let me just quickly add the unemployment down to three point seven percent hot there are a lot of what since Nineteen sixty not blowing since Nineteen a group [noise]\nWhich you know the answer for you to not get a raise just to comment on this really quickly John [noise] this is it's an amazing stat but not for the reason the Republicans wanted you to be an amazing that because people say nothing sticks on Trump\nAnd I think it's the opposite I think everything sticks on Trump the fact that you have an economy that's as good as it is and he's having a going to have a bad of an election that he's going to have everything is sticking to him because you should have with the economy [noise]\nOne of the first time that a president picked up see if it was an economy election [noise] um the Republicans could actually be gaining ground in the Congress\nBiggest gains in the high income areas are the ones turning against in the fastest still for people to say nothing sticks to Trump everything sticking to ... [noise]\nWell I think he get credit for the economy and I think [noise] I think he gets credit for the economy and I think that mitigate against the law says they take just because of the ... the cycle but these coalitions are basically cultural coalitions they're not economic coalitions\nAnd as I said the Democratic enthusiasm in the independence wanting to balance the government is really what hurts [noise]\nPeople don't trust the Republicans to have the keys to want some kind of check on Trump's yeah he's doing okay they may vote for him in two years\nBut individual may want to put a check on it I I Will say this I think the Democrats take the house is I think it's more likely than not\nAh I I don't know how they don't impeach the president when it comes out you've got the Democratic base right now it's rabbit they want to impeach him now before ... a commission and when you [noise] I I don't know how Democrats are going back\nTo their primaries in twenty twenty can't not to impeach\nTrump I I just think that happens in rent for tonight is the kind of lost each year whether they have any any reasonable evidence or not 'cause you're like they have to I don't think they have reasonable evidence now I don't know what more is going to stay out of it you know what he's going to say um but I just think you look at the base and you look at the fact that the primary elections or what most of these members worry about\nThat it's politics are girls going to do it I'm not arguing shut down to earth and takes on Capitol Hill yeah [laughter] well I I think what happens is it changes the dynamic for twenty Nineteen it was one thing that twenty Seventeen Trump's than Republicans controlled everything to put a check on him\nWhat the Democrats come in Congress like our class of Republicans in Nineteen Ninety four it's kind of members you know it's the end of Clinton played off against the Republican ... he actually did better than they would do it yeah and I have some of that dynamic and twenty Nineteen\nThat's the way that the Democrats had and we're in that window there back in twenty Seventeen you won't have that same level of wind and twenty a night you know there are other factors matter of fact", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Mark Levin Show", "city": "Portsmouth", "day": "08"}
