and also I also finding amazing that lately issues have taken a backseat on ... campaign now it's all personal it's taken Halloween pictures from my face look now\nShe's doubled down you know now it's not big for that you know they're they're trying to portray me as crazy based on I guess Halloween costumes and you know me John I have a good time so if they it's just it's amazing that last week she pretty much apologizes for marginalizing veterans\nSays she's going to stick to issues then she puts out a commercial or calling me an extremist and trying to make fabricated things up again this is what the left does their own hands it's desperate ploy by desperate candidates and that's why common sense back that's right conservatism is back and that's where I'm going to win the fifth\nCommonsense backing I'm your commander of commonsense Dennis ... without running for Congress fifth district Virginia let's get to the caravan I'm the president with my later today saying he's going to deploy\nA thousand troops you go to a series of executive orders that would stop the caravan from coming into the United states the problem is as soon as they step forward and say the word asylum we can't do anything or ... wars in the loop holes in them Denver are written in such a way\nThat all they have to do was get a toe in get their hand grabbed and say asylum and then we can't do anything they cannot go back what are you seeing the president's proposed action here if you're in\nCongress now what would Denver Riggleman being proposing on that ...\nWhat do you know or a rule of law and uh we're we're we're a nation of laws and we believe in the rule of law and the way the laws were written right now you're exactly right John I don't know you know how we we don't honor that based on what we believe is conservatives enroll in and people who follow the rule of law however\nI think Congress needs to start fixing these immigration laws as soon as possible\nAnd I also believe once that happens are vetting process for any of these people that are coming through has to be extreme vetting\nUh we do have some of the technology in place now\nBut we don't have time on its own is if there's that many people that are headed towards the border or we don't know what's in better\nThan those in John my biggest fear um it's easy you know it's like a Trojan Horse right listen Ninety five percent Ninety nine percent of those people could actually be seeking asylum um those that you know our hearts sort of go out\nTo ... with compassion however if you have people inside there that are bad actors and they're able to hide you know within this caravan\nThe intelligence assets down range I think we're going to be monitoring and my guess is I can only speculate right now my guess is what I've joined operations with Mexico on monitoring this caravan of seeing any type of emissions that are coming out of there talking about radio emissions or any kind of been told that we can glean this is not a good situation this is not good and at some\nPoint I think we have to fix our immigration laws in a way that again are are\nMuch more common sense in the sort of as sort of ridiculous since we have now are going on in the border\nUm uh\nThe I think the concern that everyone has Denver is that\nOkay there's twelve or Thirteen or fourteen thousand people we have to deal with it and uh everybody wants to discern everybody's concerned about the humanitarian aspect but a lot of my color here's what they're concerned with okay if they get in\nThe Fifteen thousand to get then the next one is going to be a hundred and fifty thousand and you're not going to be able to stop that either because we'll never get a wall up in time and even if you have a while you got a hundred and fifty thousand people that there's a lot of people so um are you in favor of the\nPresident taking action now to stop these are this\nA mob caravan from bomb rushing\nThe border and coming in are you in favor of stopping them from coming in now\nYes yes I mean it's this is the this\nIs a matter of national security or it is a matter of precedent um and again\nThis comes back to that was a normal American will say hey you know we understand people want to come to the United states but there was a legal process um and we're gonna have to we're going to have to follow that legal process you know we we think that legal process needs to be applied to all immigrants and you and you're exactly right John\nThis would set a precedent that could really be damaging to the United states' security to our policies into our rule of law or you're right if the if we just allow everybody in we're actually sort of acknowledging that open borders is what we want if we don't follow the rule of law we don't stop these\nThese migrants sadly we we have to stop all now from coming in and set a precedent Denver\nAt a bar or in about five or ten minutes the U.S government is going to release the new economic numbers or GDP expected to grow again this quarter at\nSo over for for that could be four point one four point to four points rent a bomb autonomy was chugging along in about a half percent growth I mean this growth unprecedented where do you look for in that report in ... which can close and you think you might draw out of it on the economy Denver Riggleman\nWell the thing at first I'm going to look for [laughter] and it's just because\nI got on the stuff is I'm going to look at the specific whatever report that I have I'm gonna look at the number of jobs are based on that are open right now and I look at Virginia but I also see what we're going as far as employment but GDP Growth I'm going to look at manufacturing I'm look at agriculture\nI Love looking into the numbers the humor that growth enters and if we're continuing on this line John's if we're continuing with the lowest unemployment claims and forty nine years of working\nAbove every quarter which you know it was amazing a it's a new normal was too I mean this is pretty incredible\nOr if you're looking at all these numbers I think right now what you're saying is that the tax cuts were other job for format worse opportunities zones can be leveraged here in the in the commonwealth\nA ... and opportunities on investment all the things that we looked at to encourage opt entrepreneurship to encourage people keeping their own money\nIs working and that's what I'm going to look at it this report is is this just a continuation of this amazing amazing surge or are we seeing and even more positive future for the people in the fifth district but also in the United states and then the commonwealth of Virginia I think we are I think we're just seeing the beginning of this economic boom and um I I'm\nReally just really excited to see what those numbers say based on what job growth on one sec your hair growing right now\nWhat kind of interesting to see these are coming out momentarily we expect that oh we're going to get over four percent growth and it's really really tough for a Democrat\nRight now to talk about economic the economy or any of the issues that pertain to jobs and prosperity in America so they'd rather talk about something else that's why your opponent\nLet's recall Bernard talking about your Halloween costume 'cause he doesn't want to talk about the economy she doesn't want to talk about job she doesn't want to talk about growth didn't want to talk about kids moving in the basement she doesn't want to talk about the boom and small businesses\nJust wanted to talk about the deregulation she doesn't want to talk about the number of investments that are going on because of the tax cut\nEspecially as it relates to one hundred percent deduction of capital investments Rob doesn't even understand it and so she doesn't want to talk about any any of that she'd rather talk about your Halloween costume in two thousand five\nYeah and I mean which I Will not take down off the net by the way so here's what she would rather talk about she'd rather talk about ... trillion dollars in spending not only for Medicare for all but also for forgiving student debt right which is one twenty four trillion dollars right now free community college for all are free college for all\nEverything she said and even in debate she's like I Want to give away this\nShe doesn't understand the taxpayer money is what you're using I get so limited based on what I fought for you know and government overreach she says she loves government I fear government I think government should be limited I think government should be a fish and she's also the taxpayer money for the middle class is nothing more than confetti\nShe's comparing eyes to the Nazis I mean I I find it's stunning John did anybody would vote for Leslie\nHer views are great for San Francisco and maybe a three square mile area there or somewhere up in Georgetown right in DC but for the fifth district it's absolutely appalling\nThat she thinks he's values are actually a ... to the people to death about every day and work for a living and don't give a rat's with the chattering class is saying on CNN or MSNBC or any of these other foreign left\nAnd they are now they're just they're just propaganda machines and I think at some point that's going to break through that you have comments you have this coalition of common sense against progressive ... and I think that's what's happening in the fifth district and we're going to win this John because I represent American values\nI represent conservative values but I'd rather\n\n[noise] [noise]\n[noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [laughter]\nAbsolute shore positive no doubt absolutely don't worry\nIt when for the Democrats [noise] now is slipping away by

close and we've been saying that it say one or two point range from the gang here's the other hand there's a there's a libertarian into rice\nJoseph ... who has four percent\n\nIf you're voting for Walton what the hell are you doing eight votes for Walton in this race is a vote for Abigail Spanberger\nPeriod\nThat if you want to vote for spanberger ...\n\nIf you want to vote for David ... vote for David ... what a vote\nFor a walk the libertarian at four percent you might as well hands that district to the Democrats\n... ... is that if that's what you want to do that's what your four percent vote for walks I guess you got to get those were threats\nLibertarian votes in grad school districts collapse on election day because at the end of the day\nYou're going in there and you're saying why waste my vote now your senators a little bit different Matt waters is the libertarian candidate there are simply people they cannot vote for record stores they just can't do it there are Republicans that tend to not vote for Cory stores because they just don't like the guy\n\nThat so walking is going to get a big vote for it that's a little bit different you get down to the district level\nAnd Joe ... who can't win at so four percent for Walton\nIs a problem for breath because take him out of there Ninety nine percent of that was our governor day\nNinety five percent but again if you if you want to vote for Abigail have at least get released vote for somebody in that district who could win this ... this makes no sense so it's a walk and vote collapses\nTo the tip of gold one percent of the libertarian gets in these races or two percent or that other to present you go to Brad\nSo uh that's why there's some good news but look\nThis is that this is a very hard fought district now are we going to be doing or election night show here\n\nBrown headquarters or I Will not be there I'll be calling again every so often but a cross section will be running the show or

get rid of Trump or which Trump strolled fault\nThat we we have crazy people it's raising people's fault\nAnd the only thing that I heard that I thought it made sense about what to do about this is the president said probably she should've been an armed\nGuard there for those in there if somebody was carrying they got to stop this I mean that's not going to stop the crazy people I was not any posted all kinds of hate on social media\nI mean\nThese people are just I don't I don't know what happens to them but uh it's a sad state in the United states\nWhen it's like we can't go sixty days without with one of these it's really sick it's we're in a very sick time in our society no question about it\nJohn treasuries radio network truck the truth across America live in this one I'll be\n[noise]\n\n\n\n\n[noise]\nThe man behind the poll Dr Quentin Kidd from Christopher Newport University He is the chairman of the Judy watching the center on politics and of course we're due for university now doing a very extensive polling they've told attempt the second and now\nThe seven at the end of Dr King's great to have you with us\n\nOr are you there I'm here can you or me yes well nobody okay we got you I'm Dr King okay so great new polls out it's pretty pretty interesting\nYeah I mean we have a as you know we wouldn't have been pulling his congressional races around Virginia we've been putting out two models a likely voter modeling and committed voter model and the difference between those two miles is how enthusiastic on some of the respondents are\nAnd how uh how much they say they're likely to go vote and so the the likely voter model is people who have a history of\nVoting but they um but they may be very enthusiastic and land and\nThey may not be not very enthusiastic and then they committed voter\nModel is that same history of voting for people who say they're very committed\nAnd they're very likely to go vote in a likely voter model we have it on in those models we have a\nStatistical tie in this race in a likely voter model we have spanberger uh forty six Brad at forty five and ... and importantly the libertarian judgeship long taking four percent of the vote in a committed voter model we have a brat\nAt forty five spanberger forty eight and ... and the libertarian\nTaking three percent and so this may\nBe a race where I'm a third party libertarian candidate actually plays a role as it ends up being you know within a point or two at a on election night\nThe four percent vote for Joe Walsh stalking me as I look at your whole uh when it first came out of obviously haven't seen that over the course taps Dr ... only had a half\nHour here and I've been on the air but uh\nWhen you get a libertarian that has no money that nobody's heard of getting ... percent in a district that is so hot like this was just so hotly contested knowing that all the majority of those voters are coming from Dave there and they're not going to vote for Abigail\nOff what why is why is Joe ... at four percent\nWell there could be there could be a number of reasons um and the most likely reason could be that this is a place where disgruntled Republicans are parking their votes because they're for whatever reason frustrated and paper at um if you if you happened to be\nBrett necessarily but um you know at the end of the day they committed voter bottle he drops his long drops down to three percent on on election night\nUm if it's a close race in ... is with the site or it'll be one of the rare congressional races in Virginia where a third party candidate is able to swing an election essentially um and so it'll be interesting to see a lecture night how well wall and you guys um if he does as well as four percent and he's clearly\nGoing to have an impact on this race if he doesn't then you'll have less of an impact\nWhat normally happens as libertarians and drink rational races is that their votes collapses on election day because people that say they're going to vote for him because they are bad\nAbout something where they actually go into votes or like I don't want\nTo waste my vote because it's a low profile race it's another thing when you get to Matt waters in the U.S Senate is higher profile and look there's no question\nThere are people on the Republican side they're not going to vote for Cory store on November ... regardless of the situation because they just can't stand the guy that's just reality tank so I kinda get that\nRush to race like this um I just it jumps out to me I Would be jumps out is really for for ...\nYeah well look I think a lot of conventional norms are being turned on their heads right now during this um during the Trump era I mean one of the conventional norms are would be the incumbent should\nBe above fifty percent right now and if they're not about fifty percent they're in trouble um you know we have frantic at forty five percent\nI mean by conventional norms I Would say that is in deep trouble but I'm not convinced that at the end of the day he couldn't pull out a really narrow when I'm or you could lose by a really narrow margin down in a district where clearly you know there are a lot of energy but there's a lot of there's a lot of disgruntlement also\nWell it's kind of what is it comes down to a\nDoctor and when you looked at these cross tabs what is this race if you're just a little defined as if you're just spanberger campaign and you're looking at your home right now they do their own and Charles we we all get your independence hall and they're looking at it now\nAs we speak what message justice spanberger campaign take from the fault you point out certain\nSo the reason the races where it is um there are a couple of factors for why the races where it is Democrats have a sixteen points enthusiasm advantage over Republicans in this poll there's a massive\nEnthusiasm advantage that is overcoming what is structurally I'm a Republican district um you know Ed Gillespie\nAnd won against you noted Donald Trump the Hillary Clinton by six points in twenty sixteen you know it's it's this is a Republican district plus sixteen enthusiasm\nAdvantage is able to bring it to a statistical draw 'em there's a massive gender gap advantage on the females ride for spanberger\nAdvantage spanberger has a plus fourteen female advantage that's at twenty nine point spread on gender um and then there's an age difference a spanberger has a plus nine advantage for voters on\nForty four and under state brat as a plot six advantage\nFor older voters and so that's I think that the side I think what's making this so close that democratic enthusiasm advantage that is being driven that is driving that females that gender gap in span brokers a favor on the female side\nYou're on the jocks records radio network rely today from the capital of swat these days before the midterms on your guts of the truth in America which I think it was Dr Quinn says he is the director of the uh\nOf the Christopher Newport university Washington Center for public policy as a whole lot today on the seven in the San Francisco Virginia what are the other surprising factors or\nI Want to ask you about is a horse short in this district only five seats bigger than that because the statewide lead is about what Nineteen somewhere\nSomewhere between Fifteen and twenty depending upon the given pole and they're given day but again I'm campaigns that isn't so surprising to me I mean we we put out a poll last week and the second congressional district which shows\nScott Taylor up in that race and Tim Kaine was leading by five almost six in that district um and in this district Tim Kaine is leading by five these are two districts\nBy the way that are that are tough for Democrats seconds in the seven seven is really difficult for Democrats um and so it isn't surprising to me look when Tim Kaine want a random two thousand twelve he lost his district by eleven point um and\nAnd then when he you know so this is an ... and historically democratic district so for him to be leading Republican congressional district by plus five is probably right given that there are other districts in the state\nWhere he's leading by vigor and origins and that sort of driving his statewide turtles\nYou're on the job for radio networks are hanging\nWith us other segments director kind of got to get a quick word from our sponsors facts or if you're writing reading this poll for his campaign why do they have to do in order to when I'm\nTo

make this a rice I'm from New Jersey so I don't believe any of us all lives as far as I'm concerned but but now you\nGot you got this thing as a as\nThe cook report saying it's a toss up is this real\nWell you know I I think what the cook reporters doing is they have a very broad definition of a toss up I also consider the Ted Cruz said oh lord our rates a toss up for 'em\nAnd clearly a Ted Cruz's heavily favored to win that I think look I live in New York City and every time the only thing we watch on our local TV is the local news and every single commercial break has at least one\nIn a campaign commercials on that Senate race or the Democrats are just poured six million dollars more into the race in the last couple of weeks they are concerned but then they had a terrible\nFavorability ratings are good market still New Jersey I think it would be a maybe not completely shocking outcome but it would certainly be a very big surprise Menendez loses that race\nI don't think it's got to lose I think that's just like some of us from New Jersey area like forget it that thing it's it's it's like people come in I\nThink that's part of the reality of this is if this was a strong Republican years something must be different and I suspect that race will be closer than most other contests in New Jersey but at the end of the day I think the Mendez goes back\nOkay so you mentioned something interesting Scott you said that seven or\n... in your most recent polling that the generic ballot difference between Republicans and Democrats had narrowed\nTo seven and you said seven is enough to get involved in this environment the Democrats control the house uh obviously the masses either goes higher than seven they have a better chance of what\nIs that what I mean I could do something about what is the number where you would say wow I think Republicans get actually hang on\nIt's it's five to be comfortable with Republicans to you know and again this is what do you talk about a national\nPolls doesn't translate directly race to race but I I think most people and I certainly would say if the Republicans holds a fourth one several favor to take the house it's at five points are six points then you're trying to even talk some territory and then as you move up to seven points to hire a\nThe the judge to craft a are clearly favored then what I can point out you know we're talking\nAbout it being close right now with all of these races life Republican turnout is a bit higher they have a chance to hang on to the house but the other side of it is at the Democratic turnout is higher than projected enough a Republican stay home Democrats forget twenty three seats there you have a chance to get something like forty seats or forty five seats\nOn a very good turnout nights so there's this idea of how close races are is something very important to the south Cal\nRight because uh when you said is what I'm going to hang\nHat on here is twelve or God right we all know that so that that just less than what legitimate twelve or God so that leaves right eat all the things\nThat they need a lemon win control right and they were just over thirty races there are too close to call right now there but they are highly competitive and if the Democrats when\nLiberals slurry one they take control so clearly they have the edge and I should also point out as if the Democrats don't win control adults to pick up significant getting the story one competitive races twenty nine of them are held by Republicans\nRight so they they would have ... and ... and if they run the run the table right\nThat that's where they get that's where they get the forty forty five seats wave pick up right and uh so if you choose them they ask for those listening to us right now how tough it is for Republicans hold the house is uh\nThey can only lose ... eleven of the thirty seats that are rights that are tied right now\nActually test they can only lose ten of the Saudis after one of the thirty um three of them right here in Virginia one is tied what the Republican is slightly ahead of the second district Scottsdale or a day brat Abigail Spanberger tired and then a\nFlex than it had a cop stocks in northern Virginia so in a blue waves days\nThere he just picked up all those Republicans have a good evening or they can win two to three are all three let's get the final word\nIn from Elaine Elaine ah it's all according to Scott it's all about Republicans turning out right that's that's really states ain't days it's all about them turning out and watch that\nSurge we we we have a couple of races in Virginia specifically where the libertarian is taking votes away from the Republican that gets wing it what was your message to those voters\nTo senators small business owners in their employees that um\nAnd the health care all claim ground corporations are spread out there in ...

information America First policies dot org this message aid for unauthorized by America First policies incorporated joining us now um\nTo talk about a lot of topics we're going to start with the horrific anti Semitic hate crimes as a synagogue and Pittsburgh just one of the most disgusting things I've ever I don't know what this country is comedy to put these crazy people just go in and what people are praying\nAnd they just get mass occurred on a Saturday morning unbelievable joining us now\nFor that and many other things ... speak from New York you could follow Liz that lives speak she's also a contributor to the hill lives great to have a\nGood morning thanks for having me on\nWas eight days to the midterms um a lot at stake here all of us were just shocked and dismayed and sad sickened by another massacre in another place of worship Liz ... what is going\nOn in the United states I don't know I think that there really has been a\nHardening of attitude [noise] um I think there's anger everywhere and I think you know look I don't think it's new with Donald\nTrump when Donald Trump was elected in part because of the anger that uh has boils off again what people refer to as a ruling elites or however you want to describe\nFeeling amongst a lot of people in this country that they have been ignored brushed aside a as people who are running big business sense and big institutions have benefited from globalization and a and I'm really not stop to think about what that\nMeant for some other people in the country but you know it it\nIs alarming because we are about as you point out uh to have another election and I'm afraid that you know there's a good chance that the Democrats are going to retake the house of representatives and the progress that has been made under President\nTrump and writing some of the wrongs that have prevails a\nYou know it's going to be rolled back I mean I I really think that's just an incredibly dangerous situation I by the way for anyone who thinks that the Democrats\nMight be modified by taking back the house that the firestorm of\nPolitical activism and hate speech and everything my calmed down forget it because we're going to have Nancy Pelosi as speaker of one of the most dishonest politicians out there and one of the most ruthless competitors are ... you know we have people like Maxine Waters going to be taking over the house financial services\nCommittee and Adam Schiff taking over the intelligence committee I'm not making these things are those are the ranking members and promote a\nAppearances those are the people who are going to be running these committees and what we're in for John is two years at least of endless investigation subpoenas tend to every aspect\nOr Donald Trump's wife and finances and business organization it's going to be an incredible mess and I think honestly I think people are just going to get angrier and angrier as that goes on\nIt's just sort of situation it is what's interesting of ships and the Democrats\nAre on the heels of this short of this horrific crime\nIt I I just started myself with what happens let's let's first helpful but we were still having this which I think it up and actually go on TV they blame the president I mean where does the matter with these people\nI I saw more blame throwing after\nAll the bombs that were sent to Democrats favorites I'm like [laughter] like Maxine Waters I I I thought after this particular event\nThere was less of that really because this guy was hated Trump as much as he hated Jews apparently um you know you and I have talked about this before I think after the Parkland school shooting we both agree that having people like this fellow who's ranting and raving on social media have access\nTo where they came forty seven is it's really unconscionable and I don't know how\nTo change that but it does seem to me that it should be changed because without that kind of weaponry he could not inspect the damage that he did but I Do think this country has been trending more violent for Twenty years I think it starts\nFor the fact that they're constantly spinning out ever more hate filled and violent movies and video games you know John it's there's just too much money on that table because you can produce\nA new popular video game that is horrifying and details murder rates are all kinds of things that you know really are not healthy and they make a billion dollars for\nThe day literally that's possible and in some of these games that are coming out ah there's no will to roll that back\nI and I I Do think of and studies have shown\nThat kids particularly young men are de sensitized by all this material that they're exposed to and that they engage in when they sit behind a little computer and spend their days mowing down women babies ah the minute I don't know if you've ever looked at it and stuff and it's horrifying\nIt in terms of its graphic\nDetail and the violence that encourages so I don't think it's all about Donald Trump I Do think the country needs to take stock I Would like to see I actually would like to see the president and the leaders of both parties
