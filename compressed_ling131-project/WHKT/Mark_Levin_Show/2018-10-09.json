know before Trump\nWas a or Kush are disappearing things about Yemen that the U.S needs to react to Yemen I don't think the people who are saying that really other than maybe a save the children really care about children in Yemen they're more interested in about disrupting the relation between the U.S president and Saudi Arabia [noise] you're on the\nSurgeries radio network trucks insurance across America\nLive Washington DC where when Edward Iranian our man in the middle east been with us since we started eight years ago and he is based in Cairo, Egypt so lesson and\nBigger geopolitical situation here but\nI'm the guy's missing\nHe thinks there Virginia and he works for the Washington Post and he's really legit journalist and nobody knows where he is I'm going to get your um Interpol executive in a moment nobody knows where he is you've got the the president calling on\nNBS Mohammed than San but solving the Saudi prince calling on him to pay up\nFor a bigger percentage of the defense and protection that we provide him he just over the weekend he said no he wasn't going to do that you've also got the president mad because he's continued to raise OPEC prices while\nIn Trump's mind or the U.S government has funded their defense so he's pissed about that so you got a lot\nOf things at play here but let's get off of geopolitics get back to the journalist I mean my question again is where is he and I think it was abducted you know don't you think thing and ministry should should back channel it and find out\nAnd what happened to him based on the fact that you know he works for an American company and he lived in um northern Virginia\nFor sure they're doing that right now I I Hope they're doing that right now if I were secretary of state Pompeo I wouldn't be doing that right now I I I that that is my uh\nJust to follow us relations with Saudi Arabia knowing that he works for the Washington Post then growing\nUp that the Trump Administration is it a bad position would have to react and no one really considering that you got all these media organizations that makes it that are close to her and and um the Democrats who were were were making a lot of noise about young and before that because they were saying that the U.S\nMust stop supporting Saudi Arabia militarily I mean that would follow up relations with Saudi Arabia from the get go and not you know I I I couldn't possibly divorce was from the political implications of it [noise]\nOkay so we don't know where he is your contending that let's not jump to conclusions you may be fine and this may be part of the bigger picture or maybe he's in the hands of someone else then abducted him and then spend it on the Saudis who are of course are\nSaying that he left the embassy but they can't show footage of him leaving the embassy because you have a channel like if you're constantly you got me in cameras all over the place or you have to do it for at least the footage and shows and leaving and then they have a good day I don't know what happens to them not our problem is you know things now produce that that's the problem\nYes that's right I agree with you on and I I'm dismayed about this too but like I have heard from the Egyptians and obviously they um our allies in Saudi Arabia and they don't want to say anything bad about Saudi Arabia their their argument basically that I that you know people in the Egyptian system I I've spoken with the fact that\nThe Saudis are intelligent people are not that stupid that they would knock him off and I I think that's that's true and there are a lot of their theory is\nThat a lot of that there are other parties that would have wanted to follow up relations between Saudi Arabia and the U.S that would have um you know wouldn't would not have thought twice about stopping to kill someone like some of the democracy will be assuming that's what happened which we don't know\nOkay so um [noise] your advice here is wait and see don't jump to conclusions or I get that I'll take that\nFor what it stands for let's get to the China Interpol situation right so we've got the\nInterpol who was a Chinese national goes to China\nAnd now he gets arrested\nIt it's inconceivable to me that he would have even gone\nI mean what do you do there to put yourself at risk you know if you go there and there's there's a high chance you gonna\nGet abducted by the communist government so my question is why on\nEarth did he do and\nWhat happens now\nAccording to all the media reports he is a government official deputy or intelligence minister I I think at some point someone who's a government official is obliged to return to this country as a matter\nOf course whether he likes it or not um although I mean he could have he he could have resigned from that position or he could have resigned I mean he could remain in France\nThe French are very upset about this\nCalculated risk and he thought something could happen but you know hope that wouldn't stand up\nAnd got caught 'em a sad situation obviously the Chinese government was very proud to name him or have him named as the head of inter recalls so clearly what whatever it is that\nThey have against them has to be very powerful for them to do that considering that they were proud of having their own national as the head of Interpol\nSo you're right I mean that's that's good that's good and now since they were they were very happy that he was named it after that and um\nAnd he comes back and now they've arrested them for what did they say a corruption bribery and things of that nature so whenever they got him on whatever you did that they didn't like you said must be big because uh you know they they didn't really want to give up that\nThat to session of authority they had let me look being being in the head of Enron Interpol in France cetera explain or audience how big of a suspicion [noise]\nAll that money or in terms of the actual cloud\nThat he has I mean he doesn't run that day to day operations at the bottom of the people who are putting out the warring and things like that [noise] um\nBut he is a publicly highly public visible person who would get a great deal play in Europe in the media um and clearly gives a positive impression of China to\nThe world um to at least the European audience in America are probably of the American media doesn't cover him that well but he he is well covered in France I'm pro yeah I mean he does a ... and this one of the worrying and so when he was named uh in two thousand and sixteen was\nThat he could possibly have an influence\nOn rounding up Chinese dissidents across the world that has been proven to be the case so far as we know um\nBut as I said because he doesn't have the day to day operations in hand\nSo let's get back to the uh ... let's get back to jump on them and the Saudis issue wasting Edward major prediction how do you see it playing out\nI'm I'm I'm hoping to find him that he will surface in Riyadh\nAnd that they will be ... be holding on to him and that they will be willing to release them after all this pressure as they did or what the former with the Lebanese prime minister Saad Hariri went right or detained him maybe six to eight months ago I guess right beginning of the year yeah so I'm hoping that's what happened\nOr go to a place where it's great to have your perspective it's certainly a different perspective than we've gotten from the legacy media of this and certainly the Washington Post New York times during the manager\nAdam Schiff democratic\nHouse intel ranking member there for a very caustic tweet out last evening saying that you want answers on it\nAh I retreated that Edward I want to\nThank you for your perspective as

well if they acted on those things\n[noise] absolutely John\nTell us about\nYour association I Know you're associate with the with a couple of things you associate with Steve Bannon packing told me that and then also job creators network um but tell me about what you see happening out there you did a poll the other day saying things are changing\nBecause of the Kavanaugh situation can you share with their audience John McLaughlin what that is\nSo are you sure what it is is is that um I think who's the whole cabinet situation was more than just the Supreme Court [noise] it\nWas really a play or by Chuck Schumer and the Democrats to try to win the Senate and when you look at the field of Senate seats that are above the thirty five Senate seats that are up this year\nTwenty six are in states that that uh uh are held by Democrats are turning the seats in the seat of the Democratic seats are in states that Trump won by a\nOne in the twenties sixteen presidential election some midterm elections are decided by people that are coming out that that may voted in the presidential but a lot of the people that vote in the presidential don't come out in the mid term so when Trump brand our strategy was looked to bring out millions of new voters that Mitt Romney did the ...\nNine million more than came out for Obama Romney\nAnd those voters voted overwhelmingly for Trump particularly in the heartland of the country where there was some built so the rust belt and in the mid term you only get about Ninety million people voting so it's the sixty three million voters who came out for Trump coming out more heavily\nIn the mid term the Democrats are going to lose a lot of things for the U.S Senate side think\nSchumer play a gamble to try to suppress the Trump vote where if the Republicans get embarrassed and half the poll cabinet or if the Republicans don't provide the votes he needs to get confirmed then the Trump voters will be mad at our own party and not so millions of Trump voters stayed home a\nShiver would have a play to win the Senate where he'd keep his Democrats some possibly win a tendency Nevada Arizona and become the new minority leader because the Democrats are really fighting hard to take over the house and make Nancy Pelosi the speaker\nAnd by the way that the polling took her a whole lot of times with a a packet al as a bipartisan projects the market out there to project which ban and where\nYou could see it in the numbers Nancy Pelosi still very unpopular September she only thirty percent favorable number nationwide fifty five on federal and the vast majority\nOf voters don't want her to become the next speaker of the uh you know didn't Republicans for whatever reasons aren't claim that up the way they should\nI mean a lot of the house candidates will challenge dancing policy in the districts but you really shouldn't have\nAnd you know when you think about it you should have a a a gender where she wants basically she wants to open borders she was the was increased taxes she wants to weaken security\nI mean everything stance towards ... to the majority of voters right now he is going to be the face of the Democratic party if they take over the house if they take over the house Nancy Pelosi will be the most powerful Democrat in the country and in Washington\n[noise] so that's what's at stake she can sit on numerous occasions that she's going to be the speaker and she said even the other day\nWhat those people that are running and Democrats say what they want at the end of the day I'm going to be the speaker I have the votes in the caucus and it was like do you have to do to win but then I'm going to be your speaker words when we're John McLaughlin a CEO and\nOf his polling firm and John has

when I\nPackage that was on a couple of weeks ago he told me something you said for the Democrats are taking troll the house tax cut down said the generic\nHas to be\nA minimum of twelve cents but then again the seats they need to gain the twenty five seats to gain house because he said if it's under twelve what happens is a lot of those polls are districts where the Democrats are way ahead and uh in California and New York and cetera\nSo he says basically it's gotta be twelve or right now the real politics average has it about right where one of the Republican's chance now of actually keeping their houses it even possible\nIt's still possible at like rehab pre Kevin or we we release separately than than than we do our own monthly tracking national national tracking surveillance on them it's on our website McLaughlin online dot com\nAnd so if you go to go on online dot com you'll see these numbers but the but with ... uh he's got a point I don't think it's twelve but I think it's close\nTo six and they write about there we had a survey that when you compare August or September we can with thousands of likely voters across the country and all this there were times forty four forty four Republicans and Democrats\n[noise] in ah September the day before the cabin or hearing we were down for the Democrats were hit forty six to forty two uh the president's ... a job or cruel had fallen from forty to forty six\nNow than differences since capital on those Republicans that the Democrats are trying to you know depressed and have not come out the Republicans that they've been Trump voters or have them knock around uh they've been re energized and the the pollsters have seen come back into the states where Trump won like we had a poll this week the last week where\nAre the Republican with the head of a Democrat McCaskill of Missouri by eight points there's been other media polls were Indiana's a dead heat Montana's a dead heat everybody knows that how do you can't Heitkamp is downtown in North Dakota so she's at all is Joe Manchin must have pole so he switched his vote\nBut on the house side the Democrats and and the reason I say it's probably closer to six because the Democrats in two thousand and six when they took the house from us they are they only got fifty two percent of the national vote for forty eight\nFifty to cause us to lose over thirty feet and lose the house now twenty ... we had a better reapportionment but still the and a lot of the place but a lot of the seats that are that are a defining over our open Republican seats without an incumbent\nAnd you also have a bit of a the anti Trump voters are more organically a white could've come out than the pro Trump voters to filter out the president's doing a great job or jobs or\nSeven percent to thirty two percent so some of the people don't realize what you're saying if the Democrats take over the house and our voters were less motivated a before the capital here now they're coming back in and you can see in some of the polls\nBut you got four weeks ago issued a lifetime in politics yes so uh so yeah so that it does that this is\nThe Republicans need to be a lot more aggressive and do a lot more contrast with what the Nancy Pelosi Democrats were due to this country versus what the president has accomplished\nTwenty eight days ago before the midterms were with a long time noted pollster John McLaughlin you can follow his uh his polling information going among McLaughlin\nCom that's McLaughlin online\nTo John if you have to predict now twenty eight days out based on\nData you've seen who wins house\nHow many well the houses the cost is uncomfortable we're going to pick up seven seats is pretty clear and the question is how many do we actually pick up as it is a is it an underperforming gain of one to two seats or do you pick up three four or five seats for the Senate looks pretty good because of the battlegrounds that the the number of Democrats seats that are up this time\nThe house is a much different story where the ... most ballots the Democrats are ahead right right now and it's too close to call was four weeks to go with the Republicans running lackluster you know get out the vote no message campaign", "show_name": "Mark Levin Show", "year": "2018", "city": "Portsmouth", "day": "09"}
