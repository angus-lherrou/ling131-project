I mean it's just not\nAccurate the pre existing conditions were there I was in Johnson City when the president gave his speech last week and he said we're\nGoing to protect preexisting conditions and I think that's what you respond with his you know a lot of it is smoke and mirrors that the Democrats are just playing politics with just like they did with the Gavin I'll situation goes that's fresh and the voters' minds and we're not going to do anything pre existing conditions that the one prayer of the Republicans prior\nTo Obama and the Democrats taking control was they never dealt adequately with fat and we're not going to make that mistake again we're going to make sure I Would marry then but we are going to make sure that people with preexisting conditions are taken care of in the house bill created these invisible\nTwain that the people with preexisting conditions\nRegular costs you never know if you ... you know Dr getting the insurance card but the government takes up that cost and that lowers everybody's costs because now the insurance companies aren't having to put it into somebody's family who doesn't have a pre existing condition doesn't have to put those rates are spread it around to everybody so\nThe people with a condition or taking care of and it's better for the people who don't have a pre existing conditions 'cause they're not paying that that additional risk in the ...\nOr the Democrats line about this [noise]\n[noise] well there certainly ... barricade and trying\nTo you know make it appear that it's something that it isn't a they're playing a lot of clever word games in ... but you know there Ninety nine percent wrong there is under one scenario\nLike I said if you stand on your left leg and then there was a heavy wind blowing the somehow a state if they could get a waiver could figure out a way to get around that\nUh but you know I just don't see it to do that very clear and I think they lose in court but that would be the Democrats attacking the very issues that they think are that they're claiming that they are the champions of\nAnd you know is there a legal case that maybe somebody could challenge it under certain circumstances yeah maybe but I think it was so it's pretty close to a lot but not a hundred percent they do have one little threat but they can hang on for\nSome legal case somewhere in the future uh that nobody believes will actually ever happening\n[noise]\nUN ambassador Nikki Haley resigning yesterday kind of shocked the world that didn't leak she said she told the president six months ago she

org\nThis message paid for authorized by\nAmerica First policies in corporate joining us now that boy he was a political editor and writer for Breitbart News you can follow that go to Breitbart News get their\nAnd he broke a story yesterday or\nThe majority leader of\nThe house of representatives congressman McCarthy who is from California and\nI wouldn't be the leading candidate for speaker provided the Republicans hold the house wants to make Trump's wall any campaign referendum this story broke yesterday by Matt boiling is with us now\nKevin McCarthy is going to be introducing a bill or later this week he's he's actually go on a ... at the border today so he was a he flew down on the border last night he\nSees skiing and his team are getting a threatening assessment briefing from our border patrol agents and run for us with officials down there but then when he gets back to Washington DC later this week he's going to introduce a bill\nThat fully fund to the border wall so all the rest of the money that would go for the border wall in addition to that uh has a number of other enforcement measures that Kate swat which has already passed the house that has an ending century city which is already passed the house\nOr as well as going out for a criminal alien gang members are contained in the bill I'm so all the things in a few more or other things like standing on friday the gym thing going out fairly good million voting would all be in this bell and the important thing here is just that\nThere's been no does have the votes to pass the house of representatives I with Republican support at this stage though with only fifty one senator as it doesn't look like it would pass the Senate and this has been the reason why we don't have the\nThe wall money yet right like in this has been the whole thing and raise the Senate Democrats have been holding it up because they you need sixty votes in the Senate so it looks like based off in these midterm elections are Republicans\nAre going to get a few pickups in the Senate seats right like so it looks like fish off the latest polling and everything Republicans may get to work for\nFive fifty six senators the question is is whether or not\nThey're going to hold the house so if Republicans do hold the house majority them this kind of a bill that fully funds the boardwalk can pass both the house and the Senate and we get we get into the president's desk and actually fun to walk\n[noise] so what is the amount of money that McCarthy advocating in this bill for the wall\nA twenty four billion dollars approximately four billion dollars that's that's what they say they need\nThat so we get the whole foundation so he's got the right funding at a twenty four billion dollars now\nWay I read your piece McCarthy wants to make this a campaign issue a referendum if you will a wall referendum for the mid term shortfall\nYeah that's exactly right and so again if Republicans hold the majority in the house and they add a number of seats in the Senate then they're going to be able to get the wall funding the full wall funding to President Trump next year\nIf they don't\nIf they lose the house and the Democrats take it the the the Democrats are going to be able to block the wall and from the house just like they've been doing from the ...\nSort of the point is is that what McCarthy's build dies is it makes the entire election a midterm referendum or this this entire mid term election a referendum on the wall that any\nThe borders is vote for illegal alien crime\nIt's vote for M. S. Thirteen right like it's I mean that the Democrats are the party of illegal alien crime and MS Thirteen the Republicans are the party of law and order and President Trump made that case over and over again so if you want the wall and the water you have to show up and vote for Republicans it's that simple\nAnd that's what this whole fight lays out\nBut it's really it's become a referendum on on many other things you don't get me wrong I don't think this election is just about immigration but it is very much about immigration Britain they feel it's it's very much about immigration and many other things as well including the economy including [noise]\nAh the ... you know what kind of country we want to be including did you do you support the craziness of the resistance that we've seen all these people that have gone off the rails was this whole cabinet our situation right like when the Democrats have gone nuts but the point is is that\nA ... it's very much a referendum about immigration as well\nAnd so again a if you want a border wall you got to vote for the Republicans if you don't want a border wall if you want\nA lawlessness if you want illegal aliens committing murder if you want and uh MS Thirteen running around if you want drugs spreading through your community are that are brought here by drug cartels vote for the Democrats by all means but I guess that's what you want but I don't think the vast majority of Americans\nSupport the opioid crisis I don't think the vast majority of Americans support a MS Thirteen committing crimes in their neighborhoods I don't think the vast majority of Americans want MS Thirteen that their kids' schools by so fast the fact of the matter is it the way to stop that federal public and to get to walk\nSo this is gonna be a national referendum on the wall McCarthy going down there today when it's going to lead us out\nAnd cover more with lower co pay more choices like dental vision prescription drug coverage and the freedom and the doctors you don't miss out on said in your\nHealth markets Medicare is it's free thanks micro says Michael method for health markets\nFind out if you can get a Medicare plan to pay you back coal eight hundred Seventy nine Ninety nine Thirteen that's eight hundred seven o nine Ninety nine Thirteen eight under age seven o nine Ninety nine Thirteen\nHere's the town hall dot com business you know the big loss for the wall street with Adele I'm more than five hundred points closing bell sober capital stock trader our Belden says yesterday's eight hundred plus point to climb was completely unexpected\nFor months now people have been looking for a correct and and we got it but it's a combination of you know here we got raising interest rates and it's October cash October for the end of the year they start running out readjusting their portfolios getting out of their winners\nAt the closing bell today was the dial down five hundred and forty six point\nThe ... the people I've been down by forty one long term us mortgage rates sleep this week to their highest levels in Seventy years\nOrgans by and Freddie Mac says the right on the thirty year fixed rate mortgage jumped to an average of poor point nine percent that's up from four point seven one last week the average on the Fifteen year fixed rate loan up to four point to nine percent when business on by\nNews and analysis at Tylenol dot com I'm Keith feeders Social Security beneficiaries can expect an increase in benefits\nNext year Social Security recipients and other retirees will see a cost of living adjustment up two point eight percent in twenty nine to one\nFor the average retired workers that amounts to thirty nine dollars a month it's the highest increase in seven years following an extended period of low inflation and it affects the household budget so about one in five Americans\nIncluding disabled veterans in federal retirees along with Social Security beneficiaries\nThat's about Seventy million people enough to send ripples through the economy ...

thing I I went through in two thousand sixteen and\nI told you the same thing okay the polls are garbage when rubber comes on at eight oh five uh there was one poll that was done by the Washington

home it doesn't matter it's embarrassing deal with it go away\nAnd um\nThere's other polling that we trust that showed that right now it's a toss up\n\nBut you you you're not going to hear from anybody in the fake news that it's a toss up\nYou're going to hear from everybody in the fake news push poll now we're going first agenda driven propaganda media that the Republicans are going to get

and you might as well stay home\nClosed windows in the bonds\nThat same thing they said in two thousand sixteen I I'll never forget going on with Bob Beck hold on Donald lemon before the election and

that has Trump losing Texas\nSo you'll line you you just make this up you get a push poll and you put it on a TV to press Texas Republican Trump voters that's all you do\nAnd of course the president won Texas handling this is what they do and they do it right about now twenty six days out when people start focusing\nAnd it's all coordinated and it's all in lock step and it's all going to be the

up\nDemocratic insiders are telling me it's a toss up and the Republicans are going to gain five seats in the Senate nobody knocked to the when Arizona they're\nNot going to win North Dakota they're not going to hold Indiana they're not going to win Florida they're not going to win any of these states they're they're not going to hold West Virginia they're not going to hold majority are going to
