they work hard every day in and do do great work so it's hard not to be motivated by that but it's it's hard not to be motivated to ah by the by the true honor that it is to represent them\nAnd I appreciate that and I'm having been in that position\nAnd and all\nWell you know Chris I mean I think at certain times it it it does it does give you pause as to you know where we are at the country and the divisions that are out there but but I always working every day to try to find places where we agree I think I think today it takes a little more effort to do\nA enacted that hold the line on these things you can go to continuing resolution that's an awful turn\nOff all reality but they also have I I Love the single object rule in ... where do you deal with one subject and that's it so you don't have this big mash up coming back from the other from the Senate or vice versa that just just blows up the whole deal\nThough I agree and and probably be a good good good thing is that in the in the U.S house we operate under the same rules you offering third the general assembly justices you and I both know that is\nSpeeding through it you figure out the rules about how things are happening on both the Senate has different rules so it's kind of get combined together and you look at it and go and how to Alice is related in any way shape or form in the ... the the\nThe most highlighted example is what airport about Iraq passed the title of the bill was not the political Iraq they they they took they took a ... bill script all the language out of it kept bumper and the title of the survey or the house\nVersion of the Affordable CARE Act so it it it's that kind of procedural stuff that you just shakes her head why how could that happen\nBut I Would argue that\nYou know sticking with Bill Wasik of systems aren't you see injustice manuals that way to make sure that you keep debate on track you make sure you don't have a lot of you know aren't related adopted a piece of legislation people go how did that get in there and it's kinda like you know throwing everything on the last train leaving the stakes are like\nYou know that stuff doesn't doesn't belong there are not related or used you know as the as the ethical to pass things that are unrelated I agree that that's one of the I think the problems up here is that it doesn't it doesn't require to necessarily get paid\nIn twelve plus eight when you're using that mechanism when you have like a related\nOr aspects of legislation or language for their way to deal with people just you know look at it and go how how could that\nI Hope you're well we'll take a look at some of the rules and get more to wherever a Virginia way of governing up in DC because\nI I one of the things that are when you pull back from politics and and watch sports people get upset when they see rules violations because they know the rules ... last night there was a pitcher Justin Vernon lander through as a slider was beautiful smarter\nAnd Enron darling he was a pitcher for the Mets and the agents another team said that is a pitch in when you are warming up the you put your Mitt down and say grab it till I'm done that's a perfect pitch and it was and it was called the ball\nAnd the next pitch the the Boston Red Sox guy hit him for a home run and as a as a fan you go that's outrageous only because the the the teleprompter had\nWrong and what happens when people in in politics people that they don't know the rules to get upset about that is just not cricket you're not doing it the right way guys you know we deserve better and so they pulled back you know it's just the ... they they shrugged their shoulders and throw their hands\nYou know it's just it's just not working on on on my behalf you know I I don't get it right in the distance and or anything you can do to to to change that up would be for the benefit of my rent let's get back to the absolute let's get back to the national district what what are your voters telling you\nWell you know where he has a lot of state I think that they're that they're very interested in modeling creating a a continual um increase\nIn our economy I think people are are very positive about where the economy is now I think they appreciate what's been done by Congress lessons regulatory burden and changing the tax code\nTo make it on your for businesses individuals but the things that they want to see going forward or what I call a sustaining parts of the economy and first we seen as having an education system that\nAssures that our children students get the officers are educational experience to be able to\nFulfill the jobs are there are seven point one million jobs over day Chris and Seventy five percent of those jobs will not require a great and that means we have to emphasize career and technical education as much as we do common strike education because\nThat's where the jobs are in those jobs today are skilled jobs that have a quick as far as a career when you go from an apprentice your journey into a pastor and have a career there Stargate really well in many instances better\nThan you wrote him a job that requires a college degree so I think people look at that and say that's where we have to go on to looking at going how it's going to make sure that my child is successful like how do we ensure the education just gives them the knowledge skills abilities\nTo compete for the jobs that are available today and ... and I think businesses look and say hey the other thing and the economy are going really well for Christmas and I talked to him and this was a ... I can tell you the top three things they talk about our workforce\nWorkforce and workforce or you or they say we can grow up\nBusiness today if we can just find workers to do the job and it's you know there are more job openings today are built the job openings so where am I going to have this must be happening in one other element to this article and that is brought their ability for people to connect\nIs important and that was part of education so that a lot of families about children go to school or their ... computers\nAnd bring them home if they can't connect it's hard for them to do the assignments that they've been given or the soap opera like a political or take them on to the library bottles ticket wife fine businesses anytime certain areas that don't have high speed can't do the\nBusiness they needed to be successful and her one of the ways to bring down\nDoctors can connect with patients with a lot of hard to go to an office tower miles and miles away and can get that care and quality of those things are gaining changed right so we really what brought down that we have to make sure we have education system sizes Korean talking legislation as much as a post college truck educated\nAnd these are these are these are tough issues because people don't go broadband\nWorkforce development those those don't get the people out to the to the poll I mean they're just like no that makes sense I like that in ... when people get down into the the grand you'll areas are talked about with other callers today in politics and the government's complex and people don't like complex they're like five were bumper stickers because they're pretty busy trying to make their lives working\nIn putting that into the context of their daily lives come out and vote whichever way is a tall order for a lot of politicians right\nSure policy is complicating it takes a long haul her off for anybody anybody in like in a leadership position whether\nElected or bought positive outcomes hawk tower social and you know blows booms long project are really distilled or hang out here or something but I quickly people say hey let's just critical\nAnd yes it is currently soundbites are way to help our economy but drill down is okay we've done anything you can always say oh so you're not quite in Chicago\nBut I think people are uncomfortable I don't want to talk on the left office or asking for people's phone too so I think that's great you know that's what I've got ... ... that's great but what people want to hear to work if I'm going to place multiple again\nWhat do you do in the future how do you want to stay on the plane get to eat on\nWhat are you going to do to accomplish that what do you what you\nWant to come back to us or if you are ... ... s just punch the Harlem sort of things are happening around you know\nWhat I was able to accomplish a lot of people want that they want you to understand what's important that they want you to project location for the future about how those don't you're going to be a threat so it's not just on the list of things you've done is what are you going to connect with our most people's concerns and the challenges they face\nAs I tell people audiences all the time I talked to him politics is about the future not that bad as it is and you can like look what happened to various the economy's great unemployment is historically low and they just threw out the government pretty much there's ... there's some there's some\nUndertow currents that you just have to go out there and pound doors you understand and listen to people because the elections are about tomorrow night yesterday that's you know I I really appreciate your calling in today we wish you the best out there on the campaign trail you got what Eighteen days

Wilder school tell us briefly about the Wilder school and what your doing\nYes so we're we're a school of government and public affairs at VCU um rains in the top fifty I in US News and World Report for schools the public affairs for undergraduate and graduate program focused on criminal justice homeland security and emergency preparedness\nPublic administration as well\nAs programs and the master's level and urban and regional planning and a PHD program and public policy and then we also have\nOur Center for public policy which I direct which is our consulting and community engagement arm of the work we do in the wild or schools that you will see a lot of things around economic development ah leadership in training look one state government outreach and things like public policy polling\nThat we knew within the center for public policy in the wild her school\nWe're going we're coming up pulling real quick but you guys actually go out and work with uh other local governments and businesses that you helped them not just I think people don't understand that about higher education the value that you bring to the community and the state yes\nWe really do I mean we're done everything from looking helping that localities looking at potentially providing incentives for a certain business to come into their community and doing a return on investment of what that economic impact but it looked like on the proposal stage with regards to incentive then come back and provided down that actual economic\nImpact if they went forward with a business and the impact that it had on the community with everything from revenue job creation other aspect and that way out we've done valuations of um you know criminal justice programs to the implementation of a mental health program or a drug treatment program on reducing recidivism for\nLocal jail a or a a community partner we worked with a non profit from everything from their rations of the programs in projects that things do you do also coordinating and combining the\nActual help that they need with regards to our students in our staff\n... well on the business community are\nLooking at a third party evaluations of programs in projects and the private sector looking to pitch to the general assembly and need an actual third party non biased evaluation of that work being able to provide that report or for that company for the general assembly to look at legislative impacts\nSo we do we are a continual partner\nEvery single day with our local and state governments around the commonwealth um and it it really is what we live and breathe it in a while their school specifically um we do it at a much\nCost effective rate than our private sector counterparts if you will because it really is our mission in our vision and it allows that can bring to bear are\nAcademic experts he says well within the wild her school you know we have over thirty academics who this is their area of expertise and you want to talk about the economic impact I've got four economist in an urban and regional planning program or you want to talk about the impact of an opiate program a treatment program I've got two criminals that says ah academic\nSee that their area of expertise and they get asked all around the country to look you know present their research and were able to bring that expertise to be here for our localities in the commonwealth in Virginia\nSo that when you're a whole service higher education in school because I mean\nWe are we are you know we we provide at all give us your students that we will educate the freshman in college through graduate school in PHD program\nGive us your workers that we will train them in an executive leadership and management preparation I give us your legislators and you're allowed to us and we will train them and policy analysis and the impact\nOf a variety of 'em on legislation and um give us your communities and will help you come up with good solutions and then you need evaluation of the impact on the police shows that we really are um the one stop all encompassing education and consulting\nAcademic arm for a local and state government and our our citizens and students around the common law\nAnd that's why I brought it up and it will go the polling that your that your operations down there because I think it's so important for people to understand the totality of a lot of things and governments especially heritage which has a ... on his back around the country but in Virginia we've got a great higher education system we really need to be proud of it\nUh even though it's you know it's it's appropriate to hold them accountable as tough questions but a lot of things you're talking about are free they are exclusive of of usual operations and they are a complementary to what you are doing and actually facilitate what you were doing in higher education I think it's wonderful I think it's misunderstood not understood at all\nBut let's jump into some polling or that the Wilder school has done what are you seeing out there and what have you seen what direction are we going\nWhy don't we talk a little bit and then you had Clinton on earlier so let's talk a little bit about poverty and in polling in public policy that we did on this summer we were out alive we'll have another poll rolling right here after the election in November but in our in our public policy arena you talked about higher ed\nVirginia and around the entire commonwealth so true representative sample of all five region um\nOf our commonwealth and when we look at it and ask people what they think about the value of higher education in Virginia over eighty percent of our responded believed that the community colleges that we haven't\nSeen yet or work their cost over sixty five percent believes that are public four year institutions are worth the cost and then right under fifty percent believe that our\nPrivate schools in the commonwealth and work in the car so it's really important that you said that question around down in Virginia we value higher education and not only did we value it but we're putting out a product that comes around the commonwealth bank is age appropriate return\n[noise] [noise]\nFewer news this hour from town hall dot com I download your President Trump said he will accept a landmark\nArms

former member of the Virginia house of delegates I surf in two thousand two the two thousand ten and currently I'm the executive director of Virginia free\nThe foundation for research and economic education Virginia free is a nonpartisan underlined nonpartisan boldly non partisan or a pro business out advocacy organization here in the comet they're not for Thirty years I'm not only a pro business we're also very much\nA working towards responsible pro business government ... as we heard in the in the news updates Mike we heard that China's economy is slowing down its growth and that's a problem they have a significant debt burden and their economy is slowing its growth down there\nYou know you're trying to like be be that guy and that has that has devolved to where we are today largely as a result of several factors\nI'm One that the Iraq War out to the collapse of the economy in two thousand and eight and a and that has led to this massive worldwide suspicion of government\nOr what's going on today this unsettled place that we are in this world is not just manifesting itself in the United states we are not alone in this in this in this cultural shift that's manifesting itself in politics\nIt's showing up in Hungary in Poland and in Germany over the weekend in Bavaria which is actually I ran into a [laughter]\nGerman political teacher who weekend fancy that right you're going to exchange program I didn't want to go to the vet and I'm like I'm a watch them with I I really don't want to go on watch football I Want to chill out Sunday night as a great game on Bob oh go you'll have fun okay fine subsidies to German teachers\nTrying to have a conversation and thinking I don't know any German right what are you going to do ... you know you have all the [laughter] house Hitler you know [laughter]\nYou know what are you go with that conversation well it turns out there's big beautiful English they probably better than than we do structurally\nAnd um and I and I said so how are the elections today malaria because they're very they're auction\nAnd well this one teacher where the upper a teacher of politics so then we went down a rabbit hole two hours later after dinner table we just we just were chewing up politics\nAnd when he was telling me about the very was\nIs that is extremely successful economically it is the richest region of Germany for full employment like three percent unemployment youth unemployment is extremely well\nAh their school system is set up to get people to work straight away um if if you're like a tenth grade and you're not you don't really want to go to university you don't have to fake it to make it\nYou can go right into a a a trade school with apprentice program and you're gonna get a job and you get a diploma so they get um really it's a very work intensive area they\nThey pride themselves culturally\nOn work and productivity an organization and good government right there it was like a it's not like a shining example of how you would want to have a state where a region actually be everyone's employed everyone has a job\nYou have any functions ah and it works well they had this major upset in the very end election and you go what are you upset about what what could you possibly be that concerned about\nThat you basically blow up this I don't know if they blow it up but how does major upset in the ruling party that had been has been in control\nFor decades last probably the ... the ruling majority in Bavaria and it was stunning to me to realize that we're not immune from that here and here in America so people say you know the economy republic Israeli counties going so great vote for us\nPeople don't vote on yesterday's news they don't vote on today's news they vote on the future where are we going where what is going to be happening that's my fear that's my concern because why things are going well you know\nWith Donald Trump got elected gasoline was about two twenty five a gallon now it's around two eighty ah two thousand eight was four dollars a gallon or better but are we getting better are we getting worse you know we see here that China news today about their economy slowing down its growth rate of growth\nAnd that has a factor on the human psyche about how how's it going manifested itself in my life you see these commercials they're not all about you know skills and here's my dad says\nThere about this guy off all she's horrible their ... but there's no big overriding issue like here's what we're going to do in the future it's just that the other person's really bad therefore they're not going to be good for you\nUm and therefore because he is going to say well they're gonna hurt the economy I guess this is what to extrapolate from that and the subconscious\nBut I'm going what is the big driving issue other then obviously Donald Trump and it's a fascinating time in American politics or one of reasons why do what I did because it is so interesting but also to teach people\nAs I used to tell my my students I really don't care I'm really don't care [laughter]\nWhat you think I care that you think if I can encourage people to be more interested about what they're talking about to read another article to dig deeper to challenge themselves\nThey will in turn create a better outcome for the rest of us and I just tell my students I don't care who you vote for I just care that you vote but if\nI'm not I'm not doing this I vote none of the above and it's and that's and that's tabulate it in the aggregate itself just like a vote will and that people do that doesn't make any sense\nActually it does if you don't show up for something the two political parties going to try to get you to show up next time we're trying to reach out to you in some way shape or form that data point will register I told her to a of a family I was at a baseball game with\nAnd they were so upset or I just can't stand going and I did not vote if they haven't earned your vote don't vote and tell them that you don't put it on social media like he would anyone else anything else say I'm not voting you haven't earned my though you haven't got me off my couch off my dollars\nTo go down and say I'm voting for this person you don't register it'll aggregate data\nAnd that raw data collects and is dissected by the political class to determine what they want to do a ... and ... and that's an ... swings on the undecided voter right the independent voter in October it's like oh we're going to stop talking about these issues that motivate our base to a degree we're going to focus on these oh I'm really happy to work with the other side received this now and\nIn certain kinds I work with the president's wife shows up at the polling independence\nThey might not like President Trump but when they agree with something you'd better work with him to get 'cause that's just you know all politics is personal not just local anyway this is Chris action of filling in for John Frank's if you tuned in to hear me drawing on\nAbout politics go who is this guy I'm a former member of the house of delegates I'm filling in for John ... as I Am want to do\nA as John is on vacation with his son down in Florida in a baseball tournament a John is a baseball fan by looking as women's but he was a pitcher in college and his son Joe Joes a picture\nOf you want to call and ask me some questions love to hear from you\nEight eight eight four five six four six eight eight eight four five six four six eight eight eight for eight oh five six four six four you can taxidermy straight away five four zero to nine four zero six eight zero five four zero\nTo nine four zero six eight zero I'm going to have some great experts on later today Clinton kid Chris we're Newport Jack Wilson for the Republican Party with congressman Rob Wittman\nA doctor Robin McDougal from the Virginia Commonwealth University of Wilder school and Jesse Harris from Iowa who is a political operative and uh\nAs as on the Democratic side in from the Republican side from New Hampshire will hear from Mike Dennis ... and Susan slacker on my good friend from the Central Valley uh we're um they've known citizen for you know gosh early nineties I think\nWell I certainly aging yourself there's there isn't\nA Democrat a chair a chair of the Democratic party Virginia is from highland county to county I used to represent and they've known Susan for for decades and so we have we have a great friendship and I\nAnd I'm looking forward to having all these callers calling today and stir up the conversation a little bit go a little deeper we're going deeper today in politics we're going to go deeper dive and not just you know the ... calling the top one numbers but how those posters got to those numbers\nWho are they listening to who are they calling well why are they calling because it's a very different when a university does a polling like CRISPR Newport you'll hear quitting kids talk about this they start with a very broad universe\nUniversity of actual likely voters minutes and we'll get to the will get into the nitty gritty you will be able to get you take you do a deeper dives when you look at the polls when you go to real clear politics which which I spend unfortunately way too much time on 'em but I guess is healthier than other websites right\n[laughter] this is a healthy Internet\nAh it's it's a a ... you look at these different polls and and you go like that just to just take a look at the uh the polls on a generic ballot it's insane what the what the what we're looking at here hold up this is fascinating like\nGeneric ballot follow this truck plus Democrats plus a Democrat suppose five Democrats plus eleven Democrats\nPlus the weapon Democrats plus one what how do you get there\nDid you say the polling is wrong what poems always right it's just data you're collecting other people call what the differences isn't the methodologies\nWho you're going I talked to one leading I'm\nDemocratic source and I said okay what's your polling showing me he said Democrats are around mid low thirties thirty four thirty three percent or two that range Republicans we've never seen self identification for Republicans this while it's around twenty four\nPercent in what used to be you know thirty\nFour thirty four is now thirty four twenty four and independents are up around the loaded forties he goes Republicans have never been lower on self identification but we haven't picked up any of those voters they're all self identifying now as independents that\nIs huge it when you get down to it with people when they understand what's really going on that's when they get more excited mortgage this is Chris X. men it's only for John Fredrickson it eight for you know five six for six stay tuned come on back\nHad a birthday I have a beer you know put a picture of his his her brother with this with the Budweiser tell just reminded me so much my friendship and I'm a black how blessed to have it in my life but also\nA what a what a blessing and it's just to be alive right to be able to ah just to be experienced at all and I'm Wondering since I enjoy coming in during his radio show as I get to hopefully get people excited about politics I'm a good that does governor lives is important you know we can't break down we have to work with each other\nTo get good things that we should have the debate though we should have a vibrant vigorous debate that threat moves the country forward um and we shouldn't be afraid to have that debate but we should have in a in a civil manner and I think today we see it or a lack of civility more and more and that's difficult\nIn my professional life I Am the executive director Virginia freed the foundation for research in economic education and uh we're fiber Wednesday three see sex and were nonpartisan which is a great lane to be in these days because everyone is\nYou know red or blue and I'm like okay for you well you know aren't you might not really I don't have to be actually I'm paid not to\nHave been better right oh yeah\nWe have a membership and what we tried to do is educate them on politics and as a former teacher and from a business person in my family out of bottled water business for years old a couple of years ago\nA blessed with like um you know I I like getting people excited about learning about politics seeing it differently and what's that makes me do learn an even deeper like you know when you when you go to teach the subject is better than other subjects you have to really get engaged in the subject\nSo it's an every day I get to learn more and more about politics it's it's it's a deep interesting topic because it brings in culture\nAnd a economics and history that was a history major so I I get to bring down altogether because it manifest itself as Andrew Breitbart said in the last ... last segment you know culture is down politics just downstream of cultures so if you want to impact culture or the politics impact culture first and foremost suffer your cultural evil\nLeader you'll be you'll be a political leader give us a call it eight four to five six for six we got some great guess calling in today are not just constant Rob Wittman but also the leaders of the two major parties here in Virginia posters Clinton kid and Robin McDougal\nAnd then two operatives one from Iowa\nAnd one from New Hampshire we're only I hate to say this because you're probably second tier the election is already in the midterms we are four hundred and Seventy two days away from the Iowa caucuses [noise]\nFour hundred and Seventy two now it seems like a long time but let's be honest as soon as this election is over you're going to start hearing reports back from Iowa and New Hampshire and we're going to be at the forefront of that we're going to get calls here we're going to shoot up there with us of operatives that Republican and Democrats\nTo see what's going on the ground I think Trump's got the lock on the nomination you never know\nYou never know you never know goodness knows you never know with Donald Trump because um that that that that's that's who knows this actually does what he says it says you can do but you never know what's going to happen around him and I think that's one of the more interesting parts about politics today is because\nHe's brought that dynamic or ... or what next and that sort of it was if you remember from your uh ... days in school or or at work you know when the leader changes and it's like a substitute teacher what is going to be like your\nYou know get an you get a new bars or whether it's a\nIt's there's just the newness and from since June fifteenth of twenty Fifteen this has been at very different political dynamic\nAre not necessarily unhealthy because it has made us think and react differently and respond differently and I don't think that's necessarily on healthy ah but we do have to be ever vigilant to make sure it does not become too unhealthy and I think people are recognizing that we have\nUh some some discourse in this country or that can be improved we can get better at that as a people and how we do that is every day one on one with each other if you want to impact politics if you want better representation be better people\nSort of comes down to um they represent us and if you want them to be better it's up to us to be a better\nSo it was called an eight four five six for six we'll talk about polls goodness knows there's more calls and I don't want to do with these days the generic ballot what I pay attention to first and foremost is what I check every day I'm On the real clear politics they give you the um\nCause I'm now poll should be looking at what are called Elvie likely voters polling companies should have an understanding of who they imagine are going to be showing up on election they should have a pretty good handle on may ... began in Virginia about a month ago so that we should know who's actually voting\nI'm In Virginia and or you can always tell by Arlington because they're the tabulate in their uh their absentee ballots are some friends of mine who are tracking that to see what kind of a who's voting relative to the last round of elections to see what the intensity is\nBut when you look at the er the averages of the generic about him and this is why I Do this is why I Do that\nIn twenty Seventeen when governor Ralph Northam defeated Ed Gillespie he won by eight point nine three percent a point nine three points\nThe generic ballot on that day was nine point one if I'm trying to instruct the class what do you want to follow Fox News Reuters rats mice in CNBC Emerson Maris Quinnipiac Wilder pool poll\nA Christian Newport which one do you follow follow the generic ballot right now because that it that is fairly proximate to what happened last year and the year before and twenty sixteen\nIf you look the generic ballot in twenty sixteen it was very close it was like tied and Republicans over performed on election day by about a point and they won and the generic congressional ballot I'm obviously Trump lost by about three points a nationally three million votes\nUm so that's something to consider when you're saying okay we're just going to go I think\nI think the the objective view here is look at the generic ballot look at the average and you can pretty much extrapolate where it is right now\nIs election day were held today and because it's on that basis it it takes away the the partisan lines you might have or a would be inclined to if at nine point one percent the dams won by a point nine nine point one point nine that's very close and they are at seven point six right now\nIt is safe to assume that they will not perform as well as they did in twenty Seventeen but still will win and likely when the house\nOf representatives given the the dynamics in the Senate very different because the individual races\nLikely that Republicans a hold on to the Senate what's the dynamic that if the Democrats have the house and Senate Republicans have the Senate what's going to have the next two years and that's how you can sort of\nFigure out where this thing is going so that you can understand what you need to do or not to like myself I don't watch cable news I don't watch broadcast news every papers in the morning to punishment times Wall Street journal and I get mine on information what's going on in the economy and politics and culture and whatnot\nAnd nearly enough they'll listen to you know the the uh the national talk radio shows I go to work like you know I I bet with my eyes I see what's going on and I think most voters do that if you look at the the aggregate numbers of\nYou know the Fox news of the world and the MSNBC\nActive voters they are the ... they're the activists so those shows are pretty much you're broadcasting to the activists about what they want to hear about the messaging points that they're\nThey they they're supposed to repeat so when you watch when you go to Facebook or Twitter or Snapchat or Instagram or whatever you're very different social media platforms\nYou see the replica repetition of the message and you're like wow I I go to a town hall after I got like a congressional panel watch when my friends you know if there is now in Congress there were ...\nI watch them and take questions from the audience is like where do you see what can you see from mission it's fundamentally wrong but they're really upset\nI mean angry not pleasant not understanding but what do they show up for today show up because they're angry\nThey are concerned but more importantly like anyone else in the world they just wanted to hurt right how important is that\nIn a conversation to hear what the other person is is really feeling and get down to okay what is that what what is what is making you got to say oh 'cause actually I don't know\nThat that's the operative subject matter [noise] what is triggering this fear and when you get down into the into the nuts and bolts you ... you really can't understand\nWhy people do what they do and hopefully get them to a better place than station life and it's not easy to do\nBut it's a it's it's what we do it in a democracy in the Republican form a democracy which we have\nIn America thank God I'm so we can just live more peacefully amongst each other governors self self governance I think is really important historical and concept and I think we've lost sight of that a little bit it's easy to uh but more importantly it suffered for folks to point out to be what\nWe can do better we can do better calm down we got this I mean are are you have too many TV channels at night\nDo you have too many options are they are too many restaurants and grocery stores around you\nIs it too good are you afraid you're

this is a question from a from a from a texture short\nWe're not we're not ...\nLeading up to um today so Virginia is about two thirds cell phone mostly or cellphone only users and so our sample we we actually draw samples of cell phone numbers and so we do quotas on her cellphone versus landline sample\nSo we basically go into the field with about a two third one third cellphone landline split already\nUm and we haven't found our response rate on cell phones be any different than it has been which is not great um you know people typically aren't taking cell phone calls to do surveys like they were\nLandline calls in the seventies to do surveys show we're not finding it any more difficult than we were already um I Do have colleagues around the country who are finding cell phone number is being blocked more um and and it's driven by this um all of this fishing that's been going on with our cell phone numbers lately\nI Can't remember what my phone number is recall from Idaho we're in right\nIn ... we do there are two things that we do to try to help us with that we're Dennis by ourselves as Chris rooting for university so we're not we're not an anonymous number or we're not\nI'm an endless number you'll see who we are when we call and then um if you say look put me on your do not call list will put you on argue not call is that we won't call you back or we don't have to do that because\nYou know according to the federal regulations were doing research academic research we're not working we're not getting paid to you know do this we're not making a profit show were considered um researchers so we don't have to comply with they do not call list\nBut we do keep our own do not call list and if somebody says don't call me I don't want to do surveys then we'll put them on earth do not call it so we try to be transparent in that way as well\nWell that's fascinating because most people go oh yeah I'm On a on those do not call list so that they are because because you are academic nature interesting so your turnout model is is showing forty to forty five percent that's interesting because the people I talked to was nearly campaigns are they're hoping is going to be around forty eight\nThat's so that's so it depends on who you talk to 'em it could be forty eight um it could be higher I mean they're so here's the real sort of question that I have in my head right so\nIf there is a big blue wave if there are a lot of voters that are engaged right now who didn't even vote in twenty Seventeen\nMan we're missing them in our survey were not capturing that right and that's some of the pushback I got back\nUm what do we want to put out our second district poll showing Taylor leading Luria some Democrats push back and said well you're not even capturing some of the voters that were newly registering in and they're going to vote okay fair enough but we have the luxury in Virginia in in that we had a twenty Seventeen election that we think captured that surge\nPretty well it it ... it brought Ralph Northam into the governor's mansion\nRalph Northam won a second district by four percent first time a Democrat or one that district in about a decade\nSo we think we twenty Seventeen captured that surge pretty well but it may be even bigger than\nBye bye engaging their base voters already know if they've done that we think we've captured them because they were already voters anyway um but if turnout is higher\nI think it's going to help you um I don't know that helps one party over the other all the way it might be helpful to Democrats because it might be that extra search that we might that might be a lot of new voters that we're not capturing\nSo you ... you you saw the search I combed through suburban tsunami and I'm twenty seven to ... you saw that you saw that\nI think you had and we all yeah we we were we were modeling\n'em in twenty Seventeen like we are likely model is here or what we were doing and twenty Seventeen as we were we were modeling the same way but we were also looking for new the registered voters\n'em in twenty Seventeen because of that was\nThat was that serves that was the difference between twenty six year twenty Seventeen was a lot of the new suburban voters um and so we did see\nThe search and twenty Seventeen we all know what it looked like in Virginia and so there's nothing that says to me that that's going to be any less this year than it was in twenty Seventeen and there are things that say to me it might be a little bit bigger than it is that it wasn't twenty Seventeen and by the way\nIn twenty Seventeen the Republicans were as engaged as as you would want them to be it's just the Democrats were a little bit more engaged\nSo you think it might be even bigger this year\nIt very well could be I don't think it can be much bigger but it very well could be um Democrats in particular are trying to register new voters or they they were until the deadline\nAnd Republicans I'm work trying to register new voters as much as they were trying to mobilize their their base voters that are already there so\nI mean look if both parties it's not likely to be because we don't have a really robust statewide race going on 'em and we have ... competitive congressional races some places and not at other places so so that's part of the reason I'm thinking forty five um but if it ends up being forty eight it's because there were met and there's massive turnout\nGoing on and some of these really competitive congressional races um I don't know if you're a if you're if you're looking for a competitive state wide race to drive a turnout we just don't have that this year and so that's part of the reason I'm hesitant to say it's going to go as high as forty eight\nBut look I've been wrong many times um and I'll be wrong many times in the future\n[laughter] goodness knows that I'm Talking about the same ones not close\nNot close um it I you know I think what I find interesting about the statewide races that um it's not close yet you see Tim Kaine campaigning\nIn his ... his campaign campaigning as if it were close he's running ads on on every in every television network in in the commonwealth he's campaigning like he's got a a more for a bit of a formidable candidate that he has\nAnd I think there are two things going on I think Tim Kaine needs to send a statement that I've moved beyond twenties sixteen um and and and\nI think he's also recognizing that in some of these are really close congressional races um if he can pull any coattails um if he can let out any coattails it can be really helpful to democratic candidates down ballot and so I think oddly enough\nTim Kaine is running a campaign to get re elected to the U.S Senate and running several congressional campaigns to elect Democrats um in in in some of these competitive races at the same time\nUm and he doesn't really have a challenger that has a lot of money but Corey Stewart is all over local talk radio which is where his voters are going to be and so I think Korea is running the kind of campaign that he needs to run to give voters out given um how difficult situation he has and how little money is\nSo your state wide pulling that\nWe used we pulled the Senate race several times and then decided it wasn't going to be a competitor enough to pull it throughout the final stretch from Labor Day on instead decided to pull these congressional races because\nReally for the first time in probably decades in Virginia if if if a hundred and some odd years we've got a lot of a lot of really competitive congressional races going on so we decided to pull the congressional races instead of continuing the pole what doesn't appear to be a very competitive Senate race\nBut we are we're wrapping up here in the segment with which you have a final call here on what the Senate race is going to look like in the day\nWell probably somewhere Fifteen Fifteen ashes my is where my ... I'm at right now it could be a little bit higher could be a little bit lower if it's a little bit lower it's going to\nSome of these congressional races are going to look really good for Republicans are going to be really tight if it's if it's higher if it's closer to twenty than some of these democratic congressional candidates are going to have a better night I think\nFifty sixty seven range yeah anything moving a libertarian front and they make an impact and all you\nKnow in a in in in we we anticipated they might given that that you know a lot of country club Republicans might not be interested in Corey Stewart but at the end of the day\nWe're in it were very tribal period of our politics and if there's an hour by your name a lot of Republicans were going to just vote for that are and not actually give 'em the libertarian their their vote so we don't see any uptick I'm I'm among libertarian candidates either state wide or\nIn these congressional races um there's a libertarian in the tenth as libertarians seven we're not seeing any uptick with either one of them\nOkay thanks Quentin Kidd recalling him was like an opportunity last Libertarian Party they had a chance to to crack the crack the market here a little bit in Virginia they might have fallen short this is Chris accident filling in for the vacation and John in front of a couple of them back\nTo get it right now standing joke so uh you know if you heard the last thing with Clinton kids from Christopher Newport oh are you seeing anything different than what Dr kids seeing out there\nWhere I heard that the back end of his um interview and I you know I I sort of got the sense from the discussion that perhaps these seeing more of a blue wave that I'm seeing I'm you know I'm In in regular contact with all our\nCongressional campaigns um throughout the commonwealth and frankly most of them are doing really well I'm an ad I Will be a\nSurprise if it doesn't really come down to perhaps just two of the congressional districts being really in play when we get to election\nNight to just to which too\nI I see you know the seventh and the tenth clearly or other to battlegrounds right now I think the other ones that perhaps people are looking at or the fans but I think Denver regular man is clearly running a far superior campaign there and so I think Denver a\nWill uh will be fine collection night on there have been some talk of Scott Taylor's race scotch really working hard um I mean if perhaps we'll be closer than we otherwise would hope but I think at the end of the day Scott should be fine as well so\nThat's where it comes back down to Barbara Comstock in the tens 'em and Dave Brat in the seventh this way I see it at this point\nTo a doctor kid he didn't mention Nebraska spanberger racing I live in a district I see it every day at least in western in Rico county and it was a stark difference in what's going on the ground at least but I I pulled back and try and do the objective follow the data if you follow the data that Clinton kids right in following what you're saying\nUm the Taylor and ... are the ones that are most of the plane as far as\nYou know changing I'm changing party right\nIf they're accurate or you've got killed by seven and Tom struck down by the state or nine times like that\nSo if that's consistent than his polling is accurate um it would probably show up if you if you're going to do one on bread spam or you know what I imagine that he would\nBut what he also pointed out obviously the quality of the candidates important local issues are important\nBut also what he pointed out was he didn't see the big Kavanaugh kicker or that everyone in the talking about this is going to have this big search for Republicans or is it is it's pretty quiet people make up their minds just going to vote\nAnd as he said Republicans and show up in midterms\nAnd and I sort of see the ladder I mean obviously what I'm looking at is anecdotally um play\nDuring the prior to the to the judge now justice Kavanaugh hearings um there was um um perhaps apathy on the part of the Republican base\nUm but that changed almost immediately or with those hearings and I think the Republican base in Virginia and I think the Republican base around the country saw what a Democrat majority in the United States Senate and the Democrat majority in the house representatives under Speaker Pelosi would look like\nConstant um investigations calls for impeachment so the president investigations of justice Kavanaugh\nAnd so what I saw as a state party chair with a clear\nJump significantly as a result of that and I'm as it's been said before somebody is going to write a check or send some money to the party or candidates are more likely going to vote for that person as well so it may not be showing up in the polls quite yet but I Believe\nThat there is a renewed enthusiast some they're clearly wasn't enthusiasm gap between the Republicans and Democrats prior to the Kavanaugh hearings but I think that gaffes than eliminated so now it's just a matter of turning our folks out\nSo you're seeing the enthusiasm kick if I talked to Morgan Griffith about a week and a half ago and he said the same things and you know it was a if you were doing the scale of one to ten ten being absolutely out of their mind showing up no matter what\nA he said you know Democrats are around Ninety and my folks around thirty said but my folks are now up around ... or so he he he sensed it he felt the underground been climbed told me the same thing a ... from the anecdotal standpoint\nI Do think there is a renewed a fervor in the in the Republican base that quite frankly is getting a lot of what they want in the last election as part of the hard thing to politics you know\nYou know when when you get what you want your show up are you satisfied or you know you're fat and happy new stay home because things are going pretty well what what's the point uh but I think that the cabinet things to re energize refocused or at least the Republican base on I'm wanting to come out and vote but you're seeing that throughout the day\nI Am and I and I think you know again what I think the bugs realize you're right I mean it was the got what they wanted and twenty sixteen we have the president and acting tax cuts the economy's booming lowest unemployment and in decades and said it was probably some complacency in that but then I think now the Republican base seeing\nAll that can get on done very quickly what the Democrats control the house and Senate and so I think Republicans are saying we've got to roll up our sleeves and if we want to keep what we've got we've got to go to the polls and vote for it\nUsually the cycle of politics right so what as the new chairman of the Republican Party of Virginia ah what is the next step for RPG where are you all go and what should Republicans in Virginia Beach we've got because when you look at Virginia and Maryland you have to if she was very strange electorate you have\nA democratic Maryland with a Republican governor who looks like he's gonna win three Fifteen and twenty points in Virginia which has been a battleground trending now towards the blue states Tim Kaine couldn't get thinks is going to win by Fifteen uppers probably maybe twenty points as well\nYou didn't really do have this dichotomy don't you across the Potomac were where the the the dynamics in politics are changing Massachusetts has a Republican governor or who's up pulling a the leading Democrats in the state you know Charlie Baker you have a governor a Republican governor of Illinois\nUm is is is the ... other Republicans in Virginia sit right for the electric\nI I think what you're saying I obviously I don't know that in our current climate in Virginia whether any of the three candidates you mentioned governor Hogan and others who would win secure the Republican nomination in Virginia right now but\nI think what will recognize and and I and I've sort of sense to perhaps a more pragmatic approach among Republicans I'm again coming out of the Kavanaugh hearings um uh somebody\nI'm sort of a stalwarts of the Republican Party people to laugh but now I'm getting requested how can we bring Lindsey Graham in to speak in Virginia for candidates and and have him as a featured speaker of places it's so\nI think the Kavanaugh hearings may have challenged that what we need to do is have a broader based in the Republican Party that can bring conservatives together around core principles and perhaps uh if we can agree on eighty percent of the issues we can disagree on the other twenty later on after we start winning again\n[laughter] again the cycle because look both parties are having their their uh ... battles right I mean the Democrats have their own battles are Republicans are having their battles we're gonna have some posters\nAnd that pollsters are some operatives from Iowa New Hampshire calling to nine o'clock hour as you listen to that we have one calling him from a Democrat from Iowa Republican mantra is going to tell us what's going on there says to the national caucuses 'cause it's that's really what\nThey are really only I say I don't have time to worry about that I Do I just holding out for delegates to the same set it up for reelection but they're not they're not worried about twenty twenty after we win and preserve I bet you're already in the house and Senate next year in Virginia and the\nGently push back here because the dominant theme in American politics is what's going on in Washington DC and it's being reflected back in in the states and then the local to the districts because Trump is the issue right now since\nSince June fifteenth of twenty Fifteen that man has driven the conversation every day in American politics and if you know four hundred and Seventy two days away from from the Iowa caucuses people are going to be focusing on those issues\nBut it's going to get very retail very quickly while the Virginia races are going on and that's the beauty and the dynamic of Virginia politics isn't it I mean you because we are we are the polls\nWe take the temperature all the time\n... that's exactly right and I think um for our congressional candidates this year I think last year gave them sort of a wake up call they could say OK\nPerhaps where after roll up our sleeves and work much harder than we thought we were going to have to and so um you're right that this year will sort of perhaps give us a preview of what we can expect in twenty Nineteen but that will be as sort of a pulse of the of the country for as you say\nBecause we have the entire general assembly up\nIn this time next year ... all one hundred and forty members the or the district of the general assembly\nAre going to be up for election and there's so many issues at play what Clinton kid was talking about when he's sitting in his polling is that quality candidates matter and local issues matter I got an email last night from a former colleague of mine\nTalking about Corey in northern Virginia and uh basically local development and he was engaged on he also sends out emails on traffic patterns and ... and I'm like\nThis is not what you do in the general assembly but if that's what the voters want they want someone talking about right but I\nI think that's right people are really looking for results\nFrom their elected officials and the things that are impacting most people today with a booming economy and and job I'm strong and wages\nGrowing people are looking at some of those other issues that impact them on a daily basis traffic untold up in northern Virginia and as you say the potholes in and in more rural areas of the country those are things that people are focusing on now", "show_name": "Mark Levin Show", "year": "2018", "city": "Portsmouth", "day": "21"}
