near that so we got his finger on the pulse no doubt guys have you with us we've got to get to the Redskins and the caps in this segment you what I've\nGot to start with Virginia there's three seats here play ah\nIf the Democrats went on free many people think that will be there's three seats that are close well I've got three maybe you've got others that you can certainly uh bring them up without even claimed the fiber complex competitive\nYes Barbara Comstock which than in the tent or Scottsdale are being challenged by a Elaine laureate and the second an\nIncumbent congressman Dave Brat go against several Abigail Spanberger in the seventh so let's start with a tent that's on everybody's mind ... complex but that was that the debate in ... county and uh Jennifer ... was horrific I mean she was just\nAbsolutely dreadful who did or debate prep\nIf you try to be fair in a debate if if I dressed up as her and did that debate in my goal was to be horrible she did worse than I

she's reading from a script because he's trying not to screw up the fact that she's going to end by double digits um ... fleet is capable of of doing more um than um\nThan that um you know she's been a state senator so I'm Talking on policy side um says she's not without chops right but now at this point in this rates she's being told readers script don't mess up that's what happened in that debate I don't disagree with you that like you know\nThese bushy little plane at the debate yes did she make any major errors no and that's why Barbara Comstock so upset about the debate that you know wants to talk about oh she did so poorly Barbara's ... Jennifer didn't make any errors that allows barber to get back in the next\nEight eight landslide it's been a landslide the tenth district\nHas every single demographic group that is breaking against Trump in this country over represented in it if the Democrats do not take the tent the Republicans will hold Congress at that I agree with I don't think yeah it it's now and and right now that's not in the realm of possibility\nBut the Republican polling is telling me that she's tired or slightly ahead\nBarbara is going to lose by double digits Tom or do you do that just she's over perform for pulling Everytime her whole career issues that were going\nOn here here's the problem is in bend is every demographic group or the Republicans were losing market share right now are collected in for federal employees a high income educated voters that gun now she's a woman and she talked\nTo the difficulty to have the Republicans took away the one weapon Frank Wolf and I had to survive up your nose you're more [noise]\nI was not Tom Davis I was Mr I'm\nClose to the word in prison Mr Woodrow Wilson bridge was derailed the dollars\n... Barbara gets none of that uh because the Republicans get away with their constitutional obligation uh on on the road you know to to designate projects so this makes it even more difficult\nShe's with held a lot of her fire\nInto the closing weeks on a jet for in terms of their operate search I'm not going to tell you what it is so I think this race quoting suicide scene races close a lot more at this point but this is this is a tough race so it's a tough atmosphere and as they tough districts in remembrance\nTribute than what was the Saudi thing you said again just as she wants to make the ... [laughter]\nI go to ... I got to treat that out at eight thirty aren't where with a trivia Tom Davis ... Peterson and your guts I Love the truth you John just rhetoric let's get to the other races let's get to the seven I just had Barbara I just started Abigail Spanberger on my show\nYesterday in the very top of the candidate no doubt but ah I see little momentum going for Dave I didn't think he was gonna win and we should go that way I think he is going to win a Ben how do you see that race [noise]\nSo I I had that one a slightly new Republican up until the Kavanaugh hearings at this point I think it's a toss up um because what the Kavanaugh hearings dead was really re energized and fire up the one voter block\nThat's the problem for Dave Brat in some district which is suburban women\nUm and I think that the seven districts historically Republican should be Republican voter Republican ... I'm Still lichen last year but I'm the one path for a Democrat there isn't an right to in Chesterfield with the suburban women\nUm and I think Abigail's at the match for them\nAnd I think that the Republicans are doing everything they can to lose that block naturally right now um and so I have it as a tough one\nThink been drinking Kool Aid on this Kavanaugh's nomination in terms of I mean I can turn let me just say yeah in in terms of what this was during politically and I think we all live in our own echo chambers and we all have our own perceptions of how it's done but what this is done in the nearest polling and some other pulling down the street this is the Republican base is now\nActivated enthusiasm gap which is favored the Democrats for the last year and a half is now closed substantially and I think that works to proxy for ... they bred has two two issues though outside the demographics district in the DNA that district is Republican\nNumber one he is not close the deal with some of cancers people and they were just as soon thrown under the bus to rent that she'd out for two years\nAnd bring back you know somebody it's more in line with their thinking and and even some scores and secondly Tim Kaine is going to be exceptionally strong in that district he was mayor of Richmond if he has a political he's widely ...\nMark ... that that the I think that's right this this ... democratic turnout there so you got a factor that into this thing I still think at the end of the day that the DNA of that district establishes a cell phone and bright wins but the but this is a close race in Democrats have nominated ...\nShe's very and whatever happens you're talking about uh somebody that's got to be involved in democratic politics for some time I think I think Abigail Spanberger is going to happen is going to be somebody that has got to be reckoned with a in a democratic circles for some time Jeff\nDot die you know I don't I don't know a ton about the district or I Will say I was driving down the south side Virginia to go to an event last weekend and going through some of the rural counties and it seems like if Brad can pull margin gotta those counties [noise] uh but obviously the critical mass of the the district is in Chesterfield man right go so\nYou know I I Would probably say you know robotically it's a Republican district but obviously if it's a wave here than it could be one that the Democrats deal would after defended twenty twenty\nOr let's get to the second district Taylor Maria whatever happened with a sale or the other day I had him on my radio show or the uh ... campaign put my [noise] my name and their team TV ads so I appreciate the PR for that what's going on in\nThat race but this is my first chance to respond to Scott right after he had his meltdown on your show on that went viral yet I'm Upset about our analysis last time I'm announcers has not changed he's still going to lose [noise] um and\nUm I don't think I don't believe in New York Times poll I think it was you know I I ... up to this point I thought the nutritional are pretty good I think the last week they've they've not been\nUm I think there's some noise going on\nUm but I think what is going to win and she's going to win going away um so I think she's gonna win going away I think it's going to be a [noise] a ... up until two months ago I was doing everything like um and he's really blown it\nAnd he's not going to win reelection and so are you saying because of the whole the valid issues signatures issue in the way he's handled it and remember that this district is one of the few in the country\nThat not only sits in the ... side a media market\nBut is in a media market that doesn't really stretch too many other districts\nSo the media has been all over the years on the evening news every night you know it Barbara Comstock at a petition scandal and attempt district it would have made D.C TV for forty five seconds one night or maybe a week later they quickly re mentioned that you know 'cause you you cannot get away\nWith something like the tide water it's been on Hampton Roads here so let me let me look I think a New York times for property right take it or is fixed that district very well\nOr you know the navy seal all kinds of stuff is the issue matrix and he's chosen I think you're in line with that district to use non a far right kind of guy he understands a suburban Virginia Beach in those areas so we have all that going for him\nVery good chance and you have a year that favors Democrats ... ... what ... is a Republican what scares me about this is the fact that if you look nationally Democrats just a ton of cash\nAnd drop in a couple of million dollars on that race in the last week that megaphone just can overwhelm at this point in exaggerate these things and I think I think there are times pulls correct hunting tears up today a again if are betting I I I think he wins\nBut in this environment with a kind of money Democrats put down a you've got to be nervous about this you're going to watch this on election night if the Democrats win this seat\nIt tells me it's going to be a pretty good year for farm in terms of we're talking thirty five forty yeah either because the thing about [noise]\nThat are the thing about this district is different than Comstock and it's definitely different than a brat is the turnout model is totally different and I think it's hard for Democrats to win the seat in a non presidential year\nI just based on who vote democratic and Virginia Beach Norfolk it's you know the the typical democratic voters will be a minority down there and in less you get an outsized performance it's not I think it's tough for the Democrats to win that seat I mean Glenn Nye one or two thousand eighty got flushed down the drain and twenty ten\nAnd the reason was democratic book came out in the presidential year for Brock Obama it wasn't there the next cycle for Glenn Nye 'cause nobody knew Glen I was [noise] um I think God's got advantages that the turnout I remember back when I was in the house carcass we'd look at the turnout bottles and the numbers and [noise]\nYou know Virginia Beach in Norfolk the numbers are just forty percent of what they are in other parts of the state so it's just a it's it's you got a lot of people that live there that are you know enlisted men or women that are registered to vote elsewhere\nSo it's just it's hard you know to have to break people out in that type of environment even though it's bench correct your what media market and you know they could possible Scott from now till the end of the time but there's going to be a conservative there's going to be a conservative votes is going to come out\nAnd whether I'm I'm Maria I don't know how to pronounce it Luria whether or not she can get people out based on her name as opposed to you know Tim Kaine is not as big a magnet there as he is enrichment um\nSo I I still think it's a pill for the Democrats even though I agree it looks like Scott's kind of watch this one issue\nNineteen Ninety six and tell me this one number this well I'm ... we had a we had a scandal um state wide where John want to put a television ad up against Mark Warner who is someone who was far ahead and um he photo shop Mark Warner enjoy a picture\nOr who's in the ... I Can't remember who we thought or somebody thought it was up at Clinton I think yeah you socialize with Clinton but was it was while her eyes ... there was a racial aspect to it too I Can't remember what they did but they could have shut Mark Warner into a picture he wasn't in\nAnd I'm ... TV ad and it was a huge went national scandal for John Boehner who had a moderate brand and was a guy that you know everyone looked she likes what you're trying to say Scott Taylor is\nThere like had a friend okay and and and that people you know like respected John Warner much higher than Scott Taylor them and and his numbers collapsed\nAnd he said on the needy person and and the captain of my ship and I'm responsible for what happened and I apologize and it's got Taylor had done that he would want to\nGo I was I was worse campaign chairman that year and it was a it was a close race Merck worse than fourteen million dollars at his own money that year that may just really a much closer race than it might have been other was concerned when it was beautiful unbeatable and then of course we'll put more on the map and you kind of earned it after running a close race there but I remember it out of everybody fired\nThe people that were involved in the ad and everything else and you broke it and it it was an issue for a week or two and then John took accountability you took accountability [noise] said or has mishandled this thing I think it's just kind of structure in having his people take the Fifth Amendment doesn't help it just keeps it in the news\nIs that enough to bring down somebody with a good reputation just done a good job in their first term or not\nUm and also I think the the we've turned out they took about a ... I think you're really talking about ... that's really what's happening with the Democrats is that the suburban female voters have swung radically or to the Democratic party and that's all right we're going to take up we'll get our predictions ruin your\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI'm not talking about you know going to try to bolster the Democratic but on the Democratic doors\nThat those people are telling her they're worth it\nAnd when they're on occasion they've asked what's the main complaint or if and this is for Kavanaugh 'cause I talk to anybody since then [noise] uh it was the n._r._a. [noise] those ads have been effective but this capping off thing\nI mean that's all you know of door to door and that's all I get\nThat far back for shots gotta go we've we've we've got to get to the rest [noise] yup we've got to get the big game Monday Night ride Carolina right let's just start with where the earliest [noise] right you have to be happy so far\nYeah generally happy I think the defence like I said a month ago yawn with fast a [noise] good and and they're going to get better I think their defense will get better [noise] um I I think they need to give a couple of guys more snaps a couple of guys less naps but\nBy and large I liked their defense to be a top ten defense us year in for the next few years going forward to make the playoffs\nAnd I think they do they have one issue they need to solve and I can solve it if they listen to me\nThey all week on the ends they don't have any big play receivers that could go down catch the ball you know catch eight balls for a hundred yards and you need to have that too when consistently in the NFL you can't just keep throwing your tied into your backs especially with a\nTight I'd like Jordan read the genetically going to get insurance is something that\nDoes is on the street [noise] he's bet on the street I in you know Bruce as my from Brazil I emailed him literally within twelve hours with him being cut by Dallas begging begging them to pick up desk I have repeated it every time I said um [noise]\nThe day he sets his foot on Redskins park you'll be the number one receiver they could get rid of Josh dachshund yes I said it they could keep Jamison in crowd around the slapstick and you get that keep that keep records and that there are number two receivers fast\nBut then you need a big receiver who can pull down eight nine temples again for a hundred yards desk and do it and so if they put him on the team they will be the best in the NFC East and will make the playoffs way\nDallas like losing um I think it's [laughter] I Know they don't like to when they like to lose a lot of you know why do they do what they did why do they keep Jason gear to head coach you know I mean\nWhy did I get rid of Tony Romo and ah it's just I I think somewhere Jerry Jones just decided he was tired of winning the waters start losing for a while and so that's that's why does what he does that what\nYou're saying I mean is that the answers that dependency\nYeah I I'm I'm they were going down and I can't believe we're talking about the Redskins are not referring to them is the first place\nYeah that's true birthplace of a different place type that's right\nI I'm going to say at this point a lot better than I thought there'd be this year still very very tough scheduling next week I'm going to say nine and seven and that may be enough to make the playoffs\nI'm not instead I'm actually kind of one of those things it's always hurt for\nOver ... you're going to the game since Ninety four\nAnd one of the things that the red skins of lack for some time there's a speed demon and I can't remember the last time I'm sure I probably missed something but I cannot remember the last time I've seen the Redskins a Redskin return upon her kickoff touchdown\nAnd a while and it's been a long time and I remember one of the hallmarks of a boom party was that he always had pets he called it more burner\nWhether it was you know on your nerves whoever I mean it was he always had at least one burned and we don't have that and uh it it shows\nHow many how many ... they're going to get back and Tom I got the last one I Know benefit from five for now\nAnd [noise] they threw it to happen again [noise] maybe three a month [noise] ...\nAh they beat New Orleans at the superdome and on the way to an eleven and five seasons are sitting on [noise]\nAll right I'm going to go in the middle I think they're going to win ... games I think the play offs and here's your here's the thing about Alex [noise] I'm not a fan of it because you can't win the game in the playoffs and so we got an exciting quarterback but ah you know I've watched them now three weeks I'm not a fan one way or the other but they're on TV [noise]\nBut I may be managed games and he's never going to be you can never going to be himself and\nI could see one thing I can see quite a Allen got\nHim I mean he does he kinda fits what they're\nThe whole group of philosophy is now that I don't know when games [noise] and I think that I think that seems kind of winter games are they could get in the playoffs will be dangerous [noise]\nI got I got a sign off I got to be in court today okay thank you for sharing your events I guess we're going to let me quickly add the unemployment down to three point seven percent the lowest since Nineteen sixty nine lord since Nineteen uh uh [noise]\nWhich you know I can certainly do not get a raise ... can I comment on this really quickly John [noise] this is it's an amazing stat but not for the reason the Republicans wanted you to be in making that because people say nothing sticks on Trump\nAnd I think it's the opposite I think everything's to control\nThe fact that you have an economy that's as good as it is and he's having a going to have a bad of an election that he's going to have everything is sticking to him because you should have with the economy [noise] one of the first time for the president picks up see if it was an economy election [noise]\nUm the Republicans could actually be gaining ground\nFor months and the biggest gains in the high income areas are the ones turning against in the fastest so for people to say nothing sticks to Trump everything into trying [noise]\nWell I think he get credit for the economy and I think [noise] I think he gets credit for the economy and I think that mitigate against the law says they take just because of the ... the cycle but these coalitions are basically cultural coalition if they're not economic coalitions and\nAs I said the Democratic enthusiasm in the independents wanting to balance the government is really what hurts the Republican [noise]\nPeople don't trust the Republicans have the ... and you want some kind of check on Trump be he's doing okay they may vote for him in two years\nBut in the mid term they want to put a check on [noise] I I Will say this I think the Democrats take the house is I think it's more likely than not\nAh I I don't know how they don't impeach the president when it comes down to you got to the Democratic base right now it's rapid they want to impeach him now before motors a commission and when you [noise] I I don't know how Democrats going back to their primary in twenty twenty\nCan't not to impeach Trump\nI I just think that happens in rent for tonight is not the kind of on the issue of whether they have any any reasonable evidence or not because you're like a ... a lot of them think they have reasonable evidence now I don't know what more is going to stay out of it you know what are you going to say um but I just think you look at the base and you look at the fact that the primary elections or what most of these members worry about\nThat it's politics are girls going to do it I'm not arguing where the shutting down to earth and takes on Capitol Hill yeah\nWell I think what happens is it changes the dynamic for twenty Nineteen it was one thing and twenty Seventeen Trump's in Republican control everything to put a check on him\nOnce the Democrats come in Congress like our class of Republicans in Nineteen Ninety four it kind of their lives you know it's the under Clinton he played off against the Republican ... he actually did better than they would do it yeah and I have some of that dynamic in twenty Nineteen

that's the\nYeah they didn't say something to sexual assault which is entirely different issue and you got to put yourself in the context of the time and the place and back then in the Nineteen eighties wasn't some people can't afford it don't they don't come for nearly as much today about it and they showed that they back then when I was in high school and I kind of thing people in\n... you didn't hear about him I brought out you know look I she but extremely credible yeah very emotional ...\nAnd and I do think that's I think that taking that extra week going back in interviewing somebody that people mark judge and others around it I think it was with the right thing I think slam dunk in the spring or the day after or would have been terrible politics and would have been terrible on the institution\nHaving said that nobody else can remember the party was there ... there's just too many holes to really make the case that doesn't mean she's wrong [noise] but but that's

act where we weren't amazing to me how fast the world's\nMansions blast over mentioned I think had him up Fifteen\nI Want to say now that he's up by fire saying oh boy left I saw a poll last week that I'm a Fifteen that's that's all the polls you read when they're asking you to do not like I knew he certainly is not a question about you\nBut you know under fifty he's well under well under shift and I and I think what you got to remember this is if you don't know an independent consultant strict I think this is for him this this changes the outcome I think it's right yeah I I Can't\nI ... and I'm not an expert on West Virginia but it seems meet Joe Manchin told position that I'm an independent God I'm not beholden to either side and uh\nI think it would be hard for him to get reelected there were seemed to me in it what what a Trump when the state by like fifty points something like that\nAnd I'm not on also not convinced and Susan Collins is going to run again either and that's that that that I think it's all I'm not either but she's she's never voted against\nThe Supreme Court judge ever you have a group in the state that could a million dollars up ... votes against million Spanish\nYeah okay now up to a million and a half ago find me but it didn't look like a bribe I'm I mean I think at the end of the day without corroboration she's going to be there for for for which she I agree with you not only twenty twenty twenty is she going to run again to make that decision the appropriate time [noise]\nI I think I think time now that I think she's going to vote yes on the one that I have no read on the top David is I'm Lisa Murkowski of\nAlaska what about what about you [noise]\nPretty independent I mean just remember this when she lost that primary to Joe Miller she lost the Republican primary right she run as a write in with the name Murkowski now where you get started\nAnd ended up and also as you want to laugh but you know make the part about the independents pieces when guys like mentioned when it's because they claim they're they're reelect in terms of looking out for their state right mhm and Murkowski has a big issue with the cabin opinion about Alaskan natives I think was something that you know like when she ...\nShe she she does on on that issue so no I it's not clear cut I haven't seen the polling in Alaska or they but they I think if you get ... like I think you're going to get flaky booed him out of committee so I think without some crap rations that Jeff Jeff is fundamentally\nVery concerned right you've got a big water Institute He's also very independent and I think\nA very principled guy which is why people think he's flaky because he doesn't always taken one boxing isn't always predictable\nBut misjudged if you've got to understand for Republicans this unites us this this is a very important role in the court\nAs it is on the Democrats on the other side of it [noise] wanting somebody else\nCan I ask you a question of has a a vice president were broken a tie on a Supreme Court nominee chocolate knocking on where yeah I think that would be unprecedented weather [noise]\nBut that can and that will challenge that\nBut it still counts how do you know that just hear the competition just as inviting can set and there's got to be no they already are you surprised when he votes but he's not a number\nI can tell you the ... states that are it's not ...\nAlready a lawsuit challenging the whole procedure with other Democrats\nIf he's confirmed that they're going to do and they take over the house or the Senate to move to impeach that would\nBe a disaster two thirds of the Senate good luck [noise]\nYes I just I I think you're going to get on your arms and\nOf elections have consequences that's when I take away but here's ... let's get some Republicans have been stealing Supreme Court [noise] well I I mean all of them were involved Trump one here's the problem I still can't get over the fact that Trump won two years later you still can't get over got let me bring my where\nAm I married Garland well let me let me talk about America I think might bite every indication is a very honorable straightforward with a bit of good Supreme Court judge in in the traditional sense with these balance it's not completely a liberal democratic operative before he wanted to win bench but but met the criteria for free judge\nBut what is better not holding a hearing on are doing what they've done in this case and that is bringing is putting the sham of of hearing him and then finding a way to trashes reputation and voting no they weren't there to confirm middle election year Republican senators were getting from school you seat and putting on a more liberal members just wasn't going to happen\nIn a presidential politics here not a mid ...\nWho who who knows what the rules are writing about it but the president it's the president United States who nominate somebody for them to frame court out the set of dirt my rights that threat therefore I think McConnell's argument is set out when he says look a that was the presidential election year voters decided that step but I'm just saying\nThey they stretch it each time I don't know who started his but it keeps getting worse and worse and worse\nAnd once you do it for one year you could do two years you could do it three years I I don't know ... guard rails on this I think it was they moved it from sixty votes to fifty votes for everything but the Supreme Court of course they're going to do it for the Supreme Court has made there are new guard rails anymore and this and that's what's scary\nAnd I got an iguana sexier from a DJ Republican operative in Virginia Beach if there is such a thing did you Joe mansion is only apply for\nIn the latest Fox

Peterson is with us we're at jeopardy this world headquarters here in\nCity and Scott serve el state senator from northern Virginia Democrat and part of democratic leadership I'm\nNot part of the\n... on a fairly but there isn't room for saying\nThat if you challenged if you if you\nOut here either addicts or waiting on him I don't I don't think he's seen a seven and a while\nReal clear politics average one man's right now is nine points for well that's a far cry from Fifteen here's one floods well temper Thirteen or Fifteen minutes and plus when I was\nI mean like the answer here has been consistently had our days when I said I'll give you I'll give you that and I think but I think a no vote\nHere changes of that dynamic there was a poll earlier before all this controversy or that showed that if he voted against it all took me numbers change on\nThis is a ... I don't dispute the fact that the numbers would change [noise] um but from from my perspective I think Kavanaugh confirmation to is probably in terms of democratic enthusiasm probably five to ten sheets maybe a Senate seat or two I mean well I think it helps in the house and her two because then it's\nA very red territory North Dakota uh Missouri I mean these are pretty solid state West Virginia in the Senate races Kavanaugh thinking soccer public\nOr wherever we're where we're at a time for government finally our news but one thing I think Tom now that this is the only thing I've seen in the sense Trump announced that has unified Republican I've never seen anything like this we couldn't figure out how to\nI said Fifteen I was it was twelve point for when I went back and actually look at the\nCabinet discussion yes you want to go ahead and what do you go ahead and that one but then we got to get the fuck for football hockey but God go ahead\nOh ... I'm ... last night among the winner and the Senate Judiciary committee the official account of the Senate Judiciary committee is tweeting about Democrats do not understand the definition of pumping\nThat would be a Senate Judiciary account the thing is so off the rails and and and I feel like [noise]\nYou know people were completely missing the point with all this process crap you know the reason the judiciary committee's tweeting is that the Democrats have the definition rung up against our process and none of it is actually on where people are on it and where voters are on on this is Kevin ... only has the support of the conservative base\nAnd the message that women are getting around the country is that you know people are OK with sexual assault\nNo I think that's that is that we sent the message they're getting is\nYou're now a pronounced wrongdoing or joining it it'll it'll image that they're talking about the story I mean this is the same democratic\nParty that defended Bill Clinton better tactics accusers who am I right especially the one that got raped well\nFirst of all first of all I was I was in the ... the allegation\nOf rape against Bill Clinton\nRemember that woman came out a week after on national television that whole process we've got so when you say the Democratic party rallied around him whatever that allegation wasn't even out there at the time I Will say second thing is fear\nThat was why he lied you say\nYou're talking about ... Jones is different than ... then that was not rape I threw me oh Joe's was actual ... cannot\nAfter that was ever catch one interview as a week after the centered in the Senate but then you have the sequence Kevin really was the same time it's Paula Jones or that you're thinking about\nThe I'm sure when you need a bridesmaid abroad when I first when I was in the first thing you were not retaliation but anyway the point [laughter]\nThe message that women are getting around the country is that this is okay and Republicans are now into a debate about the definition of ... I mean they have a trend and doubled struggle I mean it is a is this is on the official district ... look everybody knows what Butina art or not but you have to first of all I don't know what I'm\nHoping this Butina inserting drugs in your in us instead of taking them down your throat because your\nBody will process it faster than Iraq in ... during the eighties or that everyone\nKnows what that means I Know what are they going to be a very\nVery interesting about my very innocent crowded here that has no idea what that word me I Do not and then and then you know kept on going to go on national television taking notes and be like oh it's a party joke I mean this is so ridiculous and absurd wasn't embarrassing nominee that's out\nWhere the barest the process a Democrat and let me earlier that you're just you're banned the world you guys are talking about polling going on here and wait for\nA polling on this very [noise] with the ... this is not overwhelming pulling against capital this is right down the middle of the point\nIn which is the worst in history but we can Supreme Court justice or never done that or what we were down the matter because they were just talking about the electoral repercussions we're doing is you're kicked the hornet's nest\nRepublican base that was kind of depressed at this point in what you've seen now in in terms of the energy brings to both parties the enthusiasm gap it's close and that's going to cost Democrats a couple of nights\nAt least I mean I get when you look nobody wants to have a company that are doing sexual has a sexual assault and often we want people to come up bringing Keith Ellison is okay you have public because it's almost like a thousand or\nOr the guy who was the guy the ravens beat up his girlfriend in ... by the hair and they they pay them more money just\nFor for whatever it's worth I mean I I totally concur on email and I just had that publicly I campaigned for his opponent you know on line when he got into the primary for attorney general I said this is not right the way he's doing it um\nAnd shoes and should be that's the end and it not you've been markets meaning in general but it is it ... it is bad because a lot of people will look the other way 'cause any should not be the number two person on the Democratic\nNational Committee right but this is the Supreme Court and you have a guy who not only has a credit\nFred oval accuser but she has new corroborate that she would understand a lot of your cooperation what's your corroborate her claim the contemporaneous his\nHe's at the people she said was present at the party he turned over his calendars from the same month and at the same people are listed on his calendar and ... and being like a social event but at parties\nAnd she didn't go to a school so she wouldn't even know those people and that was all his calendars were released after she made now again\nNone of them you know leaving her best friend can remember this like ... but that's not robbery you know what but you know in in\nA ton of your parents I mean I Am I'm equally my twenty at high school reunion in next month it's been a long time or not and I'm the youngest person here\nIf I was in a social function in high school and no one told me that a a a vent traumatic event for someone else had occurred I Would have not remember at the event the next week let alone Twenty years later he came to me now and said oh were you at this pretty ... I don't know if I was at that party or an ...\nProduced counter of what he was doing that number and nobody can pinpoint nobody can pinpoint where in the in the party was where was who invited her how she got there how she got home you got to have something outside of memory\nWhich you credible witness absolutely but I've seen credible witness was before going wrong memory skip over Thirty years I don't remember a lot of the next three years ago or or I remember them differently than they were in his corrected\nLook I don't know who's telling the truth here but I think the mere allegation enough if that's now the standard that take somebody down a I think we wanted\nTo I don't think this is now in each I mean I I I think now because I think that when you look at you know um people have put a lot of holes in the story of the the third accuser um and I think that you know you obviously have to hear both sides of you know when an accuser comes forward up their credibility\nThis this accuser everything she has said you can cooperate with what she had done with how she has lived her life\nWhich are the notes from her therapy sessions\nBut we're working on that what it is accurate long I Know they're not only in the notes from earth are you ready to get them to the end she offered enough yet when the interviewer\nShe wanted to give them the committee given the fact that I mean I\nI appreciate your passion and you know I'm your friend and I love you to death but what'd you just said it off I mean she said she couldn't fly and then we find out she dumped it to me and my were fliers she's calling all over the world and within our hope with the pinch a month ago she around so\nThey they said she could be in a place where the one door that was back in the person that they are and the parents are ... percent any by the door she lives in tiny apartment one door that was fought she said a\nLie detector test I never did that I don't know anything about it that her former person that David ... said no she actually got paid to help people through lie detector test\nWhat about you can sit there and say everything that's Dennis ... I don't even know what's true anymore\nYeah that's harsh on the line I I\nDon't even know I think her testimony was a compelling testament but I Will give you that everybody could watch that but I thought he was too and that's my reputation for being trashed I'd be a little emotional ... as as well what happens\nNow everybody's back in the corners and it's a very divided country what it is done indigenous equalize the enthusiasm gap which was in the Democrats' favor prior to this I represent and and that is the politics of this we can argue forever there's got to be a good judge in history will tell that\nYou're not a ... that this was a certain this was a circus I think it's diminished that broke the institution of the Senate and the and the ... the clown show and I just sort of it's a good one at least they took a week to go back in the interview some of these other people in close that the ... it's never going to be enough if you come back and you don't take this guy out for the Democrats\nAnd on same on the Republican side so we'll have a vote tomorrow I think it passes in in ... and you move on\n'em and we'll go to an election that ... says he doesn't ... probably be the best result for the Republicans are going to know\nMore intense I agree I think that the enthusiasm gap um I don't think it's now it as much as the Republicans are claiming that has I think that there was some ... pull on and it's not they're not you know in our internal polling sure as you as you know like you know pulling motion noise and while this is going on there was at and and the reality is rougher\nAnd the and the reality is that if you are correct that he's going to get confirmed\nThat there's not going to be a Republican boost from this and the election in fact it will be the opposite it's going to add to the comic um\nMy ... the Democratic contest and he was already at an eleven\nI mean I I don't think that's true and in fact I\nThink that the Democratic intensity and she doesn't Seventeen ... you know you look at Virginia it was only in pockets of neighborhoods there were places where it was an eleven um upper income white neighborhoods were off the charts for Democrats but like the minority\nCommunities which have always been a historic democratic base have not been it we're not engage them twenty Seventeen election in the same extent and they hadn't been engaged in twenty eight teams that I I agree with that I don't and they still aren't", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Mark Levin Show", "city": "Portsmouth", "day": "06"}
