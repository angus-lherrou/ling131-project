victory for congressman Dave Brat over spanberger in that debate I'd really no idea what spanberger was doing other than trying to write some when even to Congress by saying nothing\nAnd either that or she doesn't have anything to say but it was almost like yeah Dave I'm kind of for that but not a hundred percent for that I'm not really sure what I really couldn't figure anything out other than

last night congressman what are some of the things that stood out for a for you in last night's debate\nYou know I I just think that contrast between you know even result that resistance and she put you know thirty TDY\nOr you can memorize millions and millions of dollars choir there was meant to advance people are [noise] and all that\nBut when you hear on the stage for our try and\nWe try to show that I mean she\nFound a record and people can go look it up and I hope everybody goes in watching\nThe debate by the year the voters go wash her face I Want you can because I think it was very stark and so we just went through the issue by issue by issue on the economic\nThe economy is booming she had to say it's not building and so you've got to make up your mind right twenty five hundred dollars back in your pocket and she wants to take that twenty five hundred and send it back up to a seat on immigration she's on the record plant\nA reporter was fired for probably doing news stories

and she's trying to run a car wreck in her positions\nAt the Democrat positions are all their their her position on right same the same as on the website it on our own website and so while it's

I watched the debate she didn't really put together a\nConnector coherent message and it's a lot of soundbites and you know she's in a very as I said she's a walking a tightrope here is the seat than any Republican leaning district that went against last year's two thousand Seventeen\nDemographic Democrat crap in Virginia blue wave of all time oh it's still went for the last three by three Davis got enough money to be competitive she's races\nAble to spend their money on whatever they need they have a ton of money and that's an advantage is not the uh\nIt's it's not the um the final answer\n\nBut when you've got a cornucopia of resources at your disposal and the last Twenty one days in a campaign and you you got a lot of options so she has a lot of options but it seemed like she was playing last night's debate not to lose like don't say anything dumb or just ride the wave\nAnd she was okay you know um but she's going more on hey I'm a CIA person I've served my country I'm a mom I'm great I'm smart I'm cool and\nA little lighter on the issues I mean there's all all about the issues and I think you know when you have this kind of an economy that you're back he's got the advantage\nSo I'm only ... doing anything to help herself last night but I don't think she's anything to hurt herself\nSo I think if you went into this debate and you are not going to vote for the Republican candidate you are not going to vote for days I think you came out of it and you're not going to vote for him so I don't think like Dave changed any minds of his anti\nUh of the the the blue waivers and the liberal moms have Chesterfield and all that stuff I don't think you changed anything [noise] and I don't think Abigail hurt herself with her based\nNow\nA here's where I thought they did very very well anybody wavering like if you could really make a decision if you're a true independent and had an open mind last night uh\nSpanberger did nothing to get your vote\n\nSo again she she had just counting on the two nominees sweeping or into power\nIf you're an independent or a moderate Republican or a moderate Democrat and your truly had major mind up\nAnd you saw this debate or you are more likely to vote for Dave after it then when it started you are not more likely to vote for spanberger that's we have to look at debates or you're more likely ended either\nEither neither candidate did anything to depressed airbase both candidates I mean I didn't date fired his up a little bit more Abigail's got a different style she's a little more long winded she doesn't have\nA quick retort the tape has so her communication style is different not worse or better just different and doesn't really up against brat or\nHe just ... it it gives him an advantage because of spanned burgers more low key more ... communication style\n\nAll of these things were playing into Dave's favor last night and I asked the question point blank why don't you have other debates I mean I I for the life of me after last night's debate I Would think that they would call her up and say look we're scheduled debate every three days I mean ... I don't care what the venue with me and I'll go out\nYou know consultant joined control these campaigns and they have their own way of doing things but hopefully there'll be other debates and\nYou know he said something about somebody got fired and so they couldn't have this other debate but I didn't get fired and I still don't have a day and I can tell you for the radio debate that I proposed that both camps agreed to hold up a notch wherever the spanberger camp is basically given a bunch of dates for this\nAnd the hold up is the bride campaign so let's just get that out there\nAnd I don't think I don't see how we're going to have it now because it's what October sixteenth I mean we got three weeks Twenty one days but I'll keep following up and we'll see what happens Cortland desk coming up eight thirty five years right here [noise]\n\nThey all want to read through and [noise] we change\nThat've been systematically undermining President Trump's America First agenda so November twenty second in DC all hell breaks loose\nQuarterly went down the great to have your man\nJohn watched as I get on the Senate races [noise] without revealing any information that is a public I think your your presents on on the Republicans are going to pick up seats in the U.S Senate seat\nHowever race you know people talk about this like this is going to be a close election Tina how it's going to win that rate of five or five points it's not just some people think [noise] I think we're going to hold Arizona\nAnd John I'm going to sleep for some of the country right now nobody's talking about we got a credible\nCandidate running for Senate Michigan it's closer to his cabinet right now John James anybody predicted she now he's in American small business owner and even then it's going to win that Senate Michigan you mark my words\nSo you think that John James in Michigan has actually his job to be standing about\nI don't think so about two months ago\nBut the the more I learned about in the end of the campaign and storing can't complete ten\nOf what America should be plenty of their family stood up in Detroit and work and now he wants family business three times\n[noise] right [noise]\nWell I tell you what that is a nobody's radar screen Corey let's go over these races because I'm predicting right now that\nThe Republicans are going to pick up five or six seats everybody says I'm Crazy I've been saying this for some time\nOr the tendency race Blackburn bread and saying I'm Marcia pulling way ahead now in that race she is going to win that's going to be a whole remember tendency Corey Lewandowski was was one of those seats that the Republicans were that the Democrats were ... about that they thought they could pick up\nThat is now not gonna happen Blackburn way way ahead what do you see there\n[noise] [noise] [noise] that's the Democrat [laughter] term Democrat from Tennessee [noise] Marshall walking away\nRight she's up late ten now so that's gonna be uh that that's that's that's\nThat's going to be a whole no question or let's get to and we we both believe that the Republicans are going to hold a Arizona with mixed valley I don't even think that's going to be close or when it's all said and done and I think we're gonna we're gonna window bought him as I've been saying\nFor some some time All right let's get to Montana Jon Tester are being challenged by Matt Rosendale or re public the real clear politics has this about two or three within the margin of error I'm predicting Rosendale when what do you see they're\nPulling [noise] two point four presidents don't go down this way\nTo do a campaign rally in you know the presence on the west coast when he's going to [noise] Arizona and Montana to put exclamation point on that Jon Tester become former U.S senator from Montana and looking at the new Republican pickup in Montana three weeks from\nJosh Hawley are probably the biggest surprise for Republicans some people not sure that he was going to be the best candidate use turn out to be a very good candidate remember Claire McCaskill\nWho won in a two thousand two well she beat Todd Akin whose campaign them at the end of the totem pole ocean or she is now trailing to only in a in the door\n[laughter] [noise] I don't want to change over that will never raise twenty five million dollars of money but it's on John [noise] something [noise] [noise] [noise]\nNow I Want to get to Florida Corey where with Cortland asking are we doing these predictions all the time obviously the majority of them here and he and I are spot on we probably have our own uh five thirty eight types of society because whenever wrong on this stuff in\nAnd with a small lead we don't know what the hurricane impact is but this governor of Florida it's been struggling with these hurricanes I mean he's got a rapid response team the get power on very quickly\nUm so we'll see how this plays out that the devastating hurricane in Panama City but I thought from the beginning Scott what's going to win this right\nYou know the same thing you know put up much stronger and I thought he was going to find now three weeks ago Rick Scott won four or five points and he'd be starting to pull this racist talking you know you can't estimate the\nPeople's focus away rightly so from the lectures but that being said you've got to accept it really well known individuals who both statewide experience\nI have seen from bill in front of the people of Florida and so this becomes battling Rick Scott is out\nBut if you would have told me what three weeks ago Rick Scott would have been down one or two points in the public polls I Would have said no to that goes to tell you the campaign that both Rick Scott is trying to run\nAnd now they're fighting for because he wants to return to the U.S [noise] All right\nI I thought that this race would always be tied up until the end I think I think Scott ... when he's been a very popular governor\nAnd so I think he's he's got the there in the great state of North Dakota Heidi Heitkamp down ten or Thirteen I think that's over\nThat race is over Congress and Kramer would be calling senator Kramer very soon\nOkay so that that gets us to\nIndiana Joe Donnelly are still clinging to a slight lead over a Mike Braun um I just don't see Indiana's returning Joe Donnelly in this climate that we have with the economy going so well I'm predicting that are Donnelly go Saddam Mike Braun win that seat once they are you\nI agree with you John look this is the vice president's home state he was out campaigning there this weekend it was this Friday and Saturday or as you know\nHis brother is on the ballot in Indiana [noise] is doing so helping like brown for that Senate race this focus on the streets and because of the fight for his home state the administration knows or they can be Donald nasty\nAnd so I think you're seeing brown come in two weeks and starting to open up his lead over the Joe Donnelly\nOkay so let's get the New Jersey I Know a couple about a month ago you said that might come into play I don't see it ... up by ten Fifteen or he's going to you\nKnow I saw some internal numbers just don't want to reveal but I'll tell you what if I was on my cell phone numbers and I guess I'd be scared to death you've got this Republican he's putting his own money into this race is giving a scare\nTo buy the resources the Democrats have to put into their site it's called the charm resources away from elsewhere and I'm not convinced that short winter it's fortified race right now it's causing quickly\nSo um I don't think he's going to win so we can just click on that only because I'm from New Jersey and I just can't see the ... but let me ask you this in West Virginia I'm I'm I'm really shocked at this I thought Morsi would be much better position against Joe mansion\nAnd he is now but the most recent surveys that have come out mentioned is holding an eight nine point lead in that state there ... there are the attorney general has any chance at all there Corey\nWhat he does and part of the reason is because\nThe Trump Pence ticket won that state by forty two points state that is Trump country I think it's fair to say that's West Virginia [noise] and you see\nThe amount of time that the president the vice president in that state campaigning I Believe they're going to be back in that state both third congressional district in that Senate race now every time the president of the vice president goes in that state numbers about a month ago

senators like Rand Paul and Lindsey Graham there are now demanding an accounting of our support for the Saudis and the civil war in Yemen which makes no sense these people are bombing school buses with our\nBombs that say made in America right on the missile they can't fly the Saudi royal Airforce Ari app they can't put a plane in the air without us logistics support their grounded\nWas the first thing they need to do is cut that\nAnd that has nothing to do with arms sales nothing to do with Trump's you know one hundred and ten so called billion dollars a memorandum of understanding it's got nothing to do with that\n\nThose of us would have been opposed to our involvement in the Yemeni civil war for a very long time\nAnd it's got to come up for vote in the Senate whether it be the lame duck session or not and good luck getting fifty one senators to vote in favor of continuing to support the war\nIn Yemen or fifty thousand people have died children are starving and eating bark off trees school buses are being blown up with us bombs by Saudi planes and there's no end in sight\n\nAnd of course Neil ... and those don't want the military industrial complex to keep marching along so they can all make money they're going to tell you about the who the Iran look they always have a boogie man first it's\nRussia then is around and then it's Russia that's ran tomorrow will be done if ISIS ... someone else they always have a boogie man Assad you know somebody that's going to blow up the world that we have to go get involved in these entitlements this president ran on getting out of the stuff not getting further involved\n\nNo one can defend what allegedly happened\nIn the Saudi constantly and by the way the head of the ... what the country\n\nIn Mohammed bin Salman is thirty three years old he is\nThe heir to the throne his father thinks the owners aging he was hand picked over others to get in there he consolidated power arrested a bunch of people arrested the prime minister of a of a kidnapped the prime minister of Lebanon who didn't like what he was doing did block tanks against a cutter\nThat didn't make any sense that blow up in the state everything's guys touched blown up in his place he the anti might is touch you know you have the lightest touch everything he turned touches turns to craft\nAnd this is a serious issue I mean this is world leadership and we can't just sit here and say well there's an arms deal on the table you can still sell them arms but there's got to be there has\nTo be a reaction from the United states you simply cannot function in an international community with an ally behaving this way intellectually December somebody why don't live in their\n... who was living in the United states and working for United States company and this was an ally that's one thing if it's an enemy Iran or Russia or ISIS that's\nHorrible but you know what were we we understand that China does horrible things but this is an ally that we're building a relationship what I mean imagine\nIf this happened in the Israeli consulate\n\nWhat that outrage with me or any ally of the United states Canada the United kingdom to free world\n\nMean their reaction in the United kingdom which is also backing the Saudi Emirates coal ... was when this war is this bad so this is not going away and\nThe president I understand it got to be measured I understand it's got to look at the facts I understand we got to do the investigation my pay was there I\nFavor that\nBut there's a lot of evidence right now that suggests that Jamal ... was murdered and dismembered and taking out their little doggy bags and now the Turkish authorities are saying that they have evidence that he was cut up while he was alive I mean this is the barbaric most here\nWho who does this in a hospital this isn't war this is your embassy\nMe think about it there's there's no international order without that\n\nI mean think anybody could just walk into an embassy and be detained and then murdered and chopped up and that's OK\n\nThe Turkish authorities say there's toxic materials they painted over things and they got all kinds of evidence that they intercepted the guy screaming into his watch\nThey got MPs we've got some real issues here\nAnd the scientists are going to happen to make a decision father's going to happen to make a decision because what the what did you ... the only way out of this is that'd be scholars there's plenty of other people to take power there but not him socio plays out\nFrom Twenty one days before the midterms I Love talking about the economy but I Can't and said I'm Talking about Saudi Arabia and now the president's tweet calling Stormy Daniels\nHorse race\nHorse race in a tweet um I really don't

anything\nYeah um I I don't want to say we should whitewash here's here's death I'm assuming he's dead which we think he is um especially since I I\nKnow him and that's why I Want to stress that I I don't think we should just sweep it under the rug but at the same time I'm I've been out in the middle east for thirty one years now um and I've seen a lot of people have been murdered 'em the most recent\nSerious killing was recognized Hariri the Lebanese prime minister they set up an international tribunal to judge the culprits are no one really has been punished and one of the people we think there is a got blown up in Damascus a belongs to has a lot\nAnd there's some speculation that Lebanese people might have had something to do with The Revenge\nThere I don't know but anyway no one was punished by the international tribunal ah we also have Omar\nHassan al Bashir that dictator up to Dan I'm who was\nA the international criminal court had a warrant out for his arrest you still not been arrested and what he's done as intimately more serious in killing thousands hundreds of thousands of people into down down one journalist in a consulate in Istanbul and I don't\nSay that you mean democracy will be because I I liked your market Chevy I'm Sorry that he was killed but anyway we also have Kobach Tiahrt the former Iranian\nNineteen eighty one no one ever got\nPunished for that but there are there in Europe and elsewhere all the time I think\nThe former I'm Marion dictator who you're nocturnal they read all the time the owner of a hat newspaper was murdered by the Syrian Government\nAll your ... your your point is these people get killed all the time nobody nobody no big deal I mean that's that's basically the point at which is what you're saying and\nWhat I'm saying is I get all that but I think in ... in a in an inner international community of allies there is an embassy or\nConsulate it's supposed to be a sanctuary opposed to go in there and get chopped up with the ... where the banks are taken out and make it in McDonalds I mean you're supposed to be able to go in there is something that is is things about an embassy or consulate and I I think that\nIs what is bothering people like me so much because it just breaks down all international I get murders I get the geo political assassinations I mean everybody gets that everybody gets in the middle east going out forever and it's going to always go on and I think it's the fact that he went into a constantly I'm In a foreign country\nAnd uh that that just that that's very distasteful to people at work and that's why the thing is just not I mean I Know everybody wants it to just go away let's just make it go away\nAnd let's get a hundred and ten billion dollars and keep a the Saudi planes and the ours we can keep arming school buses so the\nMilitary industrial complex in the U.S can keep making money I get\nIt right um the sixteen I get it but I think there's got to be a reckoning for the way this was done and uh it's it's just very uncomfortable to people\nI mean what I told you the other day eight months ago I went to um I I went to the Saudi um residents of a prince Turki al fossil and did an interview for an hour and a half\nWhat if what if I didn't come out I mean it's like okay I mean I I I never thought anything of it I'm like well this is the residents of a of a Saudi official you know you go into any empathy you'd never\nEver think well then you take it happened to be this was an embassy there was an international world order [laughter]\nEmbassies are safe right isn't that where you go if you're in trouble you you're going into an embassy I mean if that breaks down\nI don't know I think that's what bothers people Edward and you know I keep getting tweets about he was Muslim Brotherhood I guess you know I guess that means now if you're Muslim Brotherhood and you go into an embassy you can get you know chopped up with the ... chain store and shipped out in the doggy bag and it's okay\nI guess I guess that's the argument now and maybe it's okay\nRight maybe I'm looking at all\n[noise] no [noise] no I don't think you're looking at it all wrong I don't know what the reaction is in the case\nA new form of international law if we step in and do something serious against moderate bend so I'm\nAt because up until now or the world community has not up until now the only to attempt that is a tribunal for the killing of Rafik Hariri and the tribunal weren't around for over another sheriff you Dan how not produced anything so this\nIs going to clearly the international community decide they're going to be a new piece of international law\nLet's just get out of the Yemeni civil war and a wash your hands with a mess right that's that's the answer let's just get up\nWe shouldn't be there any way and it's going to be very interesting because what this is done and this is the day of reckoning for the for the for the Saudis in this or is\nThis is going to give Rand Paul a reason to bring this up in the U.S Senate and I don't think they're going to get it if\nYou want to vote I really don't know you know there were doing this under the old day or a map or whatever and Rand Paul's and trying to stop that but you get this debate in the Senate you get it out in the open um they're not going to get fifty one votes in order to stay there and then uh\nThe president's going to have to figure out what ... what do you just want to be there anyway we'll see what plays out any any way or chopping people up when you go into an embassy probably not a good idea on the international scene would you would agree with me on that yes I Do object\nActor worldwide\nOn ... minutes that I didn't mention there's another development today where a federal judge threw out the Stormy Daniels loyal to the president he went on to tweet after getting news of the great now I can go after horse parents were appointed certainly Daniel Andrew third rent or in the great state of Texas\nUm she will concerned a leather seats sign she knows nothing about me a total con what did you think about\nYou know I'm agnostic I spend all my crime trying to get us out of

you with us it's a great discussion with my good friend Edward uranium from Cairo covering the middle east not Jamal\nRand Paul a response to the question about the president's tweet or making fun of\nA Stormy Daniels was about the best response that I've heard which is ah my response which is I don't really have time for this there's too many other things going on in the world to be concerned about these uh about that particular a tweet and\nA Rand Paul hear Lindsey Graham there's a lot of senators that we have a lot of respect for that\nOr raising alarm bells and so you have to take what they say ah with all seriousness is my only point in us and let's get to the bottom of it I think the president\nResponse here so far has been spot on or it shouldn't affect the arms sales I disagree
