your framing of the question is a little bit of oil you know I talked about this a lot\nAbout the economy just great there is not as much of an awareness there was not a lot of voters are giving credit to the Trump and Republican policies that match creating a bit of a disconnect\nWow that's a I mean it's it's it's unfortunate and to me every day that goes by where the Republicans are not talking about the economy and jobs and\nPromotions and raises and you know the other thing I Want to get you a Elaine back involves the hum hum jeep operating officer of the job creators

get back to Scott Rasmussen so Scott\nTo what degree is that that issue going to show up on November six I noticed that\nThe Democrats come on my show now ah one of the major talking points are well Republican X Y or Z voted against a extending preexisting conditions when they voted to replace repeal Obamacare where is that showing up\nAnd that that is a fear that gets to ... people want to make sure that everyone has access to quality health care and to to lead the charge like that is believed to this person is going to lead to ending coverage for those with preexisting conditions that so that's what our practice ploy\nI'm obviously\nIt as something that Republicans would say is not true at CERN misrepresentation of the vote to misrepresentation of legal actions that have been taking\n'em so clarify what happens there is it scary because again Americans do want everybody to have access to health insurance to want to make sure it's a horrible they they're not aware again or some of the activities of the lenders mentioned some of the policies that have made less expensive plans to Beijing\nShe's actually um but probably of any kind of on the health care you know the flashpoint a scary thought is in ocean it's somebody in any condition and the place you're going to be unable to get access to health care\nAnd so that's the leading the drink driving some some people um yes to vote the other way thinking well if the if if the Democrats get in they're not going to end the bombing here\nI mean it's just the site and it was kind of amazing because um two thousand ten and the and the Tea Party and all that we covered all all that and getting rid of Obamacare was like everybody's number one issue\nAnd now the polling numbers show that you know people have accepted it they're comfortable with it and they they don't want to change it so um how how do you reconcile that\nIt's very simple the healthcare system was broken whole bombers here it was not by Obamacare people still believe the system is broken [noise] um but it's no longer be the shoulder finding part of the health care discussion because\nIt's been in place now for several years people aren't quite sure what prevents it along the lake or don't like 'em had anything to do with Obamacare will be in the middle is if you want to have your choice in her own and making her own decisions on health insurance [noise]\nI mean we know that they're ... very wary of having the federal\nGovernment take over the healthcare system um there are a number of things that you would say would be opposed to what Obamacare a foot in the party's\nLook people are you know President Obama has now been out of office for a few years his policy was past ... years ago people want to deal with the system as it is and make it better um and\nParker how do we get a\nMaximum engagement on November ... only what twenty two days remaining how how do you get maximum exposure to get Republicans on November six how do we do the\nI think we have to keep talking about the economy and connecting economy to the policies that the administration like the tax cuts can jobs back during the cutting of regulation on we did a poll a couple of weeks ago I'm asking who how many Americans that there's been a tax\nCut and about a third of them said they didn't even know that they have their taxes\nI mean that's that's just the angel we should be talking about um that the fact that five million Americans\nOut a way to increase it and then when it is that the result of it that's been out that not just the people the companies that put out press releases we got numbers just small main street small businesses get rate has been giving raises and hiring people in Spain or businesses they just don't put out press releases about it that we know that things are happening for employees\nYou know people are getting my money back in our paycheck and small businesses hiring or you know the economy's doing well but we have to keep talking about it and educating Americans about that\nSo uh what what is the advice that you have for Republicans that are running in tight races or how would you change their or encourage them to change the message in order to take advantage of this tremendous economy we are doing\nWell I mean I think it's it's very clear it's about choice choice between continuing the on this very hot economy on as a result of these\nPolicies or going back to um you know wage stagnation going back to a higher unemployment and ... it's about a choice\nAnd and that's why people have to educate themselves on the benefits that these policies cutting out a distraction\nI don't want to thank God willing for being with us Scott Ross most in the number one pollster in the history of American Jen and you're
