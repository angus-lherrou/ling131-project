these ambitions and dreams some of which we share here at the Washington Post to expand the platform uh for voice is a particularly in\nOr about Saudi Arabia in the middle east\nOr to allow for the kind of open debate which he felt those countries are entitled to and people there want but their governments don't allow so I think there's a a last hot that if that's what it is which\nYou know now kind of reads like a final will and testament was not that it was a a mission statement on for what he thought the region needed and and what he still hooked to do [noise]\nHere's what we know from

anything\nThat you're going to do that I Know she came up with healthcare now she slipped on that 'cause it was everybody thought it was a terrible idea\nAnd so uh but that's the Democrats nationwide or it's a great Politico piece a couple of days ago it's still a lot of people want to go see it on the night points of the Democrats but maybe people as the liberal agenda and it's not a policy agenda I urge everybody go take a look at it\nYou're on the John for his radio network where with incumbent Republican congressman Dave Brat from the seventh congressional district that central\nVirginia He's in a tight battle for re election to a third term against a very well funded democratic challenger Abigail span for this will be decided along with all the other midterms in fourteen days I November sex early voting is already underway in Virginia costs were let's get back to the caravan and seven thousand people\nDid not is it not unreasonable for a average people to see this and think okay\nIf the seven thousand people are allowed to come in and break our laws are just coming to the United states what would stop the next caravan from being Seventy thousand people were the one after\nThat from being seven ... seven hundred thousand people I mean what would be the deterrent if there are simply allowed to\nI'm Jane I'm basically seen them mob status and just overwhelming is horrid Eason and come in as you've seen them do in Mexico what would what would stop the second caravan from being since Seventy thousand instead of seven thousand\nNot that not ... that's exactly the point right that's why we need he Barrow fired and the green light right once you have any under siege for a promise to amnesty\nBut the package right and so\nOnce you ... down your guard at your picture right your picture President Obama in charge right now with all those in charge and ... are in charge and what what they do and you know what the answer is they'll be total chaos folks flooding and\nThen there was a signal to the whole world hate they guardian right they got an aircraft green light left out right and so I thank goodness the president's\nSon some signals that Congress has got to set up some strong legal or we have a good laugh bill that you dealt with the dark I guess I had to bail was Senator Cruz to deal with the uniting the parents have kids at the border we all compromise on that Democrats said\nNo reasonable compromise because they want\nOpen borders cheap labor ... ... you know good sanctuary cities and just look at Nancy Pelosi right look at San Francisco they got\nThey got ... the city is in decay right now go Google San Francisco everybody look at it and that's what they want to bring to Richmond and they're already starting to happen in policy already not just like here like in policy\nWell San Francisco has the seventh largest population in the United states and the third largest homeless population and that is growing and a priest when it's going to be rivaling Los Angeles as we know ah\nThe estimates are about twenty five thousand people at night are homeless in Los Angeles a sleeping under bridges and drain pipes that's a lot of people and San Francisco rivaling that\nAccomplishment I Want to get to a what exactly do I mean I've asked this question a number of times senator pose it to you also this caravan is coming they've crossed Mexico and it's becoming the president says I'm going to stop it I might send the military there\nWe've already gone through these zero tolerance policy and that was a public relations disaster so what I mean there's not time to enact anything in in in eight days and it's going to happen you guys aren't even in section\nSo what should the president to stop it like what exactly what he says I Want to send the military they are in close the border what does that mean\nYou can be ... by the defenses in Santa everything you know to where the stuff that was a folk hero millionaire our company blew out but more importantly we have a lot of leverage over Mexico right and that's where it's got to be down to president Mexico\nThere's already a sense hundreds and hundreds of law enforcement or to weaken it pick off some of the folks and send them back home already and I think\nThat's the primary loop that's what happened last time\nAnd we have or did they give you a number problem and so it's just it's just ... we got to send our own resources to send the wrong signal that our our border is secure and and obviously you need to build a wall and put up security measures ah\nCan you imagine the difference if you had a ... versus what we have ... and ... it's the fact that so it's so hard and against it is is almost the evidence itself that they know it will be a factor right if they thought it wouldn't be a factor and they just want to say good go ahead and do it but they know\nThat would be a factor in and they don't want it so we need all the above we we have good\nA wind for spent on the books and we just need to enforce\nIt and so that's that's the play call\nCars but I don't read you a texture American restaurant who's in your district he says I'm In the seventh district if I were to go to the ER and not pay I'd be chasing the end of the earth is threatened with every type of legal action imaginable\nAnd then they were garnish my wages to snuggle standards just crazy I mean this is just one of the issues for average people struggling to pay their bills\nYeah no that's that's right he'll get traced because\nGrind either serious than these records are around the books with her parents he's got an income screen that is their their parents have the IRS have all his personal information in terms of income what he's made and that's the\nWhole point that's the total unfairness of citizens versus non\nCitizen citizens are\nOn the hook for everything that the non citizens do illegally and are the American ... eighty percent issue right let me tell you the number one a polling Republican issue right now\nAnd that after they the Kavanaugh technical was the last show that the tactics\nThey're using they're using them in my district right the last ... businesses one half of the other downside feeling private property and you know leaving\nCareful notes on my own ... group that was widely reported and so uh the American people see the choice right the economy is growing we got strong America First policies and foreign policy at the border and the alternative is\nI don't think of all to me it's just simply on think when I when we do have people coming our way now right the Republicans are all coming home energy independence are breaking our way up to the Kavanaugh story and so in the end I think he ah Virginia people are going to do the right thing [noise]\nPerson that I have a minute I have a minute or the show he a fair we're going to get more information or the Turkish government is saying the next several weeks of MPs was involved in this\nOr do you favor some sort of sanctions or can crush all actions in response to allegedly when it appears that the Saudis did within their own constantly\nYeah yeah absolutely you you you cannot ever said no to another world leader even if they're an ally in other respects\nCredits All right uh to take the life of another human being\nAnd certainly going to have to be stiff sanctions I think the White House is going to get there on a on a you know more than just a narrow targeted basis I think they're going to be significant and down the Congress will for sure command and a back that up by and got it we we have\nTo write so you're going to have an ally\nWe're in total agreement with that tolerance for Dave ... thanks for being

balmy weather in Virginia and I can finally get out of the rain it is beautiful here showing no question about it okay we've we've got a\nWe've got some things I Want to go over I Want to start with the caravan coming here to the to get to the United states fourteen days before the midterms short and we understand this now grown to seven thousand people the president saying or they're not going to come in there's going to close the border if need be how does this play out Sean Spicer\nOn it I think it ... it look there's a lot of things right now it's headed to the mid term elections that are sort of that very electorate is a demonstration of what the difference between the two parties aren't as you see these things happen it Chris why is\nThe importance of the election and the thought that it to some degree with cat and our people saying okay I get it this is why this is the policies and people that will come in with this administration and having a party in power\nSimilarly I think that you look at these people kind of a coming marking on up through Mexico trying to come into our border\nAnd the president said very clear about what his position is and that he's going to make sure that we are eight a country of law and order and it catches march on into our country and they see fit I don't think the Democrats clearly have that same kind of policy\nThere are event in circumstances that crystallized what the differences are between the two parties in various candidates as you head into an election and right now it couldn't be quicker\nSo what should uh\nWhat should the president's action thing now as they get if they if they didn't get through Mexico and you'd have seven thousand I mean I understand the politics of it but let's get to the policy what should the president says you've got to send the military there how would how would that work how would\nThat play and wouldn't CNN be saying okay you've got the and that's so pointed that moms with babies that is what CNN will do\nYou know I it's just it's a it's actually a very complicated policy that I'm probably not the right person to get into it in a sense that there there's something about I think that you can send\nYou the national guard a centralized national anthem I utilized certain aspects of National Guard\nI there is a tricky issue between titled ten and title thirty two that detail how you could use certain members of the military for domestic purposes but regardless I think that the point that he's making it she couldn't figure out what it takes to do that put him along the border and make sure that people can't cross over a but there is an obligation for\nAnyone to make sure that we're protesting for any president especially this when he's made it so clear with his priorities are\nThat we protect the border and we've got to make sure that people coming into our country or coming so legally incorrectly and and not with not sort of [noise] I\nWilly nilly and as they see fit this is a country of laws are eight I'm you know people are here to seek asylum I understand that we need to make sure that it's done through the cracks process\nWe're with Sean Spicer he was the former press secretary the first press secretary for President Trump in the Trump Administration he's also a longtime F. O. J. that means the front of John ... Sean\nAnd Sean is also the author of the book called the briefing politics the press and the president which you could buy on Amazon your favorite books or or you can buy it on his Web site\nGo to Sean Spicer dot com is also a senior advisor for America first policies the number one political action committee in America that supports President Trump's America First agenda\nUp showing the to show your situation and Mohamed been solving um you're in the White House at the time about a lot of our relationship with the Saudis was\nBeing discussed that was the president's first ... says it\nUh but now I BS is really embarrassed President Trump with uh the nonsense that's done honored this or what appears to be a some kind of an assassination in their consulate\nOh what do you think the president does now if uh it's proven to be true\nAnd don't you find what NBS if he was involved in a signing off on this don't you think that was a a basically a slap in the face to the president\nI think you're absolutely right that the idea that if you're comfortable with the relation\nTo think that you can get away with how come I just never mind whether whether it's the United states you know it could be get away with it but but especially with the relationship\nThat this president is trying to find her with Saudi Arabia that was his first if you recall abroad because you really want her to strengthen that relationship so\nI think that the actions that have been taken and the idea that it's taken two weeks is a bit ridiculous you know the guy from the get go how serious this why are they new clearly it's it's one thing when they initially claimed that they didn't know anything about it that was tough to believe\nBut the two weeks later they say well okay so if something happened and there was a fight with that you do that two weeks ago that this is an unbelievably insulting stalling tactic a\n... and I think that you know all of the steps that they've taken has just been read I mean the the cleaning crew sending in the team um they either need to explain all of this which I think it's beyond the pale of of explaining\nA but right now I think the president should not just look that's in terms of the relationship that we had a rabid but it's a personal insult because the idea that we treated Saudi Arabia the way that we have and he made a such an amazing gesture of respect by visiting the person in his presidency\nAnd trying to foster and strength in the relationship we have this is how we get repaid\nOr the president needs to be strong in town\nI'm In agreement with that show in a hundred percent I think that is spot on a ... exactly what we've been saying for some time it is insulting you there's a slap in the face and it was very disrespectful and it's kind of like hey look we're friends I've got a hundred and ten billion dollar arms deal therefore I can do whatever I Want\nAnd ah I I think they're going to find with this president that's really not the way a relationship work so we'll see how that plays out\nShort springs I Want to uh I I Want to ask you about these mobs these left wing wing moms that are going around I mean in Minnesota last week or two candidates were actually assaulted two Republican candidates were assaulted by these bombs going all over the United states that threads through Susan Collins and others\nAre people getting chased out of um of a ... ... being a being chased down sub subway stairs what's the deal here\n[noise] but well here's an interesting thing I was reading on a column last week that I'm I'm a constitutional lawyer or a scholar I Can't remember which what were the closet an interesting theory which is that what he's talking about how our constitution protects us\nThe reality is if you actually read the first amendment insensitive protect our ability to peacefully assemble right and that's the key word peacefully assemble and if you think about how normally things work do you need you know there's do you want to go to temple and that particular city and whether it's Virginia or anywhere else you get a permit you don't do it that\nThat's because you have a right to do it just doesn't give you an opportunity to do it however you want to think about that because\nIt it all of their actions from the last against the right it is not in it we have a right to to express ourselves to we you know address our government and our elected officials give us a carte blanche to do it however we want and touching something and threatening way here's the thing that I think the bigger ...\nSilence for the last but almost encouraged me Nancy colored Maxine Waters Chuck Schumer all of the people who are leaders of their parties\nShould be standing up and saying this is unacceptable you have any right to protest\nBut there is a way and it means to do that going into a restaurant and basically threatening I Wonder if they're sitting there having dinner and let's be clear because we're all these people on the left to go oh well they just stood in front of them one let let them try to have that kind of how you how it feels when you are surrounded by ten twenty thirty people\nChanting actually to get out get out we're going to throw you out\nYou can't tell me that that doesn't make you feel correct\nAnd that's what they're doing and I get I think that the biggest thing the media is frankly a complete mess because it was happening on the right\nPeople would be calling for people's resignation why are you standing against it whatever ... because they basically agree with them the folks in the mainstream media are all sort of complex in there because they refused to ask the questions\nTo the Democratic leader says why they're allowing this to happen and color ... that\n[noise] why our last year [noise]\nBreaking news this hour from town hall by Tom I'm the senior President Trump is embracing the term nationalistic described himself\nAfter

leadership\nWhen in fact it again when you [noise]\nOf undocumented migrants just walk into the country that's what this election is about you can either go forward or you can go backwards and I've told you for weeks the Democrats were\nTo find a way to snatch defeat from the jaws of victory they can't help themselves\nThey have political correct all they have to do I said there's three months ago all Nancy Pelosi has to do is take the entire\nDemocratic candidate delegation for eight Ninety Days vacation in Hawaii don't party has just go to Hawaii and they would win nope they can't do it instead they're talking about socializing minutes saying that we got communist\nAs their party's standard bearer or is it\nThere chairman is saying is the future the party I mean it's it's bizarre now they got this caravan which is an invasion it's an exodus now there's another there's eight thousand strong now I heard today it's up to eight thousand against him as that goes there marching right through Mexico the\nPolice are letting them and they're going to go to the U.S border and only have to do is put one foot over and the rents\nAre wars and are so porous and there are so many loopholes\nTrump says I'm going to close the borders excuse me Mr President that would mean cutting off for trade it's just like you can't just\nClose the border for the migrants you have to close the border for everything [noise] so you were knocked out all trade that would all be gone and it was it would it would cause economic habits or you can't do that\nThat's just the reality of it you can't do it [noise]\nAnd so the problem is that there are so many loopholes that is the problem\nIn the law you know fifty percent now of of of where migrants are coming from Central America fifty per se per se there was a time when a almost a hundred percent were single males coming from Mexico looking for jobs like everybody got that\nIn two thousand one\nLess than one percent of illegal aliens claimed asylum now thirty percent claim asylum\nAnd we have a law\nThat was passed in two thousand Fifteen called the forest floor and with the Florida law says\nIf you were apprehended on the border if you're apprehended and you claim asylum [noise] legally the government can only hold these people for twenty days if you can't get your paperwork process than twenty days the federal government the border patrol has to release them\n\nThis is all lost the Democrats like the law because once they're released it's over [noise]\nThey get a piece of paper that show up on this day which is not weeks out years out years\nSo then they just disappear into the interior of the country they only have twenty days and now obviously you can't separate the children from the parents\nSo the parents and the children or whatever the children are the guardian whoever they are they can be detained together but only for twenty minutes at the end of the twenty they have to be released they get a piece of paper\nThen they just go wherever they go in\n\nAnd they say they're coming to link persecution up I'm certainly that some are countries that are ... are not doing that well but four billion people would like to migrate to the United states and get welfare and education\nAnd fish is on the back seat just doesn't affect the elites are the rich they they it has no impact on them they send their kids to private school and who has no impact on\nThis is a burden on middle and lower income Americans because schools get over round the welfare system explodes and I told you the story of my own son when I moved\nThird third grade and or the fifth fifth grade or fourth I don't I\nThird or fourth grade first day of school twenty five kids in the class I get I get that\nTold them don't speak English just speak English in the school that I was in twelve or Thirteen kids don't speak a word of English all migrants\nNow what are you gonna do how can that be satisfactory learning environment you can't so the teacher was going to go down to the lowest common denominator we pulled them out and sending the St Matthew Catholic school I didn't have the money for that\nSo we have to give up a lot of different stuff so you pay your taxes for an education that is worthless in some areas up you're living in a mansion in northern Virginia in orbit thanks to\nYou know as a five million dollar lobbyist for the federal government you don't care they're going to private school\nBut if you have to send your child to a public school because that's where your economic means land and half the kids in there can't speak a word of English you tell me we're going to ask about learning environment that\nFor your child well it's not\nIt's no fall through the children but it's the talk of the system for a while to get me this is an invasion that and they're they're burning they're burning tires in front of the U.S embassy there flying around the Honduras Guatemala flags\nAnd their voice basically taught thing the president to stop them because they know that as soon as they get in the United states they're saying they won't get really in twenty days because of their\nCases are years away so they simply disappear in the interior of the country\n\nAnd all they have to do in the first asylum hearing is meet the basic threshold see there's three thresholds of asylum\nThe first one is just claiming it eighty percent of people meet the person asylum requirements so they're released anyway and the other twenty percent get released also because they can't get processing twenty days so they all get released this is the problem these are the poles\n\nOf the people that are detained that actually show up in court when they're supposed to Fifteen Percent so eighty percent of people are not apprehended\nAnd up to twenty percent only Fifteen Percent actually go to court when they're supposed to so you do the math like Ninety five percent of the people that put one foot in the border of the country\nState it's an it's an incredible number and they're coming for either economics or for family reunification\n\nHuman traffickers drug cartel bowls bad people some say some say that there's even terrorists than in in there from the middle east no one knows\n\nWhat is the president to we've tried zero tolerance that was a public relations fiasco\n\nSo I tell you what [noise] um the images on TV Now and wonder what the caravan has done is they've pushed all the women and children to the front of the line so the cameras catch only women and children on TV so you see children crying and moms [noise]\nCrying for food for their baby while they made the choice to come but it doesn't matter that's the images that the fake news wants to play they don't want to go deep into the caravan of find out who these other people are and who's funding it\n\nHas anybody asked that question me this is an invasion it's like we have no laws we have no water we have no wars we have nothing\n\nSo here's why the Republicans are going to win and hold the house because suburban women\nThat the Democrats have been counting on heavily to give them victory because of whatever reason are looking at two things mobs in caravans mobs and caravan angry mobs an agri caravans\n\nI don't think that's conducive to getting votes for Democrats [noise] if you look at the early voting right now in the trends in early voting Republican turnout and Republican areas is through the roof\n\n[noise]\nBreaking news this hour from town hall dot com and Peter President Trump is revising his plane

issue for the president and I you know he said there's gonna be severe consequences I Do believe that President Trump along with the Congress is going to do something\nBecause the big difference here is it happened and I'm In an embassy which is there's\nAn international order right and I mean you go into an embassy ... you're not expected to get your head cut off with a chainsaw or bones so whatever they had so it's kinda gruesome and I think I think that's what's a feeling the outrage I mean this is an ally of ours than\nI think it's put President Trump in a very very awkward position and there's going to be some accounting for that what the consequences are I don't know\nCertainly uh I think that Rand Paul and others and Bob Corker and others are going to demand that there's a hearing in Congress on what our involvement why we're still involved\nIn supporting the Saudis and the Emirates\nIn the Yemeni civil war I mean I I think at least you're going to get that what

matter I mean\nDo do do you think do you think this is particularly helpful [noise]\nOf course I'm you know the kinds of things that every country makes such a political mistake in addition to the moral consequences of brokering I Want I don't want to discount\nBut you've got countries like Saudi Arabia rivals what you're trying to profit from this geopolitical mistake I I I don't want to downplay it too much but yet that's what I mean the people that will profit from is once again to the Muslim Brotherhood's once again Qatar\nQatar which is supporting terrorism all across the middle east do we want the most\nForced President Trump and on this I'm fairly certain that that you're right you're very ... of the domestic political situation I Believe that's exactly what's going to happen and they're going to force us to stop helping Saudi Arabia and Yemen which is basically going to leave the who tease him trying\nTo find and it's going to leave the country divided um it's not going to solve any of the problems of what's going on in Yemen because you've got the same parties there that are battling it out\nOr it's just going to leave another Arab country in a state of a debate here and where people are fighting on the ground um so I see no no good coming out of that political early and I see no geopolitical good coming out of supporting the Muslim Brotherhood and I knew their market joking and I'm Sorry he died I'm Sorry was brutal\nAnd I'm not going to defend Mohammed bin Salman man but you don't go rewarding or if your enemies with geopolitical gifts because\nYour friends made a mistake like that\nSo what do you think the United states should do if anything\nWell I I Would hate to be in President Trump's hands place um I I Know he's got he's surrounded by some good people secretary Pompeo and the vice president who is a very strong moral person uh what do they come up with I mean the king is not going to\nGet ... Stein he's not going to throw him to the world's a lot of people\nInside our foreign policy establishment had been trying to Samantha cool by saying that the other princes are going to try to overthrow him perhaps that's possible I suspect it's not but perhaps\nIt's possible there are a lot of for instance I Would love to do that or people lamenting that ... mammal became for maybe fifty years they don't like someone like\nThat and I I think we have a political objectives of dividing various terrorist countries I don't say we but I mean the the deep state the foreign policy establishment um and that's not a good thing it sets the middle east on fire\nA wreck the economy and puts a lot of young people out of work and creates\nFloods of refugees and you see people like George Soros who would like to see refugees we don't want to see more refugees we don't want a theory of gone sending more refugees Europe it's the Muslim Brotherhood that has been doing that's both from turkey and\nFrom from Libya and they continue to do this because they're trying to flood Europe\nWith refugees and people are doing the same thing with our borders in South America coming from Honduras and Mexico and wherever else are we don't want to see that it's a mistake\nBecause there is a possible and were Ukrainian maybe NBS just isn't particularly effective leader because right now everything the guy touches as trying to craft right I mean the Yemeni civil war than he's conducting their or the money that he spent has been a disaster\nThe public relations fiasco of them are listening all of his rivals and putting them in a higher regency you're wondering what every ... hotel they're torturing them is what some of the allegations\nBlockade against the Qataris whatever you think of that government that government of that change them or whether you knew this would be a complete disaster it's ineffective and blow up a new stations\nThey tore up people are better off um post support either and they were before we screwed that up um I mean the get the guys you know this the alleged murder is a complete ... I mean I it's beyond a screw up I mean it's like\nIt's the Keystone Cops in those things ridiculous\nI mean the guy screwed up everything so I mean maybe me his father is looking at this and saying look he's thirty three years old and maybe he's just not particularly effective right now you know we have a lot in the United states that that says that you can't be president until you're thirty five years I mean there's a reason for that\nAnd you know maybe me you know maybe it's possible that he's just not an effective leaders that are reasonable conclusion for people to make\nIt look like the drama of King Lear or as I pointed out to others who is given his ... his other son with him back to\nThe United states some people are wet spring that he should that king or the crown prince sad um it's a it's a bad situation I'm you know it could happen in ... in another kingdom obviously Shakespeare wrote about King Lear bike or the bottom\nLine here I think in the middle east is that I have to go to the wolves I don't believe he's going to choose his other sides of this is his favorite sign this unless we have the rebellion of the major princes inside the kingdom which I also don't think it's going to happen\nOr he's not going to be refined and if you want to know what the scenario is how it plays out if we can say\nBoth Saudi Arabia ... newspaper the kings threat\nMentioning that Saudi Arabia is also aligned with Russia and also that Russia would like to see the kingdom cut oil sales and I said like to do that in order to raise prices are saying and this is just a veiled threat or the\nWar to recreate another Nineteen Seventy three the three main where\nThe oil block on the west was\nEnforced prices went up and we were all standing in gas lines I don't know say theoretically could pull that off again but they were certainly threatening um I guess Mohammed bin Salman hamlet threatening um\nSo do you want to get into really ugly scenario or with the oil market given that Iran is going to be going flying on November fourth\nProbably Donaldson that electric starting to November sex I mean well how come and start pumping oil um November forest and\nPrices would go after people would be going to the polls are saying\nIt could turn ugly I don't want to see that happening at once again I Need my most important consideration here is I don't want to see the Muslim Brotherhood profit from the geo political and broke your political mistake by Mohammed down\nCongressional sources said Republicans want President Trump to declassify fewer than a dozen pages of documents which you relate to Papadopoulos shorts and say they believe these records including exculpatory evidence and appear to under cut the collision or to\n[noise]\nJobs that were cooking the truth across America I Am Godzilla of the truth it's great to be with you today don't forget\nOur in our new news talk station W.

until election day but the president has spent the past twenty four hours unloading on this migrant caravan which began its travels as a group of now eight thousand\nUm the caravan reached temperature will in Mexico on Monday about eleven hundred miles from a gallon Texas and it continues to strike north towards the southern border\nBut the Democrats they want to keep the focus on health care because uh the polling shows that was the number one issue on people's mind and joining us now to try to understand why health care is such an important issue and it's on so many people's minds joined this upcoming election and beyond\nIs my good friend del balance to is the executive director and founder of liberty health share now um my self and my family have been proud members of liberty health share forget this seven years\nIt is the best thing we have ever done you know all the health care debate [noise] we have to debate it and we talked about it and ah we analyze it for you on the air but I'm not personally involved in it because my family got out of this a long time ago we got out of the whole\nObamacare healthcare rat race and we went to liberty health share which the services phenomena oh this is a great organization where it's different because everybody shares in their own cost of health\nThose members and it is growing every day is the best kept secret in America and I urge all of my listeners now if you work for the federal or state or county government and you've got a great health plan where you work for big company and they provided you do a little of co pay that's fine\nBut if you're an independent contractor or you work in the gig economy or you're on a ten Ninety nine or you work for small companies like we have and we can't\nWe can't buy the insurance we can they would put us out of business is so expensive or you're a business owner any of those things then to liberty health share is a phenomenal opportunity for you and as I said my family of three and I've got a fourteen year old he ran it was seven\nAnd it's just it's the greatest place like paint cash\nIt's easy to do the services great uh everything gets done they didn't do shit everything on your behalf you're not there's no paperwork there's no paperwork it's just you pick up the phone I mean you send them to stop you send them to bill that's it and you get all the free\nHow's your dad or check it out it's real quotation that's all you got to be shocked by it because you're going to say no the stupid to be true there's gotta be catch you know catch joining us now to help understand what is going on today in health care where the debate\nExecutive director founder of Libya don't share yeah both hey do\nSuch a pleasure to be with you John thank you for the invitation\nYou because I'm a true believer down where you believe in something it's really easy to talk about it because I'm not only a believer I'm customer and I have been for very long time\nAnd we wouldn't three different you know the other day if you might get some of these came to me and said hey uh chewing or whatever it is you know organized hear you man or something to hundreds I Would do\nBecause it's a hassle LA's\nThe dish into we banded together as you've just said\nTo paint job his medical bills on the basis of our shared values and beliefs but we also stimulate one another to leave to lead healthy lives the reasonable such\nDeaths satisfaction in America about health care today that's why it's the top of people's discussion list concern lists as we come into this mid term election that is because we don't have a health care system in America John we have a sick\nCare system the only time a doctor will see is when you're sick and we've got to change that and we stimulate\nOne another encourage each other we welcome folks with conditions that by just simply adding exercise or die or control to their wives reverses diabetes\nAnd heart disease and high blood pressure certainly obesity we help people stop smoking we're focused\nOn the care of our health\nAnd that's what we've got to get back to ... and focus on understand that health care is really about the care of our health and that's what we're focused on\nWell you stopped me from smoking so that's good [laughter] yeah right\nAnd so on police this can be drawn because we do we welcome folks with those conditions\nThey just have to come to change their lifestyle at a recent survey came out\nFor two days ago for the New York times just indicated\nThat being a city is as bad or if not worse than smoking and if people would simply engaging simple\nExercise every day it would change their lives reduce their weight a ... and certainly reduce the risk profile for the future and that's what we're doing we're just simply saying well let's let's\nTake care of our bodies these are precious gifts one better couldn't we invested in books set aside money for retirement plan their entire\nAnd and and that's key\nIn this game because I mean the whole objective of\nJoining liberty health share and you know you have to do is get a quotation is going to liberty hill shared dot org liberty how sure dot org it's over there or you can call age five five five eight five four three seven eight five five five five four to three Seventy get yet on the whole government thing\nBut the best thing about it is it is it's a plan to stay healthy it's not a plan to go there when you say now obviously you become sick have problems you know we've we've all had them I've certainly had them over the eighty four months that I've been with\nA with the with LA chess but uh the object is to stay healthier and it permeates your whole family I mean it's held my wife even my fourteen year old\nRight is on a regimen of eating better and you'll be snowed jumps to get it all works out every day plays baseball all that stuff and so you find out if you do these things your frequency of visiting doctors goes way down
