Thomas dominion energy dot com speaking the dummy energy\nJoining us now is Aaron ruby he's media relations manager with dominion energy and he also currently serves as spokesperson and chief communications strategist for the Atlantic coast pipeline a six billion dollars six hundred mile interstate natural gas transmission pipeline\nThat is owned by a number of energy companies and uh\nWe're going to get an update on where we are because I Want my pipeline Aaron great to have you been [noise]\nMorning John how you doing [noise]\nFired up today Aaron I'm very excited to tighten because I was getting you want to get to talking about energy and jobs good paying jobs\nFive thousand dollars these are great jobs man and they last a long time but then after pipelines up you get manufacturing and you get more jobs that's what the whole thing is about now we had to stop it for awhile give us an uptick\nRight so just to remind folks this is the Atlantic coast pipeline as you described it some new a natural gas transmission pipeline that's going to bring\nNew supplies of cheaper natural gas than to Virginia and North Carolina this is all about as you talked about this was all about growing the economy bringing manufacturing back to eastern Virginia Hampton Roads lowering our energy cost the businesses can grow families can have more money in their pockets\nAnd it's also about making our electricity cleaner so obviously we've been shutting down a lot of coal plants are the last several years because of tighter environmental controls and regulations and\nWe'll replacing that with cleaner burning natural gas solar wind all the things that you talked about before so this this project is all about growing the economy creating thousands of new jobs rebuilding the manufacturing sector um we started construction earlier in the summer\nAnd we made a lot of progress in West Virginia North Carolina uh haven't started yet I'm Virginia we're still waiting on one final approval from the state environmental agency are but we expect to get underway in Virginia here I'm pretty poor like\nUh you're right that for about six weeks or we have to stop work I'm the fourth circuit court of appeals uh ordered a couple of agencies the fish and Wildlife Service the national Park Service to revise some of their products\nThe agencies were able to do that relatively quickly and suddenly got back to work once the permits were we issued a few weeks ago and we're we're going full steam ahead and in West Virginia North Carolina and I'm hopefully starting in Virginia you're pretty soon\nSo the six week holed up what is barriers now they're just getting to John in Virginia and just put it in layman's terms for our listeners\nSo we we we we've got\nAll the state and federal permits we need for West Virginia and North Carolina this is a free state project [noise] ah we have one more permit that still outstanding and Virginia and the [noise] it's a permit\nFor erosion and sediment control basically Virginia Department of environmental quality they regulate construction projects so that you don't create erosion\nAnd sediment patients so that you get much water in the streams and rivers\nUm the agency has done an incredibly thorough job of reviewing every single inch of the pipelines pass through Virginia\nAll of our erosion and sentiment control plans um they'd been reviewing our plans for for more than a year now [noise] um but we expect to get final approval on those plants here I'm In the early fall so we'll we'll be able to get underway and Virginia\nAnd then we'll be working continuously through the end of next year so it's about a ... year and a half to two year construction project we started earlier lighting\n[noise] John this is all that you know once this project is built people are going to see a significant improvement in the economy particularly in the eastern uh area in Hampton Roads um they're going to see lower energy costs you know the problem with God and Virginia is when you have any results are\nAre natural gas infrastructure for decades and so the infrastructure that we have is in keeping up with consumer demand so we're using more and more natural gas to generate cleaner electricity heat her lose power the economy but we haven't built more infrastructure to bring in the additional supplies of natural gas that we need so what's happening is\nThree at the last four winners the pipelines were so overt strain that serve our region\nThat businesses have their service shut off\nFor several days hundreds of major industrial companies had their their natural gas service shut off and consumers any hundreds of millions of dollars for an energy costs than they would have if we had the Atlantic coast pipeline it's it's simple laws of supply and demand\nMore demand and supply your\nYour prices are going to skyrocket so until we get the Atlantic coast pipeline bill consumers and businesses\nAre going to pay hundreds of millions more energy costs when they should um and businesses are going to continue to have their their service shut off during the winter and so that that makes it hard to do business far far just in companies but it makes it impossible to attract new industries like manufacturing can help grow the economy so this\nThis infrastructure is really critical to our economy it's important for the environment we're making a lot of progress and we're going to get into um [noise]\nI Want you Aaron\nAaron is she smokes person and communication strategic communications manager for dominion energy for the Atlantic coast pipeline I Want you to address the concerns of those people that are opposed to the pipeline\nOn environmental grounds um and I\nI don't mean the ground so I just don't like any type of energy except solar and wind that's one set\nA but then there's the other side which is to have real environmental concerns that of course our positions always then if you're going to transport national natural gas is only three ways train truck or pipeline trains getting accidents trends crash and Jalal ...\nUm and so I think that that was a conversation absolutely worth having um I didn't support the tax bill because it was rushed in nature and\nHoly irresponsible and added added on you know at this point one point nine trillion dollars to the deficit from a national security perspective the fact that we had so much debt and now we're continuing to blaming it and that that that is held by foreign nation some of them adversary nation\nIs something that I think Congress should be concerned with because we're essentially mortgaging our future and are kids who are going to be left to pay for it\nBecause there's going to be a vote in Congress to extend the personal tax cuts beyond the beyond the ab form of some sort of if you're an however would you vote right now the talk talk and rolling back or George\nSo my my question would be how\nAre we going to pay for it right we've we've already ballooned are gathered that with the first round of tax cuts how would it be paying for additional tax cuts at this point we're we're already I mean coming in on close to a year in since this last note it would be at this point we can't just all of a sudden out that the apple\nMerrilee repealing it isn't an option but we need comprehensive tax reform which is what was promised that twenty Seventeen and we didn't I didn't meet the goal and making taxes simpler it didn't make the goal and you can find your tent taxes on a postcard and there's a lot that still needs to be done and\nFrankly I think that we've already done enough damage to the long term fiscal stability of our country that we need to slow\nIt down bringing expert and have real hearings on what it is that can be done to maintain some of the benefits that that may have come through with the tax reform of twenty Seventeen um ensure that it's not hunting at the great detriment of our long term fiscal an international\nStability in terms of where I got\nAll right so what you're saying is have more meetings\nOr somebody say that when you're actually members of\nCongress who are focused on making really informed sound decisions\nAll right well that we can agree to disagree I think I think the tax cuts us on the tremendous impact on the economy and revenues are up but we can then happier\nThan John how do you what is your response to the level of that we've raised the deficit ... do you not have concerns are related to that long term\nAbsolutely the only way you're going to get the salaries by growing the economy just such an extent that revenues are outpacing expenses and then at some point somebody in Washington has to address spending somebody's got to do that and uh whether or not\nGetting what evidence before we were willing to address that just\nGot to get the economy moving first and so we've done that now we have to deal with the spending I'm almost at a time but I Do have to ask you one foreign policy question advocate which is this\nI was at the un all week last week at the press briefing on Wednesday with international and domestic reporters President Trump will lead to a grand plan for it for the Israel Palestine situation and he said he was the first president ever to come out in favor of this\nAnd said look I'm a favor of a two state solution because I Believe in sovereignty and I believe that the Palestinian people should be able to govern themselves and choose their own leaders and have self determination how do you how do you stand on that\nI I Am a supporter of a two state solution I agree that that is the only way forward to have long term\nStability in the middle eastern long term peace and my hope would be that the U.S would be able to be a leader and engage as necessary as requested as desired to help facilitate negotiations related to a two state solution [noise]\nOkay Abigail Spanberger one of the time\nI really

criticism short [noise]\nThem in front of insurance every single day\nCompany like from a nation's capital in Washington DC thanks for being with us today it was a joint in Portland without the embassy national galactic Milky Way headquarters map oil coming up Breitbart\nHe's fired up right first fired up we've got a lot at stake thirty three days of the midterms the White House leaking that they got the FBI report now being released for the senators to review in\nPreparation for tomorrow's procedural vote in that Saturday's big vote a judge Kavanaugh the White House saying well we went through this report and I guess what nothing no no ... he needs free and clear that's what the White House is saying but until the center get a chance to look at it\nGoing to hold judgment metro coming up in a few moments of Sigmund Freud you by our friends that job creators network you know I tell you what this off year elections these midterms are the most critical of the nation's history and you know\nAnd I know that these midterms in off year elections are about one thing you know what it is\nCan make an uncorroborated done substantiated claim it you're done\nEventually you're going to roll through people look at look at CNN they've had a number\nOf Trump surrogates on every single one that gets blasted somebody to do a story on objects something else they did this and they just send it to Paris to burn the other day that said that I mean eventually CNN it's not going to have a single person to come on to represent Trump because they just\nIt was literally the opposition party may the ... the the opposition party I mean the media part of the Democratic party wing of the Democratic party that's what they aren't\nInterested in telling the truth in this whole New York times story on this or actually seeing that we saw so\nUnremarkable within the demonstrators\nThat President Trump's all the while\nIt's like he didn't come up with some crazy thing 'cause break the law on taxes or anything like that they demonstrated they didn't follow the law this whole thing with the media the it's\nJust another one thing after another after another after another Britain right get it's nonstop when they report this stuff about what President\nTrump is actually gone to the economy or anything and I I don't think they're going to do that [noise] what are they going to report stuff on the successors edition insurance and happy they are interested in doing that and the reason being is is that they're using their power\nTheir meaning of platforms to push their agenda the difference between having us though is is that we didn't seem to be brave part by the way brain because we have a point of view we are very open about it though that's\nThe difference between us and CNN or Fox and the New York times for the Washington Post very well why did\nThe claim that their objective they're not they push or a certain point of view and that's fine they have every right to do that okay they're private companies just like we but we on\nBut we are honest with our audience we tell our audience were would point of view are coming from Maine you know what they're getting more and more talk to them and I think the fact that he's a leaner companies are\nLying to the people or to their audience is is discussing and despicable and I ... I I think it's the biggest why in the last forty years and in the American media\nOr that they claim to be objective because no person in this country can be addressed you you just can't every decision that you make\nIn in the media from what had mine for years to who you interviewed a what stories your coverage so which one you don't and so on and so forth all play into a all play into a a a everything had the opportunity for these searching by\nWriting like instead of a everything every decision you make is informed by your beliefs and so as you're making these decisions on a used to be honest with your audience about what it is you believe so they know what they're getting when they get there and then you can still tell the truth start accent\nAccuracy rate but the point is is that the all of these media outlets claimed to be objective they claim to be the sole truth but they're not they're coming from a perspective where they're all trying to take down Trump and that's their choice they can\nThey can put forward that point of view as much as they want to hear that their their company right like CNN fine your mission is to take out President Trump just tell the people that just be honest with\nHonesty is the best policy twenty three times on the job for radio network where we met boy we used to political editor of Breitbart News\nGood to go So Matt\nThese midterms coming up if Kavanaugh against confirmed on ... on a Saturday and I and I think you will uh we've just kind of do generic poll coming out by quite a pack and it shows that\nThe enthusiasm gap that the Democrats enjoy plus sixteen has been taught to plus for weaving in that the generic ballot a\nCongressional house ballot was Democrats plus fourteen three weeks ago that's cut in half its plus seven is there a comeback in the making for Republican yeah I think\nThere and by the way there is a mayor is Paul uh from NPR PBS out yesterday that I think it was something like back in the summer it was the Democrats\nHad a ... point a I'm a enthusiasm gap a manager now that now it's it's it's statistically tied they're going to point advantage to the point is that we're seeing lots of evidence\nA and we're also seeing in particular\nRaces right like so in North Dakota it looked like Heidi Heitkamp isn't coming back to Washington okay there's meant now to Paul there was one poll the other day\nA that had her down ten points there is a poll that came out last night that had are down while point to Republican Kevin Cramer were seen in ... in Tennessee Marsha Blackburn is now pulling away the latest poll last night from Fox News had Marsha Blackburn pulling five points ahead\nOr were seen Senate race Senate raised the Republicans are gainfully Josh holidays tied up with Claire McCaskill in Missouri we're seeing Mike Braun tied with a\nJoe Donnelly in Indiana we're seeing Matt Rosendale hybrid Jon Tester in Montana so if these ... I think what will happen is and there's plenty plenty of other ones across the country as well the printing is is that\nWhen judge Kavanaugh is confirmed to the United States Supreme court it's going to buy in a way that we haven't seen even in this latest energy\nOn the Republican side it's going to electrify the nation so much so that all these tires were going to start turning into five point Republican rates right like I think you're going to start seeing the energy on the geo piece died uh uh\nJust electrified after a after a judge Kavanaugh gets confirmed people where it's going to fire people up and it's going to deflate the Democratic base\nI don't think to get the Trump base fired up which I Am very familiar oh because that's based on my list or\nThere's nothing I could have done and there's nothing that there's no big enough rally the president could have had\nThere's nothing his campaign team could have done to light a match under Trump voters like this Kavanaugh saying did\nI mean so many people just watch this an absolute horror disbelieve the shenanigans in the clowns show that went on in the Democratic districts many I think it's fired people often\nThe high camp was what you were saying that she was like tied down by one and it was like\nShe was going down by like a couple of points now right now it's down ten to twelve\nYes every poll she's down by twelve she's done or she's going to get reelected mansion was way ahead ride was up by twelve Fifteen now is that by trade and more she's going to beat him I don't care what match dot because Trump voters have been far enough so they're going to win that they're going to win North Carolina\nThey're going to be Donnelly and they're going to be dominated the Indiana to going to beat me ... Missouri [noise] she's going to lose a the astronaut in Florida he's going to lose I could see the Republicans if Kavanaugh wins Matt\nI can see the pick it up five seats or even six in the Senate fibers the ad\nIn the way the math works right now Republicans to come out the other hand but anyway I think sixty four to seven seats in the U.S [noise] uh depending on how things go they've got a whole sports so they've got to hold Nevada Arizona Tennessee in practice\nAnd I think they're going to do that you are and then I think and then they have\nThen there's a bunch of others that are by like I said Indiana or a Missouri Montana\nA West Virginia or Florida or North Dakota a and there's several others on the on the map as well in fact even in New Jersey [noise] why we've seen a number of all of a sudden the New Jersey Senate race in the week in fact there was one yesterday that ... a man that is the Democrat\nOnly up one point I so the fact is is that there's an Ohio was on the map or what Michigan or Wisconsin there's plenty of opportunities for Republicans are and they could conceivably you got into the high if they if they play their cards right there\nIf uh if I guess you're from Saturday the Republicans can pick up six seats and run the table I'm never can look up from New Jersey I I don't believe any of the polls there and then that's going to win the Democrats are always went in there\nBut you know maybe I'll be shocked but I think I think they're going to run the table and everything else and it's got to be a fun night but he's got to get tougher because\nIf he's not the the opposite happened if he's not just from everybody that I haven't talked to on my show says there they're going to be really passed and dampen the Trump voter enthusiasm so there's a lot of states map boil\nAlways good to have you man and get your perspective you can follow Matt or just go to Breitbart News and that's the after you want to download their that for every day just pop that they get all the top story there and they have opinion in perspective\nBreitbart News or go to Breitbart top\nMatt ... political letter or thanks for being with your calls when I get\nAnd just one person out there there was a never ending thing they're like you find it to be surprising there was never\nA corroborating when I hear that here's what the Democrats have some trend of Kavanaugh when he was in high school that wasn't the jocks city with a jock and he was a bully and he made fun of the kids at Stanford\nAnd the ... and the football team used to push kids against the locker even though Kevin don't ever pushed anybody gets a locker he would kind of part of them in eastern or on the left\nAnd he made fun of the guy that started now I guess he campaigned confirmed for the Senate because he made fun of the federal guy [noise] now let's see I stutter and I've been made fun of my entire adolescent life [laughter]\nI don't hold that against anybody and uh it is what it is you know you start right so you get made fun of and do you deal with it so let's not vote for him because when he was in high school in somebody's center they made fun of it\nIt's just and it's becoming it is really becoming theater of the ... regime absurd I mean it's like Ripley believe it or not when you go in there and you know you see the shrunken head and stuff like this like ...

trade and manufacturing Peter you're my\nHero it's great to have [laughter]\nVery high in fat appreciate the praise my friend but you're you're doing the work out there getting the message out and the message this week was basically a great deal not just for America but North America the president\nIs just an amazing guy because he actually keep the promises that he may ... concept for a politician and he promised\nBack in June the twenty six and he would renegotiate or that NAFTA deal NAFTA is now dead now have the U.S Mexico Canada agreement and it's great news for workers in the factory industry as well as farmers and\nInnovators and when we go through some of the some of the elements of it if you want but yes top line is great for America [noise]\nLet me start with I I Want to get to the elements and as you know [laughter] you know well because he talks many times I Nasser from day one\nFirst came out and I always said that Ross Perot the other day he was corking but he had that sucking Saturday that now that's exactly what happened so I never thought it was that they would go and so to me Sunday night was like Christmas but\nI work at the un on Wednesday I so I just want you to spend two minutes on this and then we can get to the specifics of the deal I was in New York on one thing was that the president's alive press conference and it was fascinating because somebody asked him about\nHis negotiations there with Canada\nAnd one of the questions was prime minister Trudeau asked for your turn it down is that true and he said absolutely\nAnd then he said not only did I turn the meeting down I've instructed my twin team just stop and go see any with Canada\nThey're not shooting in good faith\nI don't appreciate how they're going about this they don't understand\nThe stakes here and so I've told them we're going to go into Mexico and maybe they'll come back to the table some other time but I said stop negotiating with them where that was Wednesday Sunday night you get a deal what happened [noise]\nNinety nine percent of the deal was done based on a framework lay down with uh the Mexico deal member um some weeks ago we entered into a bilateral with Mexico and that he had all the high notes hit\nSample of in the manufacturing space a strong domestic content and the cars rebuild running it hit market access for agricultural products that hit the notes for protecting digital trade and so called biologics which you're pharmaceuticals [noise]\nUh at at the modern the end of the spectrum\nThat we were still a little a little part on a couple of things like Gary and some dispute resolution mechanisms are and I yeah I I said this on the air on TV and radio you know I was puzzled why was taking so long\nTo get to um agreement that really benefited all three countries so I mean at the end of the day\nLike in this to a boxing match were were a lot of punches I get thrown but it the matches over now they're all three parties raised up their hands and\nAnd try them and I'm like that thing that that that abomination that they signed in Nineteen Ninety four for NAFTA [noise] um this is actually good for America what a concept\nI Know right where with Peter and\nIf it is I mean I'm telling you you know this better than I I mean NAFTA was a bad deal for America America China getting into the WTO and two thousand one which was pushed by by Clinton in Congress that deal for America\nTwelve south Korean deal I mean we lost over a hundred thousand jobs are merely auto industry that deal for America I mean the president is line in these things up a well like uh the pins in a bowling alley and knocking\nTo the president's for trade in manufacturing and the west wing he's also a senior economic policy adviser\nPeter Navarro let's get to some of the items in this new deal the U.S MCA U.S Mexico Canada or some of the differences some changes if you could go through some of the bigger ones that would be great\nSure let's start with the easy stuff which is the modernization in agreement back in Nineteen Ninety four there were some things that didn't exist and therefore did need a provisions are one of them obviously is digital trained which is the protection\nOf of copyright Perino actual property to transfer to do within that something as simple as a as an electronic book you might might buy and read have strong provisions or for that there's a there's these things called biologics which is a reference to\nA gig complicated of pharmaceuticals are very\nResearch intensive that are designed a overtime to cure things like cancer rheumatoid arthritis or whatever and uh we got a strong protections for that up to\nTen years why is that important is because unless company have protection a so that they can make some money on these things over a period of time or they won't put in the money for the research and development so so that's that's all good uh so so innovators are taken care of\nA digital trays taking care of now um another a small but important thing relatives the scope of the whole deal\nUh we were able to resolve some of the dairy issues with Canada and so uh that's good news will have much more market access there as well as for other types of products like chicken and egg things like that so that's good for me\nAs a director of the office of trade manufacturing policy or the the the big white whale here that we actually got was a bringing back the supply chain to North America particularly for the auto industry with NAFTA did\nIn Nineteen Ninety four is creative set of incentives to offshore our auto parts industry in turn or vertically integrated manufacturing auto plants into assembly plants performed parts and that\nDidn't just happen here in the U.S it happened in Canada and Mexico as well so the key provision is Seventy five percent of the of any car that that are made has\nTo have a a\nA U.S part Seventy five percent and then to ensure that the u._s. gets its fair share of that regional contraband or there's a strong provision for labor in their strong provision for the environment so you can't have sweatshops and pollution have in South of a border grabbing that business\nSo that's kind of dramatically change the structure and ...\nThe largest purchaser of vehicles are per capita a will benefit from that so that that's that's that's the big deal it's it's great news for this country\nAnd she didn't have our or they're also safeguards that would discourage China for instance from jumping into Canada\nAnd then bringing them into the U.S by a third party which they've been great\nIndustry question yeah yes there are a and\nI'm ... ... ... if you'd be enhanced border for a review and things like that but there's also a couple of provisions in there which which are going to be part of any agreement that we sign that\nThat are directly ah aimed at the unfair trade practices in China for example there's in the jargon they called disciplines they called the disciplines on state owned enterprises being able to enter enter the zone\nAnd uh China is kind of the leading purveyor of state owned enterprises that engaging unfair trade practices but it's also a provision in their\nPR currency manipulation a and again there's a lot of countries out there that purposely undervalue their currency is way of\nBoosting their exports discouraging our exports to\nThem and trade deficit so if you look at this thing it it just the green and um we see it uh both as a great deal in and of itself but we also see it as the most sophisticated cutting edge template for\nFuture agreements in by the way I'd bury the lead here it is the largest at one point you trillion dollars it's the largest trade deal the U.S has ever entered into and the fact that it's a good deal for America a means that a big is good here [noise]", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Laura Ingraham Show", "city": "Portsmouth", "day": "04"}
