get involved you know vote through your parking or whatever who you're voting for votes for somebody but you got to get involved Congress when\nWe got a upwards of ... thousand people in Mexico from uh South America in a caravan expected to be ten thousand hits the U.S from rushing the border many Democrats\nAre saying hey have a heart letter minutes it's all good they walk better jobs and a better life however when they step foot in the country they break the law because they have no people\nAre so there are legal so they didn't go through the system however when the second footsteps and uh\nThen there's three other laws that protect\nHim basically saying if they claim asylum and you can throw them out you have the process you can only hold him for twenty days you can't separate their children after twenty days what do you camp projects him so they're simply released and\nThey disappear into the interior of the country some people say ten thousand today a hundred thousand tomorrow what is your position congressman on a caravan\nYeah well my my position is that cannot happen\nI one of the readers on her ... year Steyer after we one of my big electric four years ago there was a huge energy bills all through Congress that went down\nIn flames the next day and so are you saying are fairly clear on it just the last thing that we're talking about pillows over in a commercial with pillows you back in the primary both of them together promoting a progressive I hearing die together and that's what you're going to get right with the Democrats\nMy opponent doesn't want to say that in the status district but she says everything is not the main terms right she says you're glad everybody here and we got to have a legal halfway\nThrough here as long as people work et cetera that means that care mansion come in open borders she won't say otherwise you won't give it up or pound she's for sanctuary cities which is even worse she won't come out and say that instead she praises it in the negative she says we should force federal law just less localities\nDeal with caravans coming in to the country went under the constitution the federal government has given that specific authority here and so I don't think people\nGet the severity of what he's actually saying she's not saying don't follow federal law she think less ignore the law of the land is running as a law enforcement candidate spring let's not follow the law of the land and that's probably why I\nHave the support of the fraternal order of police down here and if you go talk to the sheriff's they're horrified right they have to deal with the massive inflow withdraws three hundred million lethal doses affecting all came across the border just this year and then human trafficking uh basically a human\nTo medieval that's coming through the border and all of our share of snow about it and not the people are starting to see the real impact most families parents\nHave to face to face a terrible scenario with a loved one with the drug addiction opioid heroines off the fence knowledge sat around and hit spreading through the seventh district and he is every sheriff will tell you that and so\nYou couldn't have a more stark comparison right the Democrats open borders or not and then who plays all the costs who pays education emergency rooms welfare scores are the taxpayer dollars or so Democrats\nAre most everybody to come in they want to get more votes signed the American taxpayer pays the bills and and uh you know that that should be construed\nAs being anti immigrant we're a nation of immigrants we just we have a legal system for a million immigrants per year a hit this country is a melting pot all the people that want to come are all children of God\nBut that it has to get on legally the reason they're leading Guatemala\nAnd Honduras El Salvador's because of the rule of law has broken down\nAnd if you look at the blue states that people are moving from blue states to red states the reason they're leaving blue states and blue cities like San Francisco Chicago and New York it's a crime is rampant in Democrats precincts they are not good rule of law they say they are and\nNot all the evidence shows it's very clear where people are moving they're moving to red states and then a lot of those plugs for blue wants to change the red states and turn a political set your kid makes no sense I think the American people are starting to get a real handle on how all these things are hurting their lives in this demanding change\nSo cumbersome specifically what should be done to stop the care of and you say you want to stop it what specifically should we do is to stop him from entering the in the United states\nYeah well it it's like you had to catch him or at least is incredibly problematic once you put one foot here under US law you're given a certain news is this legal status\nWho so you got to keep that from happening and so the president is doing the right thing working with Mexico that she writes Mexico has offered asylum the books are coming from Guatemala Honduras et cetera search that if they're really seeking asylum you go to the first neighboring country which show that short solve the problem\nWith our folks are saying right and they've been interviewed\nOr do we want jobs ... jobs is not asylum when they harm or repression from your government fan so what we've got to get it straight I think the White House is a mess and ah we we need to change the law and and this will again\nIf you show the American people he can you imagine if you say yes or the caravan\nYou're sending a message to eight billion more people on the planet\nThat hey United States has a generous welfare safe all you got to do with his ... and you'll see ignore the rule of law a comment here highway through Mexico takes you ignore the rule of law there are large into the U.S firms that you're you get\nAll the titles to hurt either the welfare programs education pre emergency real everything and they're taxpayers got to pay for it\nAnd it's it's that simple American people have to reject that or will lose the rule of law in this country\nOn a time I would have said Congressman James rats for being with us\nI'm way mid term rates very very close they were at a job but thank you for being with us really well again next week of the things

Bush said to his father within the con\nHave tried they are one of the ... of a set of communication between the two uh Bush sent to a they routed kind of kind of ... and Bush said a push it and it says can I ask a question what's the name calling and the father says\nThrough on names or a description and the president says I'll take a description and he says I'll give it showed one what Israel which is interesting on all levels including the confirmation without president doesn't really need to read the newspapers\nExplain what you mean when you say that and how do you know that this conversation took place why you know\nWhat I call it really say who told me but I ... if someone who was I have absolute confidence and better than that I'm a type of telling the truth and also in that position to be aware of this conversation\nDenver a\nThat was Leslie Coburn husband uh now now here's injected himself and his campaign made fun of your military service and things of that nature so he's now open fodder I'm he's also the author\nOf the book or dangerously liaisons with his wife your party running for Congress or does that sound a bit and say some that encourages me\nI mean you know for for for this um it seems like since I wrote the book the one thing that I noticed when I when I listen to something read some things when I Do any type of analysis you consider the source\nAnd it's the same thing that they do it in their book also they had some sources that would say like you did he just said there\nAt the end that um he he had somebody he couldn't say the name of it was but it was somebody right and that's what they even did in their book like that anonymous letter from Nineteen eighty four and it just seems like there's this there's this willingness to go on to conspiracy for two again personally demonize people or again this this whole\nThing that always comes back to anti Israel use it it just always sort of swings back around\nThis way and I'm actually scratch my head that this was even taken seriously fights\nThe fact that they have real issues with which were like with me but also with things like you just heard I mean it just sounds it just sounds crazy and uh you know and I've been so careful in the last couple of weeks we've been trying to move back you know just make sure its policy because we'd been personally attacked so much\nA but it just seems to me that they have a real issue with Israel\nAnd not only a real issue with Israel they have a real issue with sourcing and they have a real a real love conspiracy theories and it just seems like this is sort of the air mo so since dangerous liaison or even before that because you know their history really isn't free markets either so it's just a very interesting thing you need to hear you know\nThis lack of sourcing it always goes back to the anti Israel and the sort of bizarre thing of destroying everybody personally by you know by implying that George W. Bush is stupid or that somebody actually would tell him what's going on between the conversation between Bush and Bush senior it's ludicrous ... and I think that's where I Want to just let\nIt is and er but it it seems to be whatever you did something up on these people and it gets back to anti Israel anti Semite anti uh anti\nShoot always assumed that the only factor that\nAlways always you're always it always rolls back around that we did was that really the question you know about you know what's in it that's what he wanted to go back to was in Israel and and to me that's that was the whole basis of what he wanted to get to not\nJust that George W. Bush you know had a issues with white knowing what a neo cod was or not the fact that they had a source that he can't obviously talk about which seems to be what happens when all the way back to this anti Israel thing and and just you get to the point you're just you shake your head and you had enough and I think most people\nMost people realize what's going on there aren't a\nI'm going to run a couple of other clubs here from Culver and I want to get your reaction to here's one she did a radio show obviously they will not do mine [laughter] but they did a radio show in the er which for Gary of pride in a race where\nAh they they after Brian asked her about her negative comments on making fun of your military service reps from that I Want to get your reaction to this Mike I'm military service cuts to\nThe to your husband Andrew posted on Twitter as somebody what he's talking about Mr Eagleman risking my power snorkeling OCU Garcia a cheap shot at his service in the air force I mean do you do not come in\nYou know I I got there I think that that we all get back in in certain thing that's country I think I served as well as a journalist so out of having spent priced out a lot of time in Afghanistan I mean I think it's important\nTo recognize that it was so then I think you know ... it's pretty hard last merit\nHawk what people actually cared about getting a distracted\nWell so if it's way off in a while with her husband tweet that out and bring into question your military service and I mean I don't think being a journalist has the same thing is trying to plan as nations so what is up for this lady\nIt's so funny you ask request\nJob extremists hip hop each [laughter] and it has about Halloween costume on there and has marchers you know going through Charlottesville um they're just so out of touch and there are so absolutely have no idea what to fit that cares about because they actually don't live here I mean this\nIs this is really what we get down to the root of the issues that okay let's let's just demeans somebody like they just said with George W. Bush which demean change the subject and then say something that's completely litter fresh that that is the this is the whole progressive left game plan also\nIt's just over and over and over again that that the district doesn't care about it amazing amount of veterans in the district they know who I Am the fact that somebody would tweak something like that means or out\nOf touch elitist has no clue what's going on in the real world and sometimes I get angry about you know it's because you're just sort of looking at this what are you really saying this and nobody cares about to enter your waiting journalism to my veteran\nStatus or you're ... you're being a journalist to people that have to serve you look over their shoulders are kids are crying on the flight line while you're getting on a plane\nWhere your order to do things where you don't get a chance to be in the Green Zone surrounded by people\nWrite that are protecting used we can do a story and you can leave any time there is it's a false equivalence data in it and it's it it actually implies a type of cognitive dissonance that you can't even\nReally get your arms around because you know I could I can say anything to make anything a few jobs but the fact that that she would sit on a radio show ... ... and and say hey God bless her she's just defending her husband's border what her husband did say that to my face you know if you if you know everybody hides behind\nMet her on social media and that's the thing that we have\nThe day social media has created sort of this this this mob of passive", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Laura Ingraham Show", "city": "Portsmouth", "day": "30"}
