that he works for the Washington Post then growing or that the Trump\nAdministration is in a bad position would have to react and no one actually considering that you got all the media organizations that are making that are close to ... and um the Democrats were were were making a lot of noise about Yemen before that because they're saying that the U.S\nMust stop supporting Saudi Arabia militarily I mean that wouldn't follow up relations with Saudi Arabia from the get go and not a you know I I I couldn't possibly divorce was from the political implications of it [noise]\nOkay so we don't know\nWhere he is your contending that let's jump to conclusions you may be fine and this may be part of the bigger picture or maybe he's in the hands of someone else then abducted him and that tended on the Saudis who are of course are\nSaying that he left the embassy but they can't show footage of him leaving the embassy because you have to check on if you're constantly you've got me in cameras all over the place or you have to do was released the for the judge shows and leaving and then they have a good day I don't know\nWhat happened to him not our problem is you know things now produce that that's a problem\nYes that's right I agree with you on and I I I'm dismayed about this too but I have heard from the Egyptians and obviously they um our allies in Saudi Arabia and they don't want to say anything bad about Saudi Arabia their their argument basically that that you know people in the Egyptian system I I've spoken with has said that\nThe Saudis are intelligent people are not that stupid that they would knock him off and I I think that's that's true and there are a lot of their theory is\nThat a lot of that there are other parties that would have wanted to follow up relations between Saudi Arabia and the U.S that would have um you know wouldn't would not have thought twice about stopping to kill someone like some of the democracy will be assuming that's what happened which we don't know [noise]\nOkay so um [noise] your advice here is wait and see don't jump to conclusions or I get that I'll take that uh for what it stands for let's get to the China Interpol situation right so we've got the\nOf Interpol who was a Chinese national goes to China and now he gets arrested um\nIt's inconceivable to me that he wouldn't even gone\nI mean why do you go there to protect yourself at risk you know if you go there there's there's a high chance you gonna get abducted by the communist government\nSo my question is why on earth did he go and\nWhat happens now\nWell according to all the media reports he is a government official he's the deputy or intelligence minister I think at some point someone who's a government official is obliged to return to this country as a matter of course whether he likes it or not um\nAlthough I mean he could have he he could have resigned from that position or it could have resigned I mean he could have remained in France\nThe French are very upset about that\nPerhaps a calculated risk and he thought something could happen but you know hope that wouldn't turn down\nAnd got caught I'm\nSad situation obviously the Chinese government was very proud to name him or have him name has had to enter calls so clearly what did whatever it is that they have against them has to be very powerful for them to do that\nConsidering that they were proud of having their own national as the head of Interpol\nSo uh you're right I mean that's that's good that's good and they were they were very happy that he was named to that position um\nAnd it comes back and now they've arrested him for what they say a corruption bribery things of that nature so\nWhenever they've got 'em on whatever you did that they didn't like you said must be big because of you know they they didn't really want to give up that not to mention of authority they haven't even looked being being in the head of Enron Interpol in France under\nExtreme or audience how big of a position [noise]\nWell it is a bit her Mario in terms of the actual cloud that he had me he doesn't run in the day to day operations is at the bottom I mean the people who are putting out the warrants and things like that [noise] um\nBut he is a publicly highly public visible person who would get a great deal play in Europe in the media um and clearly gives a positive impression of China to the world um to at least\nThe European our audience here in America are probably of the American media doesn't cover him that well but he he is well covered in ...\nUm yeah I mean he does a and this one of the worries when he was named in two thousand and sixteen was that\nHe could possibly have an influence on rounding up Chinese dissident across the world that has been proven to be the case so far as we know of but as I said because he doesn't have the day to day operations in hand\nSo let's get back to the U.S can flip let's get back to jump on them and the Saudis issue wasting Edward make a projection how do you see it playing out\n\nI'm I'm I'm hoping to know him\nThat he will surface in Riyadh and that they will be ... be holding on to him and that they will be willing to release them after all this pressure as they did or what the former with the Lebanese prime minister Saad Hariri was right or detained him maybe six to eight months ago I guess right beginning of\nThe year yeah so I'm hoping that's what happened\nTo go see it will play out where it's great to have your perspective is certainly a different perspective than we've gotten from other legacy media of this and certainly the Washington Post New York times are going to be\nAdam Schiff head of Democratic House intel ranking member there for a very costly tweet out last evening

with a couple of things you associate with Steve Bannon packing told me that and then also job creators network um but tell me\nWhat you see happening\nOut there you did a poll the other day saying things are changing because of the Kavanaugh situation can you share with your audience John McLaughlin what that is\nWell are you sure what it is is is that um I think the whole cabinet situation was more than just the Supreme Court [noise]\nIt was really a play or by Chuck Schumer and the Democrats who've tried to win the Senate and when you look at the field of Senate seats that are above the thirty five Senate seats that are up this year\nTwenty six are in states that that uh uh are held by Democrats Tony fix the seats and tear though the seat of the Democratic seats are in states that Trump won by a\nOne in the twenties sixteen presidential election so midterm elections are decided by people that are coming out that that may voted in the presidential but a lot of the people that vote in the presidential\nDon't come out in the mid term so when Trump ringer and our strategy was was to bring out millions of new voters that Mitt Romney didn't appeal to get them to come out and vote for him until we got a hundred and thirty nine million voters which has nine million more than came out for Obama Romney\nAnd those voters voted overwhelmingly for Trump particularly in the heartland of the country where there was some built for the rust belt\nAnd in the mid term you only get about Ninety million people voting so it's\nThe sixteenth three million voters who came after Trump coming out more heavily\nIn the mid term the Democrats are going to lose a lot of things for the U.S Senate side think Schumer play gamble to try to suppress the Trump thought where if the Republicans get embarrassed and half the poll cabinet or if the Republicans don't provide the votes he needs to get confirmed than the Trump voters will be dead at\nOur own party and not self millions of Trump voters stayed home a shovel or would have a play to win the Senate where he'd keep his Democratic seats impossibly when a tendency Nevada Arizona and uh\nPeople who next speaker and by the way that the polling took her a whole lot of times with a a pact that was a bipartisan projects the ... project with the ban and where you could see it in the numbers Nancy Pelosi still very unpopular September\nShowing her thirty percent favorable numbers ... here find unfair to vote and the vast majority\nOf voters don't want her to become the next speaker of the uh you know the Republicans whatever reasons aren't cleaning that up to where they should\nI mean a lot of the house candidates will challenge to placebo districts [noise] but you really should have their you know when you think about it you could have a a a gender where she\nWants basically she wants to open borders she was the was increased taxes she wants to weaken security I mean everything stance towards the antithesis to the majority of voters right now and he's going to\nBe the face of the Democratic party if they take over the house if they take over the house means to pull those who will be the most powerful Democrat in the country and in Washington [noise]\nSometimes I think she has said on numerous occasions that she's going to be the speaker and she said even the other day a\nLet those people that are running as Democrats say what they want at the end of the day I'm going to be the speaker I have the votes in the caucus and it was like do you have to do to win but then I'm going to be your speaker where would win with John McLaughlin a CEO and a partner\nOf his polling firm and John has worked professionally has a strategic consultant and pollster for over three decades about how long I Know John and he's worked on\nA presidential campaign starting with our favorite Steve Forbes Fred Thompson\nMany many others so great to have with us he was also involved in the governor Nathan Deal campaign\nNumber two thousand and ten and I was covering that when I ran to begin in a\nIn a in the Atlanta market the newspaper there so a lot of interesting things that he's been involved in it now he's doing work was patted down with others to try to figure out what is going on in the midterms here John\nLet's get to let's get to the\nName of the house summit so based on the generic polling I when I\nPackage that was on a couple of weeks ago he told me something he said for the Democrats control the house pat canal said the generic ballot\nHas to be [noise] I'm\nMinimal twelve he said for them to gain seats they need to gain the the twenty five seats to gain the house because he said if it's under twelve what happens is a lot of those polls are in districts where the Democrats are way ahead and uh in California and New York and cetera\nSo he said basically it's gotta be twelve or right\nThe real politics average has been about\nNow says it even possible\nIt's possible but at like we had free cabin or we we release separately than than than we do our own monthly tracking national national tracking surveillance on them it's on our website McLaughlin online dot com\nAnd uh so if you go to McLaughlin online dot com you'll see these numbers but the but with ... uh he's got a point I don't think it's called but I think it's close to the sex and they write about there we surveyed that would you compare August September\nWe can with thousands of likely voters across the country and August there were times forty four forty four Republicans or Democrats in September of the day before the cabinet are hearings we were down for the Democrats were hit forty six to forty two uh the president in ... a ... hour cruel and falling from forty to forty six\nAnd the difference is since capital those Republicans that the Democrats are trying to\nYou know depressed and have not come out the Republicans have they been Trump voters or have them knock around uh they've been re energized and the the pollsters have seen these come back into states where Trump won like we had a poll this week last week where\nAre the Republican with the head of a Democrat McCaskill in Missouri by eight points there's been other media polls where Indiana's a dead heat Montana's a dead heat everybody knows that how you can't Heitkamp is downtown in North Dakota the seasonal is Joe Manchin must have ... so he switched his vote\nBut on the house side the Democrats and and the reason I say it's probably closer to six because the Democrats in two thousand and six when they took the house from us if they are they only got fifty two percent of the national vote the forty eight fifty to cause us to lose over thirty feet and lose the house\nNow twenty ... we had a better reapportionment\nBut still the and a lot of the sea from place to put a lot of the seats that are that are a defining over an hour open Republican seats without an incumbent and you also have a bit of a the anti Trump voters are more organically are likely to come out than the pro Trump voters to filter out\nThe president's doing a great job or jobs would be great if\nThey think they're all in the same poll they say the economy's getting better fifty seven percent to thirty two percent so some of the people don't realize what's at stake if the Democrats take over the house and our voters were less motivated or before\nThe capital here now they're coming back in and you can see it in some of the polls but you've got four weeks ago which showed a lifetime in politics yes so uh so yeah so it does then this is the Republicans need to be a lot more aggressive and do a lot more contrast with what the Nancy Pelosi Democrats would do to this country versus what the president has accomplished\nTwenty eight days to go before the midterms were with a long time noted pollster John McLaughlin you can follow his uh his polling information going among McLaughlin\nCom that's McLaughlin online\nSo John if you have to predict now twenty eight days out based on\nData you've seen who wins the house and by how many\nDo we actually pick up as it is a is it an underperforming gain of one to two seats or do you pick up three four or five seats so the Senate looks pretty good because of the battleground that the the number of Democrats he set her up this time\nThe house is a much different store where the ... on that you know most generic ballots the Democrats are ahead right right now and it's too close to call was four weeks to go with the Republicans running black lost her you know get out the vote no
