the ... have been in a minute when he comes on last night in colpepper at the chamber of commerce\nAnd uh I have to tell you unequivocally I thought it was a resounding victory for congressman Dave Brat over spanberger in that debate I really no idea what spanberger was doing other than trying to write some way even to Congress by saying nothing\nAnd or\nEither that or she doesn't have anything to say but it was almost like yeah Dave I'm kind of for that but not a hundred percent for that I'm not really sure what I really couldn't figure anything other than I Am now absolutely convinced that she did work for the CIA after she attended a hundred and twenty times\nJoining us now the debate champ from last evening congressman Dr David Brat he's Republican represents the seventh district of Virginia He's running for a third term uh that'll be decided on November snakes and he'd debated his Democratic opponent\nAbigail Spanberger last night congressman good to have you with us thanks for having me John they\nAll the feedback from your debate understand from the people I've talked in when some of the media said that you had a very very still her performance last night congressman what are some things stood out for a for you in last night's debate\n[noise] yeah well I I just think that contrast between you know proven results that were then [noise] she put you know thirty second community\nWhere you can memorize millions and millions of dollars core I never meant to advance a colossal pack and all that\nThere's no coherent whole and so we try to show that she found a record and people can go look it up and I hope everybody goes in watches the\nDebate right the year the voters do watch cricket I once you get because I think it\nWas very stark can't so we just went through the issue by issue by your shoe on the economic the economy is booming\nAs a reporter was fired for probably doing news stories on a in a balanced way and so why [noise]\nThat's problematic so we're we're working on the tails and it won't work through them I I haven't found anything yet\nAnd I wanted to draw people's attention today to Politico article it's on it's up on political right now at that frames the guy Nancy Pelosi liberal agenda as well as you can do right that's what I was talking about last night don't look at that political political articles on line everybody\nAnd that gets to play about her my opponent and every Democrat nationwide\nAnd you can watch that they see her go issue by issued by issue to all our economy and she's trying to run and hide her position at the Democrat positions are all their their her position\nOn right\nSame the same as the website on our own website and it's fascinating to see the wind up of the Nancy Pelosi playbook and then my opponents strategy it's a one for one match\nOur I've only got a minute because you you you have to go so we get too quick question with thirty second answers so is my radio debate which was a big number three is that still in play\nYeah yeah everything's everything's still in play and I think I Am like down for my next interview John\nI just just one quick answer sure one thing you learned about Abigail Spanberger last night that you really liked one thing\nYeah sure where her dedication to the country working at the CIA [noise] and she's she's a mom in down by you know in my neighborhood area that you know lost their kids and wants to serve the country and that's that's a huge commitment it's one that's willing to follow that calling I commend her service\nAll right we're at a time more information Dave Brat dot com congressman thanks for being with us\n[noise] alright they broke down\nOne nice thing to say about Abigail Fisher is a great mom and a respect to the fact that she wanted to serve her country so that's really good and I always try to get the positive out here because ... is a very nice lady no oh no question about it and\nLook running for Congress in

rap when it gets back yard rivers radio network truck in the truth across America\nIn theory really now what about liberal Democrats Abigail Spanberger\nAnd her policies mountain we\nKnow she didn't

found your home with the truth\n[laughter] with\nThe best analysis in America\nAnd now back to the John fresher it's\nTo have you back during the Johnson as radio networks so you're from Dave\nBrat saying that he thought he did very well the last night's debate I think the one thing that he laid out is really spanberger securely he'll here which is as I watched the debate she didn't really put together a\nConnected coherent message and it's a lot of soundbites and you know she's in a very as I said she's a walking a tightrope here is the season a Republican leaning district that\nWent against last year's two thousand Seventeen demographic crash in Virginia blue wave of all time oh it's still went for the last three by three\nThree and a half million dollars this past quarter so to speak to her campaign has got to be able to spend their money on\nWhatever they need they have a ton of money and that's an advantage just not be a it's it's not the um the final answer but\nWhen you've got a cornucopia of resources at your disposal in the last Twenty one days and the campaign you you gotta lotta options\nSo she has a lot of options but it seemed like she was playing last night's debate not to lose like don't say anything dumb or just ride the wave and she was okay you know um but she's going more on\nHey I'm a CIA person I've served my country I'm a mom I'm great I'm smart I'm cool and a little lighter on the issue I mean ... all about the issues and I think you know when you have this kind of an economy that you're back he's got the advantage [noise]\nSo um I don't think ... doing anything to help herself last night but I don't think she's anything to hurt herself so I think if you went into this debate and you are not going to vote for the Republican candidate you are not going to vote for days\nI think you came out of it and you're not going to vote for me I don't think like David changed any minds of as being anti\nOr of the the the blue waivers and the liberal moms have Chesterfield and all that stuff I don't think you changed anything [noise] and I don't think Abigail hurt herself with her base now\nAh here's where I thought they did very very well anybody wavering like if you could really make a decision if you're a true independent\nAnd had an open mind last night uh\nSpanberger did nothing to get your vote so again she she just counting on this issue nominee sweeping or into power if you're an independent or a moderate Republican or a moderate Democrat and you are truly had major mind up\nAnd you saw this debate or you are more likely to vote for Dave after it then when it started you are not more likely to vote for spanberger and that's we have to look a debate\nOr you're more likely ended either\nEither neither candidate did anything to depressed their base [noise] both candidates [noise]\nI mean I think day fired his up a little bit more Abigail's kind of different styles she's a little more long winded she doesn't have\nA quick retort Dave has\nSo her communication style is different not worse or better just different and doesn't really up against brat\nAh he just it it gives them an advantage because of span burgers more low key more of a post communication style\nSo all of these things were playing into Dave's favor last night\nAnd I asked the question point blank well why don't you have other debates I mean I I for the life of me after last night's debate I Would think that they would call her up and say look we're scheduled debate every three ...\nIn the back of a cab I mean let's just debate but um you know consult joined control these campaigns and\nThey have their own way of doing things but hopefully there'll be other debates and you know he said something about somebody got fired and so they couldn't have this other debate but I didn't get fired and I still don't have a date and I can tell you for the radio debate that I proposed that both camps agreed to\nUh the holdup is not so bad over the span burger campus basically given a bunch of dates for this\nAnd the hold up is the ... campaign so let's just get that out there and I don't think I don't see how we're going to have it now because it's what October sixteenth I mean we got three weeks Twenty one days but I'll keep following up and we'll see what happens\nCortland asking coming up eight thirty five Jupiter right here [noise]\n\nThey allow on Iran [noise] we bonded cheap\nThat have been systematically undermining President Trump's America First agenda so November twenty second in DC all hell breaks loose\nQuarterly went down the great to have any man\nJohn I just [noise] without any information that is in public I think you're a hundred percent on on the Republicans are going to pick up seats in the U.S Senate seats\nThat however race you know people are talking about this like it's going to be a close election dean how it's going to win that race like four or five points it's not it's called the people think [noise]\nI think we're going to Arizona and John I'm going to sleep or some of the country right now nobody's talking about it we got an incredible running for the U.S Senate Michigan\nIs closer to having right now John James anybody predicted she now man he's an American small business owner and even going to win that Senate mentioning you mark my words\nSo you think that John James in Michigan has actually is shown to be standing about\nI think so about two months ago but this is the more the more I learned about the campaign story you complete me of what America should be he's\nGuilty of that stuff he was family still up in Detroit\nThree times was when he took over when he came back from his military service [noise] [noise] right [noise]\nWell I tell you what that is on nobody's radar screen Corey let's go over these races because I'm predicting right now that the Republicans are going to pick up five or six seats everybody says I'm Crazy obvious thing is for some time\nOr the tendency race Blackburn brothers than\nI'm Marcia pulling way ahead now in that race she is going to win that's going to be a whole remember tendency Corey Lewandowski was was one of those seats that the Republicans were did that the Democrats were Charlie about that they thought they could pick up that is now not gonna happen Blackburn way a way to ... ... what do you see there\nWas this [noise] Democrat [laughter] term [noise] chemical from Tennessee's Marsha Blackburn who's gonna win walking away\nRight she's up by ten thousand that's going to be a that's a that's\nThat's that's that's going to be a whole no question a let's get to and we we both believe that the Republicans are going to hold a\nArizona with Sally I don't even think that's going to be close or when it's all said and done and I think we're gonna we're gonna win Nevada\nAs I've been saying for some some time or let's get to Montana Jon Tester are being challenged by Matt Rosendale a re public the real clear politics has this about two or three within the margin of error\nI'm predicting Rosendale when when you see their\nRosen [noise] the polling has seen actually two points before President Trump goes out to do a campaign rally [noise] you know the president's doing a west coast where it's going to [noise] Arizona and Montana exclamation point on that Jon Tester become\nFormer U.S senator from Montana and looking at the new Republican\nPickup in Montana come three weeks from\nJosh Hawley are probably the biggest surprise for Republicans some people not sure that he was going to be the best candidate he's turned out to be a very good candidate\nRemember Claire McCaskill who won in a two thousand two well she beat Todd Akin whose campaign him at the end had told them ...\nOr she is now trailing to Hawley in a in the door\n[laughter] I don't want us over never underestimate Claire McCaskill who's raised twenty five million dollars of money but it was John [noise] something [noise] you know last Josh Claire McCaskill\nNow I Want to get to Florida Corey where with Cortland asking are we doing these predictions all the time obviously the majority of them here and he and I are spot on we probably have\nIn Florida all post show it very close within the margin of error Bill Nelson with a small lead\nWe don't know what the hurricane impact as governor of Florida is Ben Stiller with these hurricanes I mean he's got a rapid response team they get power on very quickly\nUm so we'll see how this plays out that the devastating hurricane in Panama City but I thought from the beginning Scott was going to win this race\nYou know I think I'll tell you what what are the much stronger than I thought it was going to I thought by now\nThree weeks ago Rick Scott the four or five points and he'd be starting to pull this racist you know you can't underestimate\nThe hurricane because people focus away rightly so from the lectures but that said you've got to accept it really well known individuals who both statewide\nExperience and a half from bill in front of the people of Florida and so this kind of type ... focus out\nBut if you would have told me with three weeks ago Rick Scott what do they not one or two points\nTo the public I Would say no to that goes to tell you the campaign that both Rick Scott is trying to run as fighting for because he wants to return to the U.S [noise]\nAll right I I thought that this race would always be tied up until the end I think I think Scott ... wins he's been a very popular governor\nAnd so I think he's he's got the narrative in the great state of North Dakota Heidi Heitkamp down ten or Thirteen I think that's over\nThat race is over Congress and Kramer would be calling senator Kramer very soon [noise]\nOkay so that that gets us to\nIndiana Joe Donnelly are still clinging to a slight lead over a Mike Braun\nUm I just don't see Indiana's returning Joe Donnelly in this climate that we have with the economy going so well I'm predicting that uh Donnelly goes on him Mike Braun win that seat once they are you\nI agree with you John look this is the vice president's home state he was out campaigning there this weekend it was this Friday and Saturday I as you know his brother is on the ballot in Indiana [noise]\nDoing so helping might run for that Senate race this is a big focus of instruction because of the vice president state the magistrate you know they can beat Donald nasty and so I\nThink you see brown come two weeks and open up his lead over sleepy Joe Donnelly\nOkay so I'm All right let's get the New Jersey I Know a couple about a month ago you said that might come into play and that was the ... up by ten Fifteen and he's going to\nYou know what I saw some internal numbers just don't want to reveal the hottest days when I saw the numbers and I guess I'd be scared to death you get this Republican\n[noise] if I had to flip a coin today\nI Would say yes this is going to [noise] the resources the Democrats have to put an end in sight keep them it's going to draw it out resources away from elsewhere and I'm not convinced that\nHe's short winter you look for in a five point race right now it's causing quickly\nSo um I don't think he's going to win so we can just click on that only because I'm from New Jersey and I just can't see them beat him and then there's but let me ask you this in West Virginia I'm I'm I'm really shocked at this I thought Morsi would be in a much better position against Joe mansion\nAnd then he is now but the most recent surveys that have come out mentioned is holding an eight nine point lead in that state there's ... those are the attorney general has any chance at older Corey\nWhat he does and part of the reason is because the Trump Pence\nTicket won that state by forty two points if there's any state that is Trump country I think it's fair to say that's West Virginia and you see\nThe amount of time that the president the vice president that in that state campaigning I Believe they're going to be in that state out both third congressional district that Senate race now every time the president and vice president goes in that state has\nAbout a month ago I was sitting at ... percent the president's been in a few times and now he's offering under fifty that the people of West Virginia and they

so\nUs and Mexico has jumped more than ten spots on the economic development with the international editor now number eleven we've made in Mexico rich with trade billions and billions of dollars millions of jobs\nAnd yet we still have twenty two million people in this country illegally the majority of the Mexican so I'm not attacking Mexico or Mexican people I'm just saying we've made in

great\nTo have you with this kind of a lot of fun ah Tucker Carlson a little clip there and he got a good point one third of Salvadorans living in the United states one way or the other legal you're illegal while they're hearing she'd given money or because it gets you know corruption is what's been\nThe NASA Newman said it's the corruption stupid all these countries are corrupt\nAnd now the new buzz word for the open borders crowded economic refugees now their economic reputation well there's four billion economic refugees across the globe that all want to come to the United states get housing get clothing get free medical care\nGet welfare again the bottom of phone\nGet a house get taken care of your blanket get food get school and get an education for billion let's just let them all in and then there's no country had goes bankrupt and then you're like everybody every other bankrupt country I mean it's absurd argument\nTheir economic refugees well there's four billion economic refugees across the globe you have a country or you don't\nThese open borders people they don't want in country this is the thing they don't want to country they don't want an America that won the United states\nThey just want to open borders and I don't know what did they think this money is going to come from\nBut in the short term political power and then eventually their vision\nIs because of that political power with all these four million people voting for them eventually that company or legal and vote and get the citizens\nAnd the company gets bankrupt you don't have the link and then you'll have the pet that's really the society they want\nA handful of liberal elite running the territory that was once the United states living very high on the hog making all the decisions drinking wine and cheese and caviar and flying around and helicopters\nWith all kinds of guards talk about gun control regards like crazy bodyguards armed guards tanker trucks machine gun the already protected and then everybody else will be fighting over food\nAnd there'll be the peasants that\nThey will rule over I mean that's what else can be a gender thing there's nothing and open borders agenda wipes out your country your culture your government it bankruptcy to wipe set out\nSo what other what other objective good at the then you have no country and the elites make all the decisions and they live in the matches with armed guards by the way they have a hundred percent ... guns\nEver need to protect them that's the liberal vision them they're the elites they make the decisions average people too stupid to have a job\nAnd they'll go in there and how much food there'll be food lion you stand on life for an hour and you get a bowl of soup\nAnd a cracker and they'll provide it and if you get to them you get a cracker and a half and that's their vision for you\nWith open borders I really can't think of what other visual and of course the people do but it's actually making billions of dollars and don't have their own island with armed guards because of the cheap labor because then people work for you know a dollar a day this is what this is what the open borders society is after\n\nSome kind of a global order where the elites are protected and they were all over the pro Terri\n\n[laughter] I mean is there is there any other explanation they could possibly happen this looks like Fifteen hundred people come into the United states in a caravan\nJust come in because their economic refugee who's not an economic reputation the entire African continent\nTo come here every one of them and the economic reputation all of South America could the economic reputation four billion people that don't have\nThe luxury ... we after the economic refugees\n\nSo where is this going and why isn't this on the ballot\nAnd why aren't we talking about this and jobs in the economy and why are we talking about this other nonsense like the hooker I mean why are we talking about this it's unbelievable to me\nTalking about losing control of the message Twenty one days out of the Republicans want to when they should be talking about two things keeping the sovereignty of your nation\nSo that you have in America for your children because it is being absorbed in going away and the liberals do water they don't want an American they weren't open borders\nGlobal a society no different here than in any other country or there are no countries just land masses and cheap labor I don't know what they what they should be talking about the great economy instead\nWe're talking about Stormy Daniels don't care about Stormy Daniels I don't care about the porn actress I don't care that is thank God I don't care about any of that going to jump the shark anything I'm tired of talking about that but\nYou can't get away from it because that disturbs the international order of things and if you have sovereign\nGovernments you need an international or otherwise you'd go to open borders and her doesn't matter the auto constantly this one world government I mean I don't know what the liberals are trying to do here with the open borders I really don't get I get what\nSo they can get all the money and buy an island and have guards and yeah I get that\nBut and I get in the short term so liberals want open borders they get cheap cheap pro cheaper labor but at some point\nIt breaks\nAnd then they have the power and then what do they do that while they go to some other type of society I don't know Obama said he wanted to transform America\nMaybe that's maybe just transform it I Can't figure it out maybe somebody can help me a name for you know John in in ... John if there's no borders no country\n\nSo you got Fifteen hundred people you your your cut their head off and then the military should go down at the border and not let them in because the consequences is the next time it's fifty thousand not Fifteen hundred\n\nHalf of them are going to make it over on on income or the other half will get\nApprehended and get caught and released fiber tempting to actually go back\nThe others don't show up and then they called her friends say I'm In I'm In wherever Denver here's my cell phone number oh this is from my mom's phone I guess you'd call for free and come over then the next week I got a house like in the bottom of phone I got for\nFood stamps welfare kids were in school they don't speak English but to bad\nSchool have to figure it out and a lot better than I was with having never\nEconomic refugee and by the way a let me fill out this farm here not checked a box and I'll do vote because the people I'm voting for will make sure that I stay here they I don't know who they are I Can't read English but I Can't read a day and asked them I don't know how to explain this maybe you've got a better a better\nAnswer to me I really don't know\nThey can Virginia Beach and they couldn't agree more the open border crowds hates America she not all of them some of them just want money\n\nGoldman Sachs lower Manhattan and a gangster banks jurors that support all the stuff they love America but they love money more\nMoney rich money\nThey want bigger bonuses how do they do that cheap labor\n\nHigher stock prices fell off make money when America implodes they'll have the gold you'll have nothing\nThere really\nThere the elites and Goldman Sachs Wall Street lower Manhattan\nWashington lobbyist do have the money they'll they will do these people will always have the money\nIt's\n[noise]\nNews this hour from town halls are tough I read about [noise]\nFollowing his trip to Saudi Arabia secretary of state Tom pale is now in Turkey has met with the Turkish president discussed the disappearance of the Saudi journalist who turkey suspects was killed inside the Saudi constantly in his ...\nWriting the secretary of state said he would conveys county Arabia commitment to summer complete and transparent investigation into Jamal I shall chief disappearing that's the BBC's\nMark lower than it is to handle\nNorth Carolina already saying trooper fatally shot drawing a traffic stop was an eleven year veteran of the patrol trooper Kevin Connor was based in Columbus county\nThe hunt for Jamie cost goes on a Thirteen year old Wisconsin girl is missing after her parish were found dead in their western Wisconsin home Marin County sheriff Chris which every\nMinute does count that's why this operation is running twenty four seven or ... people have to sleep and we'd have night cruise coming in we're running a twenty four seven operation twenty four center command post we have teams ready to respond at a moment's notice on a tip comes in\nAnd the FBI all too involved in the search the missing ... regime mortgage rates may be having a chilling effect on home building housing starts ... five point three percent last\nMonth Congress departments in housing search slipped last month through the seasonally adjusted annual rate at one point two million down from one point to seven million in August so far this year starts to increase six point four percent but the pace of home building a slum since may\nPermits an indicator of future activity fell zero point six percent to an annual rate at one point to four million\nThat's correspondent Jeremy house following yesterday's big rally Wall Street checking a bit of a breather so far today with stocks in the red the Dow is now down about two hundred eight points an ass ... thirty nine at the S. and P.

inconceivable to anybody what half a brain that follows any of that stuff that crown prince Mohammed bin Salman NBS\nDid not know about this are authorized coupled with the fact that the some of the

states Canada\nThe United kingdom the free world I mean their reaction to the United kingdom which is also backing the Saudi Emirates cola would listen to this war is this bad so this is not going away and the president\nI understand it's got to be measured understand he's got to look at the facts I understand we got to do the investigation uh my opinion was there I understand all that

Know him and\nThat's why I Want to stress that I I don't think we should just sweep it under the rug but at the same time I'm I've been out in the middle east for thirty one years now um and I've seen a lot of people have been murdered 'em the most recent serious\nKilling was record co Hariri the Lebanese prime minister they set up an international tribunal to judge the culprits are no one really has been punished\nAnd one of the people we think did a got blown up in Damascus\nA belongs to has a law and there's some speculation that Lebanese people might have had something to do with The Revenge there I don't know but anyway no one was punished by the international tribunal ah we also have Omar Hassan al Bashir the dictator of Sudan um who was a the international\nCriminal court had a warrant out for the rest you're still not been arrested and what he's done as intimately more serious in killing thousands hundreds of thousands of people into down than\nOne journalist in a consulate in Istanbul and I don't say that to demean democracy because I I like democracy again I'm Sorry if that\nHe was killed but anyway we also have shock horror back yard the former Iranian prime minister who was murdered ... million his apartment by the Iranian government in Paris in Nineteen eighty one no one ever got punished for that\nBut to the Iranian killed their opponents\nIn Europe and elsewhere all the time I ... the former um Syrian dictator who used to knock off journalists in Beirut all the time the owner of all the ... newspaper was murdered by the Syrian Government\nThe year ... year your point is these people get killed all the time nobody nobody no big deal I mean that's that's basically the point at which is what you're saying and\nWhat I'm saying is I get all that but I think in in a in in in the international community of allies they're an embassy or consulate\nIt's supposed to be a sanctuary not supposed to go in there and get chopped up with a ... with a chainsaw and taken out and make it in McDonalds\nI mean you're supposed to be able to go in there is something that sings about an embassy are constantly and I I think that is what is bothering people like me so much\nBecause it just breaks down all international I get MERS gets\nGeo political assassinations I mean everybody gets that everybody gets in the middle east the going out forever and it's going to always go on but I think it's the fact that he went into a conflict\nI'm In a foreign country and uh that that's just that's that's very distasteful to people and ... and that's why this thing is just not I mean\nKeep or the Saudi planes in the ... school buses so the\nMilitary industrial complex in the U.S can keep making money I get it right um the\nSixteenth I get it but I think there's got to be a reckoning for the way this was done and uh it's it's just very uncomfortable to people\nI mean but I I told you that the other day eight months ago I went to um I I went to the Saudi um residents of a prince Turki al fossil and did an interview for an hour and a half\nWhat if what if I didn't come out I mean it's like okay I mean I ... I I never thought anything of it I'm like well\nThis is the residents of a of a Saudi official you know you go into any embassy you'd never ever think will do anything can happen to be this was an apathy\nThere's an international world order [laughter] embassies are safe right isn't that where you go if you're in trouble you you're going into an embassy I mean if that breaks down\nI don't know I think that's what bothers people Edward and you know I keep getting tweets about he was Muslim Brotherhood I I guess you know I guess that means now if you're Muslim Brotherhood and you're going to an embassy you can get you know chopped up with the ... James throwing\nShipped out in the doggy bag and it's okay I guess I guess that's the argument now and maybe it's okay right maybe I'm looking at this all along\n[noise] no [noise] no I don't think you're looking at it all wrong I just don't know what the proper reaction is I'm In the case and it's going to be a new sort of reaction because\nWe're creating a new form of international law if we step in and do something curious against Mohammed bin Salman at because up until now or the world community has not up until now the only to a town\nThat is the tribunal for the killing of radical hurry and the tribunal a warrant around\nFor over the sheriff Sudan has not produced anything so uh this is going to clearly if the international community site the are going to be a new piece of international law\nLet's just get out of the Yemeni civil war and a wash your hands with a mess right that that's the answer let's just get out we shouldn't be there anyway and it's going to be very interesting because what this is done\nAnd this is the day of reckoning for the for the for the Saudis in this or\nThis is going to give Rand Paul a reason to bring this up in the U.S Senate and I don't think they're going to get to fifty one votes I really don't know you know there were doing this under the old days when that for whatever Rand Paul's been trying to stop that\nBut uh you get this debate in the Senate you get it out in the open um they're not going to get fifty one votes in order to stay there and then the president's gonna have to figure out what what what do you just

middle east on your mouth to shrug eat and what is going to happen with that has been dominating the news\nAnd you just heard that montage Rand Paul a response to the question about the president's tweet or making fun of a Stormy Daniels was about the best response to that person which is a my response which is I don't really have time for that there's too many other things going on in the world\nTo be concerned about these uh about that particular a tweet and Rand Paul hear Lindsey Graham there's a lot of senators that we have a lot of respect for that or raising alarm bells\nAnd so you have to take what they say uh with all seriousness is my only point in this\nAnd let's get to the bottom of it I think the president response here so far has been spot on\nA it shouldn't affect the arms sales I disagree with the center on that one\nBecause of the president said they're going to buy the arms from somebody that was so it really doesn't matter\nBut there's gotta be some kind of response and the president said that there will be a response but he's not going to make a response until all the facts rent I think everybody would agree with that right here on the John traffic's

Nick in Virginia Beach says rush and Michel Martin I've been talking about this his ties to the Muslim Brotherhood\nOkay\nI'm here's the problem with that argument so if you go into a conflict and

don't know what that has to do with anything\nI mean that that I mean if you take that argument you could you could say well and teeth that can go club people in a in a bank people over the head
