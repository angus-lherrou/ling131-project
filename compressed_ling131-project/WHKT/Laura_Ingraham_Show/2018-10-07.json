most recent claim to fame as he was the only one that\nGot the two thousand Seventeen Virginia election right he predicted that the Democrats would pick up Fifteen states he was the only one that any was anywhere\nNear that so he's got his finger on the pulse no doubt guys have you with us we've got to get to the Redskins and the caps in this segment what I've got to start with Virginia there's three seats here play uh\nIf if the Democrats went all three many people think that will be there's three seats that are close while I've got three maybe you've got other than you can certainly uh bring them up whenever you are you going to claim the fiber complex competitive\nYes Barbara Comstock which than in the tent Scottsdale are being challenged by a Elaine laureate and the second an\nIncumbent congressman Dave Brat go against several Abigail Spanberger in the seventh so let's start with the tent that's on everybody's mind western cops I look I was at the debate in ... county and a general\nElection was horrific I mean she was just absolutely dress I don't know who did her ... she I mean I\nIf you try to be in a debate if\nIf I dressed up as her and did that debate in my goal was to be horrible she did worse than I could've done a person or try to either what was\nThat this announcement that the temp district is competitive ... by Barbara Comstock for Congress I mean it is going to be a double digit rate\nShe's reading from a script because he's trying not to screw up the fact that she's going to end by double digits um she obviously is capable of of doing more um than um\nThan that um you know she's been a state senator so I'm Talking on policy side I'm so she's not without chopped right but at this point in this rates she's being told we just script don't mess up that's what happened in that debate I don't disagree with you that like you know\nDid was she a little plane at the debate yes did she make any major airs no\nAnd that's my Barbara Comstock so upset about the debate that you know wants to talk about oh she did so poorly barbers limited because Jennifer didn't make any errors that allows barber to get back into it\nIt's a landslide it fit any landslide the tenth district\nHas every single demographic group that is breaking against Trump in this country over represented in it if the Democrats do not take the tent the Republicans will hold Congress at that I agree with I don't think yeah it's it's not an end right now that's not in the realm of possibility\nBut the Republican polling is telling me that she's tire or slightly ahead\nBarbara is going to lose by double digits Tom ... like you know she's over perform for pulling you every time her whole career she's that were going\nOn in your ears the problem is in in every demographic group with Republicans are losing market share right now are collected in the ... from federal employees are high income educated\nVoters gun now she's a woman and she talks with the difficulty by having the Republicans took away the one weapon Frank Wolf and I had to survive up here and that was your marks I was not Tom Davis I was Mr I'm close to work in prison Mr Woodrow Wilson bridge Mr rail to dealt with Barbara gets none of that\nUh because the Republicans get away with their constitutional obligation uh on on the road you know to to designate projects so this mix\nUh I've seen ... she was held a lot of fire\nInto the closing weeks on a jet or for in terms of their operate search or marketing what it is so I think this race quotas since I've seen races close a lot more at this point but this was this was a tough race it's a tough atmosphere and it's a tough district\nThen remember the last five delegates in that seat in in right in the house last time and some of them might remind you yeah more money and did everything right you bring in a very good campaign and he lost double digits for like a a tad grief in I don't know if I was campaigning my but lost\nWhat was that somebody thing you said again just as she wants to be somebody makes a ... [laughter]\nI go to just get a tree that added a thirty\nAre driven Tom Davis ... Peterson and you've got a lot of the truth you John just rhetoric let's get to the other races let's get to the seven I just said Barbara I just said ... drama show\nYesterday she's a very complex candidate no doubt but ah I see a little momentum going for Dave I didn't think it was kind of when we should do now I I think he is going to win a\nHow do you see that race so I I had that one as slightly in Republican up until the cabinet hearings at this point I think it's a toss up on because what the Kavanaugh hearing stint was really re energized and fire up the one voter block\nThat's the problem for Dave Brat in some district which is suburban women\nUm and I think that the seven districts historically Republican it should be a Republican if the Republican Party left me um so I did last year but I'm the one path or a Democrat there isn't an right go in Chesterfield with the suburban women\nUm and I think Abigail the match for them and I think that the Republicans are doing everything they can to lose that block naturally right now um and so I haven't ...\nI think bin Laden's Kavanaugh's nomination in terms of I mean I Am sure you just said in in in terms of what this is doing politically and I think we all live in our own echo chambers and we all have our own perceptions of how it's done but what this was done in the nearest polling and some other polling demonstrate this is the Republican base is now\nActivated in his duty as a gaffe which is favored the Democrats for the last year and a half is now closed substantially\nAnd I think that works to perhaps paper ... named brand has two two issues do outside the demographics the district in the DNA that district is Republican number one he is not close the deal with some of you can't trust people and they were just as soon throwing him under the bus and rent that she got for two years\nAnd bring back or ... you know somebody it's more in line with their thinking and and even some scores and talking with Tim Kaine is going to be exceptionally strong in that district he was mayor of Richmond if he has a political he's widely ...\nThe running I mean that ... that that's the I think that's right this this jacks up that democratic turnout there so you got a factor that into this thing I still think at the end of the day that the DNA of that district establishes itself and bright wins but the but this was a close race some Democrats have nominated ... she's\nVery ethical and whatever happens you're talking about uh somebody that's got to be involved in democratic politics for some time I think I think Abigail Spanberger is going to happen it's going to be somebody that has got to be reckoned with a democratic circles for some time to check\nDot dot you know I don't I don't know a ton about the district or a you know I Will say I was driving down just outside Virginia to go to an event last weekend and going through some of the rural counties and it seems like you're bragging pull margins outta those counties are but obviously the critical mass of the district is in Chesterfield men right goes so\nYou know I I Would probably say you know robotically it's a Republican district but obviously if it's a wave here than it could be one that the Democrats deal than would have to defend the twenty twenty\nI get to the second district Taylor Maria whatever happened with Scottsdale or the other day I had him on my radio show or the a campaign put my [noise] my name and their team TV ads so I appreciate the PR for what's going on in that race but\nThis is my first chance to respond to Scott right after he had his meltdown on your show um that went viral yet I'm Upset about our analysis last time um and now says has not changed he's still going on [noise] um and\nUm I don't think I don't believe the north time spoke I think it was you know I I ... up to this point at or near trials are pretty good I I had the last week they've they've not been um I think there's some noise going on\nBut I think what is going to win and she's going to win going way [noise] um so I think she's gonna win going away I think it's going to be\nA [noise] a secular up until two months ago I was doing everything right um and he's really blown it\nAnd he's not going to win reelection and so are you saying because of the whole the valid issues really seen as soon as this year in a way he's handled it and remember that this district is one of the few in the country\nThat not only sits in the ... side a media market\nBut isn't a media market that doesn't really stretch too many other districts so the media has been all over this is on the evening news every night you know if Barbara Comstock at a petition scandal and attempt district it would have made the CD for forty five seconds one night\nOr maybe a week later they quickly re mentioned that you know it goes away\n... you cannot get away with something\nThe tide water it's been on the road so let me let me make I look I think are the New York times poll property rights taken her is fixed that district very well\nOr you know at the navy seal all kinds of stuff is is the issue matrix and he's chosen I think you're in line with that district is not a far right kind of guy he understands as a suburban Virginia Beach in those areas so we have\nDemocrats have a very good chance and you've every year that favors Democrats or what's in the Republican what scares me about this is the fact that if you look nationally Democrats just a ton of cash\nAnd dropping a couple of million dollars on that race in the last week that megaphone just can overwhelm at this point in exaggerate these things I think I think New York times pulls correcting papers up to date a again if I were betting I I I think he wins\nBut in this environment with the kind of money Democrats put down a you've got to be nervous about this year to watch this on election night if the Democrats win this seat it tells me it's going to be a pretty good year for farm in terms of we're talking thirty five forty yeah I just think about [noise]\nThat I was thinking about this district is different than Comstock and it's definitely different than a brat\nIs the turnout model is totally different and I think it's hard for Democrats to win the seat in a non presidential year I just based on who vote democratic and Virginia Beach Norfolk it's you know that the typical democratic voters going to be a minority down there and in less you get an outsized performance it's not\nI think it's tough for the Democrats to win that seat I mean Glenn Nye one or two thousand and he got flushed down the drain and twenty ten\nAnd the reason was democratic book came out in the presidential year for Brock Obama it wasn't there the next cycle for Glenn Nye 'cause nobody knew Glen I was\nUm I think God's got an advantage is that the turnout I remember back when I was in the house carcass we'd look at the turnout models and the numbers and\nYou know Virginia Beach in Norfolk the numbers are just forty percent of what they are in other parts of the state so it's just it's it's you got a lot of people that lived there that are you know enlisted men or women that are registered to vote elsewhere so it's just it's hard you know to to bring people out in that type of environment even though was bench correct your one media market and\nYou know they could possible Scott from now till the end of the time but\nThere's going to be a conservative there's going to be a conservative vote is going to come out and whether uh uh ... Maria I don't know how to pronounce it Maria whether or not she can get people out based on her name as opposed to\nYou know Tim Kaine is not as big a magnet there is in Richmond [noise] um so I I still think it's up help with the Democrats even though I agree that looks like it's got to kind of boxing is one issue\nNinety six and Tom Davis one member of this well um I Would we had a we had a scandal um statewide where John Warner put a television ad up against Mark Warner who was John Warner was far ahead and um he photo shop Mark Warner and do a picture\nOr who's in the ... I Can't remember who we do to stop what he thought it was up at ... I think ... with Clinton but was it was while her when I was glad there was a racial aspect to it too I Can't remember what they did but they put her shop Mark Warner into a picture he wasn't in\nAnd um Internet TV ad and it was a huge but national scandal for John Warner who had a moderate brand and was a\nGuy that you know everyone looked she likes either what you're trying to say Scott Taylor is there like had a friend okay and and and that people you know like respected John Warner much higher than Scott Taylor though and and his numbers\nDoubt and he said I'm a navy person and and the captain of my ship and I'm responsible for what happened and I apologize and it's got telling her down that he would want to\nGo I was I was worse campaign chairman that year and it was a it was a close race Merck worse than fourteen million dollars of his own money to hear that made this really much closer race than it might have been other words can stronger or was he was on ... to ... or so or the map the kind of earn it after running a close race there but I remember it out I mean they fired\nThe people that were involved in the ad and everything else and you broke it and it it was an issue for a week or two and then John too it kind of building he took accountability [noise] theatre who's missing in what's going on they can just kind of destruction and having his people take the Fifth Amendment doesn't help it just keeps it in the news\nIs that enough to bring down somebody with a good reputation has done a good job in their first term or not\nUm and also I think the the ... when he turned out they talk about a wave I think you're really talking about a ... wage that's really what's happening with the Democrats is the is the suburban female voters and swung radically or to the Democratic party and that's the\nPart we're going to take up we'll get our predictions rolling it back the next segment we got to get to run again yeah I stay with us\nI'm an ... million Thirteen when they're not that popular when they're running and libertarian broke five percent and libertarian the automatic ballot access to the next five years in Virginia which are going which are the Republican\nThat was going to expire this year 'cause libertarians have not cracked five percent again\nAnother tactic or a Stewart there'll be another five years the libertarian automatic ballot access to allow their grade point is\nThat that is a good point and the back of water is going to get over five no no question probably seven foreigners here to tell me what it was John you think you think Barbara is going to win or lose\nUh [noise] uh what what uh what about Scott Taylor Maria [noise] you know what's going on [noise]\nAnd I see you alert [noise]\n\nAnd uh [noise]\n... ah [noise] terrorists got nothing but negative publicity from a over the last several months and I don't see 'em climbing out of that whole could be wrong but I don't see that and I also do\nI mean you know [noise] Comstock can talk about her internal all she wants that's not what people were picking up going door to door [noise]\nOr what have you heard of that race\nDoors I'm not talking about you know going to try to bolster the Democratic but are going to democratic doors\nThat those people were telling her they're worth it\nAnd when it on occasion they've asked what's the main complaint [noise] uh if and this is for Kavanaugh 'cause I talked to anybody since then uh it was the n._r._a. [noise] those ads have been effective but this ... thing\nI mean that's all you know the door to door and that's all I guess\nIf you're going to backfire art factor for ... got to go we've we've we've got to get to the red yep we've got a big thing Monday Night ride Carolina right let's just start with where they are early right you have to be happy so far\nYeah generally happy I think the defence like I said a month ago yawn fast a good and and they're going to get better I think they're deep Pence will get better [noise]\nUm I I think they need to give a couple of guys more snaps a couple of guys less naps but by and large I liked their defense to be a top ten the patches here and for the next few years going forward that makes it for\nI think they do they have one issue that need to solve and I can solve it if they listen to me they all week\nOn the ends they don't have any big play receivers that can go down catch the ball you know catch eight balls for a hundred yards and you need to have that too when consistently in the NFL you can't just keep throwing too you're tied into your backs especially with a\nTight and I'm like Jordan read that's never gonna get injured his dad was on the street [noise] he's been on the street I in you know Bruce is my friend Bruce Allen I emailed him literally within twelve hours and feared being caught by Dallas [noise] begging begging them to pick up jazz I have repeated it every time I said um [noise]\nThe day he sets his foot on Redskins park you'll be their number one receiver they could get rid of Josh Fox and yes I said it\nThey could keep Jamison in crowd or in the slot they can get they keep that kid record Senate they're number two receivers fast but then you need a big receiver who can pull down eight nine temples a game for a hundred yards desk and do it and so if they put him on the team they will be the best team the NFC East and will make the playoffs sweating\n[noise] Dallas likes losing um I think it's [laughter] you know they don't like to when they like to lose a why did you know why do they do what they do while they keep Jason geared as head coach you know I mean\nWhy do they get rid of Tony Romo and uh it's just I I think somewhere Jerry Jones just decided he was tired of winning and water and start losing for a while and so that's that's why does what he does\nThat what you're saying I mean is that the answer that dependency\nYeah I I'm I'm favorable and dance and I can't believe we're talking about the Redskins are not referring to them as the first place [noise] yeah that's true or slice and afraid for a different place type\nThat's right I I'm going to say at this point a lot better than I thought there'd be this year still very very tough schedule and next week I'm going to say nine and seven and that may be enough\nThis year so I'm not in the ...\nOr one of the things it's always heard that over ... you're going to the game since Ninety four\nAnd one of the things that the Redskins of lack for some time there's a speed demon and I can't remember the last time I'm sure I'd probably miss something but I cannot remember the last time I've seen the Redskins a Redskin return upon or kick off for a touchdown\nAnd a while and it's been a long time\nAnd I remember a one of the hallmarks of a ... ... ... was that he always had pets he called it more burner\nWhether it was you know on your nerves whoever I mean it was he always had at least one burned and we don't have that and uh it it shows\nHow many how many ... they're going to get that man tough guy last one I Know that my wife said\nYeah yeah I think I think they [noise] they threw a to F word games [noise] maybe three months [noise]\nAh they beat New Orleans at the superdome and on the way to an eleven o'clock season [noise] hard to say non [noise]\nAll right I'm going to go in the middle I think they got when ten games I think you gotta make playoff and here's your here's the thing about Alex and I'm not a fan of it because they can't win big games in the playoffs and so we got an exciting quarterback but you know I've watched him now three weeks I'm not a fan one way or the other but they're on TV [noise]\nBut I mean he managed games I mean he's not gonna do you get that we're going to be yourself and\nI could see one thing I can see quite a\nOn them I mean he does he kinda fits what they're\nWhat the whole group and a philosophy is now why is it out and win games [noise] and I think that I think that seems kind of winter games are they they couldn't get in the playoffs will be a dangerous [noise]\nI guess I got to sign off I got to be in court today okay thank you for sharing your events and they let me just quickly add the unemployment\nDown to three point seven percent hot there are a lot of what since Nineteen sixty nine lowest since Nineteen or a ground [noise] which you know I Can't tell stories are not going to get a raise of what's going to comment on this really quickly John ... [noise]\nThis is it's an amazing stat but not for the reason the Republicans wanted you to be an amazing stat because people say nothing sticks on Trump\nAnd I think it's the opposite I think everything sticks on Trump the fact that you have an economy that's as good as it is and he's having a good habit bad of an election at this point that everything is sticking to him because you should have with the economy [noise]\nOne of the first times that the president picks up see if there was an economy election [noise] um the Republicans could actually\nEconomic performance and the biggest gains in the high income areas are the ones turning against them faster so for people to say nothing sticks to Trump everything sticking to try [noise] well I think you get credit for the economy and I think [noise]\nI think he gets credit for the economy and I think that mitigate so against the law says they take just because of the ... the cycle but these coalitions are basically cultural coalitions\nThey're not economic coalition and as I said the Democratic enthusiasm in the independents wanting to balance the government is really what hurts or [noise]\nPeople don't trust the Republicans have the keys to want some kind of check on ... now he's doing okay they may vote for him in two years\nBut in the mid term me want to put a check on it [noise] I I Will say this I think the Democrats take the house is I think is more likely than not ah I I don't know how they don't impeach the president when it comes out you've got the Democratic base right now which rabbit\nThey want to impeach him now before ... a commission and when you [noise] I I don't know how Democrats going back to their primaries in twenty twenty\nCan't not to impeach Trump I I just think that happens in rent for tunes\nAre the kind of our seats or whether they have any any reasonable evidence or not\n'cause you're like they have a lot of them think they have reasonable evidence now I don't know what more is going to say none of it you know what he's going to say um but I just think you look at the base and you look at the fact that the primary elections or what\nMost of these members worry about that it's politics are going to do it I'm not arguing where the earth of now takes on Capitol Hill yeah well I I think what happens is it changes the dynamic for twenty Nineteen [noise] it was

can tell you the season ticket holder that was just so frustrating but you just couldn't break it was in the playoffs you know that that we have a great home ice advantage the yeah\nThe the entire year and the playoffs they go down one goal in life because out of the stadium because we've seen it happen over and over again we're living in the playoffs right moving in the big game in and and the whole the whole rise to the edge media just um\nIn in twenty sixteen and um they went down one nothing and it was like you know one nothing and hockey is is nothing nothing and and I mean it was like a funeral that we already lost the game because they were there for a short haired old against it [noise] just collapsed\nRight and and and and that's and\nNow it's like it's lifted and and and you could feel the playoffs last year once we got through Pittsburgh it didn't matter if we went down and again people can still\nBelieve in the team and the team could believe in itself I think I think the\nThe the caps in their history was Wayne on the players were they were believing when they went down a goal that they the games where you can also and how they because\nThe fans believe are 'cause every everyone believed it and I once Pittsburgh got the last year everything changed you could feel the change their um Tom in the season ticket holder on a season ticket holder we set a poor sections away from each other sometimes each other in the Dunkin' Donuts line in between factions [noise]\nUm but um [noise] this is going to be a great era for the cap now I don't think this was a one year thing I think that you look at who's next off is young\nI'm obey in his in his you know not in the mid mid thirties I think when you're thirty three thirty two\nUm he's gonna make a run a grassy for the most goals scored of all time the regular season he's over six hundred ... Ninety four he's going to make a serious run it being a new one goals for an inch on history and the caps are incredibly bright future um\nAnd I'll just end with saying that my dilemma right now I put a thousand dollars in the cap flustered when the Stanley Cup in Las Vegas Fifteen the one\nWe want to in Vegas at the cash for tickets to Fifteen thousand dollars when a casual ticket the person at the counter told me the biggest payout she's ever paid at the sports book\nOr when people will take about like that and rolled over for two or three seasons and she said you know the caps three feet and you wrote us money over it'll be two million dollars by the time they have a three feet\nSo I'm Still having this dilemma for the rest of the season I have not done anything with the money yet because it may be that like you know it was just a thousand dollar initial investment\nI might need to roll it over a couple of times because I think the caps are legitimate threat not only to repeat the sheer potentially do you have to repeat I'm the only after world every year by year so that's my dilemma but I'm leaning towards the right now I actually think this team is a special team and one that um is going to have a lot of success going forward\n[noise] well uh I get what you're saying ah I bet the Astros last year to win the world series attendant one as you know because you put Tibetan I read about in for you and I in fact the ticket we did we didn't just to take it as that we didn't roll it over but uh\n... uh that are concentration will be in a very high concentration there's two districts but also\nOut all over the state um if you have to know you know you got to play where you were just choose your strength and it would be there I think a Ralph one uh [noise] I think ... [noise]\nOne by twelve points twelve to Fifteen points I got an ear a in a blacks district and even more I think that our instruments district\nAnd uh you know the dynamics are changing in this and it's not just so much a matter of of Trump or anything the demographics in this state are changing and they're changing almost daily [noise]\nAh it's obvious which way in Europe they're moving are we going to be like Maryland no we're not going to be like Maryland but we um northern Virginia is beginning to look more and more in northern Virginia suburbs more and more not totally but more and more like the Maryland suburbs\nNational it's not just reached and let me write happening naturally in the sky to various\nRight at least in New Jersey suburb same things going on everywhere now out of sight every but you're seeing this you're seeing this an awful lot and um I think we have an excellent chance\nAnd no question we're getting help from the guy in the White House whether it will be there or not you know uh I I was joking with Mark Warner and I said well we we need them they're just one more election [laughter] you know but I mean it's you know\nI'm a generally speaking we've done better [noise] generally speaking\nWhen there's been a Republican and the White House added burden exceptions yes generally speaking the Republicans have done better when the Democrats been in the White House have there been exceptions yes but the trend is there and it was a mistake up and try and understand and I\nI Would be surprised if we didn't know you know get your Twenty one in the end of the election Adam minimum\nYeah I think I I I tend to agree you know you still have to defend a couple of feet like you got a couple of comments got one over on the eastern shore that this is in play I think Republicans can hold with the black sea if they don't have to buy\nI think that [noise] far weaker today a it's an incumbent and probably anybody else to get some personal proclivities and\nAnd and things that I think that hurts him among some of those brothers we have some stronger candidates or black\nOr and I don't know what happens there you've got a hundred and fifty thousand the banks are like that it sounds like he's ready to go away very quickly but\nI Will do my rights him and you got to know when when the phone and you want to go out to undefeated not indicted if you could do that and it gets lost before in ... when he and house of delegates any moves over the first district run for Congress and then he comes back but I don't think you want to end your career because I I think you beat him\nA journeyman some very attractive candidate a you've but you've got some issue interest at the initial matrix there where he has not really thinking or his voting record um\nIn many many I mean we have to wait and see but may work and the Democrats thinks that the\nUm [noise] I mean it would appear that the judges are going to wind up drawing matter house district as health eleven house districts\nAnd I think that's what whatever formula they come up with that is going to a also be what the Senate's going to have to abide by twenty Twenty one\nAnd uh it could change or you know a kicker change an awful lot [noise]\nUm you know a part of the districts are unpacked not totally but below the numbers I mean look what Bobby Scott I'm In his district one from what fifty some fifty six percent down to\nYou know low forties and I'm a you know produced another democratic district so you're not to see how that plays out but it seems to me\nUh the judges drawing that district is by far and away their their best bet and if they do you know Supreme Court I think it ruled before the\nGerrymandering is is has been constitutionally permissible until spills over and racial discrimination and therein lies the problem and that's what the Republicans are facing\nThere and it's going to change its going to change the way you know a whole makeup of legislatures around the country where it's going to court for a five to four court will do this differently blocks of each other and they send it back if I may be\nWrong but I think when they send it back to the lower court it was like seven to two or nationally\nBut I I just think one of the thing is you got to understand the Republican base for better for worse is migrated from your country club at the country in so doing they've taken out of some competitive districts were these were economic issues ripple you'll be very viable [noise]\nSo it's not just the demographics ignite the fact that they have changed the emphasis on issues in ways that help him in South West Virginia but but it hurts them in growing parts that\nCan we talk about the X and hang out with a very popular governor with very low negative and you look at ... number ... support amongst Democrats\nWas not popular among Republicans was more polarizing and his numbers Ralph Northam has incredibly low negative ads\nFor somebody in this environment you look nationally um he has very high positives very low negatives\nUm and in going into these competitive seats [noise] um I remember in ... eleven in Democrats drew the state Senate lines and they lost the majority and who was the the person who was in every Republican TV ad that was flipping seats with Bob McDonnell a in a popular governor\nCan play a big role nuts and that's a big um item that timetable here\nBring these are still national ice races I don't care how you slice of the national environment\nPlays by word you have to have a messenger more to help raise their especially Romney turning out the Thomas writes the the I mean it that\nThe patterns that you've had\nUntil McCarthy Cuccinelli I mean you know what happened for almost fifty either I mean I I mean they're just about the surveys like let's take for example the start of empty started in seat was not driven by national politics and twenty Fifteen it was driven by local politics in Chesterfield versus Richmond and\nI'd like to be democratic um and I think they were and we don't know if we have more or less if candidate but we don't have we enter the campaigns don't matter you know I don't think we had a I don't think we integrate messenger there I think if you rerun that same race in twenty Nineteen and you had Ralph Northam on TV\nI'm In that district Ralph would not let me just say are they all vote the votes stardom and it's chaos is going to create problems for them\nI think that's the greater prop ... and he's he's he's not harmonious with their district on some of this hot button issue or just say they're like Robert than good governor wonderful man but he gives a fireside chat in a fire goes down you put him on TV ... it's it's not the same kind of rally the team but he's\nAn asset to them ever let me give you need to use that ... I don't want to know if that's the kind of governor you actually need this you know and he picked up not a fiery he picked up Fifteen states I mean I think\nYou know turning the color of his fiery and I'm at a carnival Barker and and he doesn't he doesn't pick up seats Labour up north I'm dead\nWell north and didn't pick 'em up Trump picked him up for him yet [noise] if if Trump would have been president and twenty Fifteen we'd be in the majority\nBut look I I yeah I don't want to respond Ralph Northam\nDisagree however I think he's been let's just say the\nChemical if one by three points and rapport with them on by eight and ten pick up near the mouth and picked up fifty five point difference was not fifteenth ... but there was also a hotel different let me tell you that\nThe White House mistake about it Trump okay was a driving factor shirt last November on top of that\nUm [noise] you had a ... and spilled over into everything\nAnd keep in mind Gillespie was not groups you know I mean he was very polarizing [noise]\nBut um I just think people keep underestimating as governor oh oh I don't think anybody on a resume I don't think anybody underestimate same\nBut make no because I mean you know what's driving politics in Virginia right now is not a Ralph [noise] uh it's it's what's going on across the Potomac River\nIt's negativity is driving politics on both sides right now in the one thing about Robert and he doesn't that many negative [noise] doesn't have any ... he's a very likeable or not\nI'm not you know I've now go Europe and knocking on doors since may I have not gotten one negative comment about brown non and that's you know it's ... I mean people liking me just a likeable person\nIs not yeah I'm not into the politics you know I I agree with that either NAFTA but he's not a fire reader that gets my vote out for\nI I think Tom Davis who got fired eater they've got to put up with a Republican but protests\nBecause the Republican candidate had a picture bigger than their own picture where the corporate I'm saying like here's what it'd be great for your time sometimes without my permission um so I mean having a messenger\nIs important and Democrat you had good black leather that north in the first time in a sense Mark Warner and we've had a messenger like\nThe authors right I agree I agree but now he's taken out an incumbent that we are not entirely different that\nI don't know I tell you what man I I'm All right Joe Joe is kind of Peter ...\nYou guys under estimate Morsi and I'm telling you what he had a disastrous press conference I wasn't there and it was a disaster of all time so he had a disastrous press conference that really hurt him to all kinds of underhanded things\nGoing on but you know after that\nI'm Morsi's mayor and and you\nKnow the thing about ... is an independent thinker he's got to do was the only way\nTo you know he's not\nA he's not a\nWhole bunch of any of the establishment caucuses or anything like that\nI think he's gonna play very well in that district and I think a lot of friends there that don't think that he got screwed by what they did to him and and you can join Morsi did the\nSmartest thing I've ever seen anyone to in politics when he won the ... I think it was ... he won Mickey chintzy on each and moved up I think\nAnd in that primary people and think he was going to win that primary crowded field\nAny more than a landslide networks people are asking what did he do he went around and after he knocked on doors at you know and I wrote a handwritten note every voter he spoke to but David it for a week and a half before the election in the context that he had remembered the conversation\n... kept these postcards for six months and send them all out of ten days before the election with a handwritten note from him talking about how their conversation and you know I met your dog Sam or you're a teacher here and I remember that conversation and do you hope I can count on your support next Tuesday\nAnd people came out in droves I mean for him to go do that though and I I I see people read postcards but I've never seen one posting them to make it appears that month later okay well companies I'm Tom Davis has everything better than anyone in politics but [noise] but he did that and and he won in a landslide and like it's\nBeen done before it ... on on major I'm just saying take on incumbent in a district like that is it's it's I feel I'm not I'm not going to be four or five people in that race either\nGonna just to I'm not an expert on that's the big difference you know if we'd had you know there's a whole lot of people have gotten to the general assembly because we don't have run off in the state\nAnd she's well why [noise]\nI don't think I if I had the gas and I think it would totally wrong with it in that district I I guess there are downsides extremely low name id pardon I Would guess that rod dance with extremely low name id and that if you test it they were more so than they might not to say that the ...\nI'm just ... but like in terms of I'd name id Richard Nixon had our name on\nIt [laughter] it's like I don't think rises like the super starting to send\nBack on you know Joe and I know Joe\nAnswer I got to get out out work something like Fifteen or twenty to one okay Joe was up there knocking on doors and making phone calls now will just\nBetween the fastball primary too in that primary like Dick was in the ... district for Twenty years before he got drawn to saint Pete ... has a concept of campaigning and knocking on doors and doing the things that you do when you're in a competitive political re enter Seventy percent of the vote my district against Mondale yeah rockets you've never been in\n... yeah but I think you're better ... she's never been accused of you guys have to perform and she's got to get out of work I'm a joke on our worker he's fighting Joe he's gotta he's gotta worker and\nIs I don't get I'm telling you he was going to get a simple clear the sympathy vote out there for the fact that the power banks enrichment screwed this guy out of his livelihood\nAnd that's that's real I mean he got screwed I mean what he did to pull his long life\nIt looks senator Stanley told me the whole thing is I ... it was blown [laughter] what happened\nThere was a total bologna and it was because uh it was it was it was the cause he challenged the Richmond system that's what I that's why they told them and so I I just I don't remember that\nLike you know there are a lot of people in that area that have and and this is a loyalty to just to see\nThe reason he does well there's a lot of people there that is represented and when families have had a time of need you know the attorney that went through the criminal defense attorney to help out someone in their family was Joe Morsi and that created the level of loyalty he had they ... I\nNot ready to call this one one way or the other yet but um he has a real ... [noise] it it's across that district from being an attorney I'm In the same way that Donald McEachin you know when he when he ran rubber on his running\nYou know humans are primary challenger what three times to incumbent uh twice twice as a challenger don't come in Delhi gets been one to the challenge is going to come and senator\nAnd and mceachin was the guy who everyone news on TV it was a lawyer\nUm he had to help so many people in the community it didn't matter that he was a challenger to encompass um that's how they knew how much they thought he was in college right and and ... I mean he has helped a lot of people in those in those communities where they don't know who to turn to joy Morsi has been the guy\nWho's defending their ... year there's time um you know against major charges that area he's one of the top defense attorneys there so I just\nI I think that it's an interesting right\nTwenty Twenty one the governorship when it comes comes through and a lot of um determining who's in the White House has said that dynamic and so on\nBut when north um goes well the attorney general Montana governor clash at that who else is looking at this at this point in the Democratic party ours on her I mean there there's a name pops up now and then very yellowish not out of the\nPicture either I'm going now I Would imagine if you're on the of course but I Would I Would hope that herring Fairfax things worked out\nFor not just the contested nominations but then you've got a lot of people in the back looking for upward mobility you're the mayor of Richmond stony you've got some other logistical nightmare yellow sitting there on you'll have a primary and you'll just have to see\nIf it's um [noise] as successful as can be dangerous is only I think if only a [noise]\nAs long as you don't have a two way right [noise] a\nMajority in Fairfax and ... and uh I think that if a if it's if it's one of them against the whole batch of other people when [noise] uh you know the Fairfax\nCounty somebody out so I like you guys are talking about herring and a Fairfax you're not talking about before stony who was absolutely going to do something here's the other person you're not talking about who could pull the upsetting in a two or three person race and\nThat's Kenny handling Alexander\nMayor of Norfolk right now who in a three way primary against to\nProgress is trying to wild liberal left wing each other Kenny Alexander comes in business guy there's a track record and the mold of who water businessman McAuliffe sky ridiculous why\nThat's ridiculous first of all just there's alligator and then there's ... as if there's a moderate right or the Democratic primaries anyway for the first piece safety but their ... their declaration rough in order to be your state they're not going to line up behind ... I like Chinese a good friend\nBut they're going to either lined up behind either herring for Fairfax whereabouts don't and I don't even know now I don't I don't I didn't know that are the same thing with LeVar record guy\nPeople like him but they go either going to go with one of those two how old are you going to be a Republican anyway could Trump's going to be gone and twenty twenty I was going to win again [noise] ... I mean first years of president you know but if you're on the same type of campaign that Gillespie\nA ... year right Republican won't win that governorship you can't ... I'm telling you you know it's disgraceful\nJet Republican everyone went again in Virginia\nWell how do you how do they want to learn that probably that's absurd how do they just didn't think about it now\nHow do you account for Hogan how'd you account for a Christie how do you account for that you know in in ... in Massachusetts I mean you know governorships in particular are not parliamentary race if people make and\nKeep trying to turn a political nickel at the expense of somebody color or somebody ethnicity or somebody's religion it ain't going anywhere I Would agree with you there and in till they can get away from that you bet well that and they should be were checked\nAnd I gotta I gotta check their from a Senator Bill Stanley he says never bet against fighting Joe so he'll Stanley agrees with me\nAnd he works as a excuse me ...

in court there's a lot different markers or better test may want to point to somebody's incredible so I've been talking to the therapist about ten years ago which apparently was documented the therapist notes I mean who helped put themselves out there and put themselves through this crap\nUm if it if it didn't happen um I mean what what are her motives I don't I don't see why she would\nHave you can convict somebody based on what just I didn't give it to anybody but this guy's applying for the highest court in the land is not applying for a job\nOr dominoes to deliver pizza and I think the the burden that you have in terms of uh keeping somebody off of a lifetime appointment an entirely different than so anybody can make any Alex ... talking about racial nobody here ... nobody's talking about taking away the guy's liberty and putting them in jail that's a that's a different issue than it is you know and I find is that the Republicans\nSaid that Trump would put up somebody can come come out and say he uh\nDid something to me forty years ago I have no evidence no cooperation and that's the\nI didn't say something that's in sexual assault which is entirely different issue and you've got to put yourself in the context of the time and the place and back then in the Nineteen eighties wasn't some people can't afford\nIt don't they don't come forward nearly as much today about as they showed that they back then when I was in high school and I kinda think people in\n... you didn't hear about the broader look she ... extremely credible yeah very emotional ... and and I do think that I think that taking that extra week going back and interviewing some of the people more judge and others around it\nI think it was with the right thing I think a slam dunk in the spring or the day after her would have been terrible politics and would have been terrible wanting to shoot having\nSaid that nobody else can remember the party\nWho was there ... there's just too many holes to really make the case that doesn't mean she's wrong but but that's a tough standard for the future you know anybody can come forward and say anything\nNot to say that but it's just I just wanted to go back within six days and remember after she testified Chris Wallace from Fox News and the president to talked about how\nCredible she was an old Republican operatives protects everybody right after she testified this is done it's over cheese toast and then seven days later with Rob back\nTo where we weren't amazing to me how fast the world changes but back to what we're talking about before I just we've gotten this cooperation sidebar mansions over mentioned I think had him up Fifteen I Want to say\nNow that he's up by fire segments blackouts I saw a poll last week that I'm a fair thing that's the that's the polls you read when they're asking you to find out who he certainly is a person by\nBy either under fifty well as well\nThis whole ... I think this is for him this this changes the outcome I think it's right\nYeah I I Can't I ... and I'm not an expert on West Virginia but it's nice to meet Joe Manchin told position that I'm an independent God I'm not beholden to either side and uh\nI I think it would be hard for him to get reelected it would seem to me in a what a Trump when the state by like fifty points something like that\nAnd I'm not on also not convinced and Susan Collins is going to run again either an ad that that I think it's all if I'm not ...\nBut she said she'd never voted against the Supreme Court judge ever you have a group in the state to the ... billion dollars up saying and ... votes against millionaire spent\nYeah okay now it's up to a million and a half ago find me but then it looks like a bribe but I'm I mean I think at the end of the day without corroboration she's going to be there for for for which she I agree with Tom you not only twenty twenty twenty is she going to run again well should make that decision the appropriate time [noise]\nI I think I think Tom now that I think she is going to vote yes ah the one that I have no read on the top Davis is I'm Lisa Murkowski of Alaska what about what about you [noise]\nPretty independent I mean just remember this when she lost that primary to Joe Miller lost the Republican primary right she run as a write in with the name Murkowski battling it started\nAnd ended up and also as you want to laugh but you know the part about the independents pieces when guys like mentioned when it's because they frame their their reelect in terms of looking out for the state right mhm yeah and Murkowski has a big issue with the cabin opinion about Alaskan natives I think what's up man you know when she\n... she she she does on on that issue so now it's not clear cut I haven't seen the polling in Alaska or anything but I think if you get ... like I think you're going to get flaky booed him out of committee directly without some crap ration Jeff Jeff is fundamentally\nVery concerned right you gotta be Goldwater Institute he's also very independent and I think a very principled guy\nWhich is why people think he's flaky because he doesn't always taken one boxing isn't always predictable but this judged if you've got to understand for Republicans this unites us there's this is a very important building in the court or as it is on the Democrats on the other side I'm wanting somebody else\nCan I ask you a question has a has a a vice president broken a tie on a Supreme Court nominee knocking on where you are and that would be unprecedented money [noise]\nBut I can and that will certainly challenge that but it's still count how do you know that\nIt just ... just as\nAdvice and consent and there's got to be no ... or you want to use the president than any boats but he's not a member I I can tell you the states like Virginia right lots reunion states there it's not Virginia yesterday nominate ... off [laughter] yes I remember I was already a lawsuit there's already a lawsuit challenging the whole procedure with other Democrats\nIf he's confirmed that they're going to do and they take over the house or the Senate to move to impeach\nThat would be a disaster two thirds of the Senate good luck [noise]\nI just I'm like I think your ... and\nOf elections have consequences that's what I\n[noise] well I I mean all the foreign policy rough one here's the problem you still can't get over the fact that Trump won two years later you still can't get over got let me bring my\nWhere my Merrick Garland well let me let me talk about America I think by by every indication is a very honorable straightforward with a bit of good Supreme Court judge in in the traditional sense with these balance deep not completely a liberal he was a democratic operative before he went on the bench but but met the criteria for it for a judge\nBut what is better not holding a hearing on them are doing what they've done in this case I had to bring is putting the sham of of hearing him and then finding a way to trashes reputation and voting no they weren't there to confirm it it was election year Republican senators weren't getting confirmed school you seat and putting on a more liberal members just wasn't\nGoing to happen in a presidential politics here not a mid ... who who knows who knows what the rules are writing about it but it's the president it's the president United States who nominate somebody for the frame court not to set a third by rights that threat so therefore I think McConnell's argument is out\nWhen he says look a that was the president you only have like a lot of voters ... that's ...\nBut I'm just saying they they stretch it each time I don't know who started it but it keeps getting worse and worse and worse\nAnd once you do it for one year you could do it two years you could do it three years I I don't know they're already guard rails on this I think it was they moved it from sixty votes to fifty votes for everything but the Supreme Court of course they're going to do it for the Supreme Court has made there are new guard rails many more on this and that's what's scary\nAre

the\n... I'm fairly well I'm not sure\nBut there isn't room for saying that if you challenged\nIf you if you challenge the godfather\nOf anybody you know the godfather\nNot here either ... or we're waiting on him I don't I don't think he's seen a seven and having a\nWild real clear politics average on Mitch right now is nine points for\nWell that's a far cry from Fifteen\nBut here's one plus twelve timber Thirteen or Fifteen minutes and plus well when I was\nMean look here's a here's there has been consistently ahead I\nThere was a poll earlier before all this controversy that showed that if you voted against it all took numbers change on this ...\nI don't dispute the fact that the numbers would change [noise] um but from my perspective I think Kavanaugh confirmation to is probably [noise] germs and democratic duty on the plane that's five to ten sheets may be a Senate seat or two I mean well I think it helps in house in her too because when it's\nOn very red territory North Dakota uh Missouri I mean these are pretty solid state West Virginia in the Senate race in capital thinking milk Republican\nOr where where where we're at a time for a couple of months go by the hour news but one thing I think Tom nailed it\nThis is the only thing I've seen and since Trump announced that has unified Republican I've never seen anything like this we couldn't figure out how to do it we're going to talk about that plush Redskins cats when it gets I keep it up [noise]\n... or something I said Fifteen I was twelve point for when I went back and actually look at the poll\nNumbers have it on discussion yeah you want to go ahead go ahead and that one but\nThen we got to get the ... for football and hockey puck on go ahead or law when I'm ...\nLast night amongst winner\nAnd the Senate Judiciary committee the official account of the Senate Judiciary committee is tweeting about Democrats do not understand the definition of moving down to the Senate did this year the account this thing is so off the rails and and and I feel like\nYou know people were completely missing the point with all this process crap\nYou know the reasons you just shake many Sweden is that the Democrats have the definition or on a book it's all processed and none of it is actually on where people are on it and where voters are on on this\nIs Kevin ... only has the support of the conservative base and the message that women are getting around the country is that you know people are OK with sexual assault\nNo I think about that if we can get their message\nThey're they're getting you're now a pronounced wrongdoing or joining in Italy and isn't this something that that's the way this is the same\nDemocratic Party that defended Bill Clinton that attacked his accusers Murray especially the one that got raped ...\nFirst of all first of all I was I went to the extent the allegation of rape against Bill Clinton which which exists actually didn't exist during the impeachment process if you remember\nThat woman came out a week after on national television that whole process has gotten so when you say the Democratic party rallied around him whatever that allegation wasn't even out there at the time I Will say second thing is\nThat was why he lied\nYou're talking about ... Jones went power Jones is different than ... then that was not written I just got through oh judgment\nCentered in the Senate about that you had to sequence Kevin really with the same time it's ... [noise] I think you're thinking about\nThe observer neither but either by abroad when I first when I was in the first thing you were not raise allegations anyway the point [laughter]\nThe message that women are getting around the country and the this is okay and Republicans are now into a debate about the definition of ... I mean the devil trend and double struggle I mean if this was on the official count look everybody knows what booth peanuts\nArt or not but you have to first of all I don't know what I'm\nSeeing is believing inserting drugs in your ... instead of taking down your throat because your body will process it faster ... arrives you believe that I learned during the eighties or that everyone knows what that means I didn't know where the idea okay every ... you know what I mean like\nA very interesting out here and it's been crowded here that has no idea what that word means you're not and then and then you know kept on going to go on national television taking notes and be like oh it's a funny joke I mean this is so ridiculous and absurd wasn't embarrassing nominee that's ...\n... ... the Democrat and let me fairly under whether you're banned the world you guys are talking about polling calling all the way for\nBowling on this very split the ... this is not overwhelming pulling against capital which is right down the middle at this point in which is the worst in history but we can Supreme Court justice or never done that or what we have are down in the dark matter because they were just\nTalking about the electoral repercussions when you're doing is you're kicked the hornet's nest the Republican base that was kind of depressed at this point in what you've seen now in in terms of the energy brings to both parties the enthusiasm gap as close\nAnd that is critical Democrats a couple of minutes at least\nI mean I get when you look nobody wants to have a story that is uh doing sexual has done sexual assault get off of that we want people to come over here it's okay you have public that doubles like Keith Ellison hit the or\nThe guy who was the guy the ravens beat up his girlfriend ... by the hair and they they pay them more money\nJust for for whatever it's worth I mean I I I totally concur on the thousand I've said that publicly I campaigned for his opponent on line when he got into the primary for attorney general I said this is not right the way he's doing it um and\nDo shows you should be that's the end and not you may remember saying in general but it is it ... and it is bad because a lot of people will look the other way 'cause any should not be the number two\nPerson on the Democratic National Committee right but this is the Supreme Court and you have a guy who not only has a credible accuser and we'll put the other two aside from it but I think Dr Ford is an extremely credible accuser but she has new\nCorroborate that had a lot of cooperation and what's your corroborate her claim thing contemporaneous\nHis he's the people she said Bush President at the party he turned over calendars from the same month and at the same people are listed on his challenger and and being like\nDr Robert in fact the person I think that the parents are ... percent any by the door she lived in tiny apartments one door that was fought she said oh a\nLie detector test I never did that I don't know\nIt than her former person that David ... said no she actually got paid to help people through lie detector test you knew everything\nIt so there was a lot of things that she said that she couldn't recall or what Mr Mr thinking about it you can't sit there and say everything at that as\nAn actor I don't even know what's true anymore yeah that's harsh on the line I I\nDon't even know I think her testimony was a compelling test my bed I give you that everybody watched that but I thought he was too and if my reputation for being trashed I'd be a little emotional ... as as well what happens\nNow everybody's back in the corners it's a very divided country what it his gun indigent equalize the enthusiasm gap which was in the Democrats' favor prior to this I agree with that and and that is the politics of this we can argue forever that's got to be good judging history will tell bad for\nThe good you're not a ... this was the ... this was a circus I think it's diminished that both the institution of the Senate\nAnd the and the ... the clown show and I just sort of it's a good ... at least they took a week to go back in the interview some of these other people in close that the ... it's never going to be enough if you come back and you know take this guy out for the Democrats and on same on the Republican side so we'll have a vote tomorrow make advances in in ... and you move on\nI'm In ... and he doesn't pass through probably be the best result for the Republicans are going out more intense\nI agree I I think that the enthusiasm gap um I don't think it's not as much as the Republicans are claiming that have to think that there are some I'm like no way mirrors poem or not they're not you know in our internal polling sure as you as you know like you know pulling motion noise and it while this is going on there was a ... and the reality is rougher\nAnd the and the reality is that if you are correct and you're going to get confirmed\nThat there's not going to be a Republican boost from the from the election in fact it will be the opposite it's going to add to the army I'm\nRight in the Democratic intense and he was already at an eleven [noise] I mean I\nI don't think that's true in fact I think that the Democratic intensity and she doesn't Seventeen ... you know you look at Virginia it was only a pockets of neighborhoods there were places where it was an eleven um upper income white neighborhoods were off the charts for Democrats the like the minority communities which have always been a historic
