what's anywhere near that so we've got his finger on the pulse no doubt guys let's have you with us we've got to get to the Redskins and the caps in this segment but I've got to start with Virginia there's three seats here play ah\nAre very very close by anybody has\nA child and if if\nScott hurry maybe you've got other than you can certainly uh bring them up without\nEven claimed the fiber complex competitive\nYes Barbara Comstock whites than in the tenth Scottsdale are being challenged by a landlord and the second an\nIncumbent congressman Dave Brat going against several Abigail Spanberger in the seventh so let's start with the cat that's on everybody's mind western\nCops I look at the debate in Larimer County and er Jeff from Washington was horrific I mean she was just absolutely director of foods that are just ... she I mean I\nIf you try to be fair in a debate if if I dressed up as her and did that debate in my goal was to be horrible she did worse than I could've done it pursing her tribe either what what's up with that\nBut this announcement that the temp district is competitive ... by Barbara Comstock for Congress\nI mean it is going to be a double digit rate she's reading from a script because he's trying not to screw up the fact that she's going to end by double digits um shall be asleep is capable of of doing more um than um\nThan that um you know she's been a state senator so I'm Talking on policy side um says she's not without chops right but at this point in this rates she's being told we just script don't mess up that's what happened in that debate I don't disagree with you that like you know\nDid was she a little plane at the debate yes did she make any major errors no\nAnd that's my Barbara Comstock so upset about the debate that you know wants to talk about oh she did so poorly Barbara's limited because Jennifer didn't make any errors that allows barber to get back in right\nIt's a landslide it's been a landslide the tenth district has every single demographic group is breaking against Trump in this country over represented in it\nIf the Democrats do not take the tent the Republicans will hold Congress at that I agree with I don't think yeah it's it's not an end right now that's not in the realm of possibility\nBut the Republican told me he was telling me that she's tired or slightly\nBarbara is going to lose by double digits Tom when she's over perform for pulling Everytime her whole career she though we're\nOn here here's the problem is in in every demographic group or the Republicans are losing market share right now are collected in for federal employees are high income educated voters gun now she's a woman and she talked\nWith the difficulty they have the Republicans took away the one weapon Frank Wolf and I had to survive up here and it was your marks\nI was not Tom Davis I was Mr Gordon prison Mr Woodrow Wilson bridge Mr rail to dealt with Barbara gets none of that uh because the Republicans get away with their constitutional obligation uh on on do you know to to designate projects\nSo this makes it even more difficult race it it's a single digit race at this point and ah I've seen\nJennifer in terms of their research on what they tell you what it is so I think this race quotas since I've seen races close a lot more at this point but this is this was a tough race it's a tough atmosphere and it's a tough district you remember\nTriggered what was that something you said he had just wants to make some ... [laughter]\nI just I got to treat that out at eight thirty\nAre with driven Tom Davis and ... and then you've got a lot of the truth you John just rhetoric let's get to the other races um let's get to the seven I just had Barbara I just said ... on my show yesterday the very top of the candidate\nNo doubt but ah I see a little momentum going for Dave I didn't think he was going to win a week ago now I I think he is going to win a Ben how do you see that race\nSo I I had that one as slightly in Republican up until the Kavanaugh hearings at this point I think it's a toss up on because what the Kavanaugh hearings did was really re energize and fire up the one voter block that's the problem for Dave Brat in some district which is suburban women\nUm and I think that the seven districts historically Republican should be Republican it voted Republican ... left me I'm so last year um but I'm the one path or a Democrat there isn't in regular in Chesterfield with the suburban women\nUm and I think Abigail the match for them and I think that the Republicans are doing everything they can to lose that block naturally right now um and so I haven't it's tough\nI think binge drinking Kool Aid on this Kavanaugh's nomination in terms of I mean I enter let me just say yeah in in terms of what this is doing politically and I think we all live in our own echo chambers and we all have our own perceptions of how it's done but what this was done in the nearest polling and some other polling demonstrate this is the Republican base is now\nActivated and needs to see as a gaffe which is favored the Democrats\nFor the last year and a half is now closed substantially\nAnd I think that works to perhaps paper ... David Wright has two two issues though outside the demographics district in the DNA that district is Republican number one he is not close the deal with some of cancers people and they were just as soon thrown under the bus and rent that she'd out for two years\nAnd bring back or ... you know somebody it's more in line with their thinking and and even some scores\nAnd secondly Tim Kaine is going to be exceptionally strong in that district he was mayor of Richmond if he has a political he's widely ... he's gonna say my wife ... but he's well regarding the enrichment where he was mayor he'd run I make\nSo you've got a factor that into this thing I still think at the end of the day that the DNA of that district establishes itself and bright wins but the but this was a close race in Democrats have nominated maple camp [noise] she's\nVery and or or whatever happens you're talking about uh somebody that's got to be involved in democratic politics for some time I think I think Abigail Spanberger is going to have got to be somebody that's going to be reckoned with a in a democratic circles for some time to check\nDot die you know I don't I don't know a ton about the district uh uh you know I Will say I was driving down the south side Virginia to go to an event last weekend and going through some of the rural counties and it seems like you're brat can pull margins outta those counties are but obviously the critical mass of the the district is in Chesterfield man right go so\nYou know I I Would probably say you know robotically it's a Republican district but obviously if it's a wave here than it could be one that the Democrats deal than would have to defend the twenty twenty\nOr let's get to the second district Taylor\nWhatever happened with a tale of the other day I had him on my radio show or the uh ... campaign put my [noise] my name and their team TV ads so I appreciate the PR for that one out of that race but\nThere is this is my first chance to respond to Scott right after he had his meltdown on your show um that went viral yet I'm Upset about our analysis last time um and now says has not changed she still lives um and\nUm I don't think I don't believe in New York Times poll I think it was you know I'd add up to this point at stuff new trials are pretty good at the last week they've they've not been um I think there's some noise going on\nUm but I think what is going to win and she's gonna win going away um so I think she's gonna wind going away things can be a [noise] a secular up until two months ago I was doing everything like um and he's really blown it\nAnd he's not going to win reelection and so are you saying because of the whole the validation Israel signatures issue in the way he's handled it and remember that this district is one of the few in the country\nThat not only sits in the ... side a media market but is in a media market that doesn't really stretch too many other districts so the media has been all over this is on the evening news and every night you know\nIt Barbara Comstock at a petition scandal in Tempe district it would've made these TV for forty five seconds one night\nOr maybe a week later they quickly re mentioned that you know 'cause you you cannot get away\nWith something like the tide water instead on hand to roast hills so let me let me look I think are the New York times poll property rights taken her is fixed that district very well\nOr you know it was a Navy SEAL all that kind of stuff is ... issue matrix and ease chosen I think you're in line with that district is not a far right kind of guy he understands a suburban Virginia Beach in those areas so we have all that going for him now this petition scandal has at least a little bit of a smart on him by Democrats\nPublic and what scares me about this is the fact that if you look nationally Democrats just a ton of cash\nAnd dropping a couple of million dollars on that race in the last week that megaphone just can overwhelm at this point in exaggerate these things I think I think New York times post correcting papers up to date a again if are betting I I I think he wins\nBut in this environment with the kind of money Democrats he put down a you've got to be nervous about this you're going to watch this aren't election night if the Democrats win this seat it tells me it's going to be a pretty good year for farm in terms of we're talking thirty five forty yeah is it about [noise]\nThe thing about this district is different than Comstock and it's definitely different than a brat is the turnout model is totally different and I think it's hard for Democrats to win the seat in a non presidential year are just based on who votes democratic and Virginia Beach Norfolk\nIt's you know the the typical democratic voters going to be a minority down there and unless you get an outsized performance it's not I think it's tough for the Democrat to win that seat I mean Glenn Nye one or two thousand eighty got flushed down the drain in twenty ten\nAnd the reason was democratic book came out in the presidential year for Brock Obama it wasn't there the next cycle for Glenn Nye 'cause nobody knew Glen I was [noise] um I think Scott Scott advantages that the turnout I remember back when I was in the house carcass we'd look at the turnout models and the numbers and [noise]\nYou know Virginia Beach in Norfolk the numbers are just forty percent of what they are in other parts of the state so it's just that it's you got a lot of people that live there that are you know enlisted men or women that are registered to vote elsewhere so it's just it's hard\nYou know to to bring people out in that type of environment even though it's bench correct you have what media market and\nYou know they could possible Scott from now till the end of the time but there's going to be a conservative there's going to be a conservative votes is going to come out\nAnd whether uh uh ... Maria I don't know how to pronounce it Luria whether or not she can get people out based on her name as opposed to you know Tim Kaine is not as big a magnet there as he is in Richmond [noise] um so I I still think it's a pill for the Democrats even though I agree it looks like Scott's kind of watch this one issue\nNineteen Ninety six and Tom Davis one member this well um we had a we had a scandal um state wide where John ... put a television ad up against Mark Warner who is John Warner was far ahead and um he photo shop Mark Warner and do a picture\nOr who's in the ... I Can't remember who we thought or somebody photo shop but Clinton I think yeah you socialize with Clinton but was it was while her green eyes ... there was a racial aspect to it too I Can't remember what they did but they sort of shut Mark Warner into a picture he wasn't in and I'm at a television ad\nAnd it was a huge went national scandal for John Boehner who had a moderate brand and was a guy that you know everyone looked she likes you know what you're trying to states got Taylor is\nThere like had a friend okay and and and that people you know like respected John Warner much higher than Scott Taylor though [noise] and and his numbers collapsed and more wonder was going to win that race because it's you know and I will say there's which I'm Wondering did was he walked out and he said\nAnd I'm responsible for what happened and I apologize and it's got Taylor done that he would want to be on\nAugust I was worse campaign chairman that year and it was a it was a close race mark Morris than fourteen million dollars of his own money not hear that made this really much closer race than it might have been other was John Warner was news on ... and that was the map you kind of earn it after running a close race there but I remember that and I really fired\nThe people that were involved in the ad and everything else and you broke it in it it was an issue for a week or two and then John too it kind of building up accountability [noise] said or has mishandled this thing I think it's just kind of misjudged it in tapping his people take the Fifth Amendment doesn't help it just keeps it in the news\nIs that enough to bring down somebody with a good reputation has done a good job in their first term or not\nUm and also I think that the wave turnout and they talk about a new wave I think you really talk about a ... wage that's really what's happening with the Democrats is that the suburban female voters have swung radically or to the Democratic party and that's I think I'll forget our predictions ruin your\nI'm an ... million Thirteen were there but not that popular when they're running and libertarian broke five percent and libertarians the automatic ballot access to the next five years in Virginia what's your ... going which are the public and\nThat was going to expire this year because ... percent again\nAnother tactic or a ... there'll be another five years the libertarian automatic ballot access while they're great\nAnd why is that really good point and ... what is this going to get over five no no question probably seven Godfather's here to get down here we are on you think do you think five or it's going to win or lose\nUh [noise]\nUh what what ... what about Scott Taylor\nMaria [noise] [noise] yeah we're going on down there [noise]\nAnd ah I see you alert [noise]\n\n[noise] and a\n... a terrorist gotten me nothing but negative publicity from up over the last several months and I don't see 'em climbing out of that whole it'd be wrong but I don't see that and I also do\nI mean there are a cop stock can talk about her internal all she wants that's not what people were picking up going door to door [noise]\nOr what have you heard of that risk [noise] I'm just I mean you know what our parents when the Democrats have gone to independent too\nFrank doors that those people are telling her they're worth it and went on occasion they've asked what's the main complaint and this is for counting all 'cause I talk to anybody since then [noise]\nUh it was the n._r._a. [noise] those ads have been effective but this chopping off thing I mean that's all you know the door to door and that's all I get\nI think it's kind of backfired are in fact the shots gotta go we've we've we've got to get around yep we've got to get the big game Monday Night ride Carolina right let's just start with where the or early in the right to be happy so far\nYeah generally happy I think the defence like I said a month ago yawn fast a good and and they're going to get better I think they're ... will get better\nUm I I think they need to give a couple of guys more snaps a couple of guys less naps but\nBy and large I like their defense to be a top ten defenses Sharon for the next few years going forward and make the point I\nThink they do they have one issue they need to solve and I can solve it if they listen to me they all week on the ends they don't have any big play receivers that can go down catch the ball you know catch eight balls for a hundred yards\nAnd you need to have that too when consistently in the NFL you can't just keep throwing your tied into your backs especially with a title like Jordan read that's never gonna get injured is Dan\nDan's on the street [noise] he's bet on the street I in you know Bruce has my from Brazil I emailed him literally within twelve hours of him being cut by Dallas begging begging them to pick up and as I have repeated it every time I said um [noise]\nThe day he sets his foot on Redskins park you'll be their number one receiver they could get rid of Josh dachshund yes I said it\nThey could keep Jamison in crowd on the slot they can get that keep that keep records and that there are number two receivers fast but then you need a big receiver who can pull down eight nine temple is a game for a hundred yards desk and do it\nAnd so if they put him on the team they will be the best team the NFC East and will make the playoffs White House [noise] Dallas like losing um I think it's [laughter] no they don't like to when they like to lose a lot of you know why do they do what they do what do they keep Jason geared his head coach you know I mean\nWhy do they get rid of Tony Romo and it's just I I think somewhere Jerry Jones just decided he was tired of winning the waters start losing for a while and so that's that's why does what he does\nThat what it what do you think that I mean it's the answers that dependency [noise]\nYeah I I'm I'm they were going down and I can't believe we're talking about the Redskins are not referring to him as the first place [noise]\nYeah that's true first place and a phrase or like the first place type yeah that's right\nI'm going to say at this point a lot better than I thought there'd be this year still very very tough schedule the next five weeks I'm going to say nine and seven and that may be enough to make the playoffs because the eagles are struggling and the cowboys and the giants are not dinner all this\nThe over ... you're going to the game since Ninety four\nAnd one of the things that the Redskins of lack for some time to speak Damon and I can't remember the last time I'm sure I probably missed something but I cannot remember the last time I've seen the Redskins a Redskin return a punt kickoff touchdown\nAnd a while and it's been a long time and I remember one little one of the hallmarks of a ... ... ... or say he always had her parents he called it more burn\nWhether it was you know on your nerves whoever I mean it was he always had at least one burner and we don't have that and uh it it shows\nHow many how many ... when you're there for us to get that nice\nTo talk of the last one I Know that one from five for now\nAnd I think [noise] they do have names [noise] maybe three more [noise]\nAh they beat New Orleans at the superdome and ... on the waiter in eleven o'clock season [noise]\nNo not\nAll right I'm going to go in the middle I think they've got to win ten games I think you gotta make playoff\nAnd here's your here's the thing about Alex Schmidt [noise] I'm not a fan of it because you can't win big games in the playoffs and so we got an exciting quarterbacks but you know I've watched him now three weeks I'm not a fan one way or the other but they're on TV [noise]\nBut I mean the masses games I mean he's never going to be you know he's never going to be yourself and he tried\nI could see that I can see why\nHim I mean he does he kinda fits what they're\nThe whole crew in philosophy is now a crime that I don't win games [noise] and I think that I think this team's gotta winter games are they they could get in the playoffs or be dangerous [noise]\nI got I got to sign off I got to be in court today okay thank you for sharing your events I mean I think we're going to let me just quickly add the unemployment\nDown to three point seven percent the lowest since Nineteen sixty nine lord since Nineteen sixty [noise] which you know I can certainly do not get a raise that just kept coming on this really quickly John [noise]\nThis is an amazing stat but not for the reason the Republicans wanted you to be an amazing that because people say nothing sticks on Trump\nAnd I think it's the opposite I think everything sticks on Trump the fact that you have an economy that's as good as it is and he's having a going to have a bad of an election as he pointed out everything is sticking to him because you should have with this economy [noise]\nOne of the first time that a president picks up see if there was an economy election [noise] um the Republicans could actually be gaining ground in the Congress and the areas where you're having the best\nSo for people to say nothing sticks to Trump\nEverything was sticking to try [noise]\nWell I think he gets credit for the economy and I think [noise] I think he gets credit for the economy and I think that mitigate against the wall says may take just because of the ... the cycle but these coalitions are basically cultural coalitions are not economic coalitions and\nAs I said the Democratic enthusiasm in the independents wanting to balance the government is really what\nHer to the Republicans [noise] people don't trust the Republicans to have the ... and you want some kind of ... he's doing okay they may vote for him in two years but in the mid term they want to put a check on [noise] I I was famous too I think the Democrats take the house is I think it's more likely than not\nAh I I don't know how they don't impeach the president when it comes out you got the Democratic base right now is rabbit they want to impeach him now before motors a commission\nAnd when you [noise] I I don't know how Democrats going back to their primaries in twenty twenty can't not to impeach Trump I I just think that happens in rent for tonight\nIs not the kind of our nature whether they have any any reasonable evidence or not because they have\nTo well I don't think they have reasonable evidence now I don't know what more is going to say none of it you know when you got to say [noise] um but I just think you look at the base and you look at the fact that the primary elections or what most of these members worry about it that it's politics or they're going to do it I'm not arguing with the insurance now takes on Capitol Hill yeah [laughter] well I I\nIf it changes the dynamic for twenty Nineteen it was one thing in twenty Seventeen Trump's than Republicans control everything to put a check on\nWhat the Democrats come in Congress like our clients of Republicans in Nineteen Ninety four it kind of Denver zero it's the end of Clinton nobody played off against the Republican\n... he actually did better than they would do it yeah and I think you have some of that dynamic in twenty Nineteen that's the way that the Democrats have real winters there back in twenty Seventeen you won't have that same level of wind and twenty a Nineteen now there are other factors matter of fact\n\n[noise]\nNews is our town hold on\nThey live in a

Yankees fan I'm a national fan so we're very much looking forward to the ethics read that it's gonna happen Astros Yankees remember that seven game series last season when most exciting ever yesterday went off weren't home the Yankees won three in the Bronx\nAnd I certainly do because after we went to Fenway\nI doubt I Can't do it I just I just I'm drained and those are the Yankee fans are going to get there going to be going crazy a good thing we didn't go because they didn't win the game they're not going to be I think when they got to get through Boston and all the games are again today also

J. F.\nAnd news talk real talk real people and then we got a great line\nThat is in the west Richmond area one hundred twenty five FM\nOne hundred and twenty five FM and that will cover western right go

the John ... radio network company life from a nation's capital in Washington DC truck to the truth\nThat left wing stagnant no growth policies where they just want to regulate five out of the white like they want to regulate it more than you're regulated in Europe um\nWe're we're no longer go longer in power in America was back to doing business and and the most important thing one of the most important part drawn this prosperity is spread everywhere and what do I mean by that is when you look at the economic\nYou read it in the wall Street Journal and read in the Financial Times or any other website reason they got the highest levels it's ever been because of ... is because of American making under fifty thousand dollars mhm\nIn the last eight years old in American didn't even know if they were getting paycheck for them leaving the workforce now is you just were talking about building in the workforce looking for better jobs\nThat's right now you're lucky obsolete now that I mean that's a one off untold story of Trump's economy is that it it is it an economy benefiting working class men and women like never before\nAnd when the Democrats to talk about one percent it's a lot of nonsense obviously everybody gets benefiting but it's not just it's ... this is not trickled down its push up because Trump's economic recovery from the first day has been aimed at middle\nAnd lower income working and unemployed Americans that's what he's focused on Sam Nunberg and that's what he's getting the success that where when Sam Nunberg he was a long time political operative for Donald J Trump was on the Trump campaign he's now a senior advisor\nTo Stephen King Bannon's new political action committee citizens for the American republic or car as we can call it was it an acronym that's an outside political group that is a ... a\nSurrogate and flooding the TV and radio air waves ahead of the mid term and Stephen Bannon also the author of the movie trumpet war you can do a Google that Fifteen minutes check it out Trump at war Sam Nunberg with Sam let's get to a\nLet's get two winners and losers in your mind on the Republican side Kavanaugh or any any side or the Kavanaugh victory who are the biggest one is\n[noise] well I think the obviously the biggest winner in the American people and it's our republic because now we have not only were able to fill the Kennedy they can see with\nAnother as strict construction as I Know Kennedy had some decision we all white or remember one thing we allies Obamacare right away they had any legalize many of these large government regulatory powers\nChief justice Roberts hats I said I think that we have the first thing is that we strengthens our constitution I think the second\nWinter obviously most importantly is American people here and why do I say that because this could have gone one or two away in high ... high happen now not even my first choice not your first choice\nBut I counted out not come out and given that respond in his opening statement after ... testimony you would have had he probably would not have the right and\nYou're allowed to use heat in group court and it sounded like you know it's time to like talk to and it's funny to you know I say bowler who didn't so much he shouldn't act like put him in jail in political enemies and trying to undo election\nBut the Democrats to you know very they're very they're very top against Russia don't you know I think that one they are they also they were acting like a Russian a Soviet communists mob mob trial but Chinese all of your old\nAgain again having out so I think that that was very important now from a political point of view\nObviously this is a win for the Republicans the issue is do we maintain and we're already ten ten days from now\nWe remember why we realize why there's something like this selectivity imported enjoy remember what's happening now show that you could have it out when they're only about the Supreme Court wasn't about Cabot out about the direction of the country we wanted and it was about to elections matter\nMhm are you going to let the Democrats\nTake over the house in the Senate and really throw the country into disarray show we'll find out so for that point of view from a strictly political point of view it remains an open book we don't know yet\nWell look\nYou're right because one of the the the only apprehension I have is that uh the Republicans who were very far up\nRight now by the time we get the ... the end of the next twenty nine days see how the hell that uh we get we got the guy we wanted to kind of forget about it so you've got to keep them fired up and do that because the slightest thanks Sam this is this is the most critical midterm election in our history I mean\nI Know a lot of Republicans are fired up about Obamacare and I remember I called I was calling me up when the Supreme Court passes saying that it was the end of the Republican and it was like okay it's a tax I mean you know you get a tax you don't have the time\nIt was just policy it's no big deal we didn't like it but it was attacked so why this was quite different maybe because now you're talking about the direction of the country um\nGive me the biggest loser in all this\nCalled the biggest loser [noise] [noise] I think that I think the biggest loser one\nUnfortunately are women who have been abused yeah look I'm getting pretty talk on the record mhm um I was much tougher line made a point when he spoke about even two weeks ago on your show and thank you for having me on a lot it's an honor but I said I thought she was lying I'm I don't know what happened to her that we can council\nAnd Brett Kavanaugh out job recently has mental problems but the biggest loser the women's movement the me too movement which has been importing\nIn corporate America which has been courting the entertainment industry in the news industry likes to point out mostly Democrats but the the minor details on credit I Would say I love her but she was used in the way\nUm go to Congress remember she looked at her lawyers and when she was ... you know that we could have gone to California\nJust shows you that this really how because [laughter] requesting care about her the Democrats didn't care about\nUm what actually happened to her well did Democrats were I just wanted to throw in the kitchen sink the worst kind of way but I'm a truck this money can surprise us look what you're talking to somebody who frankly and I send their people want to criticize it I don't really care\nI dealt with in birth origin I Kevin Burke three of them I knew ... was born\nIn the United states I mean you know typically produce probably you know I think the real problem the issue is that politics as presidential politics and stuff for electric what they did here was they went out to sea can destroy\nSomeone and in the worst possible once again so I think that's really the biggest loser dumber cracked me don't lock on law\nArmed there will be fired up there were using a lot of money as well um I think that the clear dining clarify their presidential field such that it didn't last week's show\nA little bit I think Michael nodded he he was going to get any more attention by we'll find out on that one once again once again I mean girls can block the biggest the biggest loser if you want to point to anyone that I think it would be a loser wide definitely our Michael I Would not eat mhm\nDianne Feinstein and probably Cory Booker\nI went in Greece San with all those right down the line\nLisa Murkowski John I forgot I got into a sex or look one thing people like you and me who have had our criticism of coke Amish but trust me he'll get back in her to cook she she got something come into her message I think her on the Republican side\nAbsolute loser and McConnell big winner and you know I never I never saw the sign of a call and you and I understand I Know there probably was the biggest [noise] in in on the side uh\nOver the cultural and every other we usually think he's done that are looking shocked and so you gotta give credit where it's you know and he was a big part in this\nProcess or the equivalent high thing for him John when Trump came out with their second debate actor and D.C lead the Access Hollywood tape out yes let me\nTell you what they they're all calling for Trump dropped out and he just came out there and he just destroyed her second debate and he started talking about the Supreme Court if he gained a lot of supporters so people are like I mean not like this guy personally have done a lot of terrible things before but I got\nLast year wage increases than the upper at ... and that's pretty remarkable I think and we've seen that throughout blue collar workers a big story in the paper or a couple of weeks ago blue collar workers have in their back in ... in many many years\nPresident Trump you know it opens up the economy is lower tax rate deregulation lowered energy you stop the war against it and then he stopped the war against thinks that he stopped the war against energy\nAh right now the American economy is crushing it and it's going to go on for a while in my judgment for [noise]\n\nOf the troops great to have you with his wife and the nation's capital and Washington DC in the swamp poor little down the
