Facebook now she's doubled down you know now it's not big for that you know they're trying to portray me as crazy based on I guess Halloween costumes and you know me John I have a good time so\nIf they it's just it's amazing that last week she pretty much apologizes for marginalizing veterans says she's going to stick to issues then she puts out a commercial or calling me an extremist and trying to make fabricated things up again this is what the left does\nTheir own hands it's desperate ploy by desperate candidates and that's why common sensors back that's why conservatism is back and that's where I'm going to win the fifth\nCommonsense and back and I'm your commander\nOf common sense Dennis ... without running for\nCongress that district Virginia let's get near the caravan I'm the president with my later today saying he's going to deploy a thousand troops you got to do a series of executive orders that would stop the caravan from\nComing into the United states the problem is as soon as they step forward and say the word asylum we can't do anything or ... wars in the loop holes in them Denver are written in such a way that all they have to do was get a toe in get their\nHand grab and say asylum and that we can't do anything they cannot go back what are you seeing the president's proposed action here if you're in\nCongress now what would Denver Riggleman proposing on this terror that\nWell you know the rule of law and uh we're we're we're a nation of laws and we believe in the rule of law and the way the laws were written right now you're exactly right John I don't know you know how we we don't honor that based on what we believe us conservatives enroll in and people who follow the rule of law however\nI think Congress needs to start fixing these immigration laws as soon as possible\nAnd I also believe once that happens are vetting process for any of these people that are coming through has to be extreme vetting uh we do have some of the technology in place now but we don't put time limits on this if there's that many people that are headed towards the border or we don't know what's in better\nThan those in John my biggest fear um it's easy you know it's like a Trojan Horse right listen Ninety five percent Ninety nine percent of those people could actually be seeking asylum um those that you know our hearts sort of go out to ... with compassion however if you have people inside there that are bad\nActors and they're able to hide you know within this caravan\nWe have to ... them out and my guess is this going to be sending some pretty healthy intelligence assets down range\nI think we're going to be monitoring and my guests\nTrying to scare banner seeing any type of emissions that are coming out of there talking about radio emissions or any kind of been told that we can glean this is not a good situation this is not good\nAnd at some point I think we have to fix or immigration laws in a way that again are are much more common sense than the sort of sort of ridiculous since we have now are going on on the border\nUm the\nI think the concern that everyone has Denver is that okay there's twelve or Thirteen or fourteen thousand people we have to deal with it and uh everybody wants to be concerned everybody's concerned about the humanitarian aspects but a lot of my color here's what they're concerned with okay if they get in\nIf this Fifteen thousand to get then the next one's going to be a hundred and fifty thousand and you're not gonna be able to stop that either because we'll never get a wall up in time and even if you have a wall you got a hundred and fifty thousand people that it's just a lot of people so um are you in favor of the president\nTaking action now to stop the knees a that's a mob caravan from bomb rushing\nThe border and coming in are you in favor of stopping them from coming in now\nYes yes I mean it's\nIt's I mean is it a matter of national security or it is a matter of precedent um and again this comes back to it was a normal American will say hey you know we understand people want to come to the United states but there is a legal process [noise] um and we're gonna have to we're gonna have to follow that legal process\nYou know and we we think that legal process used to be applied all immigrants and you and you're exactly right John\nThis would set a precedent that could really be damaging to the United states' security to our\nPolicies into our role of law or you're right if the if we just allow everybody in we're actually sort of acknowledging that open borders is what we want if we don't follow the rule of law and we don't stop these these migrants sadly we we have to stop 'em now from coming in and set a precedent\nDenver at the birds are in about five or ten minutes the U.S government is going to release the new economic numbers or GDP expected to grow again this quarter at\nSo over four percent that could be four point one more point to four points rent a bomb autonomy was shutting along in about a half percent growth I mean this growth unprecedented what do you look for in that report\nAnd ... which can close and you'd think you might draw out of it on the economy general recommend\nWell the thing I first I'm going to look for [laughter] and it's just because um\nI got on this stuff is I'm going to look at the specific whatever records that I have I'm going to look at the number of jobs are based on that are open right now and I look at Virginia but I also see where we're going as far as employment but GDP gross I'm going to look in manufacturing and I'm looking at agriculture I Love looking into the numbers and see where that growth is\nAnd if we're continuing on this line John if we're continuing with the lowest unemployment claims and forty nine years of her continuing with Los minority unemployment for continuing which he ... he grows four percent of every quarter which you know is amazing ah at the new norm\nThey're saying is that the tax cuts work on the job for format worse opportunities zones can be lovers here in the in the commonwealth\nA ... and opportunities on investment all the things that we look at to encourage opt entrepreneurship to encourage people keeping their own money is working and that's what I'm gonna look at it this report is is this just a continuation\nOf this amazing amazing surge or are we seeing an even more positive future for the people in the fifth district but also in the United states and then the commonwealth of Virginia I think we are I think you're just seeing the beginning of this economic boom and um I I'm\nReally just really excited to see what those numbers say\nBased on where job growth on what sectors are growing right now\nWhat kind of interesting to see these are coming out momentarily we expect that that we're going to get over four percent growth and it's really really tough for a Democrat right now to talk about economics the economy or any of the issues that pertain to jobs and prosperity in America so they'd rather talk about something else that's why your opponent\nLovely Coburn is talking about your Halloween costume because she doesn't want to talk about the economy she doesn't want to talk about job she doesn't want to talk about growth didn't want to talk about kids moving on to the basement she doesn't want to talk about the boom and small businesses\nJust want to talk about the deregulation she doesn't want to talk about the number of investments that are going on because of the tax cut especially as it relates to one hundred percent deduction of\nCapital investments Rob doesn't even understand it and so she doesn't want to talk about any any of that she'd rather talk about your Halloween\nCostume in two thousand five\nYeah and I mean which I Will not take down off and that by the way here's what you would rather talk about she'd rather talk about forty million dollars in spending not only for Medicare for all but also for forgiving student debt right which is one point for a trillion dollars right now free community college for all are free college for all\nEverything she said and even in debate she was like I Want to give away this she doesn't understand the taxpayer money is what you're using I get so limited\nBased on what I fought for you know and government overreach she says she loves government I fear government I think government should be limited I think government should be efficient she's also for the taxpayer money for the middle class is nothing more than confetti\nShe's compared to the Nazis I mean I I find that just stunning John that anybody would vote for Leslie\nHer views are great for San Francisco and maybe a three square mile area there or somewhere up in Georgetown right in DC but for the fifth district it's absolutely appalling\nThat she thinks these values are actually a political to the people the fed is not every day and work for a living and don't give a rat's with the chattering class is saying on CNN or MSNBC or any of these other far left\nAnd they are now they're just they're just propaganda machines and I think at some point ah that's going to break through that you have comments you have this coalition of common sense\nAgainst progressive pander is and I think that's what's happening in the fifth district and we're going to win this John because I represent American values I\nRepresent conservative values but I represent what the fifth wants to do right now and that's why we're going to win this\nDenver Riggleman I Want

all the conservatives so\nThis is not the first time that the guilt by association or let's let's let's slammed the conservatives let's blame everything on conservatives not the first time it's been done before we even know who actually sent these packages so\nIt's a everybody's got to calm down take a breath and ah I think Sarah Sanders had it right we should be coming together the president is calling for unity dialing down their rhetoric\nA and the Democrats are going in the opposite direction they're they're they're blaming the president unequivocally no question about it taking no responsibility whatsoever\nFor calling the guy look at the sky Brennan so the president's guilty of trees and what's the what's the penalty for treason death is basically a former head of the CIA had been out they're\nCalling for the president to be hung by the neck until dad and this is not considered inflammatory rhetoric I it's it it's disgusting the whole thing is just just hypocritical heat people will go down in the ... as the all time great is hypocrites\nSomething a Curtis I I think you make a great analogy the depression and other Democrats who cried and screen than wind about Kavanaugh\nDocumenting the FBI not investigating everything I mean why don't we just wait here I mean the FBI seems to be home again in southern Florida they're going to come up with a report pretty soon it we're we're we're going to find out the answer I mean why not just wait\nRight exactly how about everybody say calm down\nLet's we got we we have the FBI on the case\nUnless this guy was a or gal or or or bought or whatever [laughter] whatever entity it was that created these packages and less that entity was a very very very sophisticated person\nAre able to buy it and if they were very sophisticated they were\nCould Jews delivered to these various places coming out of one place there are a lot of clues there and I'm confident that the FBI will be able to figure something out here and find out who did it for narrow it down and the fact that they use Debbie Wasserman Schultz as a return address\nThat's kind of interesting in itself Debbie Wasserman Schultz who's the one who was forced to step down\nFrom head of the Democratic National Committee\nA big cause she had been rigging the system for Hillary against Bernie I don't know what that means but it's sort of an interesting clue you know maybe somebody thought that was funny to use her name out all these bombs [noise] I don't know\nUh but my point is this unless this was a very sophisticated operation that they knew how to cover their tracks at every step of the way\nYou've got twelve packages now that the FBI is investigating it let's wait for the FBI to figure this out to come up with something yeah why not wait before you start\nA and and why not why are they not waiting because they want to politicize it\nThe the Democrats are missing no opportunity to score political points on this\nWell it's a ... it seems it just seems odd to me that that all this is happening but let's wait I mean that's where everybody's saying let's wait time let's get to get the economy will get to the Taliban invasion after the bottom of the hour a but let's\nGet to the new economic numbers that just came out\nThe gross domestic product GDP growing another three and a\nHalf percent now let me just say what this means right that's the first time that we have had\nBack to back quarter a in a very long time of of over three and a half percent growth back to back and consumer confidence uh up at an all time I can do with spending was one percent another great a\nQuarter of economic growth this is more bad news for them they don't want to talk about that that they don't want to talk about the economy or jobs or the growth so what did they talk about\nAre they talking well they talk about they've got this wonderful thing to talk about this horrible thing to talk about here with the with the bombs and they talk about the president again they're falling in they don't realize they're falling into a trap and and it's their own trap a crop of their own making\nPeople don't want to hear the Democrats talk about the president they want to hear Democrats Republicans the politicians in Washington\nTalk about what they're what the politicians are going to do for them to make their life better write what I I I go to work every day I got a family to support\nI got a job I'd like to get a raise what are you going to do to make that happen how are you gonna make my life better easier make me rich uh make make make my kids you know healthier\nDon't do that [laughter]\nDoing that John Yoo about\nPresident Trump causing the bomb scare\nDoesn't do that so they're going back to the for the last two years old I've been talking about is President Trump is a Russian agent and now they're President Trump as a Russian agent who creates bomb scares I mean they're they're not doing themselves any favors\nAnd on the other side I mean it very very clear jobs not mobs President Trump and the Trump Administration\nHave created the best economic conditions in this country in in a generation the best we've seen in ten Twenty years\nAnd that goes along the way that\nDancers people's questions what have you done for me lately you got me a job you've gotten me a raise you've gotten my kids on food stamps got kicked out of the basement there on their own now great thank you very much\nI'm going to pose questions to answer it when it gets back so stay with us for another segment is about a hour but\nWhen you get back you know you and I were Trump Tower for the last two weeks and the cat jumped yoga almost like deja vu all over again I mean [laughter]\nI mean I could go back to the scene and it's the same thing we think everybody tell Trump couldn't when it was all you know whatever it was that he was going through at the time with the Access Hollywood it with us that we're going\nAnd uh so yeah it is there is a feeling that things are moved here all of these national generic ballot polls are meaningless because there's not a national election\nOther they're all like I mean it's all the calls are\nOn the talk all day about the Washington Post poll that came out yesterday that shows up for whites than they had a Barbara Comstock energy instead just drink like Thirteen look like it might when she said she's the favorite no doubt that's a very tough but just for the Republicans can win barbecue\nEvery internal poll that the Republicans have from the White House to the end or the team to Barbara down shows the race does not have a Thirteen points but this is what the Washington Post jobs they\nGet a uh they get a ridiculous methodology to get a state polls get effect analysis of it to do fake news to get a fake inclusion\nDrawn so they can continue on with their fake narrative\nIsn't there doubling down it's the same nonsense by the way you're on the John triggers radio network

and um same on the other side but I I don't think it's a good spirit the theory another year from Saudi Arabia\nThat the killing of democracy jog you appear to have been premeditated wow really what news flash wow like you would any did come out you had somebody else go in and come out in his clothes you can't find his body the guy had the wrong shoes on\nYou had Thirteen in intelligence officers fly\nIn and out the same day or the car that women didn't go out we never saw him again the dog ate the camera footage you flew in a forensic doctor with a chainsaw or saw 'em\nAnd you gave everybody the day off you gave all your Turkish of poison that stamp all the day off in both the embassy and the cops on home I mean the conflict and and it's all\nAnd now the knowledge that it appears to have a dream meditative wow well that's a real Dick Tracy right there man you're a regular Sherlock Holmes hey this\nProsecutor for the kingdom a he's a regular I hate the Sherlock Holmes man this guy either expect your cholesterol virus all\nOne wow I mean what great investigation that is this your mouth to show me thing for the kingdom of such an absolute joke it is and it's just a a bumbling it's bumbling and here's the deal and I said this on\nAl Jazeera yesterday I don't know what the president's going to do about this was going to do something that's number one number two what every judge who's going to consult the secretary of state Mike Pompeo he tried to sell Gina Haspel but they're going to do something they have to do something you have to react to this now I\nDon't think he's going to cancel the arms deal because he said look I got to deal with that it's economically benefiting the country and if I can see what they're simply going to buy the weapons from China or Russia so why would I Do that here's the other people said oh the president's position has or has keeps changing no the president hasn't had\nA position [noise] other than he discouraged the idea of scrapping the arms deal everything\nElse is on the table including withdrawing our support from the Saudi Emirates coalition and then you have any civil war so everything else was on the table so to say that well his position keeps changing he hasn't had a petition he's done commentary what'd you devolve based on new facts to come out\nAnd the Saudis have changed their story ten times did they change it again yesterday and no change it again tomorrow\nAs more facts come out so\nI don't understand what they're saying the president has changes because you have a position he's waiting for the fact that President Trump is not a politician he's a businessman here's our businessmen make decisions facts numbers spreadsheets and Matt so as the facts come in\nAnd the mathematical equation gets put together his commentary\nPosted to the end of the day I don't know what the final outcome of the U.S reaction is going to be but I've been saying this all week in the middle middle Middle East on TV this president does it take well to being lied to and\nI don't think there's any doubt\nCrown prince Mohammed bin Solomon light 'til I don't think that goes over well with President Trump he doesn't like being lied to here's the other thing that just like dealing with it competent people he doesn't have a lot of patients\n\nI'm telling you crown prince Mohammed bin Salman is incompetent everything the guy at thirty three years old has gotten\nInvolved in has been a complete Arden medicated disaster for the Saudi kingdom was actually the father just have to say you know what my son has been incompetent bumbling before and I got to put somebody else in\nThe country to to lead because it's guys and capable of being king because he does stupid stuff including this assassination allegedly\n\nThe Saudis have now ... but I just signed a final story or something but that's going\nTo change again so who knows what the uh the showcase has here's what it's tough\nIt is really brought renewed focus\nTo the Saudi Emirates tactics and they support that we're giving them and getting involved in the Yemen's civil war which is causing a horrific very disturbing very growing humanitarian crisis where I just got to tell you there's a\nUm on outages there every day I see the pictures you do see because uh the fake news networks today they don't want to show your real news they want to talk about\nYou know President Trump Stormy Daniels or whatever they do\nBut I\nI see the pictures on TV and I mean it'll really tear\nOut your stomach but you've got children just starving I mean they can ... that the that they they got mother's stripping park from trees bark and boiling it just matching it up just so there's something in there and then there's probably eating grass\nI mean there's no food I mean just think about how to get your child you're sitting there and they started that let me think about how that feels\nMint made such thing as a as a horror show it is worst in the area it's worse than anything I've seen and our involvement in it\nIs shameful and it's absolutely shameful\nAnd if there's anything to track and wanted us to show you fair or\nWe're going to get the hell out of there as we should it is just it it's horrific that the United states is involved in something of this nature\nSpeed post or whatever they have on the phone like Mike in Oakland Europe you're on the air Mike\nHey John\nI ah I agree with you on the other thing I think that's you're exactly right about that so um I I Do know that comes out of this for anything good could come out of this thing I think that would be good but\nI have to point out the irony or in something you said just a few minutes ago I'm sure you didn't pick up on it because you don't agree but um you know you said the president or the the two things he doesn't like he doesn't like to be like two and he doesn't like incompetent\nAnd I I Can't help but think he must be he just wants to all that to him so\n[laughter] yeah he sure he likes to lie to us and I feel that he's in competing for the jobs just doesn't want to share those two things with others [noise] well\nI guess ah I guess you'd say just tremendous economic renaissance and forming tremendous economy we have an all these jobs I guess you think that's the work of incompetence I guess you\nThink the fact that we haven't heard from ISIS in that they'd been kicked kicked out of the majority of their caliphate and they they now only can throw a tiny part of terror tore yet when he took over it was a massive I get your you think that's a topic I guess you think that the fact that\nThe wacko when North Korea has not done a nuclear tests and she threatened them I think that's incompetent\nI get your take all these new jobs we have in the fact that we just keep going up in the top of that and there's a tax cut and you figure that's an confident so I guess you're not step edition of incompetence\nMike ... is just a little bit different\nI guess it is a you know some of those things could have happened whether he was in office or not\nShow or I\nMay want to someone\nWho is competent than that position what kind of progress should we be in right now that\nOut you know what I thank you for straightening yeah it's Bob economy Obama leaves office in the job so plenty wages are Rob savings jobs there are people are moving to the basement kids have jobs everything is up and it's all because I bought on your for pointing\nOut on January two thousand seven to come on\nAll the automatic [laughter] Mike I got to

about that\nA MPs will have a ... a day I think have a lot to answer for and I think they have to be held accountable so I Do think that there has to be significant a penalties that they suffer I Do think to the question has to be asked is like\nDoes the United states believes that it can carry on a continued relationship with Saudi Arabia which I Do think we need to but\nCan that be where the crown prince I think that's a pretty compelling question I think the\nAdministration is going to have to ask that I think Congress will eventually addressed that an asset to you know what will be the penalties\nAre to uh to Saudi Arabia I listen I understand the impact of those of those contracts for what we're doing to supply a military uh equipment to Saudi Arabia I think Saudi Arabia I can be a like a a force\nOn it that is is a is a is an ally to us in the in the middle east but I don't think that it can it can be that\nType of ally that we wanted that we eat if this is how\nThey're going to operate I mean we have you know we have principles in the United states that we that we stand by and our allies have to have to abide by those and I just don't see Saudi Arabia doing that you know you you point out the issue with Yemen too and you and I have talked about that before\nA those are all questions I think that come up in how we see Saudi Arabia operating\nIn the region house policies being played out and are are they are they doing the same as necessary in that region or that create stability and that and that are\nWorking in the in the best interest of all involved not just Saudi Arabia but uh other allies in the middle east and listen I I I understand what they're doing that to push\nBack against the Iranians but are are they doing things that are in the long term moving in the middle east in the right direction I think those are questions that we have to ask ... foreign policy standpoint\nAnd I think that U.S policy toward Saudi Arabia you know needs to needs to be directed by those I think Eric I'm very sobering issues that we have before us\nSo it seems like congressman Whitman a were total agreement and it seems like what you're saying is the best way

they don't want to work people say well what are they going to\nChange the pony methodology to get it right never because they don't want to get it right because it's not about\nAccurate poll it's about the poll driving fake news to get a fake narrative to draw the conclusion that's all it is it's all why\nThe washer posed actually putting out a poll yesterday actually putting out a poll showing Barbara Comstock\nTrailing Jennifer ... than in the ... district by surging point now there is no way that Washington has a Thirteen\nPoint lead over bar because it's like every internal poll that I have seen in our top stock every internal poll that his pay four and a lot of money shows this raised a dead heat or Comstock\nSlightly ahead and the Washington Post has got Tom shot down by Thirteen doesn't take complete and utter lie in it to be on fake news and it's beyond the argument it's beyond the national Enquirer what they tried\nTo do they have to start so much they want that seat so bad\nThey want the liberal do nothing Jennifer watch than in there so bad they can taste it they want their left is in that seat so much that they will\nActually conducted poll make things up doing it in such a way to get a result that they want so they could put it out there and say the race is over don't give Tom start getting money and don't work for her it's a lost cause so they\nDo a
