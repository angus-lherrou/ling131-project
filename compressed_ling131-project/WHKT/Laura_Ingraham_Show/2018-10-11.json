I mean it's just not accurate the pre existing conditions were there I was in Johnson City when the president gave his speech last week and he said\nWe're going to protect preexisting conditions and I think that's what you respond within you know a lot of it is smoke and mirrors\nThat the Democrats are just playing politics with just like they did with the Kevin I'll situation 'cause that's fresh in voters' minds\nAnd we're not going to do anything a pre existing conditions that one failure of the Republicans prior to Obama and the Democrats taking control was they never dealt adequately with that and we're not going to make that mistake again we're going to make sure I Would marry then but we are going to make\nSure that people with preexisting conditions are taken care of in the house bill created these invisible risk pools\nExisting conditions regular costs you would never know if you were out in you know a doctor getting the insurance card but the government to accept that cost and that lowers everybody's costs because now the insurance companies aren't having to put it into\nSomebody's family who doesn't have a pre existing conditions that next perpetrate center spread it around to everybody so the people with a condition or taking care of and it's better for the people who don't have a pre existing condition because they're not paying that additional risk in a pool\nOr the Democrats line about this [noise]\n[noise] well there certainly ... barricade\nAnd trying to you know make it appear that it's something that it isn't a they're playing a lot of clever word games in ... but you know\nThere Ninety nine percent wrong there is under one scenario\nLike I said if you stand on your left leg and then there was a heavy wind blowing the somehow a steady if they could get a waiver couldn't figure out a way to get around at a but\nYou know I just don't see those very clear and I think they lose in court but that would be the Democrats attacking the very issue that they think are that they're claiming that they are the champions us\nAnd you know is there a legal case that maybe somebody could challenge it under certain circumstances yeah maybe but I think it looks so\nIt's pretty close to a lot but not a hundred percent they do have one little threat but they can hang on for some legal case somewhere in the future um that nobody political

that you're pigeon holed in [noise] and you say okay I'm a gimmick a two years and I'm I'm On a step sat and you tell the president that he says well I Hope you change your mind she doesn't and it looks like it was all very friendly and [noise]\nYou know there weren't any tweets back and forth about this that or the other and you know sometimes people just move on\nReplacement idea you\nKnow I

two to four three two one for more\nInformation go to America First policies dot org America First policies dot org this message page for authorized by America First policy incorporated joining us now by boy he's a political editor and\nWriter for Breitbart News you can follow that go to Breitbart News get their\nAnd he broke a story yesterday or\nThe majority leader of the house of representatives congressman McCarthy who is from California and\nI wouldn't be the leading candidate for speaker provided the Republicans hold the house wants to make Trump's wall campaign referendum this story broke yesterday by Matt boil and he is with us now Matt ...\nHe is going to be introducing a bill or later this week he's at he's actually go on a ... at the border day so he was ah he flew down to Florida last night he sees\nHe and his tumor getting a threatening assessment briefing from our border patrol agents and law enforcement officials down there\nBut then when he gets back to Washington DC later this week he's going to introduce a bill that fully funds to the border wall so all the rest of the money they will go for the border wall in addition to that I had a number of other enforcement measures grass Kate swap\nWhich has already passed the house it has an ending century city where he was already passed the house or the ... as well as going out for a criminal alien gang members are contained in the bill I'm so all those things and a few more\nOr other things like standing on friday the gym thing going after legally and voting would all be in this bill and the important thing here is is that there's been no does have the votes\nTo pass the house of representatives I was a Republican support at this stage though with only fifty one senator as it doesn't look like it would pass the Senate and this has been the reason why we don't have the\nThe wall money yet right like in this has been the whole thing right as Senate Democrats have been holding it up because they need sixty votes in the Senate so looks like based off of these mid term elections are\nRepublicans are going to get a few pickups in the Senate seats right like so it looks like based off the latest polling and everything the public and to make it to work sixty\nFive fifty six senators the question is whether or not they're going to hold the house\nSo if Republicans do hold the house majority them this kind of a bill that fully fund to the boardwalk can pass both the house and the Senate and we can't get into the president's desk and actually fun to walk\n[noise] so what are the amount of money that McCarthy advocating in this bill for the wall\nA twenty four billion dollars approximately four billion dollars that's that's what they say they need\nAnd so we get the job done so he's got the right funding into twenty four billion dollars now the way I read your piece McCarthy wants to make this a campaign issue a referendum if you will a wall referendum for the mid term shortfall\nYeah that's exactly right and so again if Republicans hold the majority in the house and they add a number of seats in the Senate then they're going to be able to get the wall funding before wall funding to President Trump next year\nIf they don't if they lose the house and the Democrats take it that the Democrats are going to be able to block the wall and from the house just like they've been doing from the ...\nSo the point is is that what McCarthy's bill dies is it makes the entire election uh mid term referendum or this this entire mid term election a referendum on the wall that any votes\nIt's a little trick illegal alien crime it's a vote for him as Thirteen right like it's I mean that the Democrats are the party of illegal alien crime and MS Thirteen the Republicans are the party of law and order and\nPresident Trump made that case over and over again so if you want the wall and the water you have to show up and vote for Republicans it's as simple and that's what they're told fight lays out but it's it's really it's become a referendum on on many other things you don't get me wrong I don't think this election is just about immigration\nBut it is very much about immigration\nRate like so it's it's very much about immigration and many other things as well including the economy including a the ... you know what kind of country that we want to be including do you do you support the craziness of the resistance that we've seen all these people that have gone off the rails with this whole cabinet our situation right like\nWhere the Democrats have gone nuts but the point is is that a ... it's very much a referendum about immigration as well\nAnd so again I if you want a border wall you got to vote for the Republicans if you don't want a border wall if you want a\nA lawlessness if you want illegal aliens committing murder if you want a MS Thirteen running around if you want to drive to spreading through your community or they're brought here by drug cartels vote for Democrats by all means right I guess that's what you want but I don't think the vast majority of Americans\nSupport the opioid crisis I don't think the vast majority of Americans support a MS Thirteen committing crimes in their neighborhoods I don't think the vast majority of Americans want MS Thirteen that their kids' schools by so fast and the fact of the matter is is the way to stop that both Republicans gets off [noise]\nSo this is gonna be a national referendum on the wall McCarthy going down there today when it's going to lead us out and and by the way many great job in breaking story and if you don't know a boil for many listeners out there he is the political writer\nNews ... hours from town halls dot com [noise] I'm Greg clocks than in Washington\nToday

this information becoming public and they don't want the president to release it and they're talking about all the consequences of it I mean is that where they go in ...\nThat's why I'm here [noise] make it plain to every body which is all the more reason why it needs to be disclosed sooner or later [noise]\nSeventy pounds melt leader standing right now people trying very hard to cut their careers who's doing it\n[noise] [noise] right now the state and probably the FBI or to wind up\nReading not merely staying and I think so yeah\nRoses seen a study and and so you got to get a wire and trap the basically here's her husband's he said I'm going to wear a wire and trap the president\nAnd then go to the cabinet and say the guys are not fit to be president look what he said he's not fit and then try to invoke the uh what what is it the twenty Fifth Amendment twenty Fifth Amendment\nFor Herman and get them out right I mean that's what that's what that's what ... said to do and and now you find out the elements kidding well first of all you don't get about something like that second of all\nNow we find that the people that he went to didn't think it was and they took it very seriously and they thought it was going to act on it that's number three then he meets with the president says you know it's fine [noise] he can stay\nI tell you what Goldman I cannot get this picture on my mind can I tell you what it is I cannot I cannot get it out of my head um I was that the swearing in ceremony for judge Kavanaugh on Monday Night at the White House and I was part of the

I don't I don't my head 'cause that was right there\nAnd he comes in Stuart dizzying and he's like swagger wing away and he's and he goes to one in and he starts working the line like shaking hands like from one end to the other like he's running a campaign on a on a whole lot\nHe starts working the line from one end to the others Milan backslapping\nShaking hands hugging and then he sits down and who's in the front row all the push people write all the RMC holdovers right they're all they're right there in the shape like he was their conquering shrinking hero and I'm saying to myself this\nRat weasel who were done everything to sink this president\nComes in there like some ... ... try out for the Victor\n[noise] well I think the president has him exactly where he long seem right now it's all going to work out fine [laughter]\nI don't think we just have to trust the president and to know that mean things that we don't know now what do you not be a good time to\nPut their department and through that upheaval we get we need to focus on the terms and get everybody out to vote the way they should [noise] so we can put things in complete order\nWell I think you're right a I've got a text question here from Iran would bridge he says please you know in all of this no one ever mentioned what potential role President Obama had\nA he can you shed light on Obama's potential involved in any of this\nOh yes definitely I've got several\nArticle addressed that if you go to Sydney ... dot com and and check into my articles on the Daily Caller\nAnd even as far back in New York Observer the whole thing happened to protect Obama I mean the whole Clinton cover up was to protect Obama as much as it was Hillary because he was emailing her I'll not server under an alias\nAnd you generally well she was running on not insecure serve her supposedly off the grid that was subject to being\nBreached and no doubt had been breached [noise] and then also\nThere's an article I wrote about a company working his plan and we have to put together the memo from Susan Rice to sell on the day of the inauguration\nWhere she says refers back to a meeting anywhere he's six and the oval office at which a company Clapper Brennan Susan Rice bonding and Obama and I think Sally Yates were there\nAnd that's one night a final on the plan for common we take a brief tromp\nOn Russia collusion a narrative just relationships apart from the Bronx yeah you know they were kinda briefing on was not the golden showers crap\nAnd that gave them the hook they needed for CNN to run with the story that they knew CNN was waiting to run with and of course come to report it back to Clapper and Brennan as soon as he had a meeting with Tron they didn't brief him on the other parts of it like they should have\nJust the stuff they knew it was absolutely fall while they knew all of that was false that when you get those guys that they were saying something like that about him and that was enough to give him the news to launch the whole story\nAnd of course there the page stroke text messaging talking about Obama wanting to know everything they were doing\nI mean I think he was into it up to his eyeball both from the Clinton and\nThe illegal Clinton conduct or on the cover up with that and then the\nIt's\nUnbelievable this whole thing in your child's\nWas Susan Rice who was doing the math games by Lisa Monaco this kind of found her way in there to she was just counterterrorism advisor and she's been licensed ally is one of the prosecutors she was glad to commit misconduct to

and it's there for two and four but to me and my son went by but it's a very deceiving record because they've been in the last three\nThere are passing or five hundred yards the very exciting team to watch them very young team and uh you gotta you gotta stay with these players because this is going to be a lot of fun to thousand Eighteen Eighteen Nineteen there's going to be very exciting team to watch these put this altogether got older and players very young an entire new coaching staff\nAnd it's all coming together is very exciting and witness now coach Scott what can happen to me and my team that's good to have any coach\nSkip me on John\nOkay you got to be fired up about center right you had a week off yeah you're by week and I didn't get your kids prepared after this week off going to Alabama\nOh it's pretty easy and you turn on the Stanford film especially against Western Carolina ended up you know you watch them I\nHave seven hundred and sixty plus yards often score sixty six points and you know critics ... kept on and then the fence all either just loaded with the pre season so Comedy Central player in the year ... good and so you know I think on Monday moments from the film it launched their attention was gotten immediately and\nHad a good week or practice this weekend looking forward to travelling down in the end up taking this one all\nHow Sanford going to deal with this new new house and you have you know there there then you you you've got three games coached where ah you're moving to a football helmet that will I get really good defenses\nYou're exploiting or taking advantage of your speed your quickness or you didn't ski I'm really not like the beginning nobody really knew about him people still thinking about top right I get it south football fans are and all all that so we had to go through that\nBut uh you know he's making he's he's making good pass if the good pass you have a couple of bad decisions we then but\nUh they're becoming less frequent so I'm Sanford now looking to solve that I bet they're saying what the heck is going on with them [laughter] do you think you're monitoring me and my football\n[noise] well I think Karen Sanford really unique we prepare to to play are often because Chris hats are just like\nWith our office or the interplay quarterback for held mommy and they run their version of the air raid often you know the air raid is just the base and then you know every coordinator or it coach has their version of it so\nThey call it that has to tap into it seems like last week they got back\nTo work with a lot more for whites that a lot more careful early in the season they recording what heightens the following the game out down a little bit you know\nThey got a few calls losses they lost ... games in so called play on on the last one of the game basically at one scoreboard again and then it wants to Florida State who's pretty good and then um they said who's top\nFive in the country so Sanford's a very dangerous football team a loaded with talent so can't coaches and writers of Stanford could be the sole kinds of campaigns going into the Caesar and then they look very dangerous to me and I think there'll be well prepared to handle what we're going to do for them often [noise]\n[noise]\nNews this hour from town hall dot com [noise]\nI'm ... in Washington

I go back to the guys thirty five he shares I'd say John I got your poll and you're ... you're saying that the generic spread between Republicans and Democrats right now is four percent\nCNN poll scattered that Thirteen percent I mean that's a that's a three hundred percent difference right that's what I make any sense to me tell me what is the difference between your poll and they're just explained to me John like Goldman I'm certainly not layman's terms explaining\nHe said it's very simple I Do polling methodology based on likely voter turnout model\nBased on two thousand sixteen based on region right it's not ... waded in Los Angeles it's it's it's an authentic hole to get information their poll is done in such a way they call all borders anybody that answered the phone\nDoesn't matter waited and waited and if you do you're pulled that way it's always going to skew democratic big and he said so they're pulling basically and an agenda narrative in mind as you said we're down by four or five [noise]\nAnd then he walked me through the court steps so I I mean I Believe the house right now is a toss up and the Democratic operative that I talked to a week ago told me that the Republicans were going to win two hundred and three\nUh without at your age and he said we need to win sixteen states and pillows he will be speaker out of those thirty now that makes sense to me and I told him what are the odds on it and he said fifty fifty so how do you go for it just to see CNN saying\nThe Democrats are going to win sixty cents how do you how do you do that\nWell what they're doing is uh is lying to the people again this is another", "show_name": "Laura Ingraham Show", "year": "2018", "city": "Portsmouth", "day": "11"}
