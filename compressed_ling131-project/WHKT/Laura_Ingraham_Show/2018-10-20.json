you\nI'm doing well doing well busy busy these days but uh but but doing well\nGood man I mean I I work as a model endorsement but there's a reflection of what I saw when you were in the general assembly working again I think we're in the community or the other you're always justice energetic smiling go get them kind of guy you know like the um like a Mickey Rooney let's put on a show you're always just like ... are you able to maintain that\nYes you know I I I'm you know black represent great folks and the the first district you know I I get my energy from that they are\nVery very attached to that individual that at work hard every day in and do do great work so it's hard not to be motivated by that but it it's hard not to be motivated to ah by the by the crew on or that it is to represent\nIt and I appreciate that and uh have you been in that position like the office and going\nWell you know I mean I think at certain times it's it it does it does give you pause as to you know where we are as a country and that the basements that are out there but but I always working every day to try to find places where we agree I think I think today takes a little more effort to do that but\nRule in places where you where do you deal with one subject and that's it so you don't have this big mash up coming\nBack from the other from the Senate or vice versa that just blows up the whole deal\nNo I agree and and you know be a good is that in the in the U.S house we operate under the same\nRules you offering that general separately chocolate what's going on you and I both know that if\nYou figure out the rules about how things are happening\nBut the subtle has different rules so it's kind of get a bond together and we're looking at how to Alice is related in any way shape or form in the ... the the the most highlighted example is we're here for a vote ... past\nThe title of the bill was that the court will clear act they they they took it took a ... dollar language you out of it kept dumpster and the title of the survey or the houses perversion of the ... so it it's that kind of procedural stuff it's just shakes her head why how\nCould that happen on it but I Would argue that you know sticking with\nThe logic of systems like you see injustice manuals to wait for the beep debate are tracking\nMake sure you don't have a lot of you know Don related adopted a piece of legislation of people go how did that get there it's kind of like you know crawling everything on the last train leaving with like you know that stuff doesn't doesn't go out on the earth spot related or it's just ... you know as the way as\nWell as a vehicle to pass things that are unrelated so right\nI agree and that's that's one of the I think the problems up here is that it doesn't it doesn't require that necessarily pay their\nCulture parsley when you're using that mechanism when you have unrelated ah aspects of legislation or what we're supposed to bill or people will just you know look at it and go how how could that happen\nWhat I Hope you all will take a look at some of the rules and get more to wherever coverage in your way of governing up in DC because I had one of the things that's when you pull back from politics and and watch sports people get upset when they see rules violations because they know the rules\nYou mean last night there was a has just been Berliner through as a wider and it was a beautiful smarter and Enron darling use a pitcher for the Mets in the eighties and some other teams that that is a pitch is when you are warming up there and you put your Mitt down and say grab Patel\nI'm done that's a perfect pitch and it was and it was called the ball and the next pitch the Boston Red Sox guy\nHit it for a home run and as a as an fans you go that's\nOutrageous only the the the teleprompter had\nThat was wrong and what happens when people in in politics people they don't know the rules to get upset about that's just not cricket you're not doing it the right way I see you know we deserve better instead they pulled back your eyes to see see they they shrugged their shoulders and throw their hands\nYou know it's just it's just not working on on on my on my behalf you know I I don't get it right and said this and or anything you can do to to to change that would be the end of my rent let's get back to the absolute let's get back to the national district what what are your voters telling you\nWell you know we're here a lot of hearts they like I think ... that they're very interesting how do we ... a a continual\nUm increase in our economy I think people are a very positive about what you had a bomb on what's billed by Congress regulatory burden in changing the tax code of somebody came\nFrom New York for businesses to host but the things that they want to see going forward what I call the stinging parts of the economy and first of those who knows how much have to assure us that our children students get the loss of surgery\nOr educational experience to really want to\nFeel the jobs are there seven point one million jobs so Chris and Seventy five percent of those jobs will not require a four year degree and that means we have to emphasize\nCareer and technical education as much as we do college tractor education because that's where the jobs are those jobs today are skilled jobs that have a quick off as far as a career\nWhere you go from an apprentice your journey to a pastor and have a career there when people start really well in many instances better than you\nKnow job that requires a college degree so I think people look at that and say that's where we want the Harris are looking on going how it's going to make sure that my child is soft on like how do we make sure the education system gives them the knowledge skills abilities\nTo compete for jobs that are available today and all the future and I think they look at it and say hey the other things and you kind of them are going really well but Chris one I talked\nTo influence with the cost of just what I can tell you the top three things they talk to me about our workforce workforce in the workforce or you know they say what is your\nBusiness to a point I just find workers to the job and it's you know terrible our job openings liberal or failed in job openings so we're going to have the rest of them are bringing one other element to this article and\nBrought her to connect\nIs important are supportive of education so that quite\nA lot of families children to school in the tropical or is it going down how well they can't connect cause heart duty assigned a given or the soap opera or nickel take I'm going to the library Donaldson why businesses\nAnytime areas that don't have high speed can't\nDo the business they need to be successful and her one of them\nSpecialist doctors can't connect with patients were a lot of hard to go to an office tower miles and miles away and get care and quality without a soccer game change for break so we\nReally what brought the education system a lot of South Korean talking about education as much as like a lot of college truck education\nAnd these are these are these are the tough issues because people don't go broadband workforce development those those don't get to go out to the\nPolls there just like that that makes sense I like that you know because when people get down into the the grand hilarity as I've talked about with other callers today in politics in the garbage complex and people don't like complex and like fiber bumper stickers because they're pretty busy trying to make their lives working and putting that into the context\nOf their daily lives came out and vote whichever way is a tall order for a lot of politicians right\nSure [noise] the policy\nOf complicating ... town hall of her off for the body of the social whether a lecturer op also have the power of social and so and you know those booms longer just really don't want to hang out here so\nIt's just something that I come up with some people say hey critical\nOf gas company soundbites are ways to help our economy ... on a thrill out of it was okay with the help of Harvey you could always always take on something that's quite shocked about us\nBut I think ... or don't want to talk on and off shore asking for people to say I think that that's going to close down eighty seeing that's great but what people want to hear teen\nOr if I'm going to place all over again what are you going to do in the future how do you want things to eat on what are you going to do to accomplish that what do you what's going to come back to us or if you are we allowed to ask you about the most horrible loss sort of things are looking\nFor what I was able to accomplish and people weren't that we want you to understand what support them and they want you to project edition of for the future about how those folks you've got to be addressed so it's not just the laundry list of questions on it what are you going to connect with Arnold stolen people's concerns\nAbout the challenges facing a huge\nHelp people audiences all the time or it's all politics is about the future not too bad and you can be seen like look what happened to the area the economy is great you know unemployment is historically low\nAnd they just threw out the government's pretty much\nThere's ...

very good what you've ever tried to listen I think card Carmelo\nHas his shortcomings but I think are sort of move up in a recent the buyer overlooks a a pretty pretty impressive tenure in the league or despite some recent to sort of downgrade in his in his gang\nSimilar things um you know I and you know I got from Philadelphia connection so I've always got a soft spot in my heart for the surge

we're right there with you yeah I'm sure so Dr Robyn McDougal is with the Virginia Commonwealth University Wilder school\nThat was briefly about the water school what youre doing\nYes sir show where we're at school of government and public affairs it rains in the top in US News and World Report for schools the public affairs got good undergraduate and graduate programs focused on criminal justice homeland security and emergency preparedness\nPublic administration\nAs well as programs in the master's\nLevel and urban and regional planning and a few key program and public policy and then we also have our Center for public policy which I direct which is our consulting and community engagement arm\nOf the work we do in the wild or school say you will see a lot of things around economic development leadership in training local and state governments outreach and things like public policy polling I that we hear within the center for public policy in the wild her school\nWe're going we're coming up falling real quick but you guys actually go out and work with uh other local governments and businesses that you helped them it's not just I think people don't understand that about higher education and the value that you bring to the community and the states\nYes yes we really do I mean we're done everything from looking at helping localities looking at potentially providing incentives for a certain business to come into their community it's really a return on investment of what that economic impacts\nIt looked like on the proposal stage with regard to incentive then come back and provided that actual economic\nImpact it paid for with a business and the impact that it's had on the community with everything from revenue job creation and other aspects\nIn that way we done about evolution of um you know criminal justice program there the implementation of a mental health program or a drug treatment program on reducing recidivism for local jail or or or\nA community partner we worked with a nonprofit from everything from their rations of the programs in projects that they do to our federal coordinating and combining\nActual help that they need with regards to our students and our staff or which in their community program and then we've done some work with the public sector and private\nTurns of programs in projects for the private sector looking to pitch to the general assembly in need an actual third party non biased evaluation of that work in provide that report for that company for the general assembly to look at legislated into so we do we are continual partner\nEvery single day with our local and state governments around the commonwealth um and it it really is what we live and breathe in the school specifically and we do at a much more\nCar then our private sector\nBecause it really is our mission our vision and it allows us and Britain that there are\nAcademic experts he says well we're getting a wild her school you know we have over thirty academic faculty who their area of expertise and he wanted to talk about the economic impact I've got four economists in an urban and regional planning program or you want to talk about the impact of an opiate program\nA treatment program I've got to the criminal justice academically that their area of expertise and they get asked all around the country to look at present their research and were able to bring that expertise for our localities in the commonwealth in Virginia\nSo that when you're when you're a full service higher education schools where we are\nYou know we we provided all give us your students they will educate them [laughter] freshman in college\nAnd graduate school in PHD program give us your workers that we will train them an executive leadership and management preparations give us your legislators and you're a lobbyist and we've all trained in policy analysis on the impact of a variety of\nGirl on legislation and give us your community that will help come up with good solutions and then you need evaluation heavy impact obviously shows that we really are I'm not one stop\nAll encompassing education and consulting academic arm for local and state government and our our citizens in students around the common law\nAnd that's why I brought it up and then we'll go to the polling you're with your operations on there because I think it's so important for people to understand the totality of a lot of things are governments especially heritage which has a bull's eye on his back around the country but in Virginia we've got a great higher education system we really need to be proud of the uh\nEven though it's you know it's it's appropriate to hold them accountable that's tough questions but a lot of things you're talking about are free\nAnd they are exclusive of usual operations and they are a complementary\nTo what you are doing that actually facilitate what you were doing in higher education I think it's wonderful I think it's misunderstood and not understood at all but most jumping to some polling a that's a while the school has done what are you seeing out there what have you seen what direction are we going\n[noise] why don't we talk a little bit Clinton on earlier so let's talk a little bit about policy and in polling in public policy that we get on this summer we were out in July we'll have another\nCall right here after the election in November but in our in our public policy arena you talked about higher as there was talk about that for a second when we look at it we made over eight hundred for getting in around the entire\nWell and when we look at and ask people what they think about the value of higher education in Virginia over eighty percent of our respondents believed that the community colleges that we had\nIt for our work their cost over sixty five percent believe that our public four year institutions or work the car and then right under fifty percent believe that our private\nSchools and the kind of like a ... o'clock so it's really important that you said that question around\nDown in Virginia we value higher education and not only that we value it but we're putting out a product
