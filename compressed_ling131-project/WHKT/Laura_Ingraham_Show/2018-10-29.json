issues have taken a backseat on ... campaign now it's all personal it's taking Halloween pictures from my Facebook now\nShe's doubled down you know now it's not big for that you know that they're trying to portray me as crazy based on I guess Halloween costumes and you know me John I have a good time so if they it's just it's amazing that last week she pretty much apologizes for marginalizing veterans says she's going to stick to issues then she puts out a commercial\nOr calling me an extremist and trying to make fabricated things up again this is what the left does their own hands it's desperate ploy by desperate candidates and that's why common sense is back that's right conservatism is back and that's why I'm going to win the fifth\nCommon sense back in your commander of commonsense Dennis Rodman without running for Congress fifth district\nVirginia let's get to the caravan I'm the president with my later today saying it's going to deploy\nA thousand troops you go to a series of executive orders that would stop the caravan from coming into the United states the problem\nIs as soon as they fought and say the word asylum we can't do anything or laws and the loop holes in them Denver are written in such a way that all they have to do is get a toe in get their\nHand grabbed and say asylum and then we can't do anything they cannot go back what are you seeing the president's proposed action here if you're in\nCongress now what would Denver Riggleman the proposing on the terror that\nWell you know our rule of law and ah we're we're we're a nation of laws and we believe in the rule of law and the way the law as written written right now you're exactly right John I don't know\nYou know how we we don't honor that based on what we believe us conservatives enroll in and people who follow the rule of law however\nI think Congress needs to start fixing these immigration laws as soon as possible\nAnd I also believe once that happens are vetting process for any of these people that are coming through has to be extreme vetting\nUh we do have some of the technology in place now but we don't put time limits on there is if there's that many people that are headed towards the border or we don't know what's in Bennett in those him John my biggest fear\nUm it's easy you know it's like a Trojan Horse right listen Ninety five percent Ninety nine percent of those people could actually be seeking asylum um those that you know our hearts sort of go out to ... with compassion however\nIf you have people inside there that are bad actors\nI guess is this going to be sending some pretty healthy intelligence assets down range I think we're going to be monitoring and my guess is I can only speculate right now my guess is why joint operations\nWith Mexico on monitoring this caravan of seeing any type of emissions that are coming out of there talking about radio emissions or any kind of into that we can blame this is not a good situation this is not good and at some point I think we have to fix our immigration laws in a way that again are are\nMuch more common sense than the sort of sort of ridiculous and as we have now are going on on the border\nUm the\nI think the concern that everyone has Denver is that okay there's twelve or Thirteen or fourteen thousand people we have to deal with it and uh everybody wants to be concerned everybody's concerned about the humanitarian aspect but a lot of my color here's what their concern was okay if they get\nIn this Fifteen thousand to get then the next one is going to be a hundred and fifty thousand and you're not going to be able to stop that either of because we'll never get a wall up in time and even if you have a wall you got a hundred and fifty thousand people a lot of people so um are you in favor of the president taking action\nNow to stop these er visits a mob caravan from palm rushing\nThe border and coming in are you in favor of stopping them from coming in now\nYes yes I mean it's this is a this is a matter\nOf national security or it is a matter of precedent um and again this comes back to it was a normal American will say hey\nYou know we understand people want to come to the United states but there is a legal process [noise] um and we're going to have to we're gonna have to follow that legal process you know we we think that legal process needs to be applied all immigrants and you and you're exactly right John\nThis would set a precedent that could really be damaging to the United states' security to our policies into our rule of law\nUh you're right it's the ... we just about everybody in we're actually sort of acknowledging that open borders is what we want if we don't follow the rule of law and we don't stop these these migrants sadly we we have to stop them from coming in and set a precedent Denver\nAt uh but uh in about five or ten minutes the U.S government is going to release the new economic numbers or\nGDP expected to grow again this quarter at so over four percent could be four point one four point to four points rent a bomb is taught him it was driving along in about a half percent growth I mean\nThis growth unprecedented where do you look for in that report in ... which can close and you think you might draw out of it on the economy general recommend\nWell the thing up first I'm going to look for [laughter] and it's just because I'm\nA geek out on the stuff is I'm going to look at the specific whatever report that I have I'm going to look at the number of jobs are based on that are open right now and I look at Virginia but I also see what we're going as far as the unemployment but GDP Growth I'm going to look at manufacturing I'm look at agriculture\nI Love looking into the numbers and see where that grow there is and if we're continuing on this line John ever continuing with the lowest\nDoing which he'd eat he grows four percent of every quarter which you know is amazing ah it's a new normal was too I mean this is pretty incredible\nUp you're looking at all these numbers I think right now what you're saying is that the tax cuts were about the job for format worse opportunities ... can be lovers here in the in the commonwealth a ... and opportunities\nOn investment all the things that we look at to encourage opt entrepreneurship to encourage people keeping their own money is working and that's what I'm going to look at it this report is is this just a continuation\nOf this amazing amazing surge\nOr are we seeing an even more positive future for the people in the district but also in the United states and then the commonwealth of Virginia I think we are I think you're just seeing the beginning of this economic boom and um I I'm\nReally just really excited to see what those numbers say based on where job growth on what sectors are growing right now\nWhat kind of interesting to see these are coming out momentarily we expect that that we're going to get over four percent growth and it's really really tough for a Democrat\nRight now to talk about economics the economy or any of the issues that pertain to jobs and prosperity in America so they'd rather talk about something else that's why your opponent\nLively Coburn to talk about your Halloween\nTalk to him because he doesn't want to talk about the economy she doesn't want to talk about job she doesn't want to talk about growth didn't want to talk about kids moving on to the basement doesn't want to talk about the boom and small businesses you're going to talk about the deregulation doesn't want to talk about the number of investments that are going on because of the tax\nCuts especially as it relates to one hundred percent deduction of capital investments you didn't even understand it and so she doesn't want to do it any any of that she'd rather talk about your Halloween costume in two thousand five\nYeah and I mean which I Will not take down off the net by the way so here's what she would rather talk about she'd rather talk about forty million dollars in spending not only for Medicare for all but also for forgetting student debt right which is one point for a trillion dollars right now free community college for all are free college for all\nEverything she's got an even a debate she's like I don't want to give away this she doesn't understand the taxpayer money is what you're using I get so limited based on what I fought for\nYou know in government overreach she says she loves government I feared government I think government should be limited I think government should be a fish and she's also said that taxpayer money for the middle class is nothing more than confetti\nShe's compared eyes to the Nazis I mean I I find that the stunning John get anybody would vote for Leslie\nHer views are great for San Francisco and maybe a three square mile area there or somewhere up in Georgetown right in DC\nBut for the fifth district it's absolutely appalling that she thinks these values are actually a political to the people the fare if not every day and work for a living and don't give a rat's with the chattering class is saying on CNN or MSNBC or any of these other far left\nAnd then they are now they're just they're just propaganda machines and I think at some point ah that's going to break through that you have comments you have this coalition of common sense\nAgainst progressive ... and I think that's what's happening in the ... district and we're going to win this John because I represent American values\n[noise]\nI Wonder if you've ever being on our website\nAnd

for instance you did you see that does migrant caravan was in the terms we found out it was being funded by these sort of left wing organizations right now I was coming to there including the swan gum governments and other organizations and they were designed and\nShe can humiliate Trump right that was the idea\nThat would have to shift the mid term elections now it's going to have the unintended\nEffect show and the Democrats have been silent on that issue so I've been I've been saying oh we're pro migrants have sent there has been this terrain that even from foreign forces not they thought they were going to um um [noise] you know have\nAll these migrants crashed the border and then you wouldn't have this other scandals\nThat he'd be separated from their mothers from the

settle the issue\nThat want to do what is the key issues that will just be this humiliating for Trump has been a backlash and it's going to be\nGood for him so I think that that's going to be that's one of the things that one of the changes that we have seen the new wave won't be any won't be as blue\n[laughter] don't sell or so and that's what we're saying is you you have evidence that are the

J. than usual enrichment\nAnd I'm just thrilled to be here folks this has been a heck of a journey I Want to thank the or the board of directors Virginia fried our members to for supporting this this effort to really engage\nThe political talk in Virginia and for those of you listening on the Internet around the country and probably around the world after John show given his\nGiven his rage were a real excited about having a a different perspective on politics if you can imagine nonpartisan radio is a is stretching these days I think we would say like\nA cause I I don't I mean as a former member of the general assembly served eight years I don't I cannot watch cable news\nUm either side it's just it's so predictable it's so scripted and we're going to try to do something different here at Virginia for your radio Virginia free for those of you who are dumped no was founded about Thirty years ago Nineteen eighty eight pro business organization\nThat was set up to inform the business community about how they can best be educated on politics and engaged the political world um\nAnd it's going pretty well but we recognize that media media outlets forms of communication change in this and we need to update that we need to enter the fray but we really are free oriented people in the business community is\nA somewhat risk averse when it comes to political activity political dialogue gauge me and it's been our um history\nTo be nonpartisan we really as an organization that's been my pleasure run this for I think five years now\nTo be nonpartisan you have any of our publications or emails we're very cognizant of not putting an art or the next day anyone's name we don't we don't it's just not who we are we we want to\nLook at the uh the candidates the elected officials and um\nGet down to the essence of the issue of the topics of the day the candidates themselves without having a bias or judgment based upon their political where everybody has a way in which they like everyone has a world view and that's important\nBut in the context of what we do in Virginia free we have a robust dialogue amongst ourselves you can go to our website VA free dot org take a look at our board of directors you'll see people on there from obviously both sides of the political spectrum but when we meet we have accomplished\nTake it up in a policy recommendations or\nA decision to make it through broad consensus and we think he represents the broad consensus of the um rub some trouble with some folks calling in including or um [noise] lieutenant governor just in Fairfax hopefully over\nFor pick up here in a second I'm\nKevin ... is one living well after I got to give him that he's hysterical but we'll try do is is cut to the chase I'm not staying away from Senator senator man to chase was telling the radio show\nBut we're really trying to do is isn't farm so that you the audience to citizens the business leaders of political leaders um anyone out there and make an informed decision as and when I used to teach high school history him\nIn government back in the early nineties and I only had one requirement for my students\nUm you know if you really look at the numbers are and the economic growth in the country's stock market growth jobs grow you know if we're looking objectively most of all of that\nTook place you know under the Obama administration certainly the Obama administration laid the foundation for just gross when President Obama came into office or the economy was in a freefall I I don't think anybody would dispute that up you go back to two thousand and eight\nOf stock market you know was was crashing that already down about six or seven thousand who was the doubt a indexes now standing somewhere close to twenty three twenty four thousand\nUm you look at a job growth of the time of the Obama administration um you know the implementation of uh of what they call a bomber care before double cataract and the number of people have been covered\nA in that span of town and so you know down here it is a growing and robust economy us I think yeah for people who say well look at all economic growth that were spirits and you know you got to really just look at the numbers take a step back\nYou know from the partisanship and say you know the nation was laid we did the numbers bear that out on and so yeah there are also frankly what we've seen out of out of Washington and the White House\nYou know some warning signals are on the horizon around our economic growth or they were running now record deficit a you know people who used to you know claim in politics they care deeply about the best that they were deficit hawks and would you have anything that you stop President Obama or or anyone else to running up the deficit now don't say a word about\nAs it grows to exponential levels are and I think that's just something that's going to scoop the market's a you know we saw gains are in the market set aside article the other day there were a race to all the games basically for the year uh with some of the drops a we had it I think people are looking at this from a macro economic perspective and saying\nIt is you know unsustainable on to be getting these you know it really budget busted tax cuts particularly\nWe need to your shred the social safety that to pay for it uh you know we've been through this kind of thing before and it doesn't end well economically so what we need is a balance of economic approach you know and we need leadership or to get there so we're providing that leadership at the state level in Virginia but you know we need to see that the federal level as well\nLet's let's I'm going to try to break that down a little bit here and let's see if we can you you mentioned when we get from a progressive than pro gross\nA and you mentioned how we're able to afford these programs what comes first economic growth which is that there's a chicken and egg here because if you don't have the money\nIn Virginia we have a balanced budget and like the ... unlike the federal government where you can just you know can you to spend on now GM has they are um and that has been a bug personal ... mind you know we've had we've been able to grow the economy because both parties in Virginia regardless where the majority\nWho's in who's in the or the governor's mansion the the culture of Virginia government is to work together in a bipartisan way and we've we've warned against the encroachment of partisanship down to Ninety five court or\nTo to Richmond um and we have this you know growing economy but a lot is done with federal spending isn't it so if we go with this is what we we talk about sequester I shall we say well if we if we had the sequester nation is going to hurt Virginia's economy\nI'm sitting there is that there's always that chicken and egg and what what what I fail to see his inability for either party go you know what he did he or she did that one right why take all the credit when we can share credit and continue to move things forward and that's what I think political leadership really is\nIt's not saying hey it was great while you know the red Sox won ... I was president therefore I'm going to win all the notion was right on I'm from Pittsburgh to you know when you know President Obama went to the Pittsburgh smart and we have in the Steelers you know terrible telling that's really smart but he's not from Pittsburgh let's be honest right now so I gave them credit for this thing were victories writing truck\nRight now of course I I I I'm with you and in this respect right I was absolutely have to work together we should work together to get we're doing that in Virginia you know the reputation of facts that I mentioned earlier the economy or just those ... right I mean these are not opinions about where the market was when President Obama came in and where it was where they left\nWho was in college who was who was your control can see this is where my perception that come in who control Congress at the time\nWell actually there were shifts right oh\nNo no no not much controlled Congress that's my point of course that's my point\nHere okay but here's my what I can get a perfect example the state level um you mentioned provoking progressive and people working together\nAnd you know federal spending and the impact on Virginia psychotic Medicaid expansion\nOkay perfect example um you\nYou mentioned how can we afford to have these programs are in this case uh the case was made effectively how can we afford not to have it we give it away ten twenty four billion dollars of federal money\nTax dollars that Virginians had already have a and it was going to other states that expanded Medicaid will give it away six twenty six million dollars every single day uh and among those who would expand it we were the thirty first\nWhat you'd call red states are ... states right so a governor Mike Pence before he became vice president\nOr the state of Medicaid in his state Mitch McConnell the chief of holding a of the Affordable CARE Act who wanted to repeal it still does ah they expanded Medicaid states talk ... ... and hundreds of thousands of\nKentucky and they have health insurance is a result of this so so that's an issue again where cross your partisan ideological lines of people making pragmatic budgetary decisions and um we saw almost immediately the impact on Virginia's budget or AAA bond rating for\nA federal the outlook was actually upgrading right when we passed our budget which makes our borrowing costs lower which helps to grow Virginia's economy\nAnd we can make a robust investments are the ultimate live with a bunch of got passed it ended up being a a bipartisan budget Richard for\nA Republican senators come over and vote for that budget after having voted against 'em your other portions of it and in the house or we had a bipartisan vote that included Medicaid expansion so that is a perfect example\nOf looking at something called the policy right is what makes sense for Virginia how do we are we progress of your hobbies expanding health care coverage reporter thousand people and also pro growth\nA aspirations of that will create thirty thousand jobs I springing hundreds of millions of dollars annually into Virginia's a general fund and so this Christmas how we've got approach you know all the policy issues a head of us in Virginia is is showing that you can do this or the smart in a rational way\nAll got together the civil going up\nThere and I and I appreciate that Justin and having served when bipartisanship was sort of a goal\nIn the legislature back in the two thousand yard and we we we we that was that was like we are trying to outdo each other and be more bipartisan and you bring them to bring up the Medicaid expansion\nAnd that's a hard one for Republicans to vote for it and go home and and winning their primaries in their districts that's just that's just the way it's set up right now [noise] similarly to people talk to members of your party\nA supporting you know a pipe the pipeline projects which are very controversial in Virginia and still are um we have this mountain valley pipeline runs down through run everything down to North Carolina and one going across the Central Valley through central beyond your\nUm it's difficult for Democrats to support that he had to go back to their districts when they know controlling well it's a good policy it's good for the economy it's good for the environment where do you stand on those pipelines\nYeah of course well you know as I said consistently overtime and as I said you know during the campaign I didn't believe the case that they made up for those projects and what we've seen um you know overtime obviously with some of the court cases that have happened in the best record in the ... circuit court level on yeah there'd been a lot of fifty stars for these\nProjects have been a your issues with construction and implementation I mean these are things that\nYou know I Would have liked to see your thought through and and planned better for that reason\nUm and so you know so there are people who have divergent views on this I talked with and met with an hurt from\nPeople who are all sides of the people who oppose both those projects and and those who support them and I think again we've got\nVery rigorous um in assessing um feasibility you know ...\nWhether these projects are serving the intended purpose [noise] um yeah the cost benefit analysis on any harm is being done and so you know this was something that again I continue to uh to look at very intently and looking very closely but you know again we've got approach these things um\nYou know with a with a policy lands um and with with a regular\nAt once you up through one to the citizens made though it is so harmful to our body politic to re litigate these are decisions whether it's Medicaid expansion of the pipelines or whatever it is sequester ration take your pick\nBecause it it goes back to that first point you made about the and I'm not saying it's all because the Trump but when we have these inability to say okay we've made our decision it's time to go forward and in and get better to your point thirty seconds to finish this up [noise]\nYeah well you know again of course I Want to thank you again for your you know for your leadership and for always highlighting the importance of bipartisan shares of a U.S you know being civil to one another to get back to tell them that I tried to set\nUp presiding over the set of Virginia and our stretching it will continue to do a it's a totally that's what I said as I've traveled around Virginia a supporting our congressional candidate and local candidates and other travel around the country you know to say look we need to be in a place in America where we are treating each other well over here you get

and a lot of people telling me for months that was going to make this a rice I'm from New Jersey so I don't believe any of its all lives as far as I'm concerned but now you got you got this thing at the uh\nThe report saying it's a toss up is this real\nYou know I I think what the court reporter to doing is they have a really broad definition of cost up also consider the Ted Cruz state of war or race a toss up for 'em\nAnd clearly a Ted Cruz's heavily favored to win and I think look I live in New York City um every time the only thing we watch on our local TV is the local news and every single commercial break tense at least one can campaign commercials for that Senate\nRace or the Democrats are just poured six million dollars more into the race in the last couple of weeks they are concerned but then they had a terrible favorability ratings are good luck is still New Jersey I think it would be a maybe not completely shocking\nOutcome but it would certainly be a very big surprise is Menendez loses that race\nI don't think it's got to lose I think that that's just like those of us from New Jersey area like forget it and the thing is it's a painful and like I mean I\nThink that's part of the reality of this is if this was a strong Republican years something must be different on it I suspect companies will be closer than most other contests in New Jersey but at the end of the day I take the Mendez goes back\nOkay so you mentioned something interesting ah Scott you said that seven or\n... in in your most recent polling that the generic ballot difference between Republicans and Democrats had narrowed to seven and you said in his hands in this environment the Democrats control the house uh obviously the masses even go as hard as they have a\nBetter chance of what is what I mean I could use some of that what is the number where you would say wow I think Republicans can actually hanging on\nBy one or two or maybe three is five is what is it\nIt's a five to be comfortable\nWith the Republicans ... you know and again this is what do you talk about a national polls doesn't translate directly raced race but I I think most\nPeople I certainly would say if the Republicans holds a fourth one self favorite to take the house it's that's five points for six points then you're trying to cause some territory and then as you move up to seven points to hire a the the ... are are clearly favored and\nWhat I should point out you know we're talking about it being close right now with all of these races like Republican turnout is higher they have a chance to hang on to the house\nBut the other side of it is if the Democratic turnout is higher than projects in the Republican stay at home the Democrats forget twenty three states they have a chance to get something like forty seats or forty five seats on a very good turnout nights so this turnout and the idea of how close these races are is something serious\nHead on here is twelve or God right we all know that so that that's just what what what is it to them as twelve or God so that leaves right eat all the things\nThat they need to learn more to win control right and there are just over thirty races that are too close to call right now and it was what they are highly competitive and if the Democrats when liberals furry one they take\nControl so clearly they have the air and I should also point out says if the Democrats don't win control do still\nPick up significant getting there will be thirty one competitive races twenty nine of them are held by Republicans\nRight so they they would have to as ... and if they run the run the table right that that's where they get that's where they get the forty forty five see waves pick up right and uh\nBut so if you choose a mask for those listening to us right now how tough it is for Republicans hold the house is uh\nThey can only lose eleven\nOf the thirty seats that are rights that are tied right now actually test they can only lose ten of the thirties after one of the thirties um three of them right here in Virginia\nOne is tied one of the Republican is slightly ahead of the second district Scottsdale or a day brat Abigail Spanberger tired and then\nWatch than it had a cop stocks in northern Virginia so in a blue wave Jay bury the dead was picked up all those Republicans have a good evening or\nThey can win two to three are all three let's get the final word is from Elaine Elaine ah it's all of this Scott it's all about Republicans turning out right that's that's really nice days it's all about them turning out and so what what's your message\nWe we we have a couple of races in Virginia specifically where the libertarian is taking votes away from the Republican that cuts wing it what was it your message to those voters and ways\nTo voters small business owners in their employees so sad to see 'em like Jaime that we're feeling as everything's delivered for tax cuts and author regard for the regulation on and the efforts pettiness racing has made a political healthcare\nAffordable personal business in part time at a level playing around with corporations earn and be able to express it risks are among the ferry knowing that the sun is out there and is that Democrats do you decide to Congress on those are things that they are absolutely and that's valid\nHe repeals don't take that and we'll see reversal of everything that we have seen feelings for the last few years All right\nOn a tangent land harder for being with us chief communications officer job creators networks to what a big choice election

them you don't build the wall now too old to\nTwo to four thirty one or two thirty one Twenty one to two two to four three once your word for more information America First policy start or this message a four and offer us by America First policies incorporated joining us now um to talk about\nTopics we're going to start with the horrific anti Semitic hate crime at the synagogue and Pittsburgh just one of the most disgusting things I've ever I don't know what this country is comedy too but these crazy people just go into what people are praying\nAnd they just massacred on a Saturday morning unbelievable joining us now for that and many other things was from New York you can follow this atlas freak she's also a contributor to the hill Lynn great to have you\nSent morning thanks for having me on\nWas eight days to the midterms um a lot at stake here all of us were just shocked and dismayed that sickened by another massacre and then the other place of worship Liz ... what is going on in the United states\nAh I don't know I think that there really has been a hardening of attitudes um I think there's anger everywhere and I think you know look I don't think it's new with Donald Trump I think Donald Trump was elected in part because of the anger that uh\nHas boils off against what people's referred to as a ruling elites or however\nYou want to describe it um and I do think that's true to some degree I think that there is a real feeling amongst a lot of people in this country that they have been ignored brushed aside a as people who are running big businesses and big institutions have\nBenefited from globalization a and I'm really not stop to think about what that meant for some other people in the country but you know it it is alarming because we are about\nAs you point out a way to have another election and I'm afraid that you know there's a good chance that the Democrats are going to retake the house of representatives and the progress that has been made under President Trump and writing some of the wrong as it has prevails ah you know\nIt's going to roll back I mean I I really think that that's an incredibly dangerous situation\nBy by taking back the house that the firestorm of political activism and hate speech and everything my calmed down forget it because we're going to have Nancy Pelosi as speaker of one of the most dishonest politicians out there and one of the most ruthless competitors are ... you know we have people like Maxine\nWaters going to be taking over the house financial services committee and Adam Schiff taking over the intelligence committee I'm not making these things are those are the ranking\nMembers and from all a\nAppearances those are the people who are going to be running these committees and what we're in for jobs\nIs two years at least a endless investigation subpoenas into every aspect or Donald Trump's life and finances and business organization it's going to be an incredible mess\nBut I think honestly I think people are just going to get angrier and angrier as this goes on\nIt's a serious situation it is such a thing of ships and the Democrats are\nOn the heels of the ... of this horrific crime\nI mean I I just beside myself with whatever fits his first year we were so happy because they get out the next day they go on TV they blame the president for this I mean where does the matter with these people\nI I saw more blame throwing after all the bombs that were sent to Democrats favorites um\nLight light Maxine Waters I I I thought after this particular event there was less of that really because this guy was hated Trump as much as he hated Jews apparently um you know you and I have talked about this before\nI think after the Parkland school shooting we both agreed that having\nPeople like this fellow\nWho's ranting and raving on social media have access to an Eighteen forty seven is it's really unconscionable and I don't know how\nTo change that but it does seem to me that it should be changed because without that kind of weaponry he could not in like the damage that he did but I Do think this country has been trending more violence for Twenty years I think it starts in the entertainment\nIndustry which has taken no responsibility whatsoever for the fact that they're constantly spinning out\nEver more heat than old and violent movies the video games you know John it's there's just too much money on the table because you can produce a new popular video game that in horrifying and detailed murder or rape or\nAll kinds of scenes that you know really are not\nHealthy and they make a billion dollars within a day literally that's possible and in some of these games that are coming out ah there's no will to roll that back\nAh and I I Do think I mean studies have shown that kids particularly young men are desensitized by all this material that they're exposed to and that they engage in I mean they sit behind a little computer\nHorrifying it in terms of its graphic detail and the violence that encourages so\nI I don't think it's all about Donald Trump I Do think the country needs to take stock I Would like to seize I actually would like to see the president and the leaders of both parties kind\nOf come together and say okay we get it this is not helping that country all this blame blame game stops and hurling epithets an insult to each other let us try\nTo elevate our test scores I don't know if it's possible because you have people like Michael ... who has decided that his greatest shot at the same as being tested vulgar and\nA aggressive and have cells as you can see that as his that's his monitor us ah and it's working I mean he went from being an absolute non entity a year and a half ago to now having millions of followers on social media\nThat's really despicable and he is despicable but unfortunately\nIt works for him\nIt works for him on the short term yes where are you in the short term it is the guy is a a\nA just a completely open some character you gotta blame you gotta blame CNN for you Jim and this this guy hours and hours and hours of of media coverage talking about a\nPresident's or a private parts or whatever it is it they talk about I've seen that it's so ridiculous they've given the hours and hours\nThe coverage is as as if he's a legit he's not and if you study the guy he's bankrupted every president Caesar had he's got every partner is I think he's ever\nHad is suing him I mean the guy's an absolute ambulance chaser green and uh he's on the street and then put this guy the national stage unbelievable what is going on but I agree with you with these video games I mean I we try to monitor I've got one show\nI watched it all and he's fourteen year old the other is a God we try to monitor that um and we're very fortunate to listen to this day in time because our youngest son is an athlete and so you know the overwhelming majority of his time spent worth working out baseball basketball and\nWould you like a week it's like this weekend we were in Washington and a text weekend he's at ... Richmond and it goes out every single weekend I'm so thank goodness for that but uh I the I just want to start with what you said that I'm going to get a break in politics\nIt's what why this guy has access join ha forty sevens beyond me I don't know what I'm going to get all my Second Amendment listeners all upset and I'm going to get Fifteen ... I don't care if you really think this guy should have have had access to an automatic\nWeapon I think I was a coup God social media I mean like I just the whole thing I get we have to have automatic weapons if the government tries to put us in internment camps are again okay off of all that but\nI mean take a breath right I mean one of the ...\nThat there has to be some reshaping of the dialogue\nOn this because everyone has taken a very hard to fish and people I I agree an awful lot of people who I I joined as conservative in almost every realm are hard and fast on the", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Laura Ingraham Show", "city": "Portsmouth", "day": "29"}
