I've only got a minute and a half year what's the deal with this caravan what should we do\nWell what we should do of course I remember one saw what one side wants to do with it and when the president and it talked\nAbout it I'm not going to go into I don't really care about the situation in Guatemala El Salvador in Mexico I don't care I care about the situation in Detroit I care about the situation\nAnd I'm In the rust belt I care about the situation in these rural towns in West Virginia and Pennsylvania and those people coming in and tell you or maybe they're not maybe they don't have to maybe they're not terrorists let's say believe maybe they're not cartel members although come on come on I'm definitely are\nTell you what they are not I will tell you what they're actually not John but not doctors are not engineered they're knocked scientists that they're not lawyers not that we need any more lawyers by the way but you know\nThey're not they're not they're not your best and occupiers and they cannot be allowed the president has been telling these countries to stop it\nAnd I think an example I could be made here I Hope I Hope I Hope the horses inviting him on something like that so it takes a Jim Mattis who he's writing is a Democrat that whole mad dog moniker we see at\nAll on don't don't really him compliment were able to take care of the situation because it's a very important in a situation where that also let me plug it I Know you have before police something next to your friends Trump that war by Steve Bannon is\nFree of charge Seventy five minutes we'll pump you walk trumped up more dot com it's available please show it and ... and John I Want to let you know I think we're going to get up to fifty million years before the midterms over we only ... Steve\nDelicious and it's never change Donald Trump got elected and got elected\nWe're a sovereign nation we need to go for years and we need to know who is here and you can legally and also this president has been very forthright for over three years now talking about not people coming in illegally but then trying to hit and pouring into our country Ninety percent of heroin\nComing into this country connoisseur a southern border we had increases and cocaine coming in now ... market down learning it works fine cannot responsible for thirty thousand\nI share it's coming and increasingly if you're a southern part of the manufacturing China I think this trend is talking about that's why even coming into our communities through this how they work\nAnd it needs to stop this is a failure of the Democrats to not act and\nPresident might last last January in\nOn live TV said he ... he wanted to end chain migration and the visa lottery and get that wall belt and he went on the dreamers and you know what the Democrats never thought he'd make good on that ... again they walked away from the cable never heard it again [noise]\n\n\nI Know the John to the radio network is jobs the mobs in\nCaravans that's what we have right now and we help polls and here's my narrative Mike\n\nHere Tom listen we got twelve days to the midterms your vote Republicans you're voting for jobs you're voting for economic prosperity you voting for a continuation of the America First of all of these policies\nLed by Donald J Trump you vote for the Democrats you're voting for mobs and caravans that's it and you want to turn the clock back on the tax\nCuts and everything else [noise]\nNow what are you going to have to endure through the next several days or fake polls because now we have a new system in the United states ladies and gentlemen you do is take new just now we have big bowls we have big polls to drive fake news\nTo draw the conclusion let me say it again\nThe next twelve days be very wary of what's the legacy media is going to do here's what the legacy media is going to continue to do the New York times CNN the fake news or the polls driving fake news for fake narrative for inclusion\nIt's all fake and you've got to get the truth right here from your guts of the truth in America and that to me\nWhen CNN puts a poll out\nShowing mayor Gillum in Florida by twelve boys override the Panthers and he's a socialist that is absurdity beyond belief that sort of real poll\nNone of these polls are real not one of them are real they did this thing of two thousand sixteen they're going to do it again\nThese are polls to drive a result so you're going to get from the legacy media fake news with state polls\nTo drive a fake narrative to get a conclusion\nAnd here's what they want you to do they're going to continue to tell you and lie to you what the polls that they take with fake metrics than and false information these are pushed falls to try to get a result and here's what you're going to get you going to get a constant drumbeat for the next twelve days just like they did\nIn November two thousand sixteen\nSaying there's a blue wave coming in the Democrats are going to win a hundred seats the generic numbers of widened to Fifteen all the Republicans are depressed don't bother to work\nDon't hear that a flyer don't knock on doors don't make phone calls don't do anything\nBecause look the polling numbers show the Republicans are cooked and so why waste your time\nGo enjoy that we can see a football game and have a beer\nThat's what they want you to do they don't want you to work they don't want you to get involved they don't want you to be enthusiastic\nSo they're going to lie to you what state polls\nDriving fake news to get a fake narratives and at the end of the day they want to think inclusion drawn so they can get their own steak result polls by these legacy fake news yours are no longer to disseminate legitimate information and inform the public\nThey are done to drive a narrative to buttress whatever result they want\nAnd so that's why I've been telling you for weeks you just take one district and that's attempt in Virginia just one and I've been telling you for weeks Barbara Comstock you'd you the title head and she's going to win that race and finally a poll comes out\nShowing your tide finally some legit poll somewhere or the other fake news polls\nShowed her down by Fifteen\nAnd I knew from the fact that was not true same thing now they're showing spanberger ahead in the seventh fake they're showing coal burning headed recommend [laughter] much going to win that race by double digits they want it to press Republican turnout\nAnd depressed or volunteers and they do this by lying to you or we're beyond fake news now\nNow we have the networks of the legacy media that won't even report certain news items if they think it's going to interfere with their narrative talking points of the day which is to defeat Trump in the Republican\nAnd look I Know there's a lot of Republicans out there that drive you nuts and you don't want to vote for them and they voted this way or they voted that way they didn't do this or they didn't do that or there was some in fight or a primary fight or a few going on\nYou got twelve day here's my thing\nUnite now let's keep the house Republican let's build the Republican majority in the U.S Senate so President Trump can't continue his fur\nWe do that on November seventh then we can fight again let's wait now fight later oh I don't like this one because he but he didn't he beat cancer okay whatever they'll fight with Dave later oh I don't like Scott Taylor 'cause he beat Randy Forbes\nI fight with them later oh I don't like Barbara cushy voted this way or that way\nSo I'm going to vote no I'm going to vote for nobody or I'm going to vote libertarian are rather stay home it's ridiculous\nRight now what Trump the if you're a Trump supporter Trump needs a Republican majority period doesn't matter who it is and he's a Republican majority\nYou want to pick your petty fights and we all have them I get it do it later\nThere's a lot of people that I'm getting on my show that I have you did with and you know who they are not going to mention their names and they come on now every single week why because we've got to bring everybody together get everybody on the same page for twelve days when this election\nBecause we are we are we're working against hundred million dollars in swat money hundreds of millions of dollars from the Hollywood crazy ... last winners\nAnd the entire fake news legacy media network which has the wind\nNow behind the Democrats and so that's what you're fighting so fake news is out there and I'm going to say it again you're going to get to the polls which is fake news to drive the fake narratives\nTo get a fake inclusion and the end game is to get the result they want\nWhich is Democrats to take power so they can do what roll back the tax cut impeached Trump go further with investigations investigate Kavanaugh tied the country up\n\nSo that's my advice to you get involved do something to the tax cuts worked out ...

triggers radio network in it's great to have you with us today and on the line with us is James James is with the Australian Broadcasting Corporation radio national Hi James welcome\nThank you for taking the time to speak with may as well because [noise] I think he can help me understand piles of what's happening in America project that I'm working on a\nGreat [noise]\nCut down on a bike to the gym [noise] actually wanting to know what state [noise] but the last couple of years to a Donald Trump and find out what people are thinking out by says jak cheap eats\nHe's the main issue with things and they tend to elections than what it means for the white politicians go about speaking to an electorate off to a campaigning twenty six thing that changed sudden ship out American politics and tell us really interested to speak with you and find out for him in a\nSense of how your audience said things and\nI guess you're probably not the case and took a gym near as well [noise]\nOkay well there's two issues I'm James one Virginia and when it's national so\nThe Trump policies that Trump America First policies and his administration are not been in two cents to Republicans get elected statewide in Virginia\nAnd one of the reasons for that is is the number the growing number of federal employees that work in live in Virginia I mean who are living in Virginia and work in Washington DC for the federal government [noise]\nThe Trump Administration I've not seen by federal workers as a friendly to them as you know he's just ask for a five percent across the board a reduction in all agencies which means jobs\nHe also called for a pay freeze for federal workers because of the debt that we have\nSo Virginia is an engine anomaly and the tremendous numbers of people living in northern Virginia that are are not Trump so Porter is basically a dominate the state and so that's why it has gone democratic\nAnd so it's in the northern Virginia area it really makes it tough for\nTrump's Republican Party to win statewide now in other parts of the state of Virginia or they they they arguing five south West Virginia\nSouthern Virginia or the shore area are they all have\nRepublicans evil elected their weeks respect all of them to get real reelected James nationally it's very different nationally it is very different and what this\nPresident has done in these midterms which is very different from status quo when you know we use the great disruptor\nAs he's barn stormed the country and he's made\nOn his America First policies on the Trump autonomy on trade and on the success of these and basically he said if you want jobs you vote for me if you want a country you vote for me if you want mobs\nAnd caravans holds for them\nAnd so he is really made this a simple choice and he's got in the states where many races are tied and right now [noise]\nTwelve days out what looked like three months ago almost certain democratic or that the Democrats will take control the house it is now tied that's up for grabs a I put it that fifty fifty three months ago it was like eighty five Fifteen everybody thought\nSo I think Trump's America First policy agenda message is completely inclusive to any minority or any American\nBecause James here's the bottom line a job is not read and it's not blue it's great when you have a good job and you feel secure in your job you can bring money into put food on the table and support your family\nAnd by your son baseball shoes\nOr your daughter and new dress for dance or take them to a movie on a Saturday Night that's what your poor doesn't matter what the Republican\nOr Democrat or this or that\nThat's driving Trump's popularity its job it's economic prosperity its economic ... host and it's being positive about what the future holds\nAnything that has many say some of the things that took care of and for example that the U.S [noise] as what James\nWhether it's a part of it like look at the the twin selling the caravan for example as appealing to the public as\nUh when ten thousand illegal migrants are coming to invade your country or what are you ... how are you supposed to react you're supposed to be excited about that I mean first of all of our country of laws\nThe laws are getting for wanted we have an open borders situation\nAnd so when ten thousand or seven thousand or a thousand illegal aliens come in statistics show that Ninety nine percent of them because of our [noise] stupid laws that the Democrats had been in\nFavor of Ninety nine percent of them ended up staying in the United states now if you come in illegally and you stay in the ...\n... says that's number one the second thing that happens is your a low skilled worker therefore you drive down wages\nSo you're not getting Fifteen dollars an hour like you should in the United states like companies should pay\nWages start dropping because you'll flooded the market with extra cheap labor so wages go down paint goes down and then if you've got two people competing for a job and one will take seven dollars an hour seven twenty five in the other one\nWants to well who gets the job the ones that want seven twenty five and that's the illegal so it is this is not a positive and what the president in\nSome of the fact that I spoke to that and some of the workers as well [noise]\nLike very ... and some of these Virginia with that look we simply would not be able to operate without spending\nSo many of whom had initially illegally in life and I go to find a way to obtain that based upon but that the accounting initially and they were [noise] and they would certainly have strong at the standing on the Republican side amongst\nA number of devices and people that I spoke to the value the holding of\nHaving bought the workers who are paid to do jobs that I that that simply could not get Americans to\nDo it then do it legally James and go through our visa application process and do it legally and then once you legal guess what you got to pay taxes you're part of the U.S job system\nAnd then you have to go back when your visa expired well how do you ask you something\nJames if a a caravan of ships right now from Guatemala were selling into Sydney, Australia ten thousand to them and they just want jobs and who knows who's who's in the Caribbean and James some of them can be terrorists who knows rights could be\nHuman traffickers are better than there no one knows it could be anybody but somebody funded them and\nShips land in Sydney and they say look we just want asylum and uh\nBut it was strange farmers you know they're going to be happy because they can pay us five dollars an hour in well or do while they're farming and clean their hotel rooms or whatever and so uh what what what ... what was the reaction of the Australian government would they be like come on and\nOff for water we got plenty of money here or would they send them back James\nAre they the government would would most certainly did that the gentleman [noise] the by the immigration in Australia or Spain simulate fiercely writing one for many years and a lot of it it's like it's something very similar to what the us across borders\nIn the woods so that's a good thing I'm south a little bit more of a hurdle but certainly the issue was taking blood to a staple coming up on stem from South Asia south east Asia as pain or\nFor quite a while and I think for the guards anyway to support my that's nice what these people ... with with what happens in America because [noise]\nPretty well with the way the world of the Democratic world I hadn't had a way that law will to America is at the law on the hill and at the\nTime so many years that device which\nUh which I Know easy to America at secretary [noise] important to fight for democracy the world and [noise] the interest\nIn what has changed [noise] the influences which I think in American politics [noise]\nSo in Australia your parents laws that basically except\nUh illegal immigrants on the skill and merit basis for instance if ... has a need\nFor a pipe sitters and there's pipes sitters in Somalia that apply to come to Australia and the Australian government knows that if they let the men and they go through the proper legal Australian paperwork that they're going to get a job as a pipe fitter\nAnd contribute to the Australian economy they let them in that makes a lotta sense that's the kind of laws the U.S needs a merit based skills based system where if we determine economically that we have a need for a certain skill or for a certain job\nThen regardless of where those immigrants might be from they get to the top of the list because we're not saying we don't want him sprints or we don't want migrants or we don't want people coming into the United states what President Trump is saying is we want them to come in and be able to get a job to come in legally\nAnd be able to contribute\nTo the betterment of society not come in and go on welfare not have a skill Jennifer phone getting housing\nGet food get food stamps and overwhelm a local school system that doesn't make any sense right no country can up if you do that you basically don't have a country you don't have you have\nBasically a massive land and eventually you're going to die from\nThe United states as a Twenty one trillion dollar debt it ... the policy of just open borders and letting anybody in because we happen to be really good people no longer makes any sense otherwise James no borders you're not what country\nI mean I can certainly understand John what are you have that appeal to devise a second [noise] the the interesting side effect [noise] he's in trying to understand what that intensive capital [noise]\nThe ... to ... what people think when they when they see what some sentiment among stares at rock because [noise] even listening to the Democratic side of politics\nTwenty six thing that they were entirely by [noise] the appeal of Donald Trump and his appeal to the way [noise] it's really interesting to try and Stan Sybil which messages appeal and I'm kind of interested in [noise]\nIf you feel [laughter] just learned [noise] twin and what you buy local races [noise] national level [noise] what about you\nKnow they learned nobody sees\nYou just look at the policies that they've been acted if you look at the national democratic agenda right now do you have any idea what they stand for or what they're attempting to do other than the hate Trump do you have any idea do they have a single policy\nNo they're going to impeach Trump and roll back the biggest tax cut in history\nAnd they're going to open up the borders and they're going to increase sanctuary cities in a whole bunch of them want to get rid of the only law enforcement organization we have cold cold ice that's the acronym\nIn order to really move illegals so the Democratic policies are exactly what got them beating the two thousand sixteen and in fact what they did James they doubled down so not only they didn't learn anything is uh\nYou that's what that's what propelled him at the beginning people don't remember that\nThe money that drives things here in the United states in politics is crazy I mean it's just it's insane it the\nThe money drivers are in Saturday the number of money spent the only people raping benefit offered or the media companies that take the advertising\n[noise] made it to the subject is about [laughter] the wrong business right\n\nJames you there I Am sorry I'm not sure I just thought secretly they eat out I got that yes\n\nYeah so what can what does that mean for the maintenance guy [noise]\nLook I mean there's a there's a tremendous amount of advertising that is going on right now in social media which is which has been very helpful to a lotta lotta startups are doing\nTo various legacy media companies and\nYou know local TV stations and radio stations I mean\nYou know political advertising an average in the advertising on the radio stations that I'm\nAffiliated with her or or that I own or a big part of it and you know money is a huge driver but it's not the only thing a Trump Card outspent by Clinton almost two to one and beat her\nAnd the Republicans are going to get outspent in this cycle by the Democrats probably by the same tuna one and I think they're going to win\nSo money is important but it's not the only thing you still have to have policies at work\nAnd the reason why I'm very optimistic now that the Republicans are coming back here in the final week and a half\nIs because the economy is just so unbelievably strong\nAnd so uh they're Republicans are running on jobs in the closing weeks and the Democrats are running on mumps the Republicans are running on a country and sovereignty\nAnd the Democrats are running on the caravan and for the Democrats in the final two weeks here this is an unmitigated disaster and they're going to lose again\n[noise] one final question for you jump in America and twenty [noise] All right [noise]\n\nNot in a good place [noise]\nTell me all what the what the the [noise] the night to fish in some [noise]\nYou know I'm the best thing is happening is prosperity and jobs for all because jobs and prosperity a rising tide lifts all boats and brings people together\nBut um you know we we have had a lot we have a lot of incidents in the United states where African American males have been a unfairly targeted by police\nAnd uh that uh people don't want to own up to that in two thousand Eighteen in America but it's real and uh a lot of that has been reported in the news some isn't\nBut um you would have thought that by now the country was past that and uh we still have some issues with it and it's a it's just not a positive thing for us and how what what I'm hoping is that\nAs a this economy continues to grow and people feel better about the valves that will be able to come together a little better than we have in the past\n\n... thank you very much for taking time to to share your thoughts and tell me about your audience [noise] the tenure politics and the state of the nation and twenty I think\nUh the nationally the Republicans pick up five states in the United states\nIn Texas these were pickups that the Democrats thought they'd have they're going to get there they're going to go they're going to do for on that\nAnd then they pick up a they win seats in Missouri\n[noise] Florida Montana North Dakota and Indiana\nDoes or five or that the Republicans winning so they're gonna gain five seats\nIn the U.S Senate on November ... text [noise] in the house or the Republicans hanging on by three and\nThen we have to see what happens because it's going to be it's going to be close so I think three to five Republicans hold on a lot of the seats are going to have read talents and things like\nThat but I think they hold on three to five\nIn Virginia specifically a lift riggleman wins the seventh Dave ... when the second Scott Taylor wins and my big upset is in the tens\nBarbara Comstock against all odds speeds Jennifer Wexton and so I think every public and to have a good night there in the
