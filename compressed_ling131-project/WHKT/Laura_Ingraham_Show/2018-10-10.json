Trump's enemy and name names but all the results running\nAround the west wing in the deep state and that he is outing in order to move ahead President Trump's agenda and he's joining us now live from New Hampshire Corey Lewandowski great to have him in\nThe morning [noise] to say\nOkay what a great speech the president Maine yesterday I Know you saw it you know Corey starts out by apologizing to the American people for the debacle offer the clown show the Democrats put on which is that was a great opening is that with their lives\nAnd I was only four rows back in the media sounds right their front and center and\nI was shocked by it and I thought it was great and then he also apologized to judge Kavanaugh and his family for having gone through the nonsense and\nA lot of polls showing Cory now that the Democrats overplay their hand backfiring that Trump voters are fired\nWhat are you seeing on the ground\nOr actually right look this president came out yesterday and apologize to judge Kavanaugh family\nFor what doors and windows or mainstream it will never apologized the accusations the way they attacked a character and went to his reputation was unprecedented in your apology from anybody in the street you know these people doubled down\nIt's such a hot when it's a conservative\nIt's one thing when it's a liberal and other times now no matter what the\nWhat catch liberals and what we thought it was the truth where they're they're using the language that conservatives couldn't say well you know that was when the person was young we stand by them or whatever it is it's always\nA double so with the president outlined yesterday\nWhen he was announcing a judge Kavanaugh as Justice Kennedy was something very different sentiment older he has to do which is to bring attention back to where it should be which was the personal an appropriate tactic judge cabin on his family received\nFrom Rochester but also for the mainstream media and the president has the\nBiggest microphone world and what what was the right thing to do and I can tell you John I've said many times there are multiple copies of the Republican\nThe party everybody right now it's four weeks from today because they've seen now wants to do what they're capable of doing and what they will do if they come back the house of representatives which is talking about impeachment both of our president and moreover I was just his cabinet already\nThe president is not on redacted that we need that we need to see that we need to\nSee the three to choose which are the FBI's note after they talked to Bruce or at the department of justice to see what's in there and we have to understand what the insurance policy\nWas to keep Donald Trump from being elected that the FBI was talking about and what role if any Rod Rosenstein habit in that because as the deputy attorney general he had the right\nTo sign that fire the application and from what I understand\nAnd when is it becoming widely known now that's why it happened to him she was riddled with mistakes and and it was based on the false premise about Dr yang\nAnd that last renewable was actually a time when Donald J Trump was the sitting president of the United states and the American people deserve the right to see what was in that renewal application that Rod Rosenstein do you recommend\nTo the Robin Jones' November seventh\nAnd look at what I Would recommend to the president is declassified all of the documents let the American people decide and see what actually transpired the FBI its credibility because of what Jim Comey and the McCain and now James Baker and people just rock at least a page has done to that organization\nIs just devastating it will take decades to recover from what they have done that organization\nTrying to use their positions people was the priority people badgers going after American citizens spying on American citizens because he didn't like the political affiliation of their opponents everything that our country has been again since its inception\nAnd giants like Peter Straub where the head of the counterterrorism unit at more ability than anybody\nHe was one box in the Clinton email investigation he's the one who led the team it was called a crossbar in a hurricane that said\nHey there's nothing to seeing these extra six hundred thousand Clinton males there were all part of the winners laptop and he's the one who said hey let's go after Donald Trump he's one of the nation we've seen\nThat with the text messages between Lisa Page and Peter Struck and they worked at least minimum complicit\nWith what gym called me and Amy McCain and Jim Baker and\nPotentially Rosen steam want it done and the question is John and this is a very very big question how did go to the U.S government we know\nThat the director of the CIA and the director of national intelligence and others were aware of this spying going on on domestic soil against us citizens but exactly how high did it go I mean this is the biggest untold story of the last two years you get this could lead right up to the very top of the government\nNeeds to be which leads to Jeff Sessions\nWhat is your what what happened to I mean he's not doing anything launching special counsel to investigate it would\nWhy are people for political gain all the way up to everything else where Jeff Sessions\nWill look this whole investigation and it's been buying large turned over to the IT the inspector general of the department of justice to find out if there's been any wrongdoing and we've seen some of that report already because it's been released publically the report that recommended the number two person at the FBI not only be fired but charged criminally\nWe're waiting for that to occur uh we're waiting to see what happens to appear struck at least a page and and and Jim Baker the general counsel for the FBI we're waiting to find out what happened to the gym combing because\nIt is very possible that Jim Comey has brought up on charges of potentially perjuring in front of Congress leaking of classified information even though Jim said he didn't think it was classified that's not an excuse wouldn't do that he was notes his work product which was he was not allowed to do\nTo the law professor to make sure that could lead to the media there's been no accountability anybody at any level of the government for what they've done which was tried it and they tried to influence\nThe outcome of the U.S election because we're Clinton supporters by and large and they did not want to see Trump become President Trump and I don't understand where the accountability is and why it hasn't come out yet\nNovember to reconnect and\nBoy I Hope so John I really hope so and I and I hope for the president's shake 'em that he has a team focused on helping him achieve all of the results which he's been able to do by and large almost singlehandedly\nIf you look at what the president's been able to accomplish what three point seven percent unemployment the lowest unemployment rate for African Americans and Hispanics\nHe's down in terms of this ah when I wrote the help of established in lieu of her staff quite candidly and we've seen in the Woodward book or the staff tried on multiple occasions to stop him from doing things and stopping trying to stop him from being successful but he's persevered he's gone on and done things historic levels\nJust think for a second if you got to start that surrounded him that actually wanted him to be successful thinking how much more he could accomplish he's done so much already but\nThere are still people who don't want to see him be successful there are still people who serve in the government or whether they're bureaucrats elected officials or people who have taken positions that didn't support him in the campaign and they're still trying to stop ... agenda at every turn and\nExpress that he has had in the first two years of history and I can only wonder how much more he could have had had the right team around him supporting him every step of the way in all these government agencies [noise]\nFor the first thing you need to do November Corey brings quarterly went down to help straighten this out my goodness you're right you think if you look at all this topic in twenty months and he did that in spite of us\nTargeting things from a checking your cell phone could go to websites or not divulging information I mean it's almost criminal what they've done this is his own staff just the people that are there to serve the president's agenda and\nThey were nothing but an obstacle trying to stop he was doing and he still got all this accomplished it's an amazing feat you can only imagine in the next two years what did you do if he has a house and he has a Senate and he's got people in there actually are\nAdvocating for him the gender rather than doing everything to stop it or stolen unbelievable Courtland ... thank

I think they left it too late or how do you have too much corruption you now the problem is also you have the local police and the local governors\nAh had too much corruption now you have a similar political system in Brazil where you can call it tips as much as the local governors like in the house right the milk of governors have a lot of power\nOr it's not it's not all the little from the ... it's a lot of local governments are a lot of local enforcement and that didn't work in Mexico and let's see what it works in Brazil\n[noise] well I think there is a difference and you pointed\nOut and all the experts that study that said that uh the the Mexican military was way behind it arms they were out gone and the biggest problem they had and you just nailed it [noise] if they would go in pursuit in areas and the local authorities were being paid off by the cartels\nSo they were jumping off the cartels are about\nAll of the military operations where they were where they were going to hit\nOur their movements were and they had they had they had better better weapons and they and they had the intel uh being sent to them by basically despise that were part of the\nLocal law enforcement apparatus that we're all in the tank so let's put the military which is not that bad it's not like they were confident I mean the the way they're rated as is about in the middle\nOf the militaries and the world I mean they're pretty well new rain\nBut they should get it right yeah\nAnd then I got a significant amount of training and intelligence officer for the U.S I mean right you don't often hear about it but there's you know you're going to look collaboration between the U.S from Mexico\nBecause this is a common problem for both countries show you know there's ... there is you know and it's very complicated in Latin America you don't want to broadcast [noise] you're working with the Yankees you know too much because it looks a little bit like you\nCan't run your own affairs monitoring taking orders from the American running reality we know that they've they've been working with the with the Mexican military and they share intelligence because of that shouldn't have done a good job but as you say the sponsors of the people working for the car channels\nI mean those guys they didn't entirely drug cartel basically\nFound from former special forces right so these are former minutes\nThey think audio switches the assassins were different court trial and then they said hey we can do to turn around and establish their own cartel so these guys really know what they're doing you know\nReally unbelievable so uh it seems like most of the narrowest tapped into the what you say the the desire for changing the status quo for Brazilians and in a way it looks like you know looking people people forget one in four\nOut of every Brazilian voter is an evangelical and uh yeah I understand I think I I read maybe five or Ninety percent of federal lawmakers are evangelicals or this or this is a very Christian nation and I think they're harder this I\nI don't see how the workers' party candidates overcome a overcomes the deficit I mean that would be shocking to me when when you can get forty six percent of your closest rival is twenty nine percent of that\nOf that of the other people that voted for the other candidate there's at least five percent of their who just don't like to dodge and they're not voting for a show like if a\nFalse narratives his people out to get it going to win\nWell you you have a very interesting point there because there was another changing dynamic in American politics right to the tuition across the region I mean I don't want to make every every country with the same brush\nIf you want to generalize there are some things you can generalize on corruption and security right so those are the two issues so aside from that you get on the other recording issue which is why they even jealous of voter so a lot of these countries most of them I I ... I'm I'm hard pressed to think of one another in Cuba or\nAre mainly during conflict but now we're seeing something else which is a bit more evangelical it's a form of Catholicism a but it's very much about\nSpreading the word of God it's quite popular at its it's even John Paul I'm you know adults being baptized in rivers and all of that and that's a new dynamic that we're seeing in Latin America you'll always kind of harm box and it has been in the sort of smaller local villagers\nAnd you'll see it and you even see it in parts of the U.S if you go into various neighborhoods you hobbies and our local church and they call themselves getting scandals as opposed to got only call right so they they seem to Christian rather than like [noise]\nUm but it's kind of next door to Catholicism [noise] you're seeing that in any in Brazil was the biggest example because it's the biggest countries to it stands out the most and as I said we had a hundred and forty seven million voters on Sunday [noise]\nMoney off the government and get rich and produce nothing but just skim off the pig trough in the tax dollar that Washington has become and it's sick I'm going to cover a subject tomorrow\nI just decided to do that um and it's going to be in Fredericksburg tomorrow rally with Iran Senator Rand Paul and and representative Dave Brat\nWith special guest speaker generally get Nick free to it's a free event or doors open at four pm it's at the Shannon Airport ... easy after we're going to put this on our Facebook page and about a minute or five minutes\nAnd uh I decided I just decided on a whim are going to cover this live because I like Rand Paul I liked Dave and I think this has got to be a front of that and they invited me to cover in fabricate would invite me to cover winter for events I Do that too and you can get on my out but\nI think it's going to be fun to convert and\nUh we're ... it's like Rand Paul has been right on a lot of things now I'm a Trump supporter and I didn't the portraying obviously when he ran for president but I Do respect them and there's a lot of things where Rand\nPaul was right on he was right on the Afghan or getting out along with Walter Jones he was right on a whim after um he was right on the Patriot act and they're starting to pay jak remember it was\nOnly Rand Paul that stood against the Patriot act\nAnd you know people forget about about the Patriot act you know this whole Pfizer warrant nonsense with rod Ross stands spying on Americans Carter Page and the eavesdropping on the Trump campaign you know when all that is a direct function or did you ever think of this this was all a direct result of the Patriot act\nNo Patriot Act no Pfizer surveillance no Pfizer spy no Pfizer court no Pfizer weren't no nothing every member those of us would oppose\nPatriot Act one and the son of Patriot Act when it was kind of sunset those that were vehemently opposed to it like me who are cold traders and everything else we predicted this exact thing was going to happen\nThat eventually innocent us citizens would be spied on\nAnd the people who control the government would use it and leverage it for their own political advantage and that's exactly what happened because it always happens you don't have to be here or a fortune teller or read a crystal ball to predict to stop all you have to do is that any sense of history\nThat's why I Try to tell my children history predicts the future if you don't have a sense of\nHistory you can't really be a complete person you can't really manage anything\nOr be an

running\nAround the west wing of the deep state and that he is outing in order to move ahead President Trump's agenda and he's joining us now\nI'll tell you what a great speech the president yesterday I Know you're still like you know course starts out\nApologizing to the American people for the debacle for the clown show the Democrats put on what you do it was a great opening and that was their lives and I was only four rows back in the media does write their front and center\nAnd I was shocked by it but I thought it was great and then he also apologized to judge Kavanaugh and his family for having to go to the nonsense and a lot of polls showing Cory now that the Democrats overplay their hand backfiring that Trump voters are wired\nWhat are you seeing on the ground\nOr John what you said is exactly right look this president came out yesterday and apologize to judge Kavanaugh family for what doors and windows of mainstream media will never apologize the accusations the way they attacked this character and went after his reputation was unprecedented\nThe White House nothing will change with Trump's enemy at the same thing will go on that the only way you're going to get changes is if they lose yesterday when you get in there and clean house answer that question\nYou know the answer is yes and the Republicans win or lose you know historical precedent has said the midterm election there are changes in the ministry and whether that's cabinet members\nWhether staff members in the building or whether it she remembers all different\nDepartments that historically has happened I think will happen again regardless of the outcome of the election that will happen but what are we predict what's going to happen in my opinion Rosen St Louis in four weeks off for a month or two years or whatever it is he will go out and\nHe will do exactly what Jim Comey directly what McCain did exactly what all these guys do they go out and they write these books they got these massive answer and then they say about their time in the White House with their time in the department of justice and ah you know everything from Erica from this president that's what they're going to do that's my prediction I'm sure\nIt will happen and I am certain there are other people who are administrations have service ministry and who are going to do the same thing and this is this is the plan now I'm seeing it for two years great people go in there they certainly\nA capacity and then they go they write a book what Jim Comey book so a lot of coffee in a gym very very wealthy and that's what these guys want to do with kids book comes out\nEarly December between who is deputy director for the FBI who was fired for among other reasons you know a line to the FBI under oath on three occasions he was fired by that his book is coming up against all profit off of Donald Trump and what's\nIn the book world so stories about Donald Trump we've seen in a fire and fury in Woodward and all the other you know tabloids that have been out there and published but my guess what Rod Rosenstein is going to do evil use his perch\nFired him quit to go and write a book and just you know be gaining against this president because that's how these guys stay alive and this is how these guys stayed you know in the public arena and it really it's a terrible terrible thing to be honest with you\nAgree with the new allegations out now that\nThe rosters seen comments that he was going to attempt to wire get wired to the president\nAnd then do with the tape was set up and go to the cabinet to invoke the twenty cents and then get them out and get to have to be\nA senior official saying they believe them and they thought he was dead serious they reported that to a shelter James Baker he thought it was serious thought it was the origins of planets away now just to information or oh that's awful me why doesn't the smartest guy now\nLook I I think I think you're exactly right I think the president wants to get through this election cycle doesn't want anything to distract the Republicans have momentum on their side but I Do think you have to look long term the ability of Rod Rosenstein to stay in that\nPosition looked it rod wants to leave that position he can do that anytime\nHe can resign if he wants to but I think you have to call into question does he have the ability to continue in his capacity as a deputy attorney general based on the information that we're hearing from other members others\nShe remembers that served with him in official capacity in the department of justice or the FBI and they're saying that their accounting for\nWhat McCain said to be true\nThat she was very troubling to everybody and we do know unequivocally that Rod Rosenstein who\nSigned one of the fires that apple change can renewable which allowed them to continue to spy on American citizens on us soil application has ever been made available to us the president's not redacted that we need that when you see that we need to\nSee the thrill to choose which are the FBI's milk after they talk to Bruce or at the department of justice to\nSee what's in there and we have to understand what the insurance policy was to keep the term from being elected that the guy was talking about and what role if any Rob how the Internet because as the deputy attorney general he had the right to sign\nThat five application and from what I understand and what is becoming widely known now that's my application was riddled\nWith mistakes and it was based on the false premise about the doctor and that last renewable will actually signed when Donald Trump was the sitting president of the United states and the American people deserve the right to see what was in that renewal applications that Rod Rosenstein\nSo when you recommend to the president that Robin does November\nI look I Would I Would recommend to the president is declassified all over documents lucky American people decide and see what actually transpired the eyes credibility because of what Jim combing the material and now James Baker and Peter Straub\nDecades to recover from what they have done jet organization\nTrying to use their positions people with authority people were badgers going after American citizen spying on American citizens because we didn't like the political affiliation of their opponents everything that our country has been again censors inception\nAnd guys like Peter Straub record the head of the counterterrorism unit had more ability than anybody\nCan remember one box to the Clinton email investigation he's the one who led the team that it was called a cross by a hurricane that hey there's nothing to see these extra six hundred thousand Clinton email there were all part of the winners laptop and he's\nThe one who said hey let's go after Donald Trump he's only let that investigation we've seen\nIt now with the text messages between at least a page and Peter Struck and they were at least minimum complete with what Jim Comey in a McCain and Jim Baker and potentially Rod Rosenstein want it done and the question is John and this is a very very big question\nHow how did this go in the U.S government we know that the director of the CIA\nAnd the director of national intelligence and others were aware of this spying going on on domestic short or against us but exactly how high did it go which is the biggest untold story of the last two years you get this could lead right up to the very top of the government\nNeeds to be which leads to Jeff Sessions what happened to a gym I mean he's not doing anything you certainly not launching the special counsel to investigate would you alleged to be the biggest scandal in the United states history ever spying\nOn people for political gain all the way up to everything else where Jeff Sessions\nWill look this whole investigation and it's been buying large turned over to the ige the inspector general of the department of justice to find out if there's been any wrongdoing and we've seen some of that report already because it's been released publically the report that recommended\nThe number two person at the FBI not only be fired but charged criminally\nWe're waiting for that to occur uh we're waiting to see what happens to a Peter Struck and Lisa Page and and and Jim Baker the general counsel for the FBI we're waiting to find out what happened to the gym calling because\nIt is very possible that Jim Comey has brought up on charges of potentially perjury in front of Congress leaking of classified information even against you didn't think it was classified that's not an excuse\nWe know that he gave his notes his work product which was he was not allowed to do\nTo the a law professor to make sure that could lead to the media there's been no accountability\nAnybody any level of the government for what they've done which was tried and tried to influence the outcome of a U.S direction because of what Clinton supporters by and large and they did not want to see the Trump become President Trump in ...\nNovember senator are we going to clean house or not\nBut we hope so John I really hope so I can hope for the sake of on that\nFocus on helping much of the rebels\nWhich is going to do by and large singlehandedly if you look at what this president accomplish what three point seven percent unemployment rate for African Americans and Hispanics\nDown there a way to help other staff staff quite candidly and we've seen in the Woodward book or the tried on multiple occasions to stop him from doing things and stopping\nTrying to stop them from being successful person has gone on and done the historic levels\nFor a second is that she\nActually wanted him to be successful to how much more accomplished so much already but there are still people who don't want to be successful there are still people who serve\nIn government or whether they're crafts elected officials or people who have taken positions that support him campaign and if you're trying to stop\nAs again at every turn and all of the success that he has had in the first two\nYears was ... I can only wonder how much more he could have had the right around him supporting in every way\nAnd various positions who's goal is to undermine\nAgenda and if it if you think this is not real a\nThis has got to be the blockbuster book it's one of\nBooks when the when the excerpts come on if it's going to be absolutely stunning Washington because all the other stuff was here say this is gonna be here's a list of the people that are undermining the president who put on a badge everyday and go into the west wing\nAnd they're basically a ruse guide their spy if you will and they're working for the opposition and they're never truckers and they were put there by previous that's what's going to happen\nIs that if the Republicans can somehow managed to hang on to these midterms fasten your seatbelt because this president you got to clean house and he's got to bring people in there that actually believe that it's America first agenda that\nWill work tirelessly in order to pursue his goal and you don't see nothing yet if you looked at it if you if you look at President Trump's accomplishments in the last twenty months in a stunning especially in the face of opposition within his own staff\nI mean forget the other party forget policy and Schumer forget the Democrats forget the never Trump present Congress forget that\nTeam that come in there every day in ... and are taking things on the desk\nAnd manipulating information and fighting him\nAnd a slow walking things installing things including his treasury secretary [noise]\nBut then we should see another one from Goldman Sachs who tried to undermine every single trade deal that the president made by a he's a free trader and his friends on Wall street and Goldman Sachs they want they want cheap goods and higher profits they don't care if you have a job or not what they\nOnly care they haven't cared about you in thirty or forty years old they care about is how big their bonuses and how much profit can they drive in the business schools now teach that they teach equity for ownership workers are commodity here Gary Cohn in there fighting them I mean it goes on and\nSo I look forward to that and I I look forward to finally the president being able to get in a position where we can actually get something done even though we have gotten things done but imagine how much more effective even if we can get to a point where the people surrounding him\nActually believe that his agenda and I for one hope that a cord goes in there and some senior capacity because I think it'd be great John treasuries radio network truck the truth across America [noise]\nSo we have a a resignation\nAmbassador resides Nikki Haley now I'm not a Nikki Haley fan I don't like her I never did [noise] sorry she was the never Trump or we for on the campaign she embarrass herself by\nAh doing one of those uh uh ... what do you call it response speeches to Obama and trashing Trump instead of using it to respond\nTo the president she spent half or speech trashing Trump She was the never Trump or from the beginning okay Trump is unique ability of being able to pick enemies that he thinks they're confident she has been a top of that\nA U.S ambassador and she's had to embrace Trump's policies but she's also publicly different with the president on a number of issues and deep down she doesn't believe any of that stuff and so I don't know why she left I mean she says\nShe's tired or she needs to make more money in order or families in debt I mean you think about it I don't\nThat your husband who was the military but she's got two children teenagers she lives in New York City you don't get a stipend for that you get a hundred and Seventy nine thousand dollars as a UN ambassador and you've got to live in New York City oh good ... good luck with that\nYou have to find all that I mean it's a lot of money and so she's been governor\nAnd so she broke and I I\nI get her leaving to make more money in the private sector and why not leave now where you can make millions of dollars and get rich because that's what everybody does do serve the government get out get rich become a millionaire then go then go back then serve again\nThe Washington government swamp way and everybody's involved in the post both sides yeah you know all you have to do is get them get appointed to a government position and you're guaranteed to have it make a mansion in northern Virginia or a\nBesides the Maryland You're guaranteed you've got to make millions of dollars by doing nothing except starving the government writing a book going on TV and\nFinding a way and I'm sure that you know Nikki Haley will write a tell all book about you know how\nTrump's socks 'cause that's what they all do that's what sells I don't like her I never did and uh she was certainly a competent UN ambassador but I have no interest and why don't you leave it at this time\nI really don't know what ... have been better if she could have hung out for another twenty nine days twenty eight days now until November seventh and then decided to leave shark because it's another day\nNot talking about the tremendous economy all the accomplishments that Trump was having Kavanaugh\nIt's another day we're not talking about the success of the America First agenda it's another day we're just changing the subject talking about something else and it plays right into the Democrats hands that don't want to talk about\nAnything that has anything to do with the economy period you know now\nBig push is Obamacare now the running I'm On that health care or they can't run on Medicaid for all because it's Twenty one trillion dollars [noise] excuse me so they can't one on\nThat so what are they what are they running on\nTheir preexisting conditions that's done anything they found in some polls someplace that people are concerned about getting rid of Obamacare\nBecause that would get rid of pre existing conditions so if you voted for a\nEvery place whatever that monstrosity was that Paul Ryan had 'em\nThat still had preexisting conditions\nBut the insurance companies could raise your rates so that's the one issue now that it's\nCome full circle preexisting conditions and a Trump sucks that's their that's their that's their campaign platform so who can replace Nikki Haley well the front runner\nAnd there's two front runners and then there's um two choices I've got\nThe front runner right now is Dina ... she would um in the national security division she's a bushy um and it never Trump her but\nLike and the family likes her and she was just on vacation last week in South Carolina where the hell is a problem with her husband so she is the front runner\nI Would say right now I Would suppose and certainly the establishment pick to replace Nikki Haley uh my two choices German including a ... I'm sure she'd be fine ah but I think better choices\n\nWho have the experience who's been in the state department has been at the un\nWho shares Trump's America First the general with a lot of enthusiasm especially at ruled as it relates to foreign policy or that will be choices number two my choice number one would be his daughter Ivanka Trump hands down she would be the best choice no doubt\nI don't think he's got to choose their he's afraid of big news of nepotism especially before the midterms I don't see it happening but she's in my mind she'd be the best choice\n[noise] but if I could put a statement yesterday saying that she's not interested in in the position that doesn't mean that can happen\n\nBut if you had to walk in there at least you have someone actually believe in the president's agenda and I'm sure Dina power will be fine I think a record that would be a better choice\nI mean at some point you have to start to reward the people who are with you from the beginning like record now you know he was a high profile gay Republican who came out for Trump very early Nikki Haley for Trump the hallway so at some\nPoint in this administration you have\nTo start to reward the people who believed in you know what the beginning who stuck by you went to beginning who never wavered like Rick run out and actually believe in the things that you're that you're saying and don't have to retrofit their own policies to tell me a lot\n\nNow there's no sense of urgency here John Bolton is in charge of it he was there and he was UN ambassador he knows what he's doing so it's not like the position has to get to chill tomorrow\nWe've gone through the uh annual United Nations general assembly meeting so that's over but those would be my choices out but if\nI had to select somebody if I'd have to protect now I predict has got to be in a pile and the and the problem is also very much liked by a Jared Kushner and Ivanka Trump so their friends so I can see that thing in his choice for the president to make but I Would pick\n[noise]\nRegular news this hour from now on hold on I'm rich Thomas [noise]\nPlus hurricane Michael poses down on the Florida

to get a certain result so we can spread that\nIn the news and the press Republican voters\nSo they won't make phone calls work cetera nobody wants to put time and for a walk talk and so when he was telling me is the CNN polling is that's fake news it's a push fault it's designed to set a narrative\nIn order to influence a result that's why the network is a complete and utter joke that's why I
