in Congress with ... about him I didn't know how to deal with the opioid crisis or doing you know New York and Clinton and finding a bond with supporting here and this is what's going\nOn right now which is really hurtful to the country so we can get any Gawker somebody saying on border security still haven't worked for him to work with people in our area who want to claim by the grace them off

color Hillary Clinton yesterday [noise] and get your way over\nHere on the\nWeb site again Barbara for Congress\nArtist and Republicans and Democrats are sort of the state from getting on the information in the age that you're good at that as well\nAnd I just want to remind our listeners that everybody knows that listens to me I wouldn't uh vehemently opposed to Patriot Act one\nSon of Patriot Act when it's sunset or ... or you were a lonely\nVoice in the U.S Senate I remember you did the filibuster for some time in opposing in questioning\nOr the ... of the Patriot act you were right uh then you're right now I was right than I Am right now we're just so many audience knows this whole ... thing\nA with Carter Page and a easy dropping the Trump campaign and the phony Pfizer Warren none of that could have happened without the Patriot act that set that up\nAnd you're the one that said you keep governor ... getting government this unlimited power up surveillance and its eventually going to come around and bite you in the bud center that's exactly what happened\nI had the same very saying the conversation yesterday with the record the FBI because I asked him point blank argue gathering information including the president's phone calls and of course he fired and said oh I Can't answer that are they're setting\nAnd the answer for him I just got the answer is yes there was an article about two or three years ago saying that they recorded Fifteen hundred of President Obama's up on call and then they minimize ham which means ... mark his name now but is it to tell when President Obama or President Trump is talking to a foreign leader your they're out\nOf their voices [noise] even if you lived or you know a marked out the names that you can't tell her the voices are but we shouldn't be doing now we're listening to members of Congress this conversation as well\nAnd then out there and then the FBI condemned search this database with our judges Warren\nAnd my point him was and I think he didn't understand it or in Britain Saturday or if you're recording teams on potential\nTerrorists from overseas to how it goes to rolling apart but if they're talking to Americans or just random people are talking to American we do get constitutional protections because your phone call our discussions with terrorists in fact the vast majority are innocent\nInternational phone calls\nAnd so we have had this discussion written down and uh it should be protected by the knocking back some say the fourth but John Adams set of the spark that led to the revolution because when you get in like the British soldiers coming into our houses you know breaking down the doors and if we paid our Sam tax [noise]\nUh we really want it protection that we wanted to say the government and never come at your house or take any of the private\nConversations are belongings without talking to a judge first\nWell and that's a that's why you were so adamantly opposed to when you were a predictor of the future with this whole thing senator or\nYou've also been a very strong voice on the disappearance of ... to show the there's a lot of talk about what should be done and we want more information\nAnd like I get that but as a member of the Foreign Relations committee you're the only senator that has proposed action which is until we get answers on his disappearance because\nCenter the thing is we haven't videotape showing that he went in there was nobody on tape showing that he went out and I'm a crown prince MPs Mohammed bin Salman says the camera footage was corrupted the battery went dead\nThey can't really Kennedy by that is like\nThe dog ate my homework or I didn't get an ever ready battery and sort of battery died now you have more in a meeting its suspension of the arms sales to the Saudis until we get some kind of a satisfactory answer can you elaborate on that sir\nI think everybody should remember that Saudi Arabia is the largest state sponsor of radical\nIslam around the world what I mean by that or if they have been the funding for\nMurder authors in Pakistan Indonesia Philippines even in the United states teaching critical west hatred of Christianity and teaching radical violent jihad this is the salaries are we shouldn't be selling a weapon simply because of\nHis tune of the Nineteen hijackers who came here were from Saudi Arabia Saudi Arabia is a big part of our terrorism problem they are gay funders of terrorism and teaching of radical Islam around the world this latest episode I I see no way that this could have happened without their government\nBeing and fall to private planes with team guys aren't going to do some of them have been linked to Saudi security services and intelligence I'm now it doesn't pass the smell test and uh [noise] you know we just went out to the president this morning he describes their arms\nFilling a journalist [noise] they're getting tens of thousands of civilians killed in Yemen\nThey're doing it with our bombs weird refueling they're finding their\nAnswered it slide and two weeks ago or three weeks ago they they kill the school bus full of children's school children were killed a year ago they killed a hundred and fifty people on a funeral procession and we wonder why someone in Yemen wants to drop a bomb on and killed either Saudi are killing American\nBecause they found the fragments of the bombs are saying they're not merica parents so we have to realize that for every action action and that's a blowback from us being involved in some ... gotten civil war is one that we actually create more terrorists but here's the other possible thing that's going to\nHappen again or what happened in Libya when we toppled Gadhafi and\nWe got chaos and more terrorism are becoming a breeding\nGround for terrorism my fear is that there is some remnants of\nFairly fairly strong remnants of al ... India and we're not fighting them that were mentioned are stricter civil war between the ... in the salary and also with Iranian and well the ... century the chaos\nAnd that you get the rise of al ... the same thing happening in Syria as their civil war that we got involved in the house you got the rise of ISIS\nWill actually uh the network that I go on a gym near a a couple of about a month ago was reporting that al Qaida fighters were actually given safe haven a by the by the Saudi forces in Yemen in ... in in order to find out who these so\nThis wouldn't you wouldn't be surprising because who did the Saudis support in Syria they supporter ground noose around which is essentially an offshoot of al carrier so the Saudis are always poor people who hate America who have a western ways\nAnd
