take this one step at a time\nWe need a full accounting and then when you accountability and\nAn editor the editorial page at the Washington Post that's what I'm focused on the nature of ... was I mean that's the other part of this you know he was no enemy of Saudi Arabia or he wasn't anybody's enemy he was a journalist doing his job\n... open debate about important issues he was a patriot\nHe won in the right thing for Saudi Arabia he was even reading for the crown prince exceeding his reforms he had these\nAmbitions and dreams and some of which we shared here at the Washington Post to expand the platform uh for voice is a particularly in\nOr about Saudi Arabia in the middle east\nOr to allow for the kind of open debate which he felt those countries are entitled to in people there want but their governments don't allow so I think there's a a last up and if that's what it is which\nYou know now kind of reads like a final will and testament was not that it was a a mission statement on for what he thought the region needed and and what he still hoped to do\nHere's what we know from all walks into that conflict on October second and he didn't walk out\nThe Saudis no what happened\nSo the idea that we need days and days of investigation uh and forensic work and it's ridiculous\nWhich when you have you on the job\nThat has a Senate race it is very close Rick Scott the governor has pulled even our ahead in some polls of incumbent Democrat Bill Nelson men expected Bill Nelson ... pretty easy time they get reelected here it's not going to happen and we're predicting\nOne Democrat and do all expanding\nRepublicans locked up the military or for our national defence and that's it all the rest of the right approach to build a within the bounds but the Democrats plus up every single program every item because it's pay to play up at the sea and everybody knows it right if you say yes everyone\nOut there they send you a check and that's why I have a guilty man burgers getting to point two million dollars from the store owes link resist a movement actor blue that's her biggest\nDonor funds were Mara hardware\nAnd the election or they're trying to just buy a seat\nThat the U.S Congress with someone who's never run for office before and she's raised I think over five million already and it just money falling down by the state and she doesn't have a policy platform she's just keeping it very neutral and it not promised and the people anything\nThat she's going to do that I Know she came up with healthcare now she slipped on that 'cause it was everybody thought it was a terrible idea\nAnd so uh but that's the Democrats they\nNationwide or it's a great Politico piece a couple of days ago still a lot of people want to go see it on the night points of the Democrats but Nancy Pelosi liberal agenda and it's not a policy agenda I urge everybody go take a look at it\nYou're on the John from his radio network where with incumbent Republican congressman Dave Brat from the seventh congressional districts that central Virginia He's in a tight\nBattle for re election to a search term against a very well funded democratic challenger Abigail Spanberger this'll be decided along with all the other ... germs in fourteen days on November sex early voting is already underway in Virginia costs but let's get back to the caravan and seven thousand people\nIs it not is it not unreasonable for a average people to see this and think okay if the seven thousand people are allowed to come in and\nBreak our laws are just coming to the United states what what stops in next caravan from being Seventy thousand people or the one after that from being seven ... seven hundred thousand people I mean what would be the deterrent if they're simply allowed to\nI'm seeing a basically seen them mob status and just over Romney authorities and and come in as you've seen them do in Mexico what would what would stop the second caravan for being since Seventy thousand instead of seven thousand\nNot that not ... that's exactly the point right that's why we need e verify ... and the green light right once you have an amnesty for a promise and the state the whole world wants to come to the richest country on the face of the earth\nGone are just picture right just make sure President Obama in charge right now with all those in charge and Abigail Spanberger in charge and what would they do and you know what the answer is there'll be total chaos folks\nFlooding and then there there's a signal to the whole world hate they got in right they got an air threat green light let's go right and so\nI thank goodness the president's turn up some strong signal that Congress has got to send out some strong goals are we had the good will out bill that that you dealt with the DACA kids I had a bill was Senator Cruz to deal with the uniting the\nParents are the kids at the border we all compromise on that Democrats that no\nReasonable compromise because they weren't open borders cheap labor ... ... you know get sanctuary cities and just look at Nancy Pelosi right look at San Francisco they gotta\nThey gotta make sure he's ... he's the city is in the ... right now go Google San Francisco everybody look at it and that's what they want to bring to Richmond and it's already starting to happen in policy already not just ideas but in policy\nWell San Francisco has the seventh largest population in the United states and the third largest homeless population and that is growing and a presumed it's got to be rivaling Los Angeles as we know\nAh the estimates are about twenty five thousand people at night are homeless in Los Angeles or sleeping under bridges and drink types that's a lot of people and San Francisco rivaling that\nAccomplishment I Want to get to what exactly do I mean I've asked this question a number of times to pose that you also this caravan is coming they've crossed Mexico in his comedy the president says I'm going to stop it I might send the military there\nWe've already gone through these zero tolerance policy and that was a public relations disaster so what I mean there's not time to enact anything in in in ... days and it's going to happen you guys aren't even section\nSo what should the president do how do we stop at like what exactly what he says I Want to send the military there and close the border what does that mean\nYou can beef up the defenses and ... you know to where the uh seven thousand a folk care I mean our comments blew out but more importantly we have a lot of leverage over Mexico\nRight and that's where it's got to be done to president Mexico there's already a sense hundreds and hundreds of law enforcement to weaken and pick off some of the folks and sent them back home already and I think that's the primary but that's what happened last\nAnd we can afford it they hear\nA number of problems and so it's just it's just thought it was we got to send our own resources to send a strong signal that our our border is secure and and obviously you need to build a wall and put up security measures are to keep this threat from happening and and people say walls don't work\nAnd it it's the\nFact that the left is so hard and against it it is almost the evidence itself that they know what will be a factor right if they thought it wouldn't be a factor but they just want to say good go ahead and do it [noise] but they know that would be a factor in and they don't want it so we need all the above we we have good a\nWarrant for spent on the books and we just need to enforce it\nAnd so that's that's the play golf\nCarts where I don't read you a text from Eric in Richmond who's in your district you since I'm In the seventh district if I were to go to the ER and not pay\nI'd be chasing the ends of the earth and threatened with every type of legal action imaginable and then he would garnish my wages fiscal standard is just crazy I mean isn't this one of the issues for average people struggling to pay their bills\nYeah no that's that's right it traced because right he's a\nSerious these records are around the book with a fantasy and he's got an income stream that is that the parents have the IRS while his personal information in terms of income what he's made and that's the\nWhole point that's the total unfairness of citizens versus non citizen citizens are\nOn the hook for everything that the non citizens do illegally and ... the American eighty percent issue right I mean it it's the number one polling Republican issue right now\nAnd that after the the ... the last show that the tactics\nAre using they're using them in my district right collapse of the whitening businesses one half of the other downside stealing private property and you know leaving careful notes on my own ... group that was widely reported and so the American people see the choice right the economy is growing\nWe got strong America First policies and foreign policy at the border and the alternative is on makeup all to me it's just simply\nOn think why not I we do have people coming our way now Republicans are all coming home independents are breaking our way up to the cabinet story and so in the end I think the or Virginia people are going to do the right thing [noise]\nCars would I have a minute I have I have a minute or the show he a fair we're going to get more information or the Turkish government is saying the next several weeks of MPs was involved in this\nAh do you favor some sort of sanctions or can crush actions in response to allegedly what it appears that the Saudis did within their own constantly\nYeah yeah absolutely you you you cannot ever sent the milk into another world leader even if they're writing an ally in in other respects that it's All right or to take the life of\nAnother human being and so there's going to have to be stiff sanctions I think the White House is going to get there on a on it you know more than just a narrow targeted basis\nI think they're going to be significant and got the Congress for sure are coming in in the back that up by and uh it we we have to write so that you can have an ally but when the allies crosses the line like that you got to ...\nDave Brat thanks for being with us safer more information or to get involved in the campaign\nIt's all you have

to America First policies dot org this message has been paid for it authorized by America First policies in corporate and you've gotta joining us now\nIs Sean Spicer he was the former press secretary for the president of the United states is now the author of the book called the briefing politics the press and the president you get an Amazon\nOr your favorite book store you go to Sean Spicer dot com and get it there\nAnd he's also a senior advisor with America First policies Shaun welcome again great to have you\nHave time to John I [noise] I don't know why you're not hearing but getting it\nIf it's at nights Bonnie like forty two degrees in the right time to head down to Florida\nI Know I heard the weather was changing sort of like I got to go down there and find out what's going on in the Senate race so what better time than we have the a bomb the weather in Virginia and I can finally get out of the rain it is beautiful here showing no question about it okay we've we've got a\nWe've got some things I Want to go over I Want to start with a caravan coming here to the tea in to the United states fourteen days before the midterms shortly we understand is now grown to seven thousand people the president saying or they're not going to come in it's going to close the border if need be how does this play out Sean Spicer\nOn it I think it ... it look there's a lot of things right now as we head into the mid term elections that are sort of that very electorate is a demonstration of what the difference between the two parties aren't as you see these things happen it Chris why it's\nImportant to the elections he thought that it to some degree with Canada or people saying okay I get it this is why did the policies people that come in with this administration and having this party in power\nSimilarly I think that you look at these people kind of a coming marching on up through Mexico trying to come into our border and the president's been very clear about what his position is and that he's going to make sure that we are eight eight country of law and order and it catches march on into our country as they see fit\nI don't think the Democrats clearly have that team set a policy oriented so so you know getting back to it I think a lot of time that you enter into an election\nBetween the two parties in various candidates is you're headed to an election and right now it could be quick [noise]\nSo what should ah\nWhat should the president's action being now as they get if they if they had to get through Mexico and you'd have seven thousand I mean I understand the politics of it but let's get to the policy what should the president's always said you understand the military there how would how would that work how would\nThat play and wouldn't CNN be saying okay you've got to stay in that so pointed that moms with babies that is what CNN will do\nBy lightning you know I it's just it's a it's actually a very complicated policy that I'll probably not the right person to get into it in the sense that there there's something about that I think that you can send you the national guard a federalized or national I Am\nA or utilized certain aspects of National Guard I there is a tricky issue between title kind of titled thirty two that detail how you could use certain members of the military for domestic purposes\nBut regardless I think that the point that he's making if he couldn't figure out what it takes to do that\nPut them along the border and make sure that people can't cross over a but there is an obligation for anyone to make sure that we're protesting for any president especially this when he's made it so clear what its priorities are that we protect the border and we've got to make sure the people coming into our country or coming so legally incorrectly and and not with not sort of [noise] I\nWill eat nearly an ads they see fit this is a country of laws that age you know people are here to seek asylum I understand that we need to make sure that it's done to correct processes\nWere with Sean Spicer he was the former press secretary the first press secretary for President Trump in the Trump administrator and he's also a longtime F. O. J. that means ... John's us Sean\nAnd Sean is also the author of the book called the briefing politics the press and the president which you could buy on Amazon your favorite books or or you can buy it on his website\nWhere Sean Spicer dot com is also a senior advisor for America first policies the number one political action committee in America that supports President Trump's America First agenda\nUp showing the show the situation and Mohamed been solving um you're in the White House at the time oh a lot of our relationship with the Saudis was being discussed that was the president's first ... says it\nUh but now in a BS is really embarrassed President Trump with uh the nonsense that's gone on in this or what appears to be a some kind of an assassination and they're constantly\nOh what do you think the president does now if uh it's\nProven to be true and don't you find what NBS if he was involved in a signing off on this don't you think that was a a basically a slap in the face to the president\nI think you're absolutely right that the idea that if you're that comfortable with the relationship that you feel that you could be this race and that that really insulting to President Trump [noise] ah\nTo begin with the weather but but especially with the relationship\nThat this president is trying to pass or Saudi Arabia that was his first trip if you recall abroad because you really wanted to strengthen that relationship so I\nThink that the actions that have been taken and the idea that it's taken two weeks it's a bit ridiculous you know these guys do from the get go how serious this was a new clearly it's one thing when they initially claimed that they didn't know anything about it I Would talk to believe\nBut the two weeks later they say well okay 'cause something can happen and there was a fight with that you knew that two weeks ago so this is an unbelievably insulting stalled contact\n'em and and I think that you know all of the steps that they've taken has just been ... I mean the the cleaning crew\nSetting and the team um they either need to explain all of this which I think it's beyond the pale of of explaining a but right now I think the president should not just looking in terms of the relationship that we had a rabid but as a personal insult because\nThe idea that we treated Saudi Arabia the way that we have and he made a section amazing gesture of respect by visiting them first in his presidency\nAnd trying to foster and strengthen the relationship we have with them and to his how we get repaid\nOr the president needs to be strong and tough\nI'm agreement with that showing a hundred percent I think that is spot on a ... exactly what we've been saying for some time in his insulting there's a slap in the face and it was very disrespectful and it's kind of like hey look we're friends I've got a hundred and ten being an arms deal therefore I can do whatever I Want\nAnd ah I I think they're gonna find with this president that's really not the way a relationship work so\nWe'll see how that plays out she wants to measure I wanted to uh I I Want to ask you about these mobs these left wing wing moms that are going around I mean in Minnesota last week or two candidates were actually assaulted two Republican candidates were assaulted by these\nBombs is going all over the United states that are threats to Susan Collins and others\nAre people getting chased out of um of a role ... being a being chased down sub subway stairs what's the deal here\n[noise] what well here's an interesting thing I I was reading on a column last week that I'm I'm a constitutional lawyer or a scholar I Can't remember which what really positive in an interesting theory which is that what he's talking about our constitution protects\nThe reality is if you actually read the first amendment protects our ability to peacefully assemble right and that's\nThe key word peacefully assemble and if you think about how normally things work you need you know there's you want to go to temple and particular city and whether it's we're getting there anywhere else you've got to ... you don't do it that's that's because you have a right to do it just doesn't give you a pin or do you do it however you want and I started thinking about that because\nIt all of the action from the last against the right it is not in it we have a right to to express ourselves to we you know a a draft our government and our elected officials that doesn't give us a carte blanche to do however we want and touching something and threatening way\nHere's the thing that I think the bigger problem to me John not only is it happening but they're actually not just deafening silence\nAll of these people who knew were leaders of their party should be standing out in saying this is unacceptable you have a right to protest\nBut there is a way and it means to do that going into a restaurant and basically threatening I Wonder if they're sitting there having dinner and let's be clear because we're all these people on the left to go oh well they just stood in front of them went let let them try to have that kind of tell you how it feels when you are surrounded by ten twenty thirty people\nCamping asked you to get out get out we're going to throw you out\nYou can't tell me that that doesn't make you feel correct\nAnd that's what they're doing and I get I think that the biggest stake the media is frankly a complete mess because it was happening on the right\nPeople will be calling for people's resignation why are you standing against it whatever but because they basically agree with them the function of mainstream media all sort of complex in there because they refused to ask the tough questions\nTo the Democratic leaders as to why they're allowing this to

everything you got to take all your options of energy and working together that were dominion doing silver Marshall nation\nI agree with you so what do we do\nWell I I think that we're gonna have to begin to have a serious discussion about what really happened established those facts get that straight and don't give us your lap when the media which will tell you anything politically get to the actual truth from the bottom of it and I believe that much of that is is underway now\nAnd then I Believe that you have to have a major response to make it very very clear to the people in the world that we're not work with some consequences unfortunately the alliance but the Saudi franchise to understand that he was the one that him and changed upon the alliance to put the alliance in danger by supporting murder\nGet to England and planting poisons in order to try to kill people or you can't have political murder that's can't they can't be a part of the future of the world yourself that cannot tolerate the it's going to happen because of authoritarian countries but we can't stand up with\nA you know I I think you've summed it up better than anybody I've had on before we had Rand Paul and last week was very upset by this but\nUm and when things that Rand Paul said he said look I I Am going to uh go to the Senate and I am going to get an accounting and vote on our involvement in the Yemeni [laughter] and then him for the Saudis\nAnd the Emirates Yemen's civil war a and yet the senators yet my colleagues to come down on this one way or the other support it or not is that\nIs that getting commerce involved is and how they should be involved in this or do you see it in a different way governor\nTopic Congress certainly has a role to play in American foreign policy wait we'll talk about a lot so commentators you could say that they really don't get\nThat it's all up to the president of the executive branch I\nDon't think that's the way the constitution works I think our foreign policy is conducted by the by the president but it is certainly broadly made an inside Congress also [noise] so ah the point is it's a legitimate to go to the Congress and have that conversation but they have limited power to do that so many things but frankly\nThe they can set a standard the Congress can set a standard if they choose to want to say goodbye to Yemen kitchen but everybody this listing plenty of maxed out take a look at where I Am and really is and\nIt said on the southern part of the Arabian Peninsula so if you have Iran to the north and they are fomenting revolution\nThere and the civil war down a gym and you get Saudi Arabia flank onwards north south [noise] they can't put up with that and that's why they're trying to defend themselves or war is always horrible particularly in third world country [noise]\nHumanitarian impact is awful [noise] but they make the decision about how they think that they have to protect the country\nAnd that that's really what's going on so the point is they give up a conflict is more complicated first appears on the fresh\nI Want to get to in order to go there you had written just the other day and one of the things that you said in the peace or you talked about the relationship we have with the Chinese and of course a lot of people and not me but a lot of people were predicting that\nChina will eventually overcome the United states as an economic power will be indebted to them and cetera or you have a a little bit of a different take on that you want to share that with our audience governor\nYeah yeah I'm just not pessimistic everybody the conventional wisdom in America these days is there goes that China is on the couch and I just reject that and I just don't agree with that at all I think the United states has the absolute advantage for the future where are the ones at least so\nWatch uh we're the ones that actually bring material benefits there are system\nThe Chinese have got a real problem on their hands\nAnd their problem is a modern society and the twenty first century they cannot continue to run an authoritarian government and yet that's their vision for the world that's their vision for China that they're going to control the east in the western Pacific in eastern East Asia and I got to control it and then maybe they'll start carrying methods to do that\nAnd in fact you see concentration camps now in western China shut up against minorities this kind of brutality cannot last in the twenty first century with the Internet modern media monitor communication and ah and frankly are rising middle class in China\nThey their problem is they're building their middle class which is a good thing but the middle class is not going to stay under a communist dictatorship forever I Believe that the future belongs to the United states I Believe we're the ones who have all the advantages going forward\nThe twenty first century and not going to be a Chinese Century it's gonna be an American century again\nAh what about our debt a lot of people now getting concerned about the debt the\nTax cuts of the president which I Know you both you and I are very much in favor of it I think they feel this economy I've tried to tell\nOur listeners if you look historically a tax cuts and the effect of having the economy and grow\nRight growth than the main thing is there's a lag between when the tax cuts take effect and when the revenue increases to actually out\nWhat it was prior to the tax cuts so there's a lag and the president also pulling in his cabinet under the blue and saying a time to get out\nYour green I said I Want to five percent cut from everybody across the board you can find it have a good day what do you think of that\nWell first of all what you're lifting from time to time go on my Web page by non profit policy organization called American opportunity dot org American opportunity dot org\nAnd you'll see that over the years we've written about economic growth than we've written about foreign policy you're limited to a recent article that I wrote on foreign policy of actually rich six and we also have some people writing all some Chinese issues of other issues like that there are a Web page American opportunity or\nBut one of our oldest for positions that we've done in our organization that the gross co which is decided at the time that that the last was in charge of the country and the wages were not growing if people were not working on a wire was higher growth slow\nAnd we proposed that there be a policy of tax cuts for economic growth well that's now been done and you know the whole point is this how you're going to get into the debt you're either going to have to raise taxes in\nOrder to finance the death or you're going to have to grow in order to create more revenue build a bigger pot\nBut at the end of the day then be any good increased revenues if you just spend the same revenue it again if you if you're a a you know grossed ... million dollars each and spend a billion and a half there still is\nWe're going to spend our money right now we're basically I'm moving to the left is trying to move us in the direction of socialism which is a transfer of money from one pockets of the other but at the end of the day there's no limit to that and that increases the debt\nAnd furthermore drives out money that's going to be absolutely essential for the coming conflicts of the twenty first century in our military spending is going to be absolutely necessary I research are are developed like our science uh these things that also has to be pushed forward so we have a lot of priorities and good governance and good executive leadership\nGot to be just a good rational leadership\nIs going to be necessary to help define that spending\nSo um we can't touch the tournaments because the president has made that promise on multiple times that was part of his\nEconomic platform and he said I have a deal the deal is a you've made in Social Security you have these different things the money's going to be there I'm not going to cut that\nThat represents what over fifty percent of the budget right right right there and he's not going to cut military spending you know now so when you when you look at a five percent cut across everything else discretionary spending\nYou know you're not talking about trillions of dollars are you\nWilling Joel desire Lee American conservatives say actually do an inventory\nOf the house or so where we are spending money and then have a policy discussion are real political discussion\nThe committee eater and campaigns for elections or otherwise just do what we're spending our money on and what we have to spend their money and all\nBut one thing is real sure and that is if you increase taxes you reduce economic activity each year increase taxes you reduce economic activity\nIt means and that's the wrestle approach to the left their goal is to simply go for the bucks and grab the money for anybody they can get his law and they usually make it quote or they're rich unquote\nBut I can promise you John based upon all the numbers I've ever seen in order to pay for this debt independence for this government if it's got to be a socialist got you got to go into the middle class you can get that money you just have two\nAnd a conservative don't believe in that\nWe believe and people keep him get much of their own money as they can that's why when I ran for governor I push the ... and that's what the goal is the goal is to give people more control over the last well let's keep more of their own money tax the Republican conservative mock trial and that's where we have to try to do for the future [noise]\nGovernor Jim Gilmore is a great analysis of where we are today that's why I Love having you on so refreshing thanks for your time sir for more information you can go to the governor's website American opportunity dot org American opportunity dot org\nThis explain\nHow this could be sanctioned by allegedly crown prince Mohammed bin Salman who's not even taking power\nI mean there's other reports now served that he was directing a basically traffic if you will to put it in layman's terms via Skype on what was going down with ... show he was a human being they went to the uh constantly to get paper work to show that he was\nDivorced in Saudi Arabia so he could get married to his Turkish me how did you have\nI actually know how anybody\nCan you call that today's world civility is that you know there's just no adult supervision it seems to me sort of a version or you and I are old enough to remember Jimmy Breslin wrote a book\nGang could shoot straight yes this is sort of a hard time [noise]\nAnd it's you know\nAnd you know the other thing is uh Mohammed determine spent all this money and effort in the United states lobbying as you know and he did the tour and he went around he was in Texas and California other parts of the country you were a business to he's trying to get\nYou always investing money and he's trying to present himself as in New young visionary leader did we get this\nWell [noise]\nI Can't really speak to your child I'm speechless during you know if you're you know you're going to kill somebody you know you shouldn't be going around every plant assassinations of journalists\nCertainly but if you're going to do it in a way that one has a good chance of avoiding extra you know there's so many people and there's certainly come out and then when it comes out and find out what do you\nMiss your parents or how does this affect us Saudi relations\nThat\nQuestion you have the White House is smaller [noise] I personally believe [noise] that ... I'm In my house is committed a one party or send us\nBasically just family [noise]\nI don't know this was in\nOther country this would have been tarnished reputation as family but simply guilt by association I personally believe that signed up to deliver a very strong actually [noise]\nWhere the Saudis have to basically learn\nThat what they're doing it harms not only their reputation harms harms their own country and also harms the interest of the United states of America I Would start very much by making it clear to the Saudis fit the\nThe the end of the war is over they have to wrap it up so I Would certainly not trying to take whatever actually Clinton against the people directly involved all the way up to the [noise]\nThere's so much you know the real world we're not going to take personal actually against Mohammed bin Laden I Believe but certainly I'm not with people and his inner circle that this that hurts\nThe commentary that they buy so much from us that we need them terribly I he was not a good narrative the real narrative Saudis need a much more than what you mean there\nAre it's not a\nWhat's the word I'm looking for it it's not a one way street and the side of the dependence on the United states is really quite considerable they can't go to somebody else\nTo buy weapons because\nI think they can but it means that they may break with us their own military comes screeching halt within within days because we provide all the spare parts we provide American companies in American technicians or provide most of the maintenance of supervision\nAnd the maintenance skills as I say I don't believe the Saudi military could stay functional\nBeyond a few weeks maybe a month or two without a direct American support so\nWe have the upper hand there's no doubt in my mind we'd have the upper hand ah it also looks like the Europeans are going to start selling them both sort of equipment the Saudis are so that leaves them with the Russians\nAre the only other viable place to go and I'll tell you I Want to be in countries like Saudi Arabia dependent on the Russians for my science it would take five years\nTo basically stand out the American equipment and by Russia you know\nMy I'm In Minnesota mountains reaction to a very simple ... you know the little minor insult from the Canadian foreign minister very minor break relations that indicates we may not have any totally irrational actor on that\nLevel\nOr the other great problem of course is that if he is you know he has done so much\nDamage to the interests of the ruling family is jail so many of them shaking\nThem for their wealth and so forth you know somebody's was justified made him popular but at the same time he has made so many enemies domestically that are in the last power it was sort of put out on the street\nOh Mr bathroom button Windsor everyone knows you're on the junk science radio network we are with former cutter United States ambassador country hero he is now the president of the U.S cover business council so you mentioned the word Mr Ambassador\nIncompetent and are you the first one that said that and uh I've got it written down because I think that really sums it up\nYou know a lot of things that MPs has gotten involved in um have not been successful whether it be the way he's conducting the Yemeni civil war which I think\nAh even supporters of that would say has been a disaster on every possible level\nThe um the blockade he did with Egypt Bahrain and the Emirates against Qatar has been a total colossal failure it's almost a comedy show\nBecause ah the country of cutting the state of\nCutter is much better off economically and otherwise and they were before the blockade\nAnd all the men is that the Saudis aren't getting any of their business I mean it was really a complete your doctor for me I mean if you if you went to Harvard missing your bathroom toilet a business class and international relations how to do a blockade inhabit blow up in your face that would be your classmates a dancer\nSo every day the guy gets involved in a blows up at what point does the fathers saying you know maybe he's just not equipped\nOh well I think there may not be in a situation where you can actually call the shots do you call it a shot when the embassy\nTo Jerusalem and this was too much [noise] but [noise] they shoot\nI'm Sorry [noise] that he was

[noise] I think that's what this one\nYeah I Believe that the Iranians position now are being able to say you\nKnows how to play these people well it's a transactional game but you know I don't make sure the city of New York doesn't really foresaw that trial parking tickets you guys got I can get your vote a couple of this is the way the\nUs operates under the fanciest stuffing are under the big

losing so that's where I Would\nPut my cars but whether or not they too so I can tell because I it depends on who's who's got the president's here on this one but this is the most important investment oil physician\nOr the bachelor or the United nations is the only American ambassador who sits regularly and cabinet meetings and has access to the president [noise]\nSo it's it's a very very important position unique you need to balance this out carefully as to who you're put in that position I mean\nThat's the qualifications I don't know what the workings are right now inside the White House to decide who's going to be the the job or not\nWell we heard Rick Grinnell from Germany interviews but we've also heard\nThat the president for a woman to take the place in the family so those were in conflict so no no one knows we do know the engine of used by\nPeople but it sounds like he's gonna make you very deliberate decision but very interesting what you're saying and certainly the profile that you outlined\nDoesn't exactly say national security to a church John Bolton who doesn't exactly he he's not the movies you can type like in like I said he was having had had him on my show many

they're talking about socializing medicine that we got communist\nAs their party's standard bearer or is it\nThere chairman and saying is the future of the party I mean it's it's bizarre now they got this caravan which is an invasion or it's an exodus\nNow there's another there's eight thousand strong now I heard today it's up to eight thousand James Dean as that goes there marching right through Mexico the\nPolice are letting them in the good to go to the U.S border and only have to do was put one foot over\nAnd there are laws and our so porous and there are so many loopholes\nThey can't do anything about it\nI mean you can't when Trump says I'm going to close the border excuse me Mr President that would mean cutting off all trade it's just like you can't just\nClose the border for\n[noise] so you would knock out all trade that would all be gone and it would it would it would cause economic habits so you can't do that that's just the reality of it you can't do it [noise]\nAnd so the problem is that there are so many loopholes that is the problem in the law you know fifty percent now of all of our migrants are coming from Central America fifty for ... percent\nThere was a time when almost a hundred percent were single males coming from Mexico looking for jobs like everybody got that\nIn two thousand one\nLess than one percent of illegal aliens claimed asylum now thirty percent claim asylum\nAnd we have a law\nThat was passed in two thousand Fifteen called the forest floor and with the force law says if you were apprehended on the border if you're apprehended and you claim asylum [noise] legally the government can only hold these people for twenty days\nIf you can't get your paperwork process than twenty days the federal government the border patrol has to release them\n\nThis is all lost the Democrats like the law because once they're released the sober [noise]\nThey get a piece of paper that show up on this day which is not a week's out years out years [noise]\nSo then they just disappear into the interior of the country they only have twenty days and now obviously you can't separate the children from the parents so the parents and the children or whatever the children are the guardian wherever they are\n\nThey can be detained together but only for twenty days at the end of that twenty they they have to be released they get a piece of paper and\nThen they just go wherever they go in\n\nAnd they say they're coming fleeing persecution I'm I'm certainly that some are countries they're playing or not doing that well but four billion people would like to migrate to the United states and get welfare and education and fish is on the back\nSeat this doesn't affect the elites are the rich they they it has no impact on them they send their kids to private school and he has no impact on\nThis is a burden on middle and lower income Americans because schools get over Ron the welfare system explodes and I told you the story of my own so when I moved to just think Virginia we put them in school I guess it was what third third grade\nAnd\nOr the fifth fifth grade or fourth I don't I\nI don't remember third or fourth grade\nTwelve of them don't speak English just forget was in the school that I was in twelve or Thirteen kids don't speak a word of English all migrants\nNow what are you gonna do how can that be satisfactory learning environment\nYou can't so the teacher was going to go down to the lowest common denominator we pulled them out instead of the St Matthew's Catholic school I didn't have the money for that\nSo we have to give up a lot of different stuff so you pay your taxes for an education that is worthless in\nSome areas of your living in a mansion in northern Virginia in orbit says that you know as a five million dollar lobbyist for the federal government you don't care they're going to private school\nBut if you have to send your child to a public school because that's\nWhere your economic means land and half the kids in there can't speak a word of English you tell me what kind of and\nAll of a learning environment is that for your child well it's not it's no fall through the children but it's the fault of the system profiling it I mean this is an invasion\nThat and they're they're burning they're burning tires in front of the U.S embassy there are flying around the Honduras Guatemala flags\nAnd their boss basically taught thing the president to stop them because they know that as soon as they get in the United states there say they won't get released and twenty days\nBecause their cases are years away so they simply disappear in the interior of the country\n\nAnd all they have to do in the first asylum hearing is meet the basic threshold see there's three ... asylum the first one is just claiming it eighty percent of people meet the first asylum\nRequirements so their release anyway and the other twenty percent get released also because they can't get processed in twenty days so they all get released this is the problem these are the poles\n\nOf the people that are detained that actually show up in court when they're supposed to Fifteen Percent so eighty percent of people are not apprehended\nAnd on the twenty percent\nOnly Fifteen Percent actually go to court when they're supposed to so you do the math like Ninety five percent of the people that put one foot in the ... of the country state it's an it's an incredible number\nAnd they're coming for either economics or for family reunification\n\nAnd we're not even who is in this caravan human traffickers drug cartel malls bad people some say some say\nNo one knows\n\nWhat is the president to we tried zero tolerance that was a public relations fiasco\n\nSo I tell you what [noise] um the images on TV Now and what the what the Caribbean has done\nIs they've pushed all the women and children to the front of the line so the cameras catch only women and children on TV so you see children crying and moms crying for food for their baby\nWell they make the choice to come but it doesn't matter that's the images that the fake news wants to play they don't want to go deep into the caravan of find out who these other people are\nAnd who is funding this has anybody asked that question me this is an invasion it's like we have no laws we have no border we have no laws we have nothing\n\nSo here's why the Republicans are going to win and hold the house because suburban women\nThat the Democrats have been counting on heavily to give them victory because of whatever reason are looking at two things mobs in caravans mobs and caravan angry mobs an agri caravans\n\nI don't think that's conducive to getting votes for Democrats if you look at the early voting right now in the trends in early voting Republican turnout and Republican areas is through the roof\n[noise]\nRaking in the shower and how old are you talking about [noise]\nStreet and see and read a story in\nA

then we'll be in Richmond enrich Vegas the or the next several days any rate and coming up in a few moments of the Caribbean continues\nTo march for our president or the garden of turkey last night

Washington DC metropolitan area today hire sixty nine low forty four sunny we got sun all over the place funny the reins gone\nWith kills people into our four and other parts of the country that has a lot more than one journalist or do we want to go on a crusade and start punishing everyone there is proof that the U.S military killed several lawyers\nMilitary US military tank fired on a building on which is there a TV journalist was doing a standup do we want to start punishing Terry first shooting a journalist\nWhere do you want to go with it I don't know but as I said I think the answer is as Jesus said what was the first person you would never sin cast the first stone [noise]\nI think the difference here is that it happened in the counselor and it was such a blatant disregard of the relationship that the president has attempted to build with the Saudi kingdom and especially NBS I'm using the White House and things like that\nBut I think that's the real issue for the president and I you know he said there's gonna be severe consequences I Do believe that President Trump's along with the Congress is going to do something because the big difference here is\nIt happened and I'm In an embassy which as there is an international order right and I mean you go into an embassy ...\nYou're not expected to get your head cut off with a\nChainsaw or a vote so whatever they had so it's kinda gruesome and I think I think that's what's fueling the outrage imminent and this and this was an ally of ours and\nI think it's put President Trump in a very very awkward position and there's gotta be some accounting for that what the consequences are I don't know certainly\nUh I think\nThat Rand Paul and others and Bob Corker and others are going to demand that there's a hearing in Congress on what our involvement why we're still involved\nIn supporting the Saudis and the Emirates in the Yemeni civil war I\nMean I I think at least you're gonna get that what wouldn't you agree with me that this is not particularly [noise] helpful to President Trump's I mean come on and were you murder somebody in your in in in in a constant lists\nOf and just do it in such a brazen matter I mean\nDo do do you think do you think this is particularly helpful [noise]\nOf course not um you know the kinds of things that every country makes a political mistake in addition to the moral consequences of brokering I Want I don't want to discount that but\nYou've got all the countries that Saudi Arabia's rivals which are trying to profit from this geopolitical mistake and I I don't want to downplay it too much yet that's what it is and the people that that will profit from this once again or the Muslim Brotherhood once again Qatar\nQatar which is supporting terrorism all across the middle east or do we want the Muslim Brotherhood to profit from their mind bottom line and I know the Congress is going to force president from hand on that time fairly certain that that you're right\nYou're very you're free to the ...\nI just stop helping Saudi Arabia and Yemen which is basically going to lead the who the he's in charge of fun and it's going to leave the country divided um it's not going to solve any of the problems of what's going on in Yemen because you've got the same parties there that are battling\nIt out or it's just going to leave another Arab country in a state of division where people are fighting on the ground\nUm so I see now no good coming out of that politically and I see no geopolitical good coming out of supporting the Muslim Brotherhood and I knew your market joking and I'm Sorry he died I'm Sorry it was brutal and I'm not going to defend Mohammed bin Salman man but you don't go rewarding\nYour enemies are with geopolitical gaps because your friends made a mistake like\nThat so what do you think the United states should do is anything\nWell I I Would hate to be in President Trump's hands place um I I Know he's got he's surrounded by some good people secretary Pompeo and the vice president who is a very strong moral person uh what do they come up with I mean the king is not going to\nGet your son he's not going to throw into the world a lot of people\nInside our foreign policy establishment ... trying to foment it cool by saying that the other princes are going to try to overthrow him perhaps it's possible I suspect it's not but\nPerhaps it's possible there are a lot of princes that would love to do that\nPeople are missing that point had been some man will be king for maybe ... years or they don't like someone like that I think we have a political objectives of dividing various there are countries I don't say we but I mean the the deep state the\nForeign policy establishment um and that's not a good thing it sets the middle east on fire\nA it wrecked the economy and puts a lot of young people out of work and creates\nFloods the refugees and you see people like George Soros who would like to see refugees we don't want to see more refugees we don't want it to the air it goes on sending more refugees\nEurope it's the Muslim Brotherhood that it's been doing that's both from turkey and from from Libya and they continue\nTo do this because they are trying to flood Europe with refugees and people are doing the same thing with our borders in South America coming from Honduras and Mexico and wherever else are we don't want a city that it's a mistake\nBecause it is it possible and were you rainy and that may be NBS just isn't particularly effective leader because right now everything the guy touches as trying to craft right I mean uh the Yemeni civil war than he's conducting their or the money that he spent has been a disaster\nThe public relations fiasco up to him or listening all of his rivals and putting them in\nThe higher regency are wondering what every ... hotel there and then torturing them as with some of the allegations were I'm not sure if there's ever been proven now the blockade of the gang of for a black chain against the Tories whatever you think of of that government about government of matching them I wouldn't even\nIt tore up people are better off um post the blood and they were before we screwed that up um I mean the get the guys you know this the alleged murder is a complete ... I mean I think it's beyond a screw up I mean it's like\nIt's a lift the Keystone Cops and the whole thing is ridiculous\nI mean the guy screwed up everything so I mean maybe meet his father who's looking at this and saying look he's thirty three years old and maybe he's just not particularly effective right now you know we have a law in the United states or is it that says that you can be president or to your thirty five years [laughter] I mean there's a reason for that\nAnd you know maybe you need you know maybe it's possible that he's just not an effective leaders that\nAre reasonable conclusion for people to make\nIt look like the drama of King Lear pointed out to other African king who is given his ... his other son was ambassador to\nThe United states some people are wet spring that he shouldn't be the king or the crown prince and um it's it's a bad situation I'm you know it could happen\nIn an in another kingdom obviously Shakespeare wrote about King Lear by uh the bottom line here I think in the middle east in the least is that I don't\nBelieve them into the world I don't believe he's going to choose his other son this is his favorite son unless he has a rebellion of the major principles inside the\nKingdom which I also don't think it's going to happen\nIt's not going to be replaced and if you want to know what's a scenario where how it plays out if\nWe say both um Saudi Arabia ... newspaper this threat mentioning that Saudi Arabia is also aligned with Russia and also that Russia would like to\nSee the kingdom cut oil sales and states like to do that in order to rainy practices saying and this is just a veiled threats are the things would\nRecreate another Nineteen Seventy three the three main square or the oil\nBlockade on the west was enforced and prices went up and we were all standing in gas lines I don't know say theoretically could pull that off\nAgain but they were certainly threatening um I guess Mohammed been Taliban was threatening um so do you want to get into a really ugly scenario or with the oil\nMarkets given that Iran is going to be going off line on November fourth we probably Donaldson electorate starting to on November ... I I mean well how does that tell man could stop pumping oil\nUm November forest and prices would go up and people would be going to the polls and saying Trump this turns everything to typical material so um you know\nA good turnout rate it could turn out to eat I don't want to see that happen um and once again\nI think later to get close to our transcribed interview that will be Thursday this week\nBefore the same panelists investigators as Fox News has learned to ever needed push to declassify from Russia records congressional sources say Republicans like President Trump\nTo declassify fewer than a dozen pages of documents which can relate to Papadopoulos social say they believe these records including exculpatory evidence and appear to under caught the collision narrative\n[noise]\nIs really that were truck measurements across America I Am your Godzilla of the truth it's great to be with you today don't forget\nOur in our new news talk station W. J. F. N. one hundred forty five ... FM launches a new talk station in Richmond and good when it launches on Thursday October twenty fifth at six am W. J. up and one other point five FM\nBooks when Richmond that is in the uh west Richmond area can be heard\nOn FM in short pump in ... in boots wind in the suburbs there and west right go and uh our talk station brand new format another talk station enrichment gives you another alternative it's going to be the Godzilla of talk radio enrichment we own the station\nAnd we launched on Thursday right on Thursday October twenty fifth\nAnd there'll be no fanfare with that it's a soft launch a headline that joke stations six AM to ten Monday to Friday after being on Mondays the Chris excellent show tend to want tend to new Tuesday to friday the fighting Joe Morris show after that\nDennis Springer Michael Savage Larry Elder we can watch from going to be a great talk station enrichment W. J. F. than one hundred twenty five ... FM in Richmond pooch lend\nWatching this Thursday so we still have a lot of work to do to get everything up and are ready to go but we're excited about it and uh other people are selling talk stations were buying them because we believe in the format so much\nAnd that's the other good news writes all good\nMeantime Democrats are eager to keep the focus on health care and the final two weeks\nUntil election day but the president has spent the past twenty four hours unloading on this migrant caravan which began its travels\nAs a group of now eight thousand um the caravan reached temperature will in Mexico on Monday about eleven hundred miles from a gallon Texas and it continues to trek north towards the southern border\nBut the Democrats they want to keep the focus on health care because uh the polling shows that is the number one issue on people's mind and joining us now to try to understand\nWhy health care is such an important issue and it's on so many people's minds joined this upcoming election and beyond\nIs my good friend del balance to is the executive director and founder of liberty health share\nNow um my self and my family have been proud members of liberty health share forget this seven years\nIt is the best thing we have ever done you know all the healthcare debate [noise] we have to debate it and we talk about it and uh we analyze it for you on the air but I'm not personally involved in it because my family got out of this a long time ago we got out of the whole\nObamacare healthcare rat race and we went to liberty health share which the services phenomena oh this is a great organization where it's different because everybody shares in their own cost of health\nThose members and it is growing every day is the best kept secret in America and I urge all of my listeners now if you work for the federal or state or county government and you've got a great health plan or you work for big company and they provided you do a little a co pay that's fine\nBut if you're an independent contractor or you work in the ticket counter me are you on a ten Ninety nine or you work for a small company like we have and we can't\nWe can't buy the insurance we can it would put us out of business is so expensive or you're a business owner any of those things then liberty health share is a phenomenal opportunity for you and as I said my family of three and I've got a fourteen year old even on when he was seven\nAnd it's just it's the greatest place like paint cash it's easy to do the services great\nEverything gets done they didn't do shit everything on your behalf you're not there is no paperwork there's no paper work it just you pick up the phone\nI mean you send them to stop you send them to bill that's it and you get all the pre emptive a chair and all that but you you got to check it out killed at liberty house share dot org check it out ask for quotation that's all it is you got\nJoining us now to help understand what is going on today in health care with this debate executive director founder of ... here yeah both hey do\nSuch a pleasure to be with you John thank you for the invitation\nYou because I'm a true believer Dale when you believe in something it's really easy to talk about it because I'm not only a believer I'm customer and I have been for a very long time\nAnd we wouldn't three different you know the other day if if I could send me these came to me and said hey ah showing or whatever it is you know organized hear you man or something\nI think two hundred that's out there\nBecause it's a hassle LA's an addition\nTo that we banded together as you've just said\nTo painkillers medical bills on the basis of our shared values and beliefs but we also stimulate one another to lean to lead healthy lives the reasonable such\nDeaths satisfaction in America about health care today that's why it's at the top of people's discussion list and concern lists as we come into this mid term election\nThat is because we don't have a health care system in America John we having\nCare system the only time a doctor wants to see\nIs when you're sick and we got to change that and we stimulate\nOne another encourage each other we welcome folks with like conditions that by just simply adding exercise or diets or control to their wives reverses diabetes and heart disease and high blood\nPressure certainly obesity we help people stop smoking we're focused on the care of our health\nAnd that's what we've got to get back to a and focus on and understand\nThat health care is really about the care of our health and that's what we're focused on\nWell you stopped me from smoking so that's good [laughter] yeah right\nAnd so I'm pulling this can be job because we do we welcome folks with those conditions they just have to admit to change their lifestyle and a recent survey came out from the two days ago for the New York times just indicated\nThat big city is as bad or if not worse than smoking and if people would simply gauging simple\nExercise every day it would change their lives reduce their weight a ... and certainly reduced the house with skin profile for the future and that's what we're doing we're just simply saying look let's let's take care of our bodies these are\nPrecious gifts one better couldn't we invested in folks set aside money for retirement plan their entire lives let's make some plans to preserve our house or into the future\nA ... and that's key in this case because\nYou know you have to do is get a quotation is going to liberty hill share dot org liberty hill shoved out or it's all there or you can call age five five five eight five quote you three seven eight five five five eight five four to three Seventy get out of the whole government thing\nBut the best thing about it is it is it's a plan to stay healthy it's not a plan to go there when you think now obviously you become sick you have problems you know we've we've all had them I've certainly had them over the eating for months that I've been with\nA with the uh with LA chess but uh the object is to stay healthier and it permeates your whole family I mean it's held my wife even my fourteen year old\nRight
