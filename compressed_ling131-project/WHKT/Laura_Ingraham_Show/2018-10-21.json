joining us now congressman Rob Wittman from the first congressional district up for reelection and a former colleague of\nMine Mike bring 'em on that the guy\n[laughter] I'm over ... are you this morning you tell me how are you\nI'm doing well doing well busy busy these days but uh but but doing well\nGive me give me and I tell ya I work as a not an endorsement but there's a a reflection of what I saw when you're in the general assembly working together I think we're in the act commuted together you're always justice energetic smiling go get them kind of guy you know like the um like Mickey Rooney was put on a show you're always just like vitamins are you able to maintain that\nYes you know I I I'm you know I'm blessed to represent great bugs and the the first district you know I get my energy from that they are very very passionate\nIndividuals that work hard every day in and do do great work so it's hard not to be motivated by that but it it's hard not to be motivated to ah by the by the true on or that it is to represent them\nAnd I appreciate that and I'm having been in that position in the office and going back\nWell you know Chris I mean I think at certain times it it it does it does give you pause as to you know where we are at the country and the divisions that are out there but but I always work every day to try to find places where we agree I think I think today takes a little more effort to do\nIs that you have deadlines are constitutionally\nA enacted that hold the line on these things you can't go to continuing resolution that's an awful turn off but they also have I I Love the single object rules in in his late ... where do you deal with one subject and that's it so you don't have this big mash up coming back from the other from the Senate or vice versa\nThat just just blows up the whole deal\nNo I agree and and how the uh good good good is that in the in the U.S house we operate under the same rules you operate during the general assembly jak or you and I both know that is\nSpent ... you figure out the rules about how things are happening on the site has different rules so many steps kind of get combined together and you look at how to balance is related in any way shape or form in the ... the the\nThe most highlighted example is we're here for about ... past the title of the bill was that the court will CARE Act they they they took they took a ... bill stripped all the language you out of it kept bumper and the title of the certainly the houses\nVersion of the Affordable CARE Act so it it it's that kind of procedural stuff that you just shake their heads go what how could that happen I but I Would argue that you know sticking with\nBill Wasik of systems like you see in your office\nAnd he was the way to make sure that your keep debate on track you make sure you don't have a lot of you know aren't related adopted a piece of legislation people go\nHow does that get in there it's kinda like you know I was calling everything on the last train leaving the stage show it's like you know that stuff doesn't doesn't belong or there are not related or ... years you know as the way as the ethical to pass things that are are unrelated so I I agree and that's that's one of the I think the problems\nUp here is that it doesn't it doesn't require the necessary debate in clubs for a seat when you're using that mechanism when you have on related\nUh aspects of legislation or language bill people just you know look at it and go how how could that have\nI Hope you're well we'll take a look at some of the rules and get more to wherever of Virginia way of governing up in DC because\nI I one of the things that when you pull back from politics and and watch sports people get upset when they see rules violation because they know the rules right I mean last night there was a pitcher Justin Berliner through as a slider it was beautiful slider\nKnot you in in ... when he was a pitcher for the Mets and the AIDS and some other teams said that is a pitch is when you are warming up to you put your mid down and say grab Patel I'm done that's a perfect pitch and it was and it was called the ball\nAnd the next pitch the Boston Red Sox guy hit it for a home run and as a as a fan you go that's outrageous only because the the the teleprompter had on there and the strike zone so you knew you could see\nI don't think people don't they don't know the rules to get upset about that's just not cricket you're not doing it the right way guys you know we deserve better and so they pulled back behind the scenes they shrugged their shoulders and throw their hands\nYou know it's just it's just not working I'm On my mom yeah you know I I don't get it right in the distance and or anything you can do to to to change that would be for the benefit end of my rent let's get back to the absolute let's get back to the national district what what are your voters telling you\nWell you know we're here a lot of state I think Chris get there that they are very interested in how do we create a a continual um\nIncrease in our economy I think people are are very positive about where the town of about a I think they appreciate what's meant by Congress or less regulatory burden in changing the tax\nCode to make it easier for businesses individuals but the things that they want to see going forward or what\nI call the Stanley Park so many comedy and first of those who does have an education system that assures that our children students get us history uh educational experience 'til you want you\nTo feel the jobs are there seven point one million jobs over and Chris and Seventy five percent of those jobs will not require raise your great and that means we have to emphasize\nCareer and technical education as much as we do common stretch education because\nThat's where the jobs are in those jobs today are skilled jobs that have occurred as far as a career when you go from an apprentice journey to a pastor and have a career their star daily well in many instances\nBetter than you wrote him a job that requires a college degree so I think people look at that and say that's where we have to know\nHim looking around going how it's going to make sure that my child is successful like how to make sure the education system gives them the knowledge skills abilities\nTo compete for the jobs that are available today entered the church and I think businesses look at it and say hey the other thing is when the economy are going really well of course when I taught for instance was across the district I can tell you the top three things they talk to me about our workforce\nWorkforce and workforce or you know they say we could grow up business today if we can\nJust find workers to do the job and it's you know there are more job opening statements are built the job openings so we're going to have the money in one other element to this article and that is brought in for people to connect\nIs important in terms of what was the support of education so that a lot of families children do scolded tablet computers and bring them home and they can't connect\nIt's hard for them to do the assignments that they've been given or the soap operas they have to put an equal take it on to the library bottles to why fight businesses many times the areas that don't have high speed can't do the business they need to be successful\nAnd her one of the ways to bring down health care costs are about access\nBlock of having to go to an office building ... miles and miles away and can get that care and quality of those things are gaining change right so we really what brought on that we have to make sure we have education such a size Korean talking about education as much as a post college truck education\nAnd these are these are these are the tough issues because people don't go broadband workforce development those those don't get the people out to the\nTo the poll I mean they're just like no that makes sense I like that you know 'cause when when people get down into the the granular already talked about with other callers today in politics in the garbage complex and people don't like complex they're like five were bumper stickers because they're pretty busy trying to make their lives working\nIn putting that into the context of their daily lives come out and vote whichever way is a tall order for a lot of politicians right\nSure policy and complicated it takes time of her off for for anybody anybody in our leadership position whether\nElected or not have that album hot those towers ... and you know those things that I grew up poor are really still hard things I hear from or so it's just something that I've come up with some people say\nHey chronicle and gas companies soundbites waves help our economy but drill down is okay\nWe've got these couple of times you can always say well he did something not quite in Chicago but I think people are going to cost why don't we want our people into like officer we're asking for people start to think well that's quite a few\nPeople close to an ACC and that's great but what people want to hear to work if I'm going to play smartphone\nAgain what are you going to do in the future how do you understand\nThings get to eat on what are you going to do to accomplish that what do you what you want to come back to us or if you were only allowed to ask you approach the last ... last sort of things on the on the ease with but I was able to accomplish and and I just want they want you to understand\nWhat's according to them and they want you to project location for the future about how this all the grass or it's not just on the list actually done it what are you going to connect with armor stone of people's concerns\nAnd on the challenges they face huge\nTell people audiences all the time I talk to him politics and about the future not to pass it is and you can get like look what happened but very the economy's great unemployment is historically low and they just threw out the government pretty much there's ... there's some there's some\nUndertow currents that you just have to go out there and pound doors you understand and listen to people because the elections are about tomorrow night yesterday that seemed to ride Rob I really appreciate your calling in today we wish you the best out there in the campaign trail you got what Eighteen days left\nEighteen days left\n[laughter] everybody because we've only got four hundred and Seventy two days to the Iowa caucuses that there isn't that fun [laughter] I Know it\n[noise] well there are already out there are already out there getting their campaign strategist and consultants lined up for them for the caucuses and people are starting packs and all that kind of stuff but it never ends Virginia is always a test case and\nAh we're blessed for people who who offer themselves up for public service and regardless of party we thank you Rob thanks for calling in and we'll be joined in the next segment by Dr Robyn McDougal Virginia Commonwealth university Wilder school joined us\nWhat do you think his\nFuture in Virginia Republican Party is he wouldn't have lost two statewide races and one nominating convention a bug in this hypothetical what has gotten better than some people anticipated certainly\nDid collect the primary does that make him a viable going forward because people will say well he's got a built in base of support in the party\nHas to be reckoned with us or what people say you've had your chance on the stage and you've lost several times so a lot of time to exit\nGreat question Julian thanks for calling and I would suggest that it is dependent upon how well he actually does relative to the national spread and the Virginia\nI'm nor does I think that the the north embrace last year was a point that's a big number if you're a Republican especially because three years before that that Gillespie got within here's Brett them a beating Mark Warner I think if he's in double digit losses it's very difficult for him to\nTo ah to run again a statewide but who knows I Do think the Republican Party is going to be going through some changes are going to look up some soul searching after this election you know um and there'll be looking at a new directions new candidates or to to go forward I don't know how much staying power Korea would have\nWith a double digit loss and I'll just after three statewide offices thanks for calling in\nAny other questions no sir have a good match\nHey uh NBA when you when you do you like they're the warriors or you know my condition it's anybody but the war [laughter] I'm On the throne golden state's in the in the finals or the playoff\nLet's got to be one of a couple of got to be the Boston Celtics looking pretty good who else in the west at\nBoston looks good we'll see what happens with the rockets that they can integrate their new pieces including Carmelo Anthony who a lot of people are down on 'em\nThere's a reason for that although very good what you've ever\nListen I think card Carmelo has his shortcomings but I think the sort of moving up in a recent the bias overlooks a a pretty pretty impressive tenure in the league or despite so much in a recent a sort of downgrade enhanced in his game\nSo we'll see you know and as you know I got some Philadelphia connection so I've always got a soft spot in my heart for the Sixers I'm I'm I'm I'm not sure if they're quite ready to make the leap but we'll see other than anybody by the warriors\nI've I I like the Sixers we used to have a song in\nSomething like that we all these advantage over the shoulders so sort of ingrained in the Seventy Sixers culture back in the day for us to proceed Conan joins you sort of like you too thanks okay as a doctor in the Google patiently waiting for us Yes sir I Am very she is so are you Robert yes\nI Am good they're happy to Lincoln's Birthday by one day [laughter]\nStores are still over by the way\nI exactly I I Will make sure that I make my you know purchase and get it you know drop to your doorstep eight that\nYou know Amazon is pretty much a daily stop at our house so just don't want any order for either in there you go perfect and we look folks if you're listening to it stopped in cardboard boxes whatever the company is publicly traded\nThat makes cardboard boxes that Amazon buys by that stopped because we have so much cardboard box in our garage stacked up after them with a\nGun and we're we're right there with you yet are I'm sure so a doctor Robin McDougal is with the Virginia Commonwealth University ... Wilder school tell us briefly about the Wilder school and what you're doing\nYes so uh we're we're a school of government and public affairs that we see you I'm raising the top fifty I in US News and World Report for schools the public affairs he's got an undergraduate and graduate program focused on criminal justice homeland security and emergency preparedness\nPublic administration as well\nAs programs in the master's level and urban and regional planning and a PHD program and public policy and then we also have our Center for public policy which I direct which areas are consulting and community engagement arm of the work we do it in a while their school so you will see a lot of things around economic\nDevelopment a leadership in training local and state government outreach and things like public policy polling\nI that we deal with in the center for public policy in the wild her school\nWe're going we're coming up pulling real quick but you guys actually go out and work with uh other local governments and businesses that you helped him just not just I think people don't understand that about higher education the value that you bring to the community and the state yes\nWe really do any real dyed\nEverything from looking hoping that localities looking at potentially providing incentives for certain business to come into their community and doing a return on investment of what that economic impact would look like on the proposal stage with regard to incentive then come back and provided them that actual\nEconomic impact if they went forward with a business and the impact that it had on the community with everything from revenue to job creation other\nAspects and that way out we've done valuations of um you know criminal justice program so the implementation of a mental health program or a drug treatment program on reducing recidivism for local jail a or a\nA community partner we worked with a non profit from everything from their evaluations of the programs in projects that they do to our federal court or anything and combining the\nActual help that they need with regards to our students and our staff or with in their community\nLooking at a third party evaluations of programs in projects for the private sector looking into a pitch to the general assembly and need an actual third party non biased evaluation of that work being able to provide that report for that company for the general assembly to look at legislative impacts so\nWe do we are a continual partner\nEvery single day with our local and state governments around the commonwealth um and it it really is what we live and breathe in the wild or school specifically um we do it at a much more\nCost effective rate than our private sector\nCounterparts if you will because it really is our mission or vision and it allows us and Britain that there are\nAcademic expertise is well within the Wilder school you know we have over thirty academic faculty in their area of expertise and you want to talk about the economic impact I've got four economist in our urban and regional planning program or you want to talk about the impact of an opiate program a treatment program I've got to criminal justice or academic\nSee that their area of expertise and they get asked all around\nThe country to look you know present their research and were able to bring that expertise to bear for our localities in the commonwealth in Virginia\nSo whether you're a service higher education schools\nI mean we are we are you know we we provide at all give us your students that we will educate them freshman in college to graduate school in PHD program\nGive us your workers that we will train them in executive leadership and management preparation given your legislators and you're a lobbyist and we will train them and policy analysis on the impact\nOf a variety of on legislation and give us your community that will help you come up with good solutions and then give you the evaluation of the impact on the police shows that we really are um the one stop all encompassing education and consulting\nAcademic arm for a local and state government and our our citizens and students around the common law\nAnd that's when I brought it up and it will go to the polling that your that your operations on there because I think it's so important for people to understand the totality of a lot of things and government especially heritage which has a bull's eye on his back around the country but in Virginia we've got a great higher education system we really need to be proud of it\nUh even though it's you know it's it's appropriate to hold them accountable as tough questions but a lot of things you're talking about art free they are exclusive of of usual operations and they are a complementary to what you are doing and actually facilitate what you were doing in higher education I think it's wonderful I think it's misunderstood not understood at all\nBut most jumping to some polling a that's a while the school has done\nWhat are you seeing out there what have you seen what direction are we going\nWhy don't we talk a little bit like Clinton on earlier so let's talk a little bit about policy and and pulling in public policy that we did on this summer\nWe were out in July will have another poll roll it out right here after the election in November but in our in our public policy arena you talked about higher ed so let's talk about that for a second when we look at\nSo a true representative sample of all five region um\nOf our commonwealth and when we look at and ask people what they think about the value of higher education in Virginia over eighty percent of our responded believed that the community colleges that we haven't\nPredict or work their cost over sixty five percent believes that are public four year institutions are worth the cost and then right under fifty percent believe that our\nPrivate schools and the common welcome worth the cost so it's really important that you said that question around down in Virginia we value\nHigher education and not only do you evaluate but we're putting out a product that comes around the commonwealth bank is age appropriate return on investment they believe that the cost that we have for higher education and forgive me I think everyone can talk about costs in general for higher\n[noise]\nThis hour so I'm

zero to nine four zero six days\nYou know Virginia is blessed and cursed to have important elections every year every year this year we have congressional races Senate race US Senate next year we had the entire general assembly up not the governor entire general assembly all of a sudden it\nForty ... senators forty seven districts than a hundred house districts\nAnd then we go right back into the presidential cycle but the overlay to the general assembly elections\nThere's going to be the elections for denominations of the Republican Party in the Democratic party leading those conversations are gonna be Iowa New Hampshire and South Carolina and it was a part of\nOur educational approach here I'm an executive director Virginia free foundation research economic the economic education a is to better inform the electric chair Virginia it's elected officials and business leaders and a part of that is our next guest who is joining us from\nCredit from ... from how are you good [laughter] some of these ...\nYeah I did I I I uh I have way too much coffee in the morning\n[laughter] you'd be both and I go through a pot I'm I'm not here and I'm no I'm just ready to go Mike what's going on in New Hampshire these days\nWell I'll tell you what we got there we had a couple of presidential candidates running for twenty twenty already here in the last week so ah things are wrapping up\nSo this is only the Democratic side no Republicans have gone up there right\nNo well you know this is talk of course about John ... and or Jeff blank running against Donald Trump for the Republican nomination\nI actually wrote 'em and op ed for uh the statewide paper here in New Hampshire just last week I it's pretty\nSilly to take on Donald Trump I'm a ... you know two years or ... any time a Republican primary where a sitting president has been challenged it's been on the right and um and these guys are be running on the left they really wouldn't have a prayer feeding the president and the Republican primary\nRight now right now that's that's right now anything can happen goodness knows anything\nCan happen or anything of course and especially you know God Forbid the economy collapses\nRight right that's what I was like no one's out there like that but if but if what if mother drops of big weren't things can change All right let's let's shift in the Democratic nomination credit primary where I think we're four hundred and Seventy nine days away something like that from the Democratic primary hamster [laughter] who's counting\nThat's why I think it's I think it's smart crushed for you to to be talking about just stop and because the the presidential stuff as you well know there's there's all kinds of things happening behind the scenes right now\nThis is where it happens right the pros person that I wrote frozen out then [laughter]\nAnd then come the day after November's election candidates start doing things in a more public way but like I said senator a joy\nCan't pay a candidate for governor in New Hampshire and show she's laying the groundwork she's ... and you know she's doing that all across the country and um [noise] ah so she's starting to to put things together\nI'm Alec Baldwin Macy's showy I'm sure you've heard about it to the guy see he's making rounds you think he made his second trip to New Hampshire just this past weekend real\nTwice in the last six months Alec Baldwin Alec Baldwin and he said he has not ruled out running for president\nHe Mike we are making news this morning this was my comment in my producer the show looking at we're making news this morning Steve ball like this one\nBallot Alec Baldwin has um a spoke at the largest fundraiser for the Democratic party in New Hampshire to um uh just last week yeah\nWow see if he ran his old out Baldwin's Jack Ryan you know it's kind of my God yeah [laughter] that was back in the Cold War you know hundred October [laughter] that's right yeah so who else you've seen up in in New Hampshire\nAnd who would you guess to be the front runners in the New Hampshire primary today likely to win the twenty twenty primary in February of next year Europeans\nBernie Sanders Robin for president he will be the front runner okay just no doubt about it now I'm In New Hampshire no during the ... if he doesn't uh Jan Elizabeth Warren will likely be the front runner\nOkay so how about what recently happened with Senator Warren in New Hampshire how does that play with her I mean fumbling of the DNA ancestry ball this week the disasters\nYou know democratic circles I actually don't think it does much a liberal Democrats are going to be looking for a liberal Democrat regardless of facts\n[laughter] you know they they they they face their their choices in and says that soon primarily on emotion and in a\nJesse Harris from a I was just going to do if you heard that\nA very a veteran democratic operative in in Iowa was describing a I'm a so called scene but in reality in the in the Democratic voters the primary butter that they also want to win and they might go you know I don't think Sanders can win nationally I think\nThat that's the I mean I I'm a Republican I think it was a bit worn would have a similar problem\nI don't think she's electable in a in a\nGeneral election nationally nationally okay yeah I I like the open that using DNA issue as an example\nI'm ... and so I thought one thing I Will say though it's a I I don't think it affected her here in New Hampshire I Do think it affected the again the behind the scenes operation\nA and then you know the ... all the maneuvering going on behind the scenes among potential democratic candidates for her to actually take over a news sites all before\n[laughter] who does that why why do I mean if you knew the results of the DNA test and it was counter to your narrative that you're trying to do after you put that thing I miss a day on Christmas [laughter] you Mary that's right you\nKnow I don't understand it so how do you think ah okay so you got Sanders worn just because it's New Hampshire but the other guys have got to go up there and compete or do they have to they might say just say\nYou know I think I Do I think that you know because there's always going to the opportunities and that's as you probably know pressure that I'm Still Clinton made a name for himself by doing well and and coming back to to win at a time when she was losing\nSo you don't have to win the New Hampshire primary to make to make a living wage across the country\nSo especially if it was Elizabeth Warren is the front runner she's from Massachusetts neighboring Massachusetts the candidate who comes in second than even third ah I can get momentum as a result\nYeah because I think Clinton finished third right yeah that's right yeah so\nSo but you have to win place your show in New Hampshire to advance do you have to yeah that's right that is correct and I ended up\nWith I don't think people understand about the the democratic nomination process this cycle is that California has moved up yeah and they're going to happen that's what we spent some snakes and Kamala Harris McConnell Harris is going to have a big lead there\nYes and that's the I think that's going to be the interesting thing I didn't hear you guys talked about this was on the Iowa\nA conversation but what she does in the early primary states will be interesting given the California moved up will she tried will ... will she try and a ... and pick a state to do was to try and do well in all of them and um you know 'cause they're so different types of early primary states pick compared to California\nWell again I think you have to at least try to compete in somebody's because\nThe reality is even though you might not win New Hampshire you won't matter the the the nomination legitimately so\nYou still have to win in the in the electoral college that's right because you can't you can't just blow past Iowa New Hampshire because those are those who have gone in either direction especially with Trump winning Iowa lesson Patrick no doubt about it what issues or drive in New Hampshire voters these days what's going on up there\nWell ... ... uh uh the economy is still the number one issue\nUm the governor here a is a Republican Christian ooh and he's and uh uh with what Donald Trump's been doing it and governor Sununu the economy's booming we have the second lowest unemployment rate in the country\nAnd um or the Democrats don't want to talk about that they're trying to talk about anything but the economy with\nA family you paid leave issue ... they're just trying to make up an issue that might connect with voters authors in the economy so that's going to continue to be number one of the second issue here Chris I I don't know how it how it works in other states you've heard\nDonald Trump even talk about this is the opioid epidemic through a which is pretty\nYeah it's sad but number it's affected our number ... we've had we've had we've had that disease and in our family as well and it's a it's a scourge and at the number of people dying as a result of that as the doors anything else to go to our country and it's going to get a handle on it and I don't think that's part of it as I\nSaid it's not a partisan issue Mike a final protection as what do you think coming out with got thirty seconds punch it when he got further the Democratic nominee or the Democratic finishers in New Hampshire twenty twenty\nI say it's going to go a little of that war any uh well when or if she she's going to win the New Hampshire primary um I\nThink they're going to be I think there's going to be kind of dark horse like a\nA R Cory Booker I expect will be somewhere in the top three um and then and then you know what I I I Would not be surprised if someone like Michael Bloomberg is in ... as well because the Democratic state we need we need to bankroll up a business\nAnd say All right Mike Denny joining us from the Granite State of New Hampshire four hundred and eighty days plus or minus out of the New Hampshire primary thanks for joining us we'll be back on the John Frederick sure this is Chris ... filling in extra next month\nHow how do you know we're not going to let her die waiting on line I mean the nor nor should you should anyone in in politics it's constant but how do you how do you compare the intensity this year to last year where do you see the same similar not as intense when he said well\nSimilar but I think we we're we're very proud particularly in Virginia last year when we send a message to the country into the world that you know hated bigotry have no\nPlace here and that we were open and welcoming for business with the election of governor Northam in his team and then you got that job verse set of a house candidates that got across the finish line that just beautiful tapestry of um of of of our our\nOur candidates that are women and a diverse women and I just eat up so that was that was really great but I think what's happened is\nPeople's realized we have we can do this we can be this and it's just health doubled down and we see for example the search and the absentee balloting I'm In Fairfax\nCounty and Prince William county which our number one and two right now in the state on requests for absentee ballots you know that's good for us that's that's really ... I think we're just at ... you know adding more excitement and enthusiasm\nRight according kid was on earlier seven o'clock hour and he said he's he thinks the turnout is going to be forty to forty five percent that's a large that's a large a range and there but where do you all projecting turn out right now\nWe're just going out there looking for every single vote\nAnd move the mess\nElections which normally a hard but we have a reason to get out there is a lot at stake and um and uh so we're going to be better than your average and it turned out to you know I'm not in the business of of that we're just going to work with just reaching out or we can you're describing\nGrant yeah we're in a G. O. T. V. now face and we are just trying to get out our voters and bring that were anybody else that wants to come\nUp the been impressed with your with your crop of Kansas this year and last year they they definitely worked hard when when that struck me as a sort of an obvious one is that the predominant of the male candidates nominees\nRight if this is definitely the year the woman I like to talk about our women candidates and then I got an e it's any flack of anti night\n[laughter] I mean for what then is is I mean and they're all they have a different kind of experience and diversity but it is all good and at all will be a good refreshing breath\nUm ah for Congress and across some crops at the time the state senator general\nFor West End up there in the camps congressional district off\nWe are really excited about what we see up there on the volunteers are just showing up on non stop and the Washington Post endorsed her which is something that I'm a you know I ... got endorsed every other time when they're very disappointed at her that she's going to stand up to a Donald Trump and\nThat proved not to be the case so her contract Jeff or West was going to be um a congresswoman and then down in uh I'll just run through a real quick if you want to ask me something about him but we will go ... and the second district a retired navy commander in a small business woman and of course\nScott Taylor's got he's adding his own problems with Don\nOr you know trying to cheat and quite frankly and on and and having a staff\nOr put half fraudulent ah signatures on the ballot I mean that's you know that's unheard of stuff that's\nPretty safely and I think the divers are going to reject that but but even that we you know without that we still have a fine you know it's a credible candidate\nWell when I when I've seen in your in your candidates yeah the the er the obviously a female when I think it says regardless of the outcomes and we can\nTalk about polling in outcomes in November and you know according to the got a tailor up and he's got west and up and Coburn and and\nThen the Williams influence in the in the six uh when I think it's sending a single though is that you're going to see even more women in the future running for office regardless of party and I think it's a very healthy dynamic\nYeah yeah and I want to I Want I Want to say two things on that real quick we're really excited that Leslie coverage just got moved into the red to blue um program for the D triple seats but the thing I think you're exactly right and that women women have always um um\nWomen have always and studies show yes but you know then the one that would and I know your mom would agree with me on that she would have\nBeen all over my heart some things don't go\nAway that raise my kids I got to get my\nI guess if you have to say good outcomes of twenty sixteen was when they decided well not waiting anymore we've got to step up you know ... something to offer\nAnd I I think that you we will just seeing more and more of that because someone sad is that what I'm saying and I don't know who was you know if you're not the table you're on the menu and if you look at what is it state this year with women's health care with families ah\nWith just health care in general you know women have a lot to add to that and there I Would I just don't think we're going to step back anymore\nNo no no I don't I don't think you should and I think having the frankly it's not just that they're women but they're but they're in a certain age range to relatively speaking to make up or you know a bit older a little bit younger but for the for the most part you're you're center cut her mom's right the suburban mom is is is a strong voting I Want to say walk but a market\nThat I I think your party is obviously intentionally trying to attract\nCorrect correct and um those suburban mom some of them who voted for Donald Trump\nI think kept seeing the ramifications of that vote and we are reaching out and talking to them and particularly when you take something like the Kavanaugh's nomination where you know set aside the fact\nOf whether you didn't dinner getting delayed doctor for just as a man who temperament we saw back his temperament that is not to be a judge and then add on to it the fact of you know her very compelling tested testimony and on\nAnd and they you know Republicans decided not to believe ought to believe there's going to be some ramifications from that\nUm let's talk about mostly Coburn moving from into the trees the triple C\nA red to blue program oh you're you're making the news here in the John Frederick radio show this morning we've had the other folks make news about nothing on Iowa and Steve bullock is a potential outsider and our job and it never hamster wheels [laughter]\nYou're you're ... three for three more callers here so this is news was recovered is moving into this special category of funding from the D triple C talk about that\nWell we just we just got that information ourselves and that just shows you know that's an open seat we've always thought it was very competitive and uh we we're pleased to see that on the inside the beltway group recognize that\nAs well she's Seventy two thousand miles on her car you know the ... district has\nReally really dig it goes from up in a faulty accounting all the way down to the north Carolina line it's got a lot of different you know Raul but you know it's got Charlottesville area in it to you it's got you know then you've got sort of the D.C suburbs with all care so you got a little bit of everything\nThat she is really a campaign in every part of that district and um and I think that you know here you're sheer it towards the end they sound like you know\nSolve the value in investing more in her\nWell it also says hey they have the resources to do it right well that's a good point too I think that is and if you've seen the articles that you know\nThese are actually out raising 'em a Republican incumbent psyche you look at ... brat versus Abigail Spanberger I think she outraged Kim three don't want to maintain this last um [noise] yes this this recent filing reports\nOn 'em and and you know that that's what we're seeing all across the board\nYeah I think that my my small donations to which is like really gratifying because you had a small diners are the ones that really invest in even show up and knock on doors since Sunday can and put the she let her\nGo I think that's showing up obviously in the polling generic ballot is a little behind where you all were last year at the end of the day\nOr if you just follow the if you just saw those those numbers and the data you probably do quite well election day maybe not as large as soon army that happened in Virginia last year but you know showing up on the ground um I I think the Democrats are going to have another a happy\nDay here again kind of nice to stay\nIn a few days in this

after disasters took it on the chin last night against the Boston Red Sox I turned it off a little bit early I think a turn off in the eighth inning\nAnd uh that living it looked like there was a it was wrapped up there this is ...\nI'm a filling it I Do this occasionally I'm I'm a former member of the Virginia house of delegates I surf from two thousand two to two thousand ten and currently I'm the executive director of Virginia free\nThe foundation for research and economic education Virginia free is a nonpartisan underlined nonpartisan boldly non partisan or a visit pro business out of the advocacy organization here in the comic they're not for Thirty years\nI'm not only are pro business we're also very much a working towards responsible pro business government because as we heard in the in the news updates Mike we heard that that China's economy is slowing down its growth and that's a problem we have a significant debt burden and their economy is slowing its growth down there\nYou know you're trying to like be be that guy and that has that has devolved to where we are today largely as a result of several\nFactors I'm One that the Iraq War out to the collapse of the economy in two thousand and eight and a and that has led to this massive worldwide suspicion of government or what's going on today this unsettled place that we are in this world\nIs not just manifesting itself in the United states we are not alone in this in this in this cultural shift is manifesting itself in politics\nIt's showing up in Hungary in Poland and\nIn Germany over the weekend in Bavaria which is actually I ran into a [laughter]\nThe German political teacher over the weekend fancy that right you're going to exchange program I didn't want to go to the vet and my wife I I really don't want to go with someone was football I Want to chill out Sunday night it was a great game on I'll go you'll have fun okay fine some said it would be to German teachers\nTrying to have a conversation and thinking I don't know any German right what are you going to do ... you know you have all the [laughter] house Hitler\nBig beautiful English but he probably better than than we do structurally\nAnd um and I and I said said oh how are the electricity in Bulgaria because they're very ... and they're like says on Sunday it was a very important election in Germany\nThat's the kind of guy and that's what I follow and well this one teacher was a teacher of politics so then we went down a rabbit hole two hours later at the dinner table we just we just were chewing up politics\nAnd when he was telling me about the very was\nIs that is extremely successful economically it is the richest region of Germany for falling point like three percent unemployment youth unemployment is extremely low or their school system is set up to get people to work straight away\nUm if if you're like a tenth grade and you're not you don't really want to go to university you know it's a fake it to make it you can go right into a a a trade school and apprentice program and you're gonna get a job and you get a diploma so they get them really it's a very work intensive area they\nThey pride themselves culturally\nOn work and productivity an organization and good government\nRight there it was like a it's not like a shining example of how you would want to have a state or region actually be everyone's employed there was a job\nEverything functions ah and it works well they had this major upset in the very election you know what are you upset about what what could you possibly be that concerned about\nThat you basically blow up this I don't know if they blow it up but had his major upset in the ruling party that had been has been in control\nFor decades last probably the ... and the ruling majority in Bavaria and it was stunning to me to realize that we're not immune from that here here in America so people say you know the economy Republicans are the economy's going so great vote for us\nPeople don't vote on yesterday's news they don't vote on today's news they vote on the future where are we going where what is going to be happening that's my fear that's my concern is wild things are going well you know\nWhat Donald Trump got elected gasoline was about two twenty five a gallon now it's around two eighty or two thousand eight was four dollars a gallon or better but are we getting better are we getting worse you know we hear the China\nNews today about their economy slowing down its growth rate of growth\nAnd that has a factor on the human psyche about how how's it going to manifest itself in my life you see these commercials they're not all about you know skills and here's my dad says there are about this guy's off all she's horrible there ... there but there's no big overriding issue like\nHere's what we're going to do in the future it's just that the other person is really bad therefore they're not going to be good for you um and therefore because the economy's going so well they can hurt the economy I guess this is what they strapped relations and the subconscious\nBut I'm going what is the big driving issue other than obviously Donald Trump\nAnd it's a fascinating time in American politics are what are reasons why I Do what I did because it is so interesting but also to teach people as I used to tell my students I really don't care I really don't care [laughter]\nWhat you think I care that you think if I can encourage\nArticle to dig deeper to challenge themselves\nThey will in turn create a better outcome for the rest of us and I just tell my students I don't care who you vote for I just care that you vote but if you don't vote I understand that's also a vote in itself because you were saying I'm not I'm not doing this I vote none of the above\nAnd it's and that's and that's tabulate in it'll aggregate itself just like a vote will and that people do that doesn't make any sense\nActually it does if you don't show up for something the two political parties going to try to get you to show up next time we're trying to reach out to you in some way shape or form that data point will register\nI tell us through a of a family I was at a baseball game and they were so upset or I just can't stand voting and dump out if they haven't earned your vote don't vote and tell them that you don't put it on social media like he would anyone else anything else so I'm not voting you haven't earned\nMy though you haven't got me off my couch off my duff to go down and say I'm voting for this person you don't register it'll aggregate data\nAnd that rod that collects and is dissected by the political class to determine what they want to do\n'em and they're in that in every election the slang on the undecided voter right the independent voter in October\nIs like oh we're going to stop talking about these issues that motivate our base to a degree are going to focus on these oh I'm really happy to work with the other side received this now\nAnd then certain cats I work with the president's wife shows up the polling independence they may not like President Trump but when they agree with you better work with them to get cars that they just you know all politics is personal not just walk anyway this course actually I'm filling in for John credits if you tuned in to hear me drawing on\nAbout politics go who is this guy\nI'm a former member of the house of delegates I'm filling in for John ... as I Am wants to do a as John is on vacation with his son down in Florida in a baseball tournament a John is a baseball fan by looking as well but he was a pitcher in college and his son Joe Joes a picture\nOf you want to call and ask me some questions love to hear from you\nEight eight eight four five six four six eight eight for you know five six four six eight eight eight for eight oh five six or six or you can taxidermy straight away five four zero to nine four zero six eight zero five four zero\nTo nine four zero six eight zero I'm gonna have some great experts on later today Clinton kid Christopher Newport Jack Wilson for the Republican Party with congressman Rob Wittman\nA doctor Robin McDougal from the Virginia Commonwealth University Wilder school and Jesse Harris from Iowa who's a political operative and uh as as on the Democratic side in from the Republican side from New Hampshire will hear from Mike Dennis ...\nAnd Susan slacker or my good friend from the Shenandoah Valley uh we're I'm Susan for you know gosh early nineties I think\nWhen I started aging yourself there's there isn't\nA Democrat a chair a chair of the Democratic party Virginia from highland county to county I used to represent and they've known citizen for for decades and so we have we have a great friendship and I and I'm looking forward to having all these callers calling today and stir up the conversation a little big go a little deeper we're going deeper today in politics we're going to go deeper die\nWho are they listening to who are they calling why are they calling because it's a very different when a university does a polling like CRISPR Newport you'll hear ... ... talk about this they start with a very broad universe um and it keeps coming down to a smaller University of actual likely voters\nGermans\nAnd we'll get to that we're getting to the nitty gritty well we'll get you take you do a deeper dive so when you look at the polls when you go to real clear politics which which I spend unfortunately way too much time on 'em I guess it's healthier than other websites right [laughter]\nThis is a healthy Internet\nOr ... or ... you look at these different polls and and you got like that just to just take a look at the uh\nThe polls on the generic ballot it's insane what the what the what we're looking at here pulled up its it's fascinating might generic ballot follow this track plus Democrats plus ... Democrats plus five Democrats plus eleven\nDemocrats plus a lot of Democrats plus one what how do you get there\nSo you say the polling is wrong well pollens always right it's just data you're collecting of the people who call what the differences isn't the methodologies who you're going\nI talked to one leading I'm democratic source and I said okay what's your polling showing me and he said Democrats are around mid low thirties thirty four thirty three percent Thirteen that range Republicans\nWe've never seen self identification for Republicans is while it's around twenty four percent and what used to be you know thirty four thirty four is now\nThirty four twenty four and independents are up around the load of mid forties\nHe goes Republicans have never been lower on self identification but we haven't\nPicked up any of those voters they're all self identifying now as independents that is huge and when you get down to it with people when they understand what's really going on that's when they get more excited more engaged this is Chris X. men feeling for John Frederick eight eight eight forty five six\nHappy birthday I have a beer you know put a picture of his has her brother with this with the Budweiser many that just reminded me so much my friendship and I'm a black how blessed that wants to have it in my life but also\nA what a what a blessing and it's just to be alive right to be able to\nAh just to be experienced at all and I'm Wondering is I I enjoy coming in during his radio show where they get to the hopefully get people excited about politics I'm against it does governor lives it is important\nUh we can't break down we have to work with each other to get good things that we should have the debate though we should have a vibrant vigorous debate that threatened moves the country forward\nUm and we shouldn't be afraid to have that debate but we should have in a in a civil manner and I think today we see it a a lack of civility more and more and that's difficult in my professional life I Am the executive director Virginia free the foundation for research in economic education and uh uh we're probably want to see three see six and we're not partisan\nBlue and I'm like okay for you well you know aren't you might not really I don't have to be actually I'm paid\nNachos [laughter] even better right oh yeah they get healthcare so [laughter]\nWhat we did was we represent businesses and uh we have membership and what we tried to do is educate them on politics and as a former teacher and a former business person my family at a bottle of water business for years old a couple of years ago\nA blessing like um you know I I like getting people excited about learning about politics seeing it differently and what's that yeah that makes me do as aren't even deeper it's like you know when you when you got to teach a subject you better than other subjects they have to really get engaged in the subject\nSo it's an everyday I get to learn more and more about politics it's it's a it's a deep interesting topic because it brings in culture and a economics and history and I was a history major so I I get to bring it altogether because it manifests itself is Andrew Breitbart said the last ... last segment\nYou know culture is down politics is downstream of culture so if you want to impact culture of their politics impact culture first and foremost suffer your culturally don't\nLeader you'll be you'll be a political year give us a call it eight four five six for six we got some great guess calling in today are not just congressman Rob Wittman but also the leaders of the two major parties here in Virginia posters Clinton kid and Robin McDougal and then two operatives one from Iowa\nAnd one from New Hampshire we're only I hate to say this 'cause you've probably second tier the election is already in the midterms we are four hundred and Seventy two days away from the Iowa caucuses [noise]\nFour hundred and Seventy two now it seems like a long time but let's be honest as soon as this election is over you're going to start hearing reports back from Iowa and New Hampshire and we're going to be at the forefront of that we're going to get calls here we're going to shoot up there with us of operatives that Republicans and Democrats\nTo see what's going on the ground I think Trump's got the lock on the nomination you never know you never know you never know goodness knows you never know with Donald Trump because um that that that that's that's who knows what's actually does what he says it says you can do but you never know what's gonna happen around him and I think that's one of the more interesting parts about politics today is because\nHe's brought that dynamic ... max and that sort of it was if you remember from your\nDays in school or or at work you know the leader changes and it's like a substitute teacher what's this going to be like you know you get you get a new boss or whether it's a\nIt's there's just the newness and from\nSince June fifteenth of twenty Fifteen this has been a very different political dynamic\nAre not necessarily unhealthy because it has made us think and react differently and respond differently and I don't think that's necessarily on healthy ah but we do have you ever vigilant to make sure it does not become too unhealthy and I think people are recognizing that we have\nAh some some discourse in this country\nOr that can be improved we can get better at that as a people and how we do that is every day one on one with each other you want to impact politics if you want better representation be better people sort of comes down to um they represent us and if you want them to be better it's up to us to be better so it was\nAnd what to do with these days the generic ballot what I pay attention to first and foremost is what I check every day I'm On the real clear politics they give you the um average of all the different polls and then they break down the individual polls\nI'm now poll should be looking at what are called Elvie is likely voters polling companies should have an understanding of who they imagine they're going to be showing up on election they should have a pretty good handle on may ... began in Virginia about a month ago so that we shouldn't know who's actually voting\nI'm In Virginia in or you can always tell by Arlington 'cause they're they're tabulate in their uh their absentee ballots are some friends of mine who are tracking that to see what kind of a who's voting relative to the last round of elections to see what the intensity is\nBut when you look at the er the averages of the generic ballot them this is why I Do this is why I think that\nIn twenty Seventeen\nWhen governor Ralph Northam defeated at Gillespie he won by eight point nine three percent a point nine three points the generic ballot on that day was nine point one if I'm trying to instruct the class where do you want to\nFollow Fox News Reuters rats mice and CNBC Emerson Maris Quinnipiac Wilder pool poll a crystal Newport which one do you follow follow generic ballot right now because that is that is fairly proximity to what happened\nLast year and the year before and twenty sixteen\nIf you look the generic ballot in twenty sixteen\nIt was very close it was like tied\nAnd Republicans over performed on election day by about a point and they won and the generic congressional ballot\nI'm obviously Trump lost by about three points a nationally three million votes um so that's something to consider when you're saying okay we're just going to go I think I think the the objective view here is look at the generic ballot look at the average and you can pretty much extrapolate where it is right now\nIs election day were held today and because it's on that basis it it takes away the the partisan lines you might have or a would be inclined to\nIf at nine point one percent the dams one by one point nine nine point one point nine that's very close\nAnd they are at seven point six right now it is safe to assume that they will not perform as well as they did and twenty Seventeen but still will win and likely when the house\nOf representatives given the the dynamics in the Senate very different because the individual races\nLikely that Republicans a hold on to the Senate what's the dynamic that if the Democrats have the house and Senate Republicans have Senate\nWhat's going to have the next two years and that's how you can sort of figure out\nWhere this thing is going so that you can understand what you need to do or not to like myself I don't watch cable news so I don't watch broadcast news every papers in the morning ... times Wall Street journal and I get mine on information what's going on in the economy and politics and culture and whatnot\nAnd then leave it alone don't listen to you know the the uh the national\nI've dealt with my eyes I see what's going on and I think most voters do that if you look at the the aggregate numbers of\nYou know the Fox news of the world and the MSNBC is it's a very small subset of the American population but they're that they're the most active voters they are the their the activists so those shows are pretty much you're broadcasting to the activists\nAbout what they want to hear about the massing points that they they they they're supposed to repeat so when you're watching when you go to Facebook\nOr Twitter or Snapchat or Instagram or whatever they're very different social media platforms you see\n\nThe replica repetition of the message and you're like wow I I go to a town hall after I got like a congressional town all my friends you know if there is now in Congress there were ... I watch them and take the questions from the audience is like where do you see them getting information\nIt's fundamentally wrong but they're really upset I mean angry not pleasant not understanding but what do they show up for today show up because they're angry\nThey are concerned but more importantly like anyone else in the world to just want to be heard right how important is that in a conversation to hear what the other person is is really feeling it get down to okay\nWhat is that what what is what is making your data set oh 'cause there's no no no that's that's the operative subject matter [noise] what is triggering this fear and when you get down into the into the nuts and bolts you ... you really can understand\nWhy people do what they do and hopefully get them to a better place than station in life and it's not easy to do but it's a it's it's what we do it in a democracy in the Republican former democracy which we have\nIn America thank God I'm so we can just live more peacefully amongst each other governors self self governance I think it's really important a historical and concepts and I think we've lost sight of that a little bit it's easy to 'em but more importantly it's tougher for folks have pointed out to people that look we can do better\nWe can do better calm down we got this I mean are are you have too many TV channels at night\nDo you have too many options are there are too many restaurants and grocery stores around you is it too good are you afraid you're gonna lose all this to me it's it's crazy how good life isn't suburban America um

because of cell phones this is a question from a from a texture short\nI we're not um we're not having any more difficult at times and we had been having 'em in the years leading up to um today\nSo Virginia is about two thirds cell phone mostly or a cell phone only users and so our sample we we actually draw samples of cell phone numbers and so we do quotas on her cellphone versus landline sample\nSo we basically go into the field with about a two third one third sell for land line split already um and we haven't found our response rate on cell phones to be any different than it has been which is\nNot great um you know people typically aren't taking cell\nPhone calls to do surveys like they were landline calls in the seventies to do surveys show we're not finding\nIt any more difficult than we were already um I Do have colleagues around the country who are finding cell phone number is being blocked more um and and it's driven by this um all of this fishing that's been going on with our cell phone numbers lately\nI Can't remember what my phone number is recall from Idaho\nAnd we we do there are two things that we do to try to help us with that we have to end up by ourselves as Chris rooting for university so we're not we're not an anonymous number or we're not\nI'm an endless number you'll see who we are when we call and then um if you said look put me on your your not call list will put you on our callers and we won't call you back or we don't have to do that because\nYou know according to the federal regulations were doing research academic research for not working we're not getting paid to you know do this we're not making a profit show were considered um researchers were so we don't have to comply with that did not call it when we do keep our own do not call list and if somebody says don't call me I don't want to do surveys\nThen we'll put them on our do not call it so we try to be transparent in that way as well\nWell that's fascinating because most people go ah yeah I'm On on on those do not call with somebody they are because because you are academic nature interesting so your turnout model is showing forty to forty five percent that's interesting because the people I talked to the campaigns are they're hoping is going to be around forty eight\nThat's so that's ah so it depends on who you talk to 'em it could be forty eight um it could be higher I mean so here's the real sort of question that I have in my head right so\nIf there is a big blue wave if there are a lot of voters that are engaged right now who didn't even vote in twenty Seventeen then we're missing them in our survey were not capturing that right and that some of the pushback I got back\nUm what do we want to put out our second district poll showing Taylor leading Luria some Democrats push back and said well you're not even capturing some of the voters that were newly registering and and they're going to vote okay fair enough but we have the luxury in Virginia in in that we had a twenty Seventeen election that we think\nMansion Ralph Northam won a second district by four percent first time a Democrat or one that district in about a decade\nSo we think we twenty Seventeen captured that surge\nPretty well but it may be even bigger than and also Republicans may have responded 'em by by engaging their base voters already now you have done that we think we've captured them because they were already voters anyway um but if turnout is higher\nI think it's going to help 'em I don't know that helps one party over the other all the way it might be helpful to Democrats because it might be that extra surge that we might that might be a lot of new voters were not capturing\nSo you ... you you saw the search I called it through suburban tsunami I'm twenty seven ... you saw you saw coming in\nI think you had an aunt yeah we we were we were modeling\n'em in twenty Seventeen like we are likely model this year or what we were doing and twenty Seventeen as we were we were modeling ... the same way but we were also looking for new the registered voters\n'em in twenty Seventeen because of that was that was that surge that was the difference between twenty six you know twenty Seventeen with a lot of the new suburban voters\nUm and so we did see the surgeon twenty Seventeen we all know what it looked like in Virginia and so there's nothing that says to me that that's going to be any less this year than it was in twenty Seventeen and there are things to say to me it might be a little bit bigger than ... than it was and twenty Seventeen and by the way\nIn twenty Seventeen the Republicans were as engaged as as you would want them to be it's just that Democrats were a little bit more engaged\nSo you think it might be even bigger this year\nIt very well could be I don't think it can be much bigger but it very well could be um Democrats in particular are trying to register new voters or they they were until the deadline and Republicans I'm work trying\nTo register new voters as much as they were trying to mobilize their their base voters that are already there so I mean look if both parties it's not likely to be because we don't have a really robust statewide race going on 'em and we have ... competitive congressional races some places and not at other places ... so that's part of the reason I'm thinking forty five\nUm but if it ended up being forty eight it's because there were many there's massive turnout\nGoing on and some of these really competitive congressional races um I don't you know\nIf you're a if you're if you're looking for a competitive state wide great to drive a turnout we just don't have that this year and so that's part of the reason I'm hesitant to say it's going to go as high as for aid but look I've been wrong many times um and I'll be wrong many times in the future\n[laughter] goodness knows that's that's a blessing 'em sock what's the one race not close\nClose um if I you know I did what I find interesting about the statewide races that um it's not close yet you see Tim Kaine campaigning in his ... his campaign campaigning as if it were close he's running ads on on ...\nHe's got a a more for a bit of a formidable candidate that he has and I think there are two things going on I think Tim Kaine needs to send the statement that I've moved beyond twenty sixteen um and and and sort of the difficulties of being the vice presidential candidate on the ticket in twenty sixteen\nBut I think he's also recognizing that in some of these are really close congressional races um if he can pull any coattails um if he can run out any coattails\nIt could be really helpful to democratic candidates downtown and so I think oddly enough Tim Kaine is running a campaign to get reelected to the U.S Senate\nAnd running several congressional campaigns to elect Democrats\nUm in in in some of these competitive races at the same time um any doesn't really have a challenger that has a lot of money but Cory story is all over local talk radio which is where his voters are going to be and so I think we're stewards running the kind of campaign that he needs to run to give voters out given\nUm how difficult situation he hasn't had a little money is\nSo your state wide pulling it\nWe ... we pulled the Senate race several times and then decided it wasn't going to be competitive enough to pull it throughout the a final stretch from Labor Day on and instead decided to pull these congressional races because\nReally for the first time in probably decades and Virginia if if if a hundred and some odd years we've got a lot of a lot of really competitive congressional races going on so we decided to pull the congressional races instead of continuing the pole what doesn't appear to be a very competitive Senate race\nBut we are we're wrapping up here in the segment with which you have a final call here on what the Senate race is going to look like in the day\nWell probably somewhere Fifteen Fifteen ashes my is where my ... I'm at right now it could be a little bit higher could be a little bit lower if it's a little bit lower it's going to some of these congressional races are going to look really good for Republicans are going to be really tight if it's if it's higher if it's closer to twenty\nThan some of these democratic congressional candidates are going to have a better night I think fifty\nSix fifty seven yeah anything moving a libertarian from making an impact and all you\nKnow in a in in in we we anticipated they might given that that you know a lot of country club Republicans might not be interested in Corey Stewart but at the end of the day\nWe're in we're in a very tribal period of our politics and if there's an hour by your name a lot of Republicans are going to just vote for that are and not actually give 'em the libertarian their their vote so we don't see any uptick I'm I'm among libertarian candidates either state wide or\nIn these congressional races um there's a libertarian and attempt there's libertarian the seven we're not seeing any uptick with either one of them\nOkay thanks Clinton kids going in was like an opportunity last a Libertarian Party they had a chance to to crack the rocket marking her a little bit in Virginia they might have fallen short this is Chris accident filling in for the vacation and John front next couple of them back\nJohnny who's the newly elected chairman of the Republican Party of Virginia jak our this morning\nI'm doing well Chris I Hope you're doing well\nThere's not a third day this week we've seen each other I Know I think you're stalking me around stalking you haven't figured it out yeah let's not go there [laughter] you're the elected right now so ah you know if you heard the last second was Clinton kid from Christopher Newport or are you seeing anything different than what Dr kids seen out there\nWhen I heard that the the the back end of his\nUm interview and not you know I I sort of got the sense from a discussion that perhaps he seen more of a blue wave that I'm seeing I'm you know I'm In regular contact with all our congressional campaigns um throughout the commonwealth and frankly most of them are doing really well um\nAnd I I Will be a surprise if it doesn't really come down to perhaps just two and a congressional districts being really in play when we get to election night to just to which too\nI think you have the seventh and the tents clearly are the two battlegrounds right now I think the other ones that perhaps people are looking at are the fast but I think Denver Riggleman is clearly running a far superior campaign there and so I think Denver a\nWill ah will be fine come election night there had been some talk Scott Taylor's race scotch really working hard um I mean perhaps we'll be closer than we otherwise would hope but I think at the end of the day Scott should be fine as well so\nThat's where it comes back down to Barbara Comstock in the tens 'em and Dave Brat and establish this way I see at this point\nTo act as a conductor kid he didn't mention Nebraska spanberger racing I live in a district I see it every day at least in western in Rico county and\nThere's a stark difference in what's going on the ground at least but I I pulled back a tragedy object to follow the data if you follow the data that Clinton kids right in falling what you're saying\nUm the Taylor and ... are the ones that are most important as far as you know changing I'm changing party right if they're accurate or you've got to tell my seven and Tom struck down by half a decade or nine times like that\nSo if that's consistent than his polling is accurate um it would probably show up if you if you see that they weren't on bread spanberger I Would imagine that he would\nBut he also pointed out obviously the quality of the candidates important local issues are important but also what do you pointed out was he didn't see the big Kavanaugh kicker or\nThat every once in a talking about this is going to have this big search for Republicans or if it is it's pretty quiet people make up their mind just going to vote\nAnd as he said Republicans are show up in midterms\nWell and and I sort of see the latter I mean obviously what I'm looking at his anecdotally um but during the uh prior to the to the judge now justice Kavanaugh hearings um there was some um\nApathy on the part of the Republican base um but that changed almost immediately uh with those hearings and I think the Republican base in Virginia and I think the Republican base around the country saw what a Democrat majority in the United states\nLook like constant um investigations calls for impeachment set a precedent investigations of justice Kavanaugh\nAnd so what I saw as a state party chair with a clear\nUp tick and enthusiasm response or the emails fundraising jump significantly as a result of that and I'm as it's been said before if somebody's going to write a check or send some money to the party or a candidate they're more likely to vote for that person as well so\nIt may not be showing up in the polls quite yet but I Believe that there is a renewed enthusiasm they're clearly wasn't enthusiasm gap between the Republicans and Democrats prior to the Kavanaugh hearings but I think that gap spin eliminated so now it's just a matter of turning our folks out\nSo you're seeing the enthusiasm kick up I talked to Morgan Griffith about a week and a half ago and he said the same thing\nYou know it was a if you were doing a scale of one to ten ten men you know absolutely out of their mind showing up no matter what a he said you know Democrats were around Ninety and my folks around thirty said but my folks are now up around eighty so he he he sensed that he felt on the ground inclined told me the same thing\nOr so from the anecdotal standpoint I Do think there is a renewed a fervor in the in the Republican base that quite frankly is getting a lot of what they want it in the last election as part of the hardest thing in politics you know\nYou know when you get what you want to show up are you satisfied or you know you're fat and happy new stay home because things are going pretty well but what's the point\nUh but I think that the cabinet things sort of re energized refocused or at least the Republican base on uh wanting to come out and vote but you're seeing that throughout the state\nI Am and I and I think you know again what I think that folks realize you're right I mean it was a got what they wanted and twenty sixteen we have the president and acting tax cuts the economy's booming lowest out on climate and and decades and so that was probably some complacency in that but then I think now the Republican base sees\nAll that can get on done very quickly what the Democrats control the house and Senate and so I think Republicans are saying we've got to roll up our sleeves and if we want to keep what we've got we've got to go to the polls and vote for it\nUsually the cycle of politics right so what as the new chairman of the Republican Party in Virginia ah what is the next step for RPG where are you all go and what should Republicans in Virginia Beach got\nBecause when you look at Virginia and Maryland you have to you she was very strange electorate you have a democratic Maryland with a Republican governor who looks like he's going to win three Fifteen and twenty points in Virginia which has been a battleground trending now towards a blue state\nTim Kaine Clinton get things who's gonna win by Fifteen offers probably maybe twenty points as well you didn't really do have this dichotomy don't you across the Potomac were where the the the dynamics of politics a change in Massachusetts has a Republican governor\nOr who's up polling are the leading Democrats in the state you know Charlie Baker you have a governor a Republican governor of Illinois\nUm is is is the ... other Republicans in Virginia sit right for the electric\nWell I I think what you're saying I I don't know that in our current climate in Virginia whether any of the three candidates\nVirginia right now but I think what we're recognizing and I and I've sort of sense to perhaps a more pragmatic approach among Republicans I'm again coming out of the Kavanaugh hearings um\nUh somebody you know six months ago had mentioned you know Susan Collins and Lindsey Graham being I'm sort of a stalwarts of the Republican Party people to laugh but now I'm getting request is how can we bring Lindsey Graham in to speak in Virginia for candidates and and have him as a featured speaker and places it's so\nI think the Kavanaugh hearings may have shown that what we need to do is have a broader based in the Republican Party that can bring conservatives to gather around core principles and perhaps uh if we can agree on eighty percent of the issues we can disagree on the other twenty later on after we start winning again\n[laughter] again the cycle because look both parties are having their their ah Internet signed battles were I mean the Democrats have their own battles are Republicans are having their battles were going to have some posters\nAnd that pollsters are some operatives from Iowa New Hampshire calling nine o'clock hour should listen to that we have one calling in from a Democrat from Iowa Republicans New Hampshire and tell us what's going on there are said to the national caucuses because it was really what they are when we're\nOnly actually I don't have time to worry about that I Do kind of holding out for delegates who said set it up for reelection but there's nothing that worried about twenty twenty after we win and preserve our ... and the house and Senate next year in Virginia and the\nGently push back here because the dominant theme in American politics is what's going on in Washington DC and it's being reflected back in in the states and then the local to the districts because Trump is the issue right now since\nSince June fifteenth of twenty Fifteen that man has driven the conversation every day in American politics and if you know four hundred and Seventy two days away from from the Iowa caucuses people are going to be focusing on those issues\nBut it's going to get very retail very quickly why all the Virginia races are going on and that's the beauty and the dynamic of Virginia politics isn't it because we are we are the pulse we take the temperature all the time\n... that's exactly right and I think\nUm for our congressional candidates this year I think uh last year gave them sort of a wake up call and they can say OK perhaps raptor roll up our sleeves and work much harder than we thought we were going to have to and so\nUm you're right that this year will sort of perhaps give us a preview of what we can expect in twenty Nineteen but that will be a sort of a pulse of the of the country as you say\nBecause we have the entire general assembly up this time next year ... all one hundred and forty members of the districts in the general assembly are going to be up for election and there's so many issues at play and what Clinton kid was talking about what he's seeing in his polling is a\nQuality candidates matter and local issues matter I got an email last night from a former colleague of mine talking about Corey in northern Virginia and uh basically local development and he was engaged and he also sends out emails on traffic patterns and ... and I'm like\nThis is not what you do in the general assembly but if that's what the voters want they want someone talking about right\nI I think that's right people are really looking for results from their elected officials in the things that are impacting most people today with a booming economy\nPeople are looking at some of those other issues that impact them on a daily basis traffic and tolls up at northern Virginia and as you say bottles and and in more rural areas of the country those are things that people are focused on now
