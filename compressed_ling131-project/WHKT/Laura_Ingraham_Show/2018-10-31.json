out of the campaign let Trump be trumped by former today would it be dull your Amazon wherever you want it's your favorite book store on line let Trump Trump got a new one coming out in November twenty second I Can't wait to read it\nTrumps enemies I I'm not in that book is I'm not an enemy so I Can't I'm not going to find my name and their facts I mean on the trucks biggest supporters for when that comes out pouring off yesterday over the weekend it's a horrible shooting at the synagogues\nAnd we've got these pipe bombs that's crazy crazy people doing crazy things the fake news the Washington Post runs an editorial basically blaming Trump for all of this ah number one what is your reaction to this\nTo me and you know I I Do want to give a little credits to some of the media outlets\nOver this weekend to call out the Washington Post on there disgusting dental your editorial put their head language appeared on Saturday\nMorning blamed little Trump or for the pipe bomb issues and you look Chris\nWallace from Fox News held\nUp the newspaper it was it was the lead story on Saturday morning and Chris showed it on Sunday and it set you know Trump supporter you know it's it's farming whatever it was it's amazing to me the the trail of some of the members of the mainstream\nMedia who want to blame the president for things that he has nothing to do with I don't ever recall I Do not trying to pass the buck up or diverged here but I don't ever recall them saying you know Bernie Sanders supporter mowed down tried to kill two hundred members of Congress at a congressional baseball practice or you know you don't see that you\nDidn't see and I'm disgusted by this but the individual who committed these heinous crimes with a synagogue or is it works after made these crimes what the Trump hater you don't see Democrats support our permits atrocity synagogue\nAs the headlines for the media wants to go after this president for all the wrong reasons they don't want to give them credit and then there are some level responsible for the headlines and the editorials are great print\nDriving a narrative which has virtually all against the president and and it's shameful and they need to be held accountable to and I hope that the American people do that\nWell I'm not sure if they will but look I go to those press conferences as you know I'm a White House correspondent\nI was there yesterday and the questions you get from some of the media the fake news media and the front row especially CNN is just it's just ridiculous and um that's just\nPart of the problem is out of ten questions you're going to get three that are legitimate all the others are just too embarrassed to president or shall something out or some other such nonsense um now you have the bombings a pipe bomb a\nCrazy guy that got arrested you had a horrible shooting in the synagogue is you know the president and the first way to go into Pittsburgh today this the right thing to do a lot of people telling me smoke\nAnd I maybe it's the president's rhetoric and that's a\nThem and that's and the Republicans I've had a true or false\nNot ... it's false as a matter of fact our country\nIs going to become stronger after a national tragedy\nIt always does and what I have called for this last week said again is we need to be able to disagree with each other but not be disagreeable the president is the controller and chief he and the\nFirst lady as well as his daughter and son in law who happened to be Jewish are going to Pittsburgh today to be part of the the comforting process for those families who were impacted by this in the nation as a whole we can never tolerate this but this is where the president\nIs his strongest when he sees something goes wrong he doesn't look at Republican or Democrat independent black white yellow green it doesn't matter he just wants to fix it and what took place in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania was horrific display of\nAtrocity in anti Semitism which will never be\nTolerated by anyone in this country should never be tolerated by new in this country and the president's going to go there and remind the world of why we're the greatest country we are going to be nice when tragedy happens he's going to be a he is the president of everybody in this\nCountry and toning down the rhetoric is important\nWe have a very important election in seven days but no election is worth what is taking place in issues like that synagogue or attempting to have\nPipe bomb killed elected a former elected officials where the greatest country in the world were not a banana republic we need to understand that we are better when we are stronger and we are gathered and that's the presents to talk about um Pittsburgh\nWhere it was horrible and down the senior advisor for the vice president's political action committee now great America too many you get more information or just go to great America committee dot com Corey I've got about\nOr the president in an interview with actually as we understand last night said that he is ready to do an executive order to stop a birthright citizenship see I grew baby idea lot a lot of us have been saying that's one of the biggest problems we have an immigration website you\nLook at it is an issue with immigration are unfortunately I don't think the president has the legal authority or a issue to amend the constitution and the United states and what will happen\nIs that my gas in ... which is what took place when he issued other executive orders is a sort of a ... a court is going to step into going to put a stay on it immediately and I'm sure the White House has already thought through what the legal challenges are going to be to this and ultimately this is going to end up\nBeing litigated at the Supreme Court at the highest levels of the land and they're going to make a decision but that decision will not be reached in the next seven days or ... return the next three months but the president and his team a White House counsel et cetera believe that there was a cork in the amendments that says that\nThey the individual was born here are subjected to the laws of a of the country that theory ... and there was a cork there that says these people here illegally so they're not\nGiven citizenship through birthright\nOr will it will make you like it [noise] but I don't live in this will be\nOr it was [noise] All right All right I think that's exactly it we've got seven days or want to thank you for being with us thank you so much Corey

think\nThis is going to come down to like I really slim majority one way or the other side to that right now it's going to be five seats are less for either party that whichever party wins this is going to be very very close election\nOn November that shaped by eight could very well could go to the Democrats it very well could you can't I don't know yet or not for best thing to be a prop prophesied person here right like I'm not trying to be a prophet like the rest of the pundits and posters of what they're all losers and they all or none of them know what they're talking about\nBut the point is is that this is very close ah there if\nRepublicans do hang on for South the expectation that's been set by the media by the political class by the Democrats AS Nancy Pelosi made very clear on Kobe or last night and actually has done in in so many different other interviews over the course in the past several months the expectation is the Democrats are taking the majority is even buy a\nSeat in the fall short of that\nThat is a massive loss for the Democratic party for the resistance to President Trump\nAnd even massive waiting for President Trump is Republicans hold on it's by even by one seat or even a few more than that what would happen here is is it eighty three shot in the arm for President Trump going into his reelection\nThen we're going to see twenty something Democrats running for president in two thousand twenty tear each other apart they're going to rip their party to President Trump's going to be able to move\nForward with bottle way more Republicans\nIn the Senate because on the Senate side of things things are looking really good for the ... right now so we're seeing Republicans will probably have at least fifty four maybe as many as fifty seven or more seats in the Senate after the midterm election uh uh\nSo if they get to that place where they've got fifty five fifty six something like that in the Senate and they hold\nTheir house majority we're going to be able to see President Trump do things on it even more than what he's done the first two years\nHe says he's going to have allies in Congress because not only is he going to have a stronger Republican Congress on both sides of Capitol Hill where do you have Republicans who were wronged gr inside the party have guys like guys like Paul Ryan and Jeff Flake Bob\nCorker they're leaving these people that are that have been criticizing President Trump grabbing its agenda do a hall from\nInside the Republican Party they're not coming back instead we're getting people like Kevin McCarthy been doing a lot I I'll be honest with you the charter leaders how he's been doing everything we can to help the president get the wall right rain like we're we're Ryan has been banned but ketamine is well\nI'll give him an enormous amount of credit on that front I ... I could tell you Kevin trying to get to walk it two or three ... you know we're getting we're getting Marsha Blackburn instead of Bob Corker we're going to get Martin makes jelly instead of a Jeff Flake and in Arizona all these are operating\nInside the Republican Party so we're seeing the Republican Party move more in the president's direction but if you're able to hang on and he was majorities it hang on to the majority of the house and get to that place where they got fifty bucks\nIf you think they're going to be a little role the Senate Democrats in in it 'cause that's where the problem right we can't get legislation through\nI saw it on the issues right to the point is\nIs that if we can get to the place where you have to fight it can be very roll the Democrats are going to be able to jam them with so many major piece of legislation I guarantee you that the government down or something on Wall funding at that point rain like we thought well that went for him that earlier this year it's not going to go so well for them now\nBut the point is that the opportunity to end with the Republican you hold on [noise] well\nAnd it's gonna be it's going to signal really uh the total breakdown\nOf the resistance of the Democratic party you're right if the Republicans hold the house by two votes and\nI think I agree with you might have been saying all along the ... they're going to pick up five maybe six seats in the U.S Senate I'm predicting five I don't think they're going to win mansion seeing so I think you're going to win five states I'm going to switch\nParties and I mean yeah and I came back after he voted for Brett Kavanaugh\nI mean that might happen just that's like like if the Republicans one by one or the Democrats went by one only need as one person to be promised you know chairman of appropriations or something and they switch parties and you know we've seen that\nHappen I mean it could be a device can be a divided has it if it's if it's if it's somebody slips flips over its its tights there's all kinds of things that can happen I don't think that that will be the scenario but um\nI tell you what for my a legacy media friends are those in CNN I'm going to have to go to New York that night and the lock the windows because the people will be jumping out of I don't know what they're going to do I mean what is it what is the legacy media I've only got a minute what are they going to do with the Republicans hang\nI mean [laughter] forward continued behavior they've been awful throughout this entire presidency they've been awful through the campaign emptied out who's sixteen there needs to be changes to the way the media operate they need to stop the stay here and they're going to change it all by\nThe time John Silver's radio network ... thanks\nMatt boiled for being with us great recap Matt thank you know he was the political editor and\nOf Breitbart News download their apple do to Breitbart News at the app store or a\nRead their site every day that's what I Do ... games dot coms they've also got a great now since they're up to ten closest hottest races in the house are going to decide who's in control\nKevin McCarthy someone else on the Republican side or polo see waving that gamble John trappings radio network we got Sam Nunberg coming up somewhere running around\nWith the bad but it right here [noise]\n\nOne Mike here on the president's a decision yesterday to basically go for any record of order and challenge to that and get rid of anchor babies which is a real problem in the U.S ...

with John McCain winning twenty Thirteen we passed legislation that would have provided an additional twenty thousand border agents to the border\nIn regards to birthright citizenship that the

thank goodness we're finally\nRecording what about electric on very quickly the question was about legislation about birthright citizenship would you support it or not\nI wait and see what the discussion on it\nGoing to report it or not read the legislation is\nThe reason is has been around a long time it's in the constitution of the United states is the fourteenth amendment the guiding document of our nation I voted three times for border well security but here's the thing this is an issue you have\nTo have bipartisan support for I have shifted pieces of legislation with a Republican partner every single time and I can't even have a single Democrat but\nOur leadership we're tending to it the senators that you're going to vote with the president he never vote for them on

what a vice president Pence commented on that she said we all cherish the fourteenth amendment would appear to suggest that the administration of opening if Trump issued an executive order the vice president's sad at the event on Tuesday he said\nThis is from the Supreme Court or the United states has never ruled on whether or not the language of the fourteenth amendment subject to the jurisdiction there\nOf applies specifically to people who are in the country\nIllegally that's the opening that's a little poll that's what the person's going to take advantage\nOf it that's why we elected him to stop crazy crap that goes on in the United states like birthright citizenship that makes absolutely no sense yet when they come into the country illegally let me break all your laws let me not follow any laws let me illiterate I let me work illegally literally we do everything illegally then they have\nAnd all the legal and oh by the way taxpayers take care now with me at my

goes on here\nOur kids the phone lines a day and age\nMurray good to have you\nHi thank you for taking my call I'm not quite as it's not something that can be taken care of a constitutional convention and hot and then my second question is is\nSupport you know not allowing people to become citizens they turn their children have come here illegally were door for the Democratic party to change the constitution or maybe they inning per Second Amendment which confront right to arms and I'm going to hang up and listen tearing it\nOK number one number one a Murray thank you for the that's a great question about\nIn favor of a constitutional convention I Know many conservatives are they think that's the only way to get a balanced budget uh it just opens up the door for all kinds of crazy stuff like getting rid of the second amendment so I'm and no uh\nI had no way in favor of any constitutional convention because you don't know where it ends up and so I'm not in favor of what I Am in\nOf though is this executive order because there is a loophole and it's going to end\nUp in the Supreme Court and then you've got to find out if the\nKavanaugh flight was worth it or not birthright citizenship for the U.S is judges do longer makes any sense what is being exploited by illegal aliens who break the law it's just being exploited it was in there for a reason that reason it's passed it was in the Eighteen hundreds of God\nThere's a ... there was a Republican for reasons\nThat loophole was put\nThere that wording was put there for a reason that the reason was something like this so it's going to be it's it's going to be an executive order or there's\nGot to be five judges that immediately stop at the happiest day it's going to get argued up the court system it's going to go to the Supreme Court and they're going to decide and basically you're going to need five chores to say yes this wording that was there was in there came a\n... there has to be an exception I think exception is going to be for illegal alliums I mean if you just think it's a logically you broke the law it again in the\nCountry you're here illegally or a lawbreaker and now the incentive is to have a baby so that made me as a citizen and then you can be a citizen and then all your family could come over and they can all be citizens and\nYou don't even have to have a job you don't even have to work now how does that make sense it's illogical illogical that this was an issue that I bet you know what does it matter what the polling numbers sites poster calls up a\nIf someone's born in the United states do you think they should be a citizen well yes thirty percent of Americans are in favor of birthright citizenship but that's because you have to question it would be called up and said

Clarke sheriff\nClarke great to have you back ...\nJones was there will be on with you and your listeners once again\nSheriffs so many topics so little time right six days before the ... let's get right to some of the big issues okay let's start with the caravan\nThis just in sheriff says reported by Fox News reporter Griffith Jenkins is reporting a last night that a Mexican states reportedly providing charter buses to drive the migrants\nAnd on Monday and former rush the border jak you're saying\nAnd showing photos that the spouses strong migrant caravan is now being shorter blocks to the U.S border a jacket showed multiple professional Boston's a lie down\nAnd forcing migrants take them to the border so they could get there before the terms what is going at who's paying for that\nWell first of all this abuse that our southern border has got to stop I Believe these reports that are coming out of this has been a political and voice from the beginning this has been a political construct time and time for the November six election but this president has made it very clear he has to remain\nFirm in protecting the southern border from the trust passing this was in the eastern or southern border to national security threat I think the president is handling\nThis just the way you should I\nUsed to working with these other governments Mexican Mexican Government or Guatemala Honduras\nHe's looking at all these options\nAnd that's what he should be doing that sort of executive does that was an executive position as a share of electorate from Milwaukee County when people ask me what should the president do that'll tell nobody should tell the president wants to do what what is it by just to do is give him options three or four policy options give them all the information at the hearing the three or four things that\nYou can consider Mr President here are the pluses of those things here of the minuses\nAnd the president alone as to make this decision and that's what's going to happen\nSo I'm putting my trust him I said in the decision of the president Donald Trump he has a not let us down before this decision making I think he's going to win this thing again\nArcher Clark so ah what the president also sending five thousand troops to the border your sheriff obviously a you were in law enforcement have very long time sheriff Clarke so we have five thousand troops guarding the border twenty two hundred national guardsmen going to the border plus we have our\nOwn border patrol when they get there and what did they do like how do they stop ten thousand people from just coming into what exactly are they going to do why are they there how do they start yeah my question is how do they stop it\nYeah that's an interesting uh innocent interesting question [noise]\nFirst of all the storm the border that's an embrace it and and I'm not going to set up there and say that the military should should fire on them so on and so for those decisions as the commander for me\nBut the fact is you cannot illegally enter the United states do not have a right to come into the United states they can request to come in through asylum but they're violated all the principles of asylum\nAnyone he declared asylum in Mexico they weren't interested because there's little political a construct so sort of means to be seen what they will do I've heard a couple of things mentioned they'll set up some tent cities or you know entertain them until their their\nImmigration hearings because the president's made it very clear to catch and release days are over now there's no doubt in my mind that there are some activists storage will probably already\nHas to be written out of the pro illegal immigration\nFolks on the less we'll run the record\nThe president can do this can stop can't set up in cities and a lot of men and I think at that point\nA push us to come to show because that's an intrusion upon the violation there'll be separation of Powers Act I think it's an intrusion on the authority under the constitution that the president has in these situations so I think and this president has shown that I think he by by throwing out yesterday or a potential into this\nUh this anchor baby situation is birthright citizenship equal\nTo push the issue that's supposed to push the issue\nBecause nobody else well this is the fault of Congress John you know that right this is the fault of Congress's inability or the will to fix this broken immigration system so this is what we have but the president does have some options but I think what he's trying to do and he's trying to force Congress to act\nOn this thing so he'll throw some things out there make the courts get while make Congress getting bothered maybe find him we'll get some action\nOn this but I think that if at some point if the courts to continue to intrude on the executive authority under the constitution I think the president has to push back I don't know how\nThat will be in one form that will take but I think you have to push back\nSo the the er president yesterday sheriff David Clarke so former sheriff over walkie county sheriff Clarke the president yesterday saying look at it this birthright citizenship\nThink makes no sense a lot of people I've been saying that because you end up with the anchor babies now we've got hotel we we've got a whole cottage industry of illegal companies uh\nOn the west coast basically you pay ... coming to the United states so that gets put in a\nHotel hidden do you have a baby and then it becomes an egg or maybe the whole thing makes sense what the president says I was going to do an executive order because there's an opening in the fourteenth amendment now we know that's going to get overturned immediately by the dice says strict in Hawaii and everything else but uh this good as I've gotten Supreme\nCourt where do you think if if if you talk to an average\nPeople um where do you think this is going to fall politically they think average Arab Americans are going to say yes good ideas aggravate me to make some sense or you think you're going to say no I don't want to mess with the fourteenth amendment or that's the constitution that's who we are how do you think it'll fall\nWhile this anchor baby finger birthright citizenship this part of the abuse rights and so this has to be rectified too there's a lot of moving parts in the illegal immigration thing uh so you're just picking these one thing one of the time because you have to solve the whole thing you can't just take one thing and say well we'll fix this will be okay because it won't be okay\nThis is the views of our immigration system the anchor baby situation twenty people will be on the side of the American people will be on the side of the president listen if you look\nAt some of these other immigration issues are securing the border for the wall so on and so forth um this pulls heavily in favor of the president said last one I saw nearly Seventy percent of the people want to southern border security they want an end to this um\nI think the politics of it is going to be spying on American people will be on this side of the\nThings take time for them to work their way through the American public and so I don't know if the anchor baby sing the impact on next Tuesday but I Know that in the long run this president's force Congress to do their job well they're not\nQuestion about that you're either John truckers radio network sure if they record\nWithout they sure Clark hang in there for other
