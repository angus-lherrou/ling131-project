judge Kavanaugh especially now that\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMoney about twenty five percent you know you told us not enough to put a Barbara in a I'm In a competitive position is that the way I understand\nIt well I mean generally that's what I'm saying um the the income breakdown looks very similar to what the district looks like so if you look at age if you look at education if you look at\nAll the basic demographics I think we're accurately reflecting the district pretty well I'm recognizing that Barbara Comstock stronger on the west side of the district in on the eastern started the district it also is the fact that the west side of the district is population is much smaller\nMuch lower than the more urban and suburban eyes the eastern part of the district\nSo one of the question I have is um and I appreciate your coming up because I'm sure it's this this is for normally you know you just say what you're told is I really tried to spend some time on a cigarette out [noise] um\nSo according to your poll Barbara Comstock is leading west and buy one where\nEach of four forty five clock right Colorado barbers winning that group forty five and older is it possible you may have over sampled a younger vote in the ... district [noise]\nUm now if you look at our cross ... if you look at our demographic breakdown our our age [noise] you know here's an email we know what the age distribution of the district is because we know what the voting population is with census data and so\nUm you know we're talking to about twenty five percent of voters who are thirty five an under um Seventy five percent of voters are\nAre ah thirty five an older in uh\nActually eighty percent of voters or thirty five an older so we're not over sampling young voters in a disproportionate to their share of the voting age population in the district um you know the ... looks at the demographics of the survey look look pretty much like what the district looks like um [noise]\nAnd we have we have access to all that sort of data so we we know what the district's gonna look like [noise]\nSo you've also have low approval ratings and the district by President Trump I'm just approved fifty nine percent approved thirty eight percent and along with that\nAlthough you didn't told a Senate race you said that you did ask the question within the district and the change was meeting store or\nIn the tens district by Twenty one fifty five\nTo thirty four which basically is doomsday for short I mean you can't I mean what if I I mean I've said this over and over and over having run the Trump campaign in Virginia in two thousand sixteen I mean we carried south West Virginia five big numbers\nBut when you lose Fairfax [noise] I think we've lost Fairfax Alexandria in Arlington by a hundred and forty four thousand votes right three cities\nAnd Rochefort to make that up you simply can't make it up it's just too many yeah and I\nAnd I think you know you pointed out Trump's approval and you pointed out\nUm the Senate race numbers and we did those uh because we wanted that test really what we think are the two ... two of the big things that are shaping this election in the tent um what kind of headwinds are coming out of Washington\nI'm a related to Donald Trump\nAnd are there are coat tails or lack of coattails were negative coattails when it relates to the Senate race in both\nOf those situations and then Comstock is facing strong headwinds I'm Out of Washington a lot of her constituents aren't happy with the president and what he's doing and what Republicans are doing and Corey Stewart isn't helping in any way in fact he's probably hurting because people who aren't excited about coming out to vote\nFor a Senate race or a half to get excited about their local race and if they're not excited\nAbout their local race are likely not to turn out to vote and you know so that means Republicans who would otherwise be excited about Corey Stewart and aren't Barbara Comstock has to work extra hard to attract their attention to say look you need to come out and vote in this congressional race even if you're not happy about Corey Stewart\nSays something\nJust a kid that you can glean from the polling in the days of spending cuts in district what if you could give up a figure or\nA ballpark to what degree is Corey Corey Stewart on the ballot to what degree is he hurting Harvard's ability to get reelected like if you were putting on a scale of one that's in one day\nMuch tending a yeah big time what would it be based on your readers Paul\nWell probably somewhere below five I'm probably somewhere between two\nAnd five or three and five I mean I think to some extent he's been baked into the to the calculation for ... to ... you know for some voters but I Do think there is it is the case that turnout is typically higher in the U.S Senate race than it is in a local congressional race\nAnd so if you happen to have a U.S Senate race going on in the same year that your local congressional races going on\nAnd you're or Senate candidate is\nWay ahead and you need those coat tails that's good for you and Barbara Comstock doesn't have that this year\nShe's got a candidate who's running behind 'em by anywhere from ... we haven't Twenty one points behind in this district state why he's running behind anywhere Fifteen to twenty points that's not helpful to Comstock it's hurtful to her because she has to work her campaign has to work extra hard\nTo reach out to those voters who would otherwise be engaged because they were engaged for the Senate race she's gotta work extra hard to reach out to them and say look\nI Need you to still be engaged for me and I think that's part of the problems she's having\nSo I think it would be fair to say looking at the numbers [noise] you're probably gonna fly in the same court George drag\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou know from a teaching perspective it was a really interesting place to teach [noise] some of the kids were at local American from northern Virginia but you know it was it was a very interesting place to teach and and\nAnd be the American teacher that all of these diplomatic children had\nThey're kind of point of reference as someone who later went overseas and my colleagues have their kids in American school to bronze you know part of the cultural learning is having the teachers who are local area to teach their language teach their culture um and so it was actually a really interesting experience\nFor me to be kind of American English teacher for a bunch of young kid who many of whom were returning to their countries of origin when their parents diplomatic time in the U.S was over\nSo it sounds like what you're saying it's the job since your\nYour personal and professional situation and you simply thought it would be interesting\nRight now pretty much yeah\nOkay let's get to the for your um your claim that your staff did uphold research on yourself and settle for your request and never got a response back from the government\nYet when you did before you're on your own for yeah thanks forty was never submitted so there's a discrepancy there how do you reconcile that up and go\nFor starters I Would say that ... so we hired and outside an investigator to do a background investigation on me and basically determine what what's the information that someone politically aligned with my opponent would\nGather around me and then you try to use against me and so he eventually tired filed for years\nTo teach for which where I actually worked\nOn the difference with what America Rising did on behalf of the congressional leadership fund as they filed a poor with national personal record center which is a different entities right um\nThe postal inspection service on their website requires that all four years and I've requested all waiters be submitted be a male which is what our individual Dan\nUm and yeah and the response was never received\nBack from us or we've never received anything back\nOver all that didn't look particularly confusing are alerting or problems problematic to me because our only goal is to understand what would be the experience from someone else who was for young man right um\nBut then even though you're claims you did that for you and your response CNN said they could afford it on your four year and there was no record of it so yeah there's also\nThe same entity that release my unrated acted personal national security questionnaire\nUm so I mean at this point\nI have a little I have a little bit less face in the fact that they are following the steps that they should be following I mean they're the real the real issue here is the U.S postal service in violation of federal law the privacy act released my national security questionnaire which is\nA fully protected document use\nIn providing and processing background background investigations and providing clearances and I of course her secret secret\nClearance for my time in law enforcement and top secret clearance when special compartment it to pass as for my time with with the eye and so the violation was when the U.S postal service violated the law by releasing now and then of course later it was distributed and and it's fully unproductive\nFormed by another entity [noise] so are you saying\nThat the spanberger seem absolutely you're saying that you absolutely set to for your request and now you're claiming that based on top of the some of them\nReleasing all of your rejected information it's not a reason to think that they were competing and not being able to find the for you that you also but\nNow I'm actually saying that it's a distraction from the real violation of law and the violation of law occurred when the postal service broke the law by providing my information one of the pieces with a story that's also not reported\nOn is that the national personnel records center actually initially denied the request when we ... that America Rising submitted and um and so there's so many more questions to the situation but really what it boils down to\nIs there is a violation of federal law\nMy national security questionnaire which is the documents that anyone who's speaking as security security clearance spells out and those are not members of our military members of law enforcement numbers or the intelligence community fill out they provide their detailed\nPersonal information not just about themselves but about other people in their lives on very detailed information very personal information\nThat document was released erroneous\nUm document they proceeded to pass it on two numbers of media without taking the steps to protect my Social Security number my medical history any of that [noise]\nWell that was irresponsible no question about it\nSo as far as the information generally do you think it was just in competence by somebody that just didn't know what they were doing or you think there was some kind of a conspiracy\nThere's currently an ongoing investigation and so I I Can't necessarily comment on that topic\nAll right sir and fair enough let's get to the bank\nEurope toner Dave Brat I said well we talked with campaign\nAbout these debates he said that they had not officially committed to end debate beyond the first one in October fifteenth which is going forward on your team put on a very strongly worded statement blasting day for backing out\nSaying that they were supposed to be three debates of course the third debate was with me which hasn't been set so that date has not been said even though I've I've asked about a hundred times\nOut for being scheduled debates I mean were they schedule ...\nYeah so you know he's he's talked on your show about the fact that we've agreed to multiple debates we had identified location we identify to place a our teams have done independent walked through the\nRehab they've done to walk through other location we had told media partners we had the media lined up on a local TV station that was going to [noise]\nTo ...\nEverything was set up the only thing we had set out a press release um and that was something that we had been I'm pushing for a certainly the host and the media partners has been pushing for ultimately then after\nA couple of weeks and and you know John I'm not the ones making the primarily down there but I think it's about two weeks\nOf our team the host and the television station in trying to get\nYou know trying to get approval on how to put out or the wording on we were told that he would no longer be\nCommitted to doing that second debate that we had already detailed and that he would in fact or his team would in fact confirm it on the sixteenth of October whether or not we would in fact to move forward with the with the debate scheduled for the twenty fifth okay so\nAs far as now the debate on the twenty fifth which is which was the second televised debate is not a done deal even though other teams to walk through they want to wait and see how the debate on the fifteenth and I guess\nI mean I'm I'm not going to sign on their their reasoning for wanting to wait until the sixteenth it it\nIt seems like a plausible reason but they they did not\nProvide us with a reason why they want to wait until the sixteenth denouncing farm and you know there's been staffing changes on his team that might have been a contributing factor on science but overall when we set up the parameters of the debate one of the things that was important to argue that we expressed to me was that given that it is a large\nQuite a quite a long distance that it was important to have the ability to have a debate\nYou know throughout the district north\nCenter of the district middle the district in southern portion of districts that individuals would be able to attend on and and that was something that was a priority because now are the first in as of right now the only debate isn't very northern part of the district which I'm pretty place has a pretty significant burden on anyone coming from the southern portion\nOf the district in the center of the district to get to the colpepper particularly given the time of the debate\nRemind them that you know to go to the tickets for that when they sold out within less than a minute right on and there's many many individuals who have reached out to our campaign saying that they tried to get tickets but were unable to do so\nWell and my ... which was the third debate\nGotten a date from Dave team\nThe spanberger team I just want to mention has said that um they ah said that they they have they've given me a bunch of ... to go back to the debate team\nWhen we've not been able to get that done either hopefully we'll get that done in the next week or so okay let's get the judge Kavanaugh you're on the John triggers radio network trucks with truth across America we're with Abigail\nSpanberger she is

with the black seats if they don't have the black I I think that is far weaker today it's an incumbent than probably anybody else to the extreme some personal proclivities and\nAnd and things that I think that hurts him among some of those voters we have some stronger candidates or black or you know I don't know what happens there you got a hundred and fifty thousand in the bank\nSo light doesn't sound like he's ready to go away very quickly but I Will do my advice him and he got nowhere to hold on one of the phone and you want to go out to undefeated not indicted if you could do that\nAnd it gets lost before in ... when the house of delegates any moves over the first district to run for Congress and then he comes back but I don't think you want to injure career because I I think you beat him\nA German some very attractive candidate a you are but you've got some issue ... initial matrix there where he has not really tend to hurt his voting record 'em to that district and you've got to state house at fifty one forty nine into redistricting that's critical happened that made me\nI mean it would appear that the judges are going to wind up throwing that house district as hell eleven house districts and I think that's what whatever formula they come up with\nThat is going to also be what the Senate's going to have to abide by twenty Twenty one and uh it could change or you know it could change an awful lot [noise]\nUm you know a hog the districts are unpacked not totally but below the numbers I mean look what Bobby Scott I'm In his district one from what fifty some fifty six percent down to you know low forties and I'm a [noise]\nYou know produced another democratic district so you're gonna have to see how that plays out but it seems to me\nThat uh the judges drawing that district is by far and away their their best bet and if they do you know Supreme Court I think it ruled before the gerrymandering is is it has been constitutionally permissible until spills over in\nRacial discrimination and therein lies the problem and that's what the Republicans are facing there and it's going to change its going to change the way you know a whole makeup of legislatures around the country or is going to court for a five to four court\nWill do this differently the boss of the records and they send it back if I may be wrong but I think when they sent it back to the lower court it was like seven to one\nNationally but I I just think one of the thing is you can understand the Republican base for better for worse is migrated from your country club the country you're in so doing they take your self out of some competitive districts were these were economic issues you'll be very viable [noise]\nSo it's not just the demographics ignore the fact that things have changed the emphasis on issues in ways that help them in South West Virginia robbery but but it hurts them in the growing part\nCan we talk about the ... and also with a very popular governor with very low negative and you look at ... numbers antenna McConnell had a lot of support amongst Democrats\nWas not popular among Republicans was more polarizing and her numbers Ralph Northam has incredibly low negatives\nFor somebody in this environment you look nationally um he has very high positive very low negatives\nUm and in going into these competitive seats [noise]\nUm I remember in ... eleven in Democrats drew the state Senate lines and they lost the majority and who is that the person who was in every Republican TV ad that was flipping seats with Bob McDonnell a in a popular governor can play a big role now and that's a big um item that timetable here\nRan these are still nationalize rates I don't care how you slice of the national environment play on\nYou have to have a messenger more into health breakthrough especially even turn it off the Thomas writes the the I mean it that that national same ways very heavily [noise] you know which is why you've had\nI mean you know what happened for almost fifty year I'm gonna I'm In I'm In his mouth and surveys like let's take for example the start of anti started in ... was not driven by national politics and twenty and it was driven by local politics in Chesterfield versus Richmond and\nI'd like to be democratic um and I think that we and we ... we had a more aggressive Canada but we don't have we had an extra campaigns don't matter yeah yeah I don't think we had to I don't think we had a great message or that I think if you really run that same race in twenty Nineteen\nAt the at me and it was yeah that that's the second time by the way it was what what they can for the wall license away for what they want to send somebody to uh\nTo to make a a a plea bargain for somebody that [laughter] fifty seven\nYear old dating a Seventeen Eighteen year old the Doug\nYou don't think that that's an issue I mean give me a break give me a break\nThat's the problem and Ross one is a pretty good candidate do kids yourself\n[noise] she's well liked well he ... he can say this is my children didn't like him huh I mean you have four children she's like oh you know I oh well that's wonderful and before that\nBefore that yeah what about what about the other ones before that you know I mean it's\nWho can I don't want to get married and I don't know that those issues plays marching down and we were talking about but you know you are talking about white men white male taking on a black woman in Oregon and her jewelry while I'm disregarding like\nIn ... and ... it with a ... white man who I think got two percent of the white vote or something and the rich and mayor's race about forty percent of the button to just do the right\nOr wrong as either I agree but now he's taken on income that we are not entirely different that\nI don't know I tell you what man I I joke joke kind of Peter ... you can't underestimate Morsi and I'm telling you what he had a disastrous\nPress conference I wasn't there and it was a disaster of all time so he had the disastrous press conference that really hurt him all kinds of underhanded things going on but you know after\nMorsi's mayor and and you know the the thing about Joe is he's an independent thinker he's got to go is the only way he's a you know he's not he's not a whole bunch of any of the establishment caucuses or anything like that\nI think he's gonna play very well in that district and I think a lot of\nOf friends there that I Know I'm thinking he got screwed by what they did to him and and you\nAdd to the gym or she did the smartest thing I've ever seen anyone doing politics when he won the was it was ... he won mceachin see on each and moved up I think [noise] and\nAnd that's where people are asking what did he do he went around and after he knocked on doors at you know and I wrote a handwritten note to every voter he spoke to [noise] but David it for a week and a half before the election in the context rather that he had remembered the conversation\n... kept these postcards for six months and send them all out ten days before the election with a handwritten note from him talking about how their conversation and you know I met your dog Sam or you're a teacher here and I remember that conversation and do you know hope I can count on your support next Tuesday and people\nCame out in droves I mean for him to go do that though and I see people read postcards but I've never seen one posting them to make it appear as ... months later okay well Tony I'm Tom Davis does everything better than anyone in politics\nLater but [noise] but he did that at any one in a landslide and like it's been done before\nIt really I don't underestimate your understanding taken on income district like ideas in its appeal or not I I'm not going to be four or five people in that race either\nGonna just to ... that's the big difference you know if we'd had you know there's a whole lot of people have gotten in the journal suddenly because we don't have run off\nIn the state a whole and and you won't have that you'll just have to people in there\nAnd she's well why [noise]\nI don't think I if I had the gas and I I can be totally wrong with the Taliban that district and I guess that route dams have extremely low name id pardon\nI Would guess the Rocky Mountain extremely low name id and that if you tested there Jim or signing me that the state of the palm pilot I'm just ... but like in terms of I'd name id Richard Nixon had our name on\n[laughter] you know I mean I like I don't think rises like the superstar in the Senate\nBack on you know Joe and I know Joe\nAnd it's got to get out out work something like Fifteen or twenty to one okay Joe without their knocking on doors are making phone calls now will just\nBetween the fastball primary too in that primary like Dick with independent district for Twenty years before he got drawn to safety is actually has a concept of campaigning and knocking on doors and doing the things that you do when you're in a competitive political race\nFor Seventy percent of the ... my district Mondale yeah Ross dance and never\nBeen a federation of lights on for ever Confederate says she's never been\nOf you got to ask you before and she's got to get out work I'm a joke that out worker he's fighting Joe he's gotta he's gotta worker and\nIs I don't get I'm telling you he was going to get a tip that there's that step of the boat out there for the fact\nThat the power banks enrichment screwed this guy out of his livelihood and that's that's real I mean he got screwed I mean what he did the political or why it looks senator Stanley told me the whole thing is I ... it was bullshit\n[noise] [noise] [noise]\nIt was blown okay [laughter] what happened there was a total bologna and it was because uh it it was it was the call\nThat's why they pulled up and so I I just I'll come November that\nLike you know there are a lot of people in that area that have [noise] and and this is a loyalty to Joe ...\nThe reason he does well in a lot of people there that is represented and when families have had a time of need you know the attorney they went to the criminal defense attorney to help out someone in their family and there was Joe Morsi and that created the level of loyalty he has a ... I\nI'm not ready to call this one one way or the other yet but um he has a real ... it's it's across that district if I'm being an attorney [noise] I'm In the same way that Donald McEachin you know when he when he ran rubber on his running\nYou know even as a primary challenger ... three times two incumbents are twice twice as the challenger don't come in Delhi gets then one to the challenger dot com and senator\nAnd and the kitchen was the guy who everyone news on TV it was a lawyer um he had help so many people in the community it didn't matter that he was a challenger to encounter um that's how they ... him how much they thought he was the income right and and do more see I mean he has helped a lot of people enrolled in those communities where they don't know who to turn to joy Morsi has been the guy\nWho's defending their nephew there's time um you know against major charges that he was one of the top defense attorneys there so I just\nI I I think that it's an interesting race and and and we've got to see you know will rise even run again\nLet me do not let me look ahead to twenty Twenty one the governorship or would've come come through and a lot of um determine who's in the White House as you said that dynamic and so on but when north and grows will the attorney general Montana governor clashes that who else is looking at this point in the Democratic process you are on\nI mean there are name pops up there on that very yellow was not out of the picture either on it now I Would imagine if you're on the you know of course [noise] our [noise] I Would hope that herring terrified [noise] worked out or not to see contested nominations\nAnd you've got a lot of people in the back looking for upward mobility till you get the mayor of Richmond stony you've got some other or just getting her yellow sitting\nThere on you'll have a primary and you'll get that big a successful it can be dangerous is only I think it's only a\n[noise] as long as you don't have a two way right [noise] uh\nBetween Fairfax [noise] uh I think that if a if it's if it's one of them against the whole batch of other people they win [noise] ah you know Fairfax\nCarrying somebody out so I like you guys are talking about\nHerring and a Fairfax you're not talking about ... stony who was absolutely going to do something here's the other person you're not talking about who could pull the upset in a two or three person race and\nThat's kind of like Alexander mayor of from Norfolk right now who in a three way primary\nSky business track record in the mold of hope water businessman McAuliffe business ... daughter in critical why\nThat is ridiculous first of all there's always there's ... as if there's a moderate right or the Democratic primaries anyway for the first piece but the ... there that can interrupt them you're going over there is state\nThey're not going to line up behind Ken I like Kenny good friend but they're going to eat are lined up behind either herring for Fairfax whereabouts telling and I don't even know I don't I don't mean I didn't know that same thing with ... record guy people like him but they're either going to go with one of those too\n[laughter] well how ... going to be a Republican anyway because Trump's going to be gone and Twenty one now is going to win again which I mean first years of presidencies early on\nThe same type of campaign less be a ... year right Republican won't win that governorship you can't ... I'm telling you you know it's disgraceful\nJet Republican ever win again in Virginia\nWell how do you how do they want to learn that probably that's absurd how do they just started going out for\nHow do you count for Hogan how'd you account for Christie how do you account for ... you know in in ... in Massachusetts I mean you know governorships in particular are not parliamentary where people make and you know you know\nAnd um I think that that is a real dilemma for him because he's not I'm a true believer in terms of the Republican base away needs to say but he'll say it and then it doesn't come across well and I think that's what cost and the lieutenant governor's race when it's you know he had to campaign has an arch conservative I don't think he has one\nBut did he ever got nomination I think you'd be very dangerous\nBarbara now she couldn't be done to measure our topic uh what uh what about what we\nWent into the most viable he has a viable electoral base he has a winning record ... I think he bridges are gaps are better than either of the other two women can't be nominated why it why didn't you nominate absolutely cannot be nominated you don't win a primary just got to ... ... ...\n... women could never be nominated state wise to monitor\nWhat uh what about each other I don't making five\nJust don't I don't I I mean he's a kind of a flash\nIn the pan they look at this than I I I I think there are other people with stronger ... Pete doesn't really have a base got money but he doesn't really have a base and you have to have a base somewhere or the biggest problem with Republican voters right now is people who used to vote Republican primary there not Democrats but they're voting Democrat\nIs bringing them out in the ... the doesn't do that um and that's what he would need to get the nomination number one and and uh you get the nomination funny things\n[noise] right right\nAnd I argued wrong party I think to get nominate [noise]\n[laughter] I think I'm gonna I'm gonna do it three three Republican name's Barbara and talk with Tom yeah not going to happen [noise] better ... better\nOr worse than to Tom I don't see that happening here here's the other part of the problem we're Whitman once they use they use the term moderate attack un Republican Party a\nAnd and the nominating process as a moderate you're dead and just ... I mean if they're going to nominate somebody names that you mentioned I don't think we'll be one of the camp [noise] I just don't see [noise]\nFive dollar a minute I gotta get out\nOf Denver recommend\nNow why why don't we not mentioning Tom Davis I Want to run it why would you know we're not we're not talking about when he wants to run or not but like the only way of a more moderate person to win a Republican primary in Virginia right now would be winning big margins northern Virginia of course Stewart won his primary to share with margin in northern Virginia ...\nSo you know that the only one Republican let you go out and go whale large Republican primary victory in northern Virginia to potentially winning when a nomination that's how many [noise] okay finally\nSo uh Tom Davis what about topics\nWere about Tom Davis Tom Davis is one of the original governor very very happy at this point [noise] uh well you got a nomination issue first of all I mean who else is going to be in the mix at this point I mean the one thing I bring you bring out people to vote in the primary would come out otherwise\nAnd I think no Republicans have seen this is a safe way 'cause they're all going after the same folks which are the Corey Stewart voters\nAnd among those voters I'm a dead man rather a starting out and and don't pretend to be otherwise but like I think I had a great run amok I left undefeated in on a diet it's something I'm very proud of and something a fewer and fewer politicians can say and you got to know your time and place and everything and I'm just content with who I Am and you're back in the\nBack in the late in the in the night and maybe in the early to go to the strongest people could put maybe even discussed very much Tom was one you know we're in trouble\nAnd uh you know it's like confidence has nothing to do with it [noise]\nThat settles ladies and gentleman a has nothing to do with that settled that one of the time today but I\nAm unequivocally unabashedly [noise] in our job today was for governor twenty Twenty one I think can be a fabulous candidates [noise]\nOnly for somebody's got to bring us Republican Party back together or even make believe that we have a party maybe you know what the candidates out there Tom Davis corporate money would be the guy to do that Tom I'm all in one of the time of the segment\nWho's gonna win Monday Night Russian Panthers back in St I'm a recovering sex or what I say Panthers Russian saying what's going on the cover\nCounty I think I Can't I Can't go [noise]\nRuptured during the game out right take the points on the radio networks signing up anything else that [noise] my son Justin pitching Jane chair of a of the College Park\nMaryland a championship four games for about starting out for a show more early afternoon at the University of Maryland so yeah we are already on our Catholic grade we can see my friends are all looking\nForward to a different world I think that's an outcome in the same way [noise] nameless down after all the permanent brain damage to play the punk rock Tina down like take any plans are going to a job interview or speaking in preparation is the key to a successful outcome prepare for the gap\nBy just plain everyday prayer brings us closer to God to talk about your team African descent as we speak to your fear\nAnd to keep the peace when we see an expansion team and you're playing and keeps your liver cancer often about\nBeing trained you know the little blue piece [noise] only tracked him I'm Kelly and the political momentum ...

we got lots of coverage today and we talk a little bit about job but obviously what's on everybody's mind as the cabinet\nConfirmation the impact is going to have and then after that and the segment we'll get to Redskins chops now asked rows and everything else about\nSports were going up a restaurant with Tom Davis Tom the the cabinets that you're ...\nYou're very familiar with is making the

didn't the FBI didn't find any cooperation [noise] um so I think through you're going to get the Republican members and probably Joe Manchin a mansion and puts his reelection jeopardy if he does it does at Fort\nThird third party cooperation none but I'm telling you it's somebody else and tried to kinds of cases in court there's a lot different markers or better test maybe we should point to somebody's being credible so I you know talking to the therapist about ten years ago which apparently was documented the therapist notes I mean who the hell puts themselves out there and put themselves through this crap\nUm if it if it didn't happen um I mean what what other motives I don't I don't see why she would\nHave a you know you're just pick somebody based on what just now I didn't connect to anybody but this guy's applying for the highest court in the land is not applying for a job the dominant to deliver pizza and I think the the burden that you have\nIn terms of uh keeping somebody off of a lifetime appointment is entirely different than so anybody can make any allegation ... talking to operation nobody nobody's talking about taking away the guy's liberty and putting them in jail that's a that's a different issue than it is you know it's okay to lie for a Republican\nSaid that Trump would put up somebody can come out and say he did something to me forty years ago I have no evidence no collaboration and that's the\nYeah I didn't say something and said sexual assault which is an entirely different issue and you've got to put yourself in the context of the time and the place and back then in the Nineteen eighties wasn't some people can't afford it don't they don't come for nearly as much today about it they should that they'd back then when I was in high school and I kind of think people in\n... you didn't hear about the right track I look I she but extremely credible I'm just very emotional ... and and I do think that I I think that taking that extra week going back and interviewing some of the people more judge and others around it\nI think it was with the right thing I think slam dunk in the spring or the day after her would have been terrible politics and would have been terrible on these two ships\nHaving said that nobody else can remember the party who was there ... there's just too many holes to really make the case that doesn't mean she's wrong [noise] but but that's a tougher standards for the future you know anybody can come forward and say anything\nTo say that but it just wanting to go back more than six days and remember after she testified Chris Wallace from Fox News and the president to talked about how\nCredible she was an old ... protect everybody right after she testified this is done it's over she's toast and then seven days later without Rob act where we weren't amazing to me how fast the world changes but back to what we're talking about before either we've gotten this cooperation sidebar\nMansions will bless over mentioned I think had him up Fifteen\nThe thing that's that's all the polls you read when they're asking you don't want our new certainly certainly are is partially by\nBy either under fifty ... well well under shift and I and I think what you've got remembering this is if you don't you know an independent in Seoul ... I think this is for him this this changes the outcome of his race\nYeah I I Can't I and I'm not an expert on West Virginia but as things meet Joe Manchin told position that I'm an independent God not beholden to either side and uh\nI think it would be hard for him to get reelected it would seem to me what what a Trump when they buy like fifty point something like that\nAnd I'm not on also not convinced and Susan Collins and going to run again either and I asked that that I think it's all I'm not either but she says\nShe's never voted against the Supreme Court judge ever you have any group in the state that has put a million dollars that they get ... votes against millionaire has spent\nYeah okay now it's up to a million and a half go find me but then it looks like a bribe but I'm I mean I think at the end of the day without corroboration she's going to be there for for for which she I agree with Tom you not only twenty twenty twenty is she going to run again well you should make that decision the appropriate time [noise]\nI I think I think Tom now that I think she is going to vote yes ah the one that I have no read on the top Davis is I'm Lisa Murkowski of\nWhat about what about you [noise]\nPretty independent I mean just remember this when she lost that primary to Joe Miller the last Republican primary she run as a write in with the name Murkowski\nNow where he just felt I ended up and also as you want to know that last letter\nBut you know make the part about the independents feeds and when you guys mentioned when it's because they claim they're they're reelect in terms of looking out for their state right mhm yeah and Murkowski had the big issue with the cabin opinion about Alaskan natives I think it was something\nThat she ... she she she does on on that issue so no I it's not clear cut I haven't seen the polling in Alaska or the but the I think if you get towns like and I think you're going to get flaky booed him out of committee but I think without some ... operation that Jeff Jeff this fundamentally very concerned right\nNow you got to be a little more research to he's also very independent and I think a very principled guy which is why people making flaky because he doesn't always staying in one boxing\nIsn't always predict but less judgeship you've got to understand for Republicans this unites us there's this is a very important building in the court or as it is on the Democrats on the other side a wanting somebody else\nCan I ask you a question has a has a a vice president ever broken a tie on a Supreme Court nominee often or not they're not aware of yeah I think that would be unprecedented at what age [noise]\nBut that can then we'll kind of a challenge that\nBut it's still count how do you know that just their thinking competition just as an advice and consent and there's got to be no ... already on the president than any votes but he's not a member\nI can tell you the satellite Virginia right now three states that are it's not Virginia not managing off [laughter] yeah [laughter] that would have already lawsuit there's already a lawsuit challenging the whole procedure on the other Democrats\nTo impeach that would be a disaster two thirds of the Senate good luck [noise] yes I just I'm like I think he already on the ground and I'm\nOf elections have consequences that's when I take away from it but here's a lot of kids that Republicans have noticed stealing Supreme Court says\nOh well I I mean all the foreign policy from one isn't here's the problem I still can't get over the fact that Trump won two years later you still can't get over got let me think what am I married Garland well let me let me talk about ... I think\nMight bite every indication is a very honorable three four would have been good Supreme Court judge in in the traditional sense with these balanced eats not completely a liberal democratic operate before he wanted to win bench but but met the criteria for it for a judge\nBut what is better not holding a hearing on them are doing what they've done in this case and that it's bringing is putting the sham of of hearing him and then finding a way to trashes reputation and voting they worked at a confirming middle election year\n... Republican senators were confirmed ... feet and putting on a more liberal members just wasn't going to happen in a presidential politics here not a midterm who\nWho knows who knows what the rules are writing about it but it's the president is the president United States who\nNominate somebody from the frame court out the senator Iraq is that right so therefore I think McConnell's argument is out when he says look a that was the\nPresidential election yeah like my mother of voters ... ...\n... but I'm just saying that they stretch it each time I don't know who started his but it keeps getting worse and worse and worse\nAnd once you do it for one year you could do it two years you could do it three years I I don't know ... ... guard rail Congress I think it was they moved it from sixty votes to fifty votes for everything but the Supreme Court of course they're going to do it for the Supreme Court if they there are new guard rails many more on this and that's what's scary\nAre not going to get a text here from a\nDJ Republican operative in Virginia Beach if there is such a thing she just says Joe mansion is only apply for\nIn the latest Fox poll as of a two days ago apply for not Fifteen so Scott needs to what chickens email is what one of our listeners said for a that was shot eight and a half hour they got another email on that let me check that chefs got another email where\nThe boys are factor town of waning right by the ... or so that must be well that is right for it and said that I just got an eight or what's his name battle is destroying Ted Cruz in Plano is not going to win that we're with Tom tom Davis how we can track or something from\nNorthern Virginia Newt Gingrich's favorite congressman ever\nWe've got chapter centers where that's where I'd shepherd is world headquarters here in\nCity and Scott surveillance state senator from northern Virginia Democrat and part of democratic leadership I'm\nNot part of their ... fairly soon but there isn't room for saying that if you challenged if you if you challenge the godfather to anybody about the guy father's not here in the dictionary or we're waiting on him I don't I don't think he's saying\nWell that's a far cry from Fifteen oh here's one plus twelve or Thirteen or Fifteen minutes and plugs well when I was\nI mean like the answer here has been consistently had I had said I'll give you I'll give you that and I think but I think a no vote\nHere changes have that dynamic there was a poll earlier before all this controversy or that showed that if you voted against the tea also numbers change on\nThis was ... I don't dispute the fact that the numbers would change [noise] um but from my perspective I think it Kavanaugh's confirmation to is probably the terms of democratic enthusiasm probably five to ten sheets maybe it's then it's easier to what I mean well I think it helps in house and her\nToo because when it's brought on very red territory North Dakota uh Missouri I mean these are pretty solid ... West Virginia in the Senate race in capital thinking help republic or where\nWhere we're at a time for a couple of instructed finally our news but one thing I think Tom now this is the only thing I've seen in since Trump announced that has a unified Republican I've never seen anything like this we couldn't figure out how to do it we're going to talk about\nI said Fifteen I was it was twelve point for when I went back and actually look at the polls\nThat limits the cabinet discussion yeah you want to go ahead what do you want to go ahead and that but then we got to get the fuck for football and hockey but God go ahead\nOh at wall e and I'm like last night among the winter and the Senate Judiciary committee the official account of the Senate Judiciary committee is tweeting about Democrats do not understand the definition of moving down to the\nSenate Judiciary account this thing is off the rails and and and I feel like\nYou know people were completely missing the point with all this process crap you know the reasons you just shake and he's tweeting that the Democrats have the definition wrong up within our process and none of it is actually on where people are on it and where voters are on on this isn't the Kavanaugh only has the support of the conservative base\nAnd the message that women are getting around the country is that you know people are OK with sexual assault\nNo I think that's that is better than the message they're they're getting\nIs you're now a pronounced wrongdoing or you don't really get it over and it's a good thing about the same\nDemocratic Party that defended Bill Clinton better tactics accusers my rights especially the one that got raped well\nOf all first of all I was I was lifted the allegation of rape against Bill Clinton which which exists actually didn't exist during the impeachment process if you remember that woman came out a week after on national television that whole process who got so when you did the Democratic party rallied around him whatever that is\nThat was ever catch him on the interview with a week after the centered in the Senate vote that you have the sequence Kevin Willie was saint Thomas ... [noise]\nI think you're thinking about the money to buy a broad term this the first when I was in the first thing you were not raise allegations anyway the point [laughter]\nThe message that women are getting around the country is that this is okay\nAnd Republicans are now into a debate about the definition of ... I mean general trend and double struggle I mean it's ... and this is on the official Senate district ... look everybody knows what blew the nit either not you have to first of all I\nAte pumping is Butina inserting drugs in your ... instead of taking 'em down your throat because your body will process it faster vent\nAbout Iraq because you haven't done that I learned during the eighties right where that everyone\nKnows what that means I didn't know what I did okay I Want to be a very\nVery interesting very innocent crowd here that has no idea what that word means you're not and then and then you know kept on going to go on national television taking notes and be like oh it's a parting joke I mean this is so ridiculous and absurd wasn't embarrassing nominee that's ...\n... a barrel sing process a Democrat and let me just really give banned the world you're talking about polling polling on everything with\nBowling on businesses very [noise] with the ... this is not overwhelming polling against capital this was right down the mental at this point\nIn which is the worst in history but we get Supreme Court justices are never done that or what we have right down the dark matter because we're just talking about the electoral repercussions when you're doing is you're kicked the hornet's nest\nThe Republican base that was kind of depressed at this point yeah and what you see now in in terms of the energy base of both parties the enthusiasm gap is closed and that's going to cost Democrats a couple of weeks\nAt least you know I mean I get when you look nobody wants to have a story that is uh doing sexual has a sexual assault get off of it we want people to California can you tell us when it's okay you have public figures that double standard right she's she fell into it or\nOr the guy who was the guy the ravens speed up his girlfriend and ... by the hair and they they pay them more money\nJust for for whatever it's worth I mean I I totally concur on Keith Ellison that's been out publicly I campaigned for his opponent you know on line when he got into the primary for attorney general I said this is not right the way he's doing it um\nAnd you should you should be that's the end and it or not you've been my biggest thing in general but it is it ... and it is bad because a lot of people will look the other way 'cause any should not be the number two person on the Democratic\nNational Committee right but this is the Supreme Court and you have a guy who not only has a credible accuser and we'll put the other two aside from that but I think Dr forest is an extremely credible accuser\nBut she has new corroborate that would stand lottery cooperation what's your core operation her corner thing contemporaneous hits\nHits it to people she said was present at the party he turned over his calendars from the same month and at the same people are lifted\nSo she wouldn't even know most people and that was all his calendars were released\nAfter she made now again none of them you know reading her best friend can remember this my right but that's not robbery you know what but you know in in\nCommon and in fairness I mean I Am I'm going to much money at high school reunion in next month it's been a long time or not and I'm the youngest person here\nIf I was in a social function in high school and no one told me that a a a traumatic event for someone else had occurred I Would have not remembering the event the next week let alone Twenty years later he came to me now and said oh were you at this point you know I don't know I was at that party or\nAn ... this guy produced calendar of what he was doing that number and nobody can pinpoint nobody can pinpoint where in the in the party was where was with my dear how she got there how she got home you got to have something outside of some memory I\nWish you credible witness absolutely but I think credible witness before going wrong memory skip over Thirty years I don't remember a lot of banks Thirty years ago\nOr or I remember them differently than they were in gift corrected\nLook I don't know who's telling the truth here but I think the mere allegation enough if that's now the standard that take somebody down I think we want to\nI don't think this is an allegation I mean I I I think now if\nI think that when you look at you know I'm ... people have put a lot of holes in the story of the the third user um and I think that you know you obviously have to hear both sides of\nYou know when an accuser comes forward their credibility this this is a user everything she has said you can cooperate with what she had done with how she lived her life\nWith the notes from her therapy sessions\nThey'll act wreck all I Know that they're not too early in the notes from earth or she is the operator you get them to the she offered enough yet when the interviewer\nShe won't give the committee the fact that I mean I\nI appreciate your passion and you know I'm your friend and I love you to death but what'd you just said it's off I mean she said she couldn't fly and then we find out you just jump to to me and my were flyer she's crawling all over the world and within a robust speech a month ago she Iraq so\nThey they said she she couldn't be in a place where the one door that was that corroborate in fact\nThe person that data during the parents at a gym send any by the door she lived in tiny apartment with one or that was all she said it was a\nLie detector tests I never did that I don't know anything about it is that in her former person that David ... said no she actually got paid to help people through lie detector test you knew everything\nIt so there was a lot of things that you said that\nShe couldn't recall or what must mistaken about that\nYou can sit there and say everything I said it's been ... I don't even know what's true anymore yeah\nThat's harsh on the line I I don't even know I think her testimony was a compelling test my bed I give you value everybody watched that but I thought he was too and if my reputation for being trashed I'd be a little emotional ... as as well\nGun it didn't equalize the enthusiasm gap which was in the Democrats' favor prior to that I agree with that and and that is the politics of this we can argue forever just got to be a good judge in history will tell bad but\nIt's really not a ... that this was like ... this was a circus I think it's diminished that both the institutions Senate and the and the court to clown show and I just sort of it's a good one at least they took a week to go back and interviewed some of these other people in close that the ... it's never going to be enough if you come back and you know don't take this guy out for the Democrats\nAnd on same on the Republican side so we'll have\nA vote tomorrow I think it passes in in ... and you move on 'em and we'll go to an election that federal or state earlier as if he doesn't pass it probably be the best result for the Republicans are going to know more in tune\nI agree I I think that the enthusiasm gap um I don't think it's not as much as the Republicans are claiming that have to think that there was some I'm nowhere near as coroners when they're not you know in our internal polling sure as you as you know like you know pulling will show noise and it while this is going on there was in my eyes and and the reality we're\nFair and the and the reality is that if you are correct that he's going to get confirmed\nThat there's not going to be a Republican boost from the from the election in fact it will be the opposite it's going to add to your nominee I'm\nMark ... democratic and he was already at an eleven I mean I\nDon't think that's true in fact I think that the Democratic intensity and she doesn't Seventeen ... you know you look at Virginia it was only in pockets of neighborhoods there were places where it was an eleven um upper income white neighborhoods were off the charts for Democrats but like the minority communities which I've always been a historic democratic base", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Laura Ingraham Show", "city": "Portsmouth", "day": "05"}
