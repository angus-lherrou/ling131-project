that listens to me I was a vehemently opposed to Patriot Act one son Patriot Act when it's sunset it you were a lonely voice in the U.S Senate I remember you did the filibuster for some time in opposing in questioning or\nThe ... of the Patriot act you were right uh then you are right now I was right then I'm right now we're just so my audience knows this whole Pfizer thing\nA with Carter Page and a easy dropping the Trump campaign and the phony Pfizer warrant none of that could have happened without the Patriot act that set that up\nAnd you're the one that said you keep covering ... getting government this unlimited power\nOf surveillance and its eventual you got to come around and bite you in the bud center that's exactly what happened\nHappened to saying very saying the conversation yesterday with the director the FBI because I asked him point blank\nArgue gathering information including suppressing some calls and of course he's butter and that's without the setting and the parents are divorced and I just got an answer yes there was an article about two or three years ago saying the recording this team hungrier President Obama's call and then they ...\nHim which means that sort of market now but is it to tell when President Obama or President Trump was talking to a foreign leader your them and their voices [noise] even if you minimize or you know a marked out the names that you can't tell the voices are but we shouldn't be doing now\nMy conversation and they record it and then they're out there and then the FBI condemned search this database\nWithout a journalist Warren and my point him was in I think he didn't understand it or in Britain started here if you're recording things on potential terrorists from overseas to cost the government really apply\nBut if they're talking to Americans or just random people are talking to Americans when you do get constitutional protections because the phone call our discussions with terrorists in fact the vast majority are innocent international phone calls\nAnd so we have had this discussion with them and uh it should be protected by the casket back some say the Fourth Amendment John Adams set of the spark that led to the revolution because when you're like the British soldiers coming into our houses you know breaking down the door and see if we paid our stamp tax [noise]\nUh we really wanted protection that we wanted to say the government can never come to your house or any of your private\nConversations are belongings without talking to a church first\nWell and that's a that's why you were so adamantly opposed to when you were a predictor of the future what this whole thing senator uh\nYou've also been a very strong voice on the disappearance of\n... to show the there's a lot of talk about what should be done and we want more information\nAnd like I get that but as a member of the Foreign Relations committee you're the only senator that has proposed action which isn't to get answers on his disappearance because\nSenator thing is we haven't videotape showing that he went in there is nobody will tape showing that he went out and I'm a crown prince NBS Mohammed bin Salman says the camera footage words corrupted or the battery went dead\nThen we'll see I don't really care only by that is like\nThe dog ate my homework or I didn't get ever ready battery and so the battery died now you have more in a meeting in suspension of the arms sales to the Saudis until we get some kind of a satisfactory answer can you elaborate on that sir\nI think everybody should remember that Saudi Arabia is the largest state sponsor of radical Islam around the world what I mean by that\nOr if they had been funding for Jack McCoy authors in Pakistan and India needed Philippines even in the United states teaching critical west to the Christianity and teaching radical violent jihad this is the salaries are we shouldn't be selling a weapons simply because of that\nIs one of the Nineteen hijackers who came here were from Saudi Arabia Saudi Arabia is a big part of our terrorism problem there are a funders of terrorism and teaching of radical Islam around the world the latest episode of\nArt I see no way that this could have happened without the Saudi Government being it's all too private clients were Fifteen guys on on some of them if they are a link to Saudi security services in intelligence I'm now it doesn't cost the smelter and [noise] you know we just cleared out\nIn addition to them killing a journalist [noise] they're bringing tens of thousands of civilians killed in Yemen\nThey're doing it with our bombs when we're when they're flying in there\nAnd it's a big flyer and two weeks ago or three weeks ago they killed the school bus full of children's school children were killed\nA year ago they killed a hundred and fifty people in a recession and we wonder why someone in Yemen wants to start a bomb on and kill the Saudi are killing American because of the crime the fragments of the bombs that same making America and so we have to realize there are every action or some action\nAnd that's a blowback from us being involved in some Mr gotten civil war a is one and we actually create more terrorists but here's the other possible thing that's going to happen\nAgain or what happened in Libya when we toppled Gadhafi\nWe've got chaos in more terrorism and became a breeding ground for terrorism my fear is that there is some remnants fairly fairly strong record of al ... and yet we're not fighting them that were Mitchell are stricter civil war between the who these and the salaries and also within range of course as well but my fear is decorate it\nSeems that they are and you get the rise out there it's the same thing happening in Syria is that\nThe whole war we got involved in standard in the house you got the rise of ISIS\nWill actually uh the network and I go on a ... near a couple of about a month ago was reporting that al Qaida fighters were actually given safe haven a by the by the Saudi forces in Yemen in ... in in order to fight the who these so\nCalled this wouldn't you shouldn't be surprising because who did the Saudis support in Syria they supporter down on the news round which is essentially an offshoot of out so the Saudis are always poor people who hate America and al ... a western ways\nAnd yet we kind of big arms deal the president says oh it for a job for creating jobs that's not something that we should be\nConsidering what we argue arms deals we need to be considering our national security not trying to have some sort of Keynesian jobs cook\nYou're on the John triggers reading your network truck in the truth across America where when\nKentucky Senator Rand Paul Republicans on the Foreign Relations committee or he's been the strongest voice in the U.S Senate on how we react to the uh Jamal ... disappearance\nSo have you recommended this to the president\nCenter have you went to direct conversation because remember a look and I was an original Trump supporter everybody knows day when it came down the escalator he campaigned on getting out of these entanglements not standing in the have you had any direct conversation with the president on how we should react to this\nNonsense to killing of the journal asked um he does know my feeling was talking about once every week or two and we have our conversations are general ours by saying\nThat uh he has the same man strings that idea that we pay for the Afghan or two\nSyria or that we should stay forever and yet he's surrounded by stay forever crowded ... that's the real problem is I think the president's instincts are good I'm sort of in the crowd of let the president a bigger president right and yet the people surrounding him are\nI think to offer and you know part of the traditional foreign policy round here which is go stay forever and bankrupt America\nSen Paul the president has invested a lot of political capital in the Saudis and it was the first place that he went\nIn his first foreign dessert a MPs came to the United states he did as a media tour with them to Saudi spend a ton of money on media PR as you know uh in in in the swamp\nAnd so he's put a lot of uh and and you know we kind of look the other way when NBS rounded people up jailed them in that hotel whatever they did\nA ... has looked the other way is this going to affect our relationship with the Saudis and my ... and tying it to that is it going to change the president's position on the Saudi Fargo of the state of Qatar where we have or\nBiggest military base in the middle east [noise]\nYeah I'm not so sure you're going to change his mind he seems to be ... on a continuing to sell our to Saudi Arabia I think Congress is also the

Menendez\n[noise] look I I Would agree with you I Am I going to making her depression I was always Jersey key Smokey\nHer unique in your house right you can keep those seats for credit [laughter] do you also see where a lot of money by how he's going to win by a smaller guy right that's\nAll right let's get to let's get saying these are fake polls so you're you're you look at the polling that's coming out showing this you know these wide gaps by Democrats and they're using the same polling methodology they didn't do not sixteen when all of them kept saying\nEven worse by where I Would argue John rotating corrupt you put your workforce\nSo is there think polls by the fake news dribble fake agenda for the narrative I mean what what did they ever ... ever turn\nOr did you just think they're just trying to press Republican and a turn out\nWell yes I think first talk that despite what they will tell you they certainly are too crowded Republican her you know you talk to [noise] look I have friends in New York Times the Washington Post reporter as well they all talk\nOr at MSNBC contributors market that you know fate accompli that will be going through impeachment proceeding\nBecause the Democrats are going to when I Do agree with them by the way the Democrats will\nTheir narrative they're not just painted it's older they don't want to they need the older pollsters they don't understand and the demographic but I also think too in the following\nThe reason I spoke with they were worse when you were talking about John it's because they're basing it\nOn a movie of they're basing it on the voting on all well let's say the ABC Washington Post on typically the ... the worst of the words right that is like that is like I mean there's some work it in\nThe ... of let's say the worst political you wouldn't think governor just thinks that you know Democrats are always writing that Republicans are always wrong by [noise] um [noise] they base it on the model where they're looking at\nPeople that typically do\nFrankly are even registered some car and loading this time and they sit on the fact of a woman march on talk not pay something millennials are coming out to vote the way they can use democratic pollsters are putting it in and millennials are not coming out of those who are democratic candidates\nFor nature and the second issue is a less you show me a poll on that and I will tell you if you were to real polls on John CBS you go to Paul\nPaul struck forget his name he released a book and he says book I'm giving it to three ways to their best case scenario running now for the Democrats undermined polling\nHe had the Democrats the tendency majority worst case scenario under my polling you only had two Democrats were against the Republican House by one seat\nI still think that under an accidental\nCircumstances the reason he says that is because what they do is they do they're generic that way I remember doing these congressional race in the way they do it for congressional as opposed to the Senate races they it's just not fair\nFor accurate way to do it because of the gerrymandering the way these districts are\nThe way they polled people let's say in the state of California the state of New York or even in the state of Virginia and then they put that into\nTheir poll of composite it's just not an accurate it doesn't represent what they don't waiting accurately for what it has to come out to slip Republican Pete the Democratic party at some point I Want to say is part of it is just simple laziness\nBy that laziness unsophisticated ways of doing your part of it is that it's very expensive looked at his expensive if you wanted to do what we did citizens of the American republic Steve Bannon's group we spent two hundred thousand dollars I'm polling\nAnd what we did was we saw in the region the polling in the state as well we didn't even do stay we said we want to be like oh why New York right we want to see me\nThe um [noise] we will look at the state of Washington right where we were we have washing may we said we want to see the northern and\nWestern column of Washington right that's the way you do a quick that look I'm two hundred thousand dollars he's right you know\nSo it's a lot more expensive to do with the right way to do with\nThe whole point is there these networks they don't spend the money they have to stand but seeing people doing jobs that one person can do right right some of the things like that you would think they actually would want to spend money on we'll pull it off\nAnd let me shift over I got a couple of minutes ago two two minutes then shipped over to some policy and I want to get your thoughts Mike Pompeo justice match Saudi Arabia or to a ... by the president\nWho spoke with it or who spoke with a ...\nMohammed bin Salman ... today king Salman denying it anything to do with his show he that's hard to believe for the average person but he is denying it you have to I guess I think that [noise] down the prison turning around and telling compare to go there or the president saying on Saturday because he was that if it was proven\nThat she was murdered in the conflict there would be severe punishment for the Saudis Saudi then turned around under and the MPs and said\nWe will retaliate what do you make this whole thing Sam\n[noise] well I think retaliate ridiculous on to retaliate in Harlem and coming from Saudi Arabia was governor state run TV [noise] it was probably someone quibble of life\nYou know the equivalent of\nA radio host or something where I heard you know what I paid jak [noise] and they were showing the Saudis they think that will retaliate and they'll go to ... and they'll start align themselves are rushing you want to live on your soldier Russia [noise] you wanna lawyers told the Russian you'll end up in the Shia\nIranian crashed and so that's not realistic when I came to the following this reporter was killed by the\nSaudi Arabians not only with people that are barely a children they barbaric\nBarbaric Mariner oh it was something that went wrong I don't know why this gentleman went into that conflict was that was\nObviously he's not responsible for what happened\nBut considering what really considering the deepest human writing and knowing about ...\nAnything he Donald Trump is correct about NBS for the following reason\nRemember George W. Bush took us into Iraq\nNot only find you want to remove Saddam but then he said we're going to have them vote and they're going to select the democracy it it's going to end up having Starbucks their movie theater okay the the way it worked out [noise] I had no problem with in in many regions supporting\nA chance to think about it a bit I literally on the way here\nHave this way and you tell me this is what NBS\nDid he thumbed his nose he thumbed his nose at his benefactor companies now is not directly against us but it was like hey I'm going to do what I Want screw ya and that's not the way the world works\nAnd as soon as the president said there's gonna be severe punishment you can bet your bottom dollar is going to do something because he doesn't do the\nA bomb a red line empty truck he says he's going to act you will act I think he's proven that\nBut everybody has to weigh over player's hand way overplayed his uh his chips here and thought that somehow that you know he could get on the phone with\nJared pushed or or write the honors somebody in by is way out of there are certain things you can't buy her way out of I think he made a real mistake here\nI've got some ... some a cut that we want to do here on the John Frederick radio network with us from Michael in in ... but\nFirst let me tell you that for a segment is brought to you by our friends that job creators network you know folks you and I know one thing Mitt germs are about who shows up every pollster we've had on our show every analyst says the same thing\nIf Trump supporters turn out the Republicans can hold the house if they don't they're not and we also know that this election this mid term is the most important mentor and probably in the history of the republic\nBecause a lot more is on your ballot that just kind of it's tax savings is on your ballot the American economy is on the ballot your jobs are on the ballot guess what your kids moved out of the basement finally their jobs are on the ballot to\nYour wages on the ballot rages on the ballot promotion on the ballot so they're right on the ballot\nAs a small business owner like me those tax cuts that you got to help you expand that hire people that's on the ballot tell and here's the biggest the biggest issue\nThat you're going to vote for doing what politicians and bureaucrats\nIn the swamp running the show in Washington DC or do you want to be in charge that's basically the choice here what your choice if you want to preserve the victories in the past two years I'm urging you're getting involved this November\nBy going your tax cuts work dot com that's tax\nCuts worked out count that make it easier for you whenever you want to do you want to hand stuff out you wanted to do text called takes the money in the polls whatever it is tax cuts work dot\nCom because here's what we know the Democrats are motivated they're going to show up every year they don't show up you lose tax cuts worked out Tom do your part\nDon't get out worked in November go to the tax cuts worked outcome that segment this message I'm Sorry I paid for an authorized by job creators\nPresident talking with the Saudi\nKing today and after the conversation immediately dispatching pump pay over there that we can all read into the the way I really enjoyed it\nDidn't really buy into the conversation so we sent comparing it to get the bottom of it um and the fact that he treated out that he talked to them and he put in quotations by a Saudi citizen [noise]\nUm I don't think the president was comfortable that's just my opinion on sixty minutes last night the president addressing Saudi Arabia might cut one has denied a said that the Saudis have that are playing any part\nIn the district in the disappearance of your show but saves the cases being an investigator\nCIA mile ... the journal that Saudi journalist warranty murdered by the Saudis and the print in order to tell him\nWhen he nobody knows yet but we'll probably being able to find out it's being investigated it's being looked at very very strongly or we were very upset and angry if that were the case as of this moment they deny it and did not deny me mentally couldn't be that we asked\nChallenger sounded like got on the phone and asked\nTheir team what can I ask that they deny it denied every way you can imagine in the not too distant future I think we'll know an answer what are your options are saying they did what are your options would you consider imposing sanctions as a bipartisan group of senators have proposed\nWhat depends on what the sanctions and give you an example they ordering military equipment everybody in the world wanted that order Russia wanted it China wandering that we wanted it we got it and we got all of that every bit of it don't what'd you cut that are like well what I don't want to do [noise]\nBlowing rock ... re pee on all these ... I don't want to hurt jobs I don't want to lose in order like that and you know there are other ways of population to use the word that's a pretty harsh words but it's true\nHowever buddy what can you care\nYou know they said well there's a lot I think there's a lot at stake and maybe especially so because this man was a reporter to something you'll be surprised me say that there's something really\nTerrible and disgusting about that if that were the case so we're gonna have to see we're going to get to the bottom of it and they will be severe punishment\nSevere punishment [noise] um I wouldn't I wouldn't mess around with the the uh\nMohammed bin Salman is messing with the wrong president in the wrong town at the wrong place in the wrong time\nPressure before the midterms if he says there's going to be something will happen\nMike the president saying as we have said there's gonna be likely to have changed after the midterms are we know what some of them are we think we do of

your bottom dollar there's gotta be severe punishment now there's media reports going around that took a show he was an operative of intel for the Saudis that he was involved with the um\n[noise] uh

I don't like any does [noise]\nAh but she says I Do have to admit this economy he's got gold is really great\nSo then uh the my wife says well what are you going to do on November six and she's like a well I'm certainly not going to do anything to jeopardize this economy and that was her comment and\nI'm telling you there are so many Democrats like that out there that uh they might say they don't like Trump and they might say that there's been a poll or whatever but they don't want to and they don't want to do anything to screw this economy up and certainly putting Nancy Pelosi in charge is a prescription for disaster joining us now is\nElaine Parker she's the chief operating officer\nOf job creators network Elaine great to have you with us\nCan morning Jonathan crowding\nElaine these are economic numbers continue to just stunned people\nThe or the the level of growth that we're having the newest unemployment report coming out to about ten days ago three point seven percent unemployment Elaine this was the lowest recorded on unemployment in the United states we've had since Nineteen sixty nine\nA winter the economy where does this phenomenal Trump autonomy rang in there just isn't making matrix when they show up on November stakes dot whereas it\nThe health care and the economy just about all over the country are at the top issues national security is important to many and in some states like Arizona immigration is the critical issue so economy everywhere is one of the top two issues uh\nThey brought this a lot about the economy is Greece there is not as much of an awareness there was not a lot of voters are excuse me credit to the Trump and Republican policies that match creating a bit of a disconnect [noise]\nWow that's a I mean it's it's it's unfortunate and to me every day and it goes by where the Republicans are not talking about the economy and jobs and\nPromotions and raises and you know the other thing only give you a Elaine back involves the overthrow of um chief operating officer of the jobs created networks\nElaine another thing that is not readily talked about is the number of people now that are comfortable changing jobs Elaine ah\nWhich is another number that is off the uh CNN polling radar screen if you will but the number of people that were in jobs he did particularly want to be in or didn't like her one happy\nBut in the Obama economy one percent girl one percent growth they were afraid to move now you're getting movement from one level to the other people changing companies feel more comfortable\nThat they can make that move can you expand on that all it\nReally isn't that just all part of what I was talking about earlier with having more out of all people have died about six and a half million jobs\nAnd I only have about six million people are\nOut there and it doesn't mean there's always a skills natural and the jobs that are available as a result we're seeing leaders right around ... side of the market and how it how it's supposed to work and people are feeling very comfortable and looking at\nOther opportunities we've got other opportunities for people who are taking their first steps and going to start their own company on because they all started shedding has taken steps to make our health insurance more affordable around for small business ... three of\nHis patients cleaning people are able to make that leap fat\nI'm making an they weren't able to just because of the cost of health insurance and that would actually health insurance is actually touch at our fire\nOr weekly survey last week we found that ... percent of people are willing to give up their doctor\nMhm um or their current plans for federal plans and um that we know that\nThat people want access to health insurance states want access to affordable insurance on in the government had a real and sharing is cutting are providing it\nSo a lot to get back to Scott Ross wasn't so Scott to what degree is in the that issue going to show up on November six I noticed that\nThe Democrats would come on my show now uh one of the major talking points or well Republican X Y or Z voted against a extending freezes thinking decisions when they [noise]\nAnd that that is a fear that gets to ... people want to make sure that everyone has access to quality health care and to the degree that the\nChurch like that is believed to this person is going to lead to ending coverage for those with preexisting conditions that so that's what our protective ploy\nI'm obviously it as something that Republicans would say is not true in a certain misrepresentation of the vote to misrepresentation\nOf legal actions that have been taking 'em so clarify what happens there is each community because again Americans do want everybody to have access to health insurance they want to make sure it's affordable they they're not aware again or some of the activities that the whole lingers mentioned some of the policies that have made less expensive plans\nWhich increases accent I'm probably of anything on the health care of me going to get the flash point a scary thought is in motion that somebody in any condition many places will be unable to get access to health care\nAnd so that's the leading the driving some some people um yes to vote the other way thinking well if the if if the Democrats get in and they're not going to end the bombing here\nI mean it's just a sign that was kind of amazing because um two thousand ten and the Tea Party and all that we covered over all that and getting rid of Obamacare was like everybody is number one issue\nAnd now the polling numbers show that you know people have accepted it they're comfortable with it and they they don't want to change it\nSo um how how do you reconcile that\nIt it's very simple the healthcare system was broken whole bomber chair it was not by Obamacare people still believe the system is broken on but it's no longer really the shoulder finding part of the health care discussion because\nIt's been in place now for several years people aren't quite sure what is it a lot of your life your adult life um had anything to do with Obamacare what we know is this going on and have a choice that their own and making their own decisions health insurance [noise]\nWe know that they are wary very wary of having the federal government\nTake over the healthcare system um there are a number of things that you would say would be opposed to Obamacare are put into place\nBut people are you know President Obama has now been out of office for a few years his policy was past eight years ago people want to deal with the system as it is and make it better [noise] um and they don't see either side really having a solution to that at this\nPoint Elaine Parker how do we get a maximum engagement on November ... only what twenty two days remaining\nHow do you get maximum exposure to get Republicans on November ... how do we do that\nI think we have to keep talking on the highway and kind of the pilots\nWe did a poll a couple of weeks ago on asking how many Americans knew that there than a tax cut and about a third of them said they didn't even know that they have their taxes I\nMean that's that's substantial we should be talking about um the fact that five million Americans got it all out Rachel increases and that means is that the results I think that not equal to companies that put out press releases we got numbers just small means for\nSmall businesses to get rain has been giving raises and and hiring people standing there but they just don't put out press releases about it so we know that things are happening for employees you know people are getting money back in our paycheck in their small businesses hiring only hear the economy's doing well but we keep talking about it and educating Americans about that\nSo uh what what is the advice that you have for Republicans that are running in tight races or how would you change their or\nEncourage them to change their message in order to take advantage of this tremendous economy we have to learn [noise]\nWell I mean I think it it's very clear choice choice the quote unquote hanging the on the very high economy as a result of these policies or going back to\nYou know wage stagnation going back to a higher unemployment [noise] and it's about a choice and and that's why people how to educate themselves on on the benefits that these policies cutting are they nice ration\nI don't want to thank God willing for being with us Scott Rasmussen the

and we were down by what was it Nineteen\nI said the pose a complete joke and it was we lost the race pie or just under four percent certainly not Nineteen percent\nBut look the duty in order to the
