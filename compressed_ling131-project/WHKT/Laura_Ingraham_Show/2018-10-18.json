what he says or does he can he can threaten age gonna cut aid everybody saying that's oh and then if you oppose this you're a racist that's that's the other other thing I'm opposed to five thousand people invading my country illegally that either have to pay for\nComing in a plant caravan and because I oppose this I'm going to be labeled a racist\nNo I Am a believer in the law or we have a country now you're a racist\n\nAnything that doesn't fit the liberal mantra you're a racist\nThat's I mean that's the attack\nSo it doesn't matter what Jeff Sessions does or what Trump does judges on

eighty percent of those get in successfully\nThe next wave will be twenty five thousand\nMe time there is no war\nAnd nobody nobody really wants to talk about this and a short text and that says the ... the Caribbean it's coming for the midterms\nI mean you would think you would think that if the caravan of invading illegal aliens and that's what this says this is an invasion this is an invasion coming to the United states\n\nI don't I'm not going to call it anything but what it is an invasion you would think that that would motivate people\nTo get out and vote and vote for Republican so that you have some kind of a security on the border of what other people think it's actually going to hurt the Republicans because CNN and all the news networks are going to be showing pictures of moms with babies that's that you you can't script is out mom's with\nBabies and they're going to call them economic refugees seeking asylum asylum means you're a\nPolitical prisoner or you are at risk in

kind of comedy as for asylum because they can't get a job in their ... corrupt country\n\nThat we give billions of dollars to these people and it's the corruptions beyond the pale\n\nYou would think

called a racist because you don't want your country invaded by four thousand illegal immigrants on the southern border no it was just like you want to obey the law\nI guess we have two sets the laws parts for people that the Democrats won in and that was very body of I don't really understand it\nThis is a real issue and\nThere's no answer to this and ... really you would think that our ally Mexico wouldn't let them come in the Mexico\n\nI mean think about think about think about what what would happen in the U.S if these five thousand a caravan of invaders said well we really want to go to Canada so as we can you let us in the United states and give us just a a a sixty they are status here so that we can\nGo up the highway and ah get to Canada and we can invade them\nI mean what what what would they Canadian say well sure you know I understand I understand it's our problem no they'd be like ... why are you doing this this is just a logic\n\nAnd was open borders crowd is relentless and they have Wall Street Republicans behind them you would think that this would be the major issue of the day and because of Goldman Sachs says salivating and looking over their chops at the

get separated from the child the child doesn't go to jail with them\nThe law but laws don't matter now\n\nI mean if you ever had more evidence why there shouldn't be a wall this has it\n\nSo the Republicans are attempting to make this a\n\nA election issue where they're putting a built together for thirty two billion dollars to fund the wall\nBut they're not getting their message out as far as I'm concerned\nI mean you you really think about you what do you think about how any other country would handle an organized caravan of illegal immigrants coming into your country and expecting a fully expecting that they will be allowed in and taking care of\n\nIts crazy and uh you would think that this one issue alone would sink the Democrats in the election but many people think it's going to have the opposite effect so you know you just start scratching your head\n\nI mean I think the debate over this issue in this country should be whether or not you want to border or you do\nAnd you know there is an argument for not having one and the argument is cheap labor and we have a big heart and we'll take care of anybody that comes in\nAnd eventually when the country collapses than it is what it is I mean that's one argument you know in the meantime the elites will continue to profit off it and then obscene fashion\nAnd the gangster benches and make more money and Wall Street executives will get more wealthy than they are and if you work at Goldman Sachs you'll be able to buy an island\nI mean I guess that's the plan and you'll continue to fund the Democrats who will then have on unlimited power in perpetuity and remember it was President Obama who said ah my goal was to transform\nIt America transforming you transform it by changing its make up\nIts demographic makeup you change it by\nAllowing 'em unfettered illegals to come in and change the culture whenever the American culture is those who want to change it want it to be something else I'm really don't know what they want it to be or what you think but that's the objective of this whole thing\n\nUnholy alliance of Democrats want cheap votes\n\nWall Street Republicans at one cheap labor\n\nAnd the third

right back\nI'm Sorry a treasury official in the department of treasury arrested yesterday and charged with leaking information on former Trump advisers in order to discredit them\nThis this is scary and this is your deep state right here ... junior official working for the treasury department's financial crimes enforcement operation network find said I got a lot of acronyms here so hang with me\nHas been ... this is a senior official has been charged with leaking confidential financial reports on former Trump campaign advisers Paul Manafort Richard Gates and others to the media\n\nNow prosecutors say that Natalie Mayflower sours Edwards that's a lot of names there her name is Natalie Mayflower sours Edwards a senior advisor to find Sen\nPhotographed work called suspicious activity reports or SARS and other sensitive government files and sent them to an unnamed reporter in violation of US law banks file\nSARS which is basically if you're a changing money around and agreements have over ten thousand dollars banks file SARS\nConfidentially in order to tip off law enforcement to potential illegal financial transactions the on authorized document disclosures which began last October are said to have provided\nThe basis for twelve news articles published by an unnamed news organization\n\nNatalie Mayflower sours Edwards the lady with three name\nFor names here let's just go to Natalie Edwards Edwards is being charged in the southern district of New York with one count of unauthorized disclosures of suspicious activity reports in one count\nOf conspiracy to make unauthorized disclosures of suspicious activity reports both of which carry a maximum of\nFive years in prison\nI mean if this person does not go to jail and prison I don't know what the deal is here because I don't care what you think of anybody's activity you cannot have people in the department of treasury that cherry pick information I pull\nI mean that that that could happen to your tax return I mean you think about this you think it but you could be a Trump supporter and somebody in the IRS could be copying your tax returns on a on a photo put them on a thumb drive and send them to the New York times\n\nBecause you're a Trump supporter I mean and it's an amazing thing this is never done the liberals like this was never down to Obama's supporters or Clinton supporters it's only done to Trump supporters\nOr anybody affiliated with the the president or likes them or whatever whatever they think maybe\n\nThis in this is incredible I mean there there's not there's there's one thing to have a deep state here's another thing to have this level of corruption eight eight days for eight oh John eight eight eight for\nA though five six four six eight eight eight for eight oh five six for sex\n\nEdwards is a it is being charged here we'll see what happens the charges or the latest indication of the Trump administration's effort to root out alleged leakers within the government something that prosecutors emphasized in announcing the charges on Wednesday\n\nOr is this is incredible according to the criminal complaint agents in the treasury inspector general's office detected in patterns\nGet this a pattern\nOf on authorized the media disclosures\nOf the center of the financial files beginning in October two thousand Seventeen and continuing for a year the disclosures were related to matters being investigated either by Mahler or by the U.S attorney's office for the southern district of New York or the Justice Department\n\nThey included leaks about suspicious transactions\n\nAh they included all leaks about different things that were on authorized that are illegal to leak\n\nFederal prosecutors have also accused Edwards of leaking sensitive financial information related to the case of Maria Butina the Russian Women charged with acting illegally as an unregistered agent or the Russian government we're not really covered it that much but um\nI mean it's really unbelievable\nThe alleged leak announced Wednesday would be the second major suspected breach of find sent reported this year after a federal law enforcement official told the New Yorker in may that he leaked SARS on his show companies set up by Michael Cohen Trump's former attorney after two similar\nBank records appeared to be missing from the fights and database\n\nEdwards is also accused of sending\nTo get his memos and intelligence assessments Edwards allegedly used an encrypted application to sent files that contained or described the financial reports prosecutors also say Edward save the documents on a flash drive that they believe she has in her possession were had in her position\nAs a time of arrest not to say I mean this is unbelievable and ladies and gentlemen this is the tip of the iceberg\nI mean this is this just beyond the deep state this is the dirt deep corrupt state\nIn the political she ... I mean you go back to the IRS with a Lois Lerner what they did there and you've got an entire federal beer ... bureaucracy licking things in order to hurt anybody associated with Trump\nOr his agenda in order to harm them\nI mean why would anybody go get a job and the government now in the White House why would you do that\nSo that you're you know information could get leaked\nOr anything negative on you that the government has in their background check that's going to get leak now\nIt's just beyond the deep state this is like an internal coup against the president I tell you the stakes here so high the stakes are so high if if\nThe Democrats win and they get ... ward it for\nThis kind of behavior I don't know where we're going as a country I really don't I mean if there's any independent out there or any moderate I mean do do you really think this is the right thing to do for your country regardless of whether you like Trump's tweets are not do you really think this is the right thing to do\nWhere we have a better bureaucrats harming US citizen simply because\nOf their political affiliation is that where we're headed and we have angry mobs running around chasing people out of elevator spitting on them\n\nThreatening them sending a allegedly poisonous substance to Susan Collins home because they don't like how she voted on a particular issue\nChasing people out of diners is that where we're headed here I mean is that the America that you want your children living in\nBecause that's what's gonna happen\nI mean this is basically rural now by angry mob deep staters\nLeakers and corrupt bureaucrats that have a political agenda\nHow many Edwards do you think are out there you think it's just an isolated incident or do you think there's thousands of them\nSouth Asians\nGetting exposed you can't but it's too many are you got to go to quick words are sponsors I'll be right back around the John predators radio network trucking trip did you know that homeowners now control for it\nSo with cornerstone first financial and this rise in appreciation has led to record numbers of people using their homes as ATMs with the elimination of some ... tax deductible credit card debt on the rise in interest rate increases looming now is the time to act if you're looking to\nFix your house up eliminate P.
