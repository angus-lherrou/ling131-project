little crazy right meantime I'm your guy ... of the truth ... an everyday looked at the phone lines gene in and let Virginia junior on the air\nHey John how are you today never better\nWant to I Want to talk about a couple of power that you mentioned uh recently during our last phone call about the Mexican walls with Donald Trump it kept his promise\nThat Mexico would want to pay for the wall then we wouldn't be a talk and having this conversation now and uh Mexico is not paying for the wall because although Trump hasn't agreement with Mexico and Canada to renegotiate NAFTA or\nThat that agreement has to be approved by Congress overnight worth of papers planning only and I think it's very interesting\nThat the Republicans have the agreement but they're the habit loop\nA hotline or is it not in not move forward with a degree in that the Trump has a say on paper but it has to be a a ratified by Congress or it's just it's just a just a piece of paper\nSo Mexico's not paying the liquor for the wall and if the Trump kept his promises and ah I got the million dollars from Mexico than we have a wall or we have one started and\nWe wouldn't have to worry about this uh these people are coming up here or if until we get a wall if we could ah ah put sanctions on ... or any employer hiring illegal immigrants now that'll send them home too but they're not about to do that\nAnd uh just this or else you'll know that uh you know this this is not a shoe and a victory for the Republicans a November the six\nAnd a I don't see any polls that that are that are very prophecy if at all for Comstock outlook before I called the ones that I could access the closest one of those six percent but the problem is is that Comstock and with man and a tailor\nIt rats they can't bring truck into Virginia Trump is radioactive and Virginia have peaked there's a reason for\nThat and I don't think there's anything done by Donald Trump to rectify that since he's been in a in the White House\nSo you know I Would advise Barbara Comstock the best she could series with Egypt holiday\nOn the White House right down the street and ask Donald Trump to come up there in a campaign for why why not you know why Rob Wittman says it was I was a big guy Donald Trump's order and a day brat as Donald Trump white hands down so well how can people calling that Donald Trump to get some help when they got a a toss up\nA a ... writing in the uh in the polls and one other thing I just want to tell you this you know I watched\nPart of the uh Williams a ... a\nFancy way and there's a lot Whitman debate yesterday you know that the the er the answer about Obamacare\nA given by a car liberal was pretty much a a joke we are still under Obamacare the promise for seven years to\nRepeal and replace it with something better and uh the Republicans have all three branches of government they can even pass their own version of a a a trunk care or something better than Obamacare and even even the the the Congress\nForget to Congress should like the crowds for seven years the promised that Donald Trump made on the campaign he was going to take care of everybody a which is is easy to get older you tend to watch it like the promise a none of that's\nBeen done and November\nThe six day to hold Republicans accountable\nFor their lives to the American people and the the biggest promise is affordable adequate health care you can you can put as much money in people's pockets\nOkay you know time limit okay I Can't let you do a monologue for Fifteen minutes here I've been I've been really polite they appreciate your patient you were done now let me go let me go backwards number one you're talking about a\nA bomb of care and the Republicans promise to repeal and replace it they had a better plan they lied to you for seven years Trump they told Trump had to plant they never did and now the president understands that\nRepublicans have lied about that for a seven year period to raise money off it and there's no question and so but that's why Trump beat them off okay you get it that's why he edition rated sixteen candidates\nPretty cool\n[noise]\nBreaking news this hour about how

and uh\nWe looked the other way when it's been changed on by the left it's such a horrific manner\nBut the legacy media never wants to address that you know I remember when ... was gunned down and

actually did this and\nThe Democrats are now taking advantage of it in order to help them with the midterms which is just ... they\nAre now the ... they are the party\nParty of mobs caravans Republicans are the party of jobs in the country now they're trying to take advantage of the Republicans ever tried to take advantage of any of the Republicans being shot at that baseball\nTV blaming

now if you listen to me right now you tell me that's not sick this is a separate party the Democrats just pick the people that do this are nuts yes it's just a horrible events\nAnd I'm pretty convinced that ah\nIt was a personal because all the advertisement saying is they're all the same so this is the same person four percent person or persons probably percent crazy person\n\nBut then then there's the question of you know who did it and what was the motivation and until we get the facts and we don't know\nWe don't know who did this we don't know if this was politically motivated by a Trump supporter we don't know if this was a democratic supporter trying to influence the election\n\nIn the back of your belly and wait we have no idea we didn't know what the facts are was the same thing that I told you about Saudi Arabia and the show he's killing at the president to the right way he his position evolved as the fax came it let's let the facts to come in\n\nBut I'm I I'm not even going to speculate until we get more information more information you can test me seven five seven six Nineteen Seventeen Jennifer from Norfolk says\nIf in fact the pipe bombs or for probably real

little speculating today but uh the FBI all over this and they're saying and various news reports\nThat they're going to get the bottom of it and the president did the same thing Washington's a little bit on the edge as the FBI now with the best the gates a string of attempted mailbox addresses two top Democrats or\nWhich was very odd because here's your they picked a bomb on Clinton holder John Brennan\nSoros Maxine Waters Debbie Wasserman Schultz ... it's just it's just very odd to me that are like half of these people aren't even argument involved now I just find that\nOdd I just find it I just the whole thing is a odd to me let me leave it at that it's just odd happening\nOr eleven days before the midterms the FBI now investigating the potentially destructive to devices of course we don't know if they were actually set to go off either we have pictures of them but um none of the\nThank God discovered this week exploded and no one was harmed so thank the lord for that these six inch long package Bob's each had a battery containing powders and broken glass\nWork instructed from a PVC pipe and covered with black tape this is what we learn from a law enforcement official who saw the bombs that the X ray images of it and told the Associated Press\nThe white power in the package that the CNN was tested and determined to be basically baby powder harmless so the white powder was harmless they um it's not really determined right\nNow if these bombs could have actually cut off a\nThe FBI intercepted the packages for Obama Clinton in ... before they were received now anybody that does one of these would be odd that they didn't know that you can't get to a bomber Clinton or Trump for anybody of this nature because uh\nSo that seemed odd to me the package forever colder was forwarded to return address from the offices of Debbie Wasserman Schultz in Florida\nPackage for granted that was that the CNN resulted in the evacuation of the cable John's headquarters in New York City leading to the surreal seeing the bankers and journalists reporting on the breaking news event from the street\nAnd uh\nThe FBI says it's possible that other packages were male to other locations that are still in the mail strip the makeshift bombs are going undergoing test and the destruction of the FBI Laboratory\nIn Quantico, Virginia the Associated Press reported that the trail of clues are are eventually going to lead to that would be bomber and a course of the time and get that's not good enough speaking in the East Room yesterday President Trump condemned the axe or\nThreats or political violence and called for unity as his audience to\nApplaud\nAnd he said that in these times we have to unify we have to come together and said one very clear very strong unmistakable message that acts of threats of political violence of any kind of no place in the United states of America that coming from President Trump\n\nThat wasn't immediately condemned by Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer who then turned around and I said it was an insufficient response [noise] let me read it again in these times we have to unify of course a Hillary Clinton said you can't unify until the Democrats what\nThat's what you said that we can go\nBut apparently the Democrats thought that the president's message of unification and coming together to send a very clear strong unmistakable message that acts or threats of political violence of any kind of have no place in the in the United states obviously they are\nFor the ... statement it said it was insufficient\nAnd that he was part of the problem\nYou had the other democratic operative coming on TV last evening\nWho said that uh all the people targeted\nBy the pipe bomber in the mail you said you could ah basically jet molested by following the president's shorter feet\n\nSee this is what the Democrats are trying to take advantage\nOf what could have been a horrible situation or maybe not\nBecause until we get thrown into bombs could actually have gone off we don't know like the powers that to CNN was baby powder so until we actually know that the bombs had the potential to go off and they could have harm someone\nCourts out we don't know we don't know anything all we know is what we know so let's wait until the FBI\nBeing honest about it let's wait until they give their report the Washington\nPost reports that Republican leaders are very close to get that package bombs that the rest of the politicians officials on the news media later on the campaign rally last night in Wisconsin [noise] I'm Sorry I had a campaign\nRally in uh Wisconsin President Trump's message of common purpose\nShifted to criticism of the Democrats and the media Trump said people should not mob people in\nPublic spaces seems like a pretty reasonable statement to me and that the press has a responsibility to set a civil town and stop the endless possibilities and cops that negative and they get taxed at the same stories\nWell the\n[noise] news is our town halls on average Thomas\nFor suspicious parcels males are more prominent critic ... president\nPackages addressed to actor Robert De Niro and former vice president Joe Biden were intercepted this morning at officials say they are similar to the crude pipe bomb said earlier this week to former President Obama Hillary Clinton and CNN packages of albums used in Delaware New York Washington Florida and California\nThe bombs seized earlier this week we're about six inches long each contains a battery and broken glass so far none have
