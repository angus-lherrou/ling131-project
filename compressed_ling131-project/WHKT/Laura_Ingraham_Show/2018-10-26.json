Republican those are going to flip\nSo the Democrats are going to have to pick up twenty six seats where I've heard right now\nIs up to twenty six seats they need 'em that are toss ups that all of them are now trending towards Republican now in the last\n... forty eight hours part of it is you know people are looking at the economy and they're saying do we really want to go backwards do we really want to go back to the bottom of regimes we really want to go back to getting rid of the tax cuts a half a percent growth savings\nAre down nobody has any money family comes home father comes over mom and dad come home on a friday night third they can't take your family to a movie they don't have any money there in fear of their jobs the other thing is Elaine that you have to look at is not only our jobs up or an unemployment\nIs at the lowest it's been since Nineteen sixty nine Nineteen sixty nine wasn't land that was one of the New York miracle Mets won the world series Nineteen sixty nine I mean I was a kid\nBack then I was uh twelve years old or something that's so far but the\nNumber of people feel a bit of it\nSince the two thousand and one or two thousand one says the two thousand and eight recession dropped out of the job market are now coming back and let me give me some other stuff away the number\nOf former felons that have been released out of prison getting jobs is at a record high you know how great it is\nFor people that made a mistake and now they're getting a second chance let me give you another staff the hiring of handicapped people in the Trump autonomy Elaine it's up to thirty five percent are handicapped people getting jobs I mean this is an American\nEconomic renaissance that Trump has started as it's sunny and of course nobody wants to talk about it so how do you get the message at all and\nI like I said I charge savvy person at every single stop with hearing these stories and take that information and I'm not surprised that we're seeing that linked to come out of a incarceration and be able to find jobs\nAnd that's it so we can we can help them to acclimate back into society um\nThe reality is we have seven point one million jobs out there and we don't have enough people to build up so I think it's fantastic to get nice that's the training that they need to get into jobs will keep them out of trouble and keep them from the hunting repeat offenders that's it that's ... that's covering that could ever get anybody to get the job\nNothing now that that happens when you have a job and you're making money and you're contributing to society\nAnd the thing is that line or a job for a family a raise 'em a better pay raise more take home pay\nA job is not read and it's not flew in your in your you know what it is is great and so when you get a job you're right and when uh when when men and women feel better about\nTheir ability to support and take care of their family things look out for people and uh just really this is the jobs economy I mean that is incredible\nThe number of people the other thing the other auto storyline Parker with is a Trump economy and the research is we're having is the number of people now that in in\nUh in middle income jobs or um lower to middle income jobs who now feel comfortable changing jobs because there's a better opportunity for that you know before\nThis when you looked at the numbers nobody would leave a job they were in because they were scared\nLike the next job would be there long walk now that's changing so people that uh I have a better opportunity at another employer they're now moving to benefit themselves that's another whole story of this economy do you agree\nAbsolutely and and we're seeing people to have those kinds of choices and employers are competing for um poorer later for employees and because of that we're seeing wages rise and people in\nAnd and eat in under the tax plan that took effect is here we're going to see 'em that wasn't your family feel that he's two thousand dollars more each year out of their earnings and India there's one other thing that that kind of an\nUntold story and it doesn't get a lot of [noise] a lot of press on and that's the the new uh conduction for small business owners pastor small business owners\nPartnerships sole proprietorship around as corporations they're able to actually feel twenty percent of their business earnings from taxes which is what you were talking about your small business as well and they're able to reinvest that money on it now they have to\nReinvest it more into a into higher wages because they're competing for scarce labor Alistair for jobs and filling pleased you feel good about their choices out there and and that's that's a great thing too I mean it seems to me he's coming in more and more and more and\nWhat we keep reminding people out on the road is that if we want to keep this this progress\nSilliness prosperity than we do you have kids though for each has its policies and for the Republican Congress that has put in place I've actually\nNever seen a party run by raising taxes that's essentially what the Democrats are doing and the public needs to open their ears and listen to the fact that they are wedding on raising taxes\nIt's amazing raising taxes open borders lower wages unfettered immigration sanctuary cities it's it's it's their platform\nIs insane and I don't even know what their platform is other than sanctuary cities open borders jeopardy of tax cuts I I mean I have no idea and basically their their their whole policy is

it's an invasion and more\nAre joining them every day is going to be ten thousand by the time that it's the southern border now these invaders are determined to crush\nThe border and if they get through there are millions more behind them by the way they went in front of a U.S embassy and burned tires that's why you need to build a wall now look if you don't have a bore you don't have a

sheriff was running and he's a good guy share of way that they thought they were better when they got crushed and so I'm like no way you're going to win this or you're going to win this eccentric\nBut McAdams he's doing this in a little bit of a different way this guy is everywhere in Don's they teach in straw polls he's in their churches he's in their communities knocking on doors\nHe always used to win the Republican areas but he's given Donald run for his money and the words just he just had vice president Pence on Saturday came for a rally for McGahn and plus the vice president's time here with Fifteen\nTen days to go is very limited they don't go and help candidates they don't think it will because they don't have the time and he's with us now we've got some woods behind his back and some of the matter Ryan McAdams running for Congress Republican district for against incumbent\nDemocrat John ... teaching that will be determined on November sex mceachin right for a second term Brian good to have you with us Matt\nJohn good morning it's great to be with you congratulations on your your radio show being expanded into the acquisition appreciate everything that you said I I Love the elite in and I'm thinking so much to do with being with the smart\n[laughter] look I think you're you're turning this into a fight race I'm not saying that you're going to win but you're turning it into a competitive race and you're working hard also a couple of things let's start with these pipe bombs what are you are making this yeah\nWell you used to well I was listening to you and\nYou know there is no place put us in politics I think that that we've gone too far maybe on all sides demonize demonizing one another and I think we need to get back to\nTalking about ideas and solutions and and what's best for the American people and stop trying to paint each other you know as a you know the enemy is and you know we are competitors in races but we need to get back to our weather's American and that is or not this type of activity that we're seeing\nA right now with bombing or with the just the hyped up rhetoric um\nUh that we see in politics today so I'm definitely for a more moderate tone and and focusing on the things that really matter to Americans and the solutions\nSo tell me a little bit about um\nYour position on this caravan right we've got ten thousand people\nThat's basically going to bomb Russia reporter the states\nAnd write as you know even though the president\nSaid he's trying to put the military there or or um or or the or the national guard it's a it's likely that he closes the border because that would close off trade and our laws are such it's very odd Ryan because when you step one\nFoot over the border without your documents you've broken a U.S immigration and walk right you're here illegally soon as you step foot but that Ryan as soon as you step the other foot in you got three laws protecting you basically need the floors\nLaw so there's nothing we can do we can't catch and release\nYou have to process it and you can only what you can only detain them\nFor twenty days and the asylum process saying the backlog now right two years so basically you get a piece of paper and you get released into the interior of the country if you were in Congress what do you do about this ... how do you deal with it\nYeah well there's two different issues there but let's talk about the care care of their first number one as we got to stop them I think the president's gonna stop 'em there's no doubt in my mind that he's going to fall for what he said that he's not allowed him to come in and\nI mean I think the continuing to put pressure on Mexico ... he's he's done with Honduras and brought them all and said look if if you can't stop them and then we're going to start taking our money away and our funds that we've given you or whatever that looks like but I agree that it's got to be consequences countries is a allowing\nThis type of thing this caravan lawlessness that to happen across borders coming up far away so\nI think continuing to push ... number one put pressure on Mexico to stop this caravan or I don't know if they'll be able to do that you know if it's the Fifteen thousand strong now or whatever it is um but we're gonna have to stop them at the border and then the second issue is what you said is I think that we\nNeed to change those asylum laws that when someone comes in and and I know you know this but eighty percent or a bill to claim asylum will will get it um then they'll go through the process\nAnd then most of them eighty percent of them will get turned away by the courts and so there's there's just\nThere's a you know this connection between those claiming asylum and then does actually going before the court and then then being deemed that it's completely erroneous\nAnd so uh I think but but like you said the problem is is that once they they've gotten that that status\nPer se men they\nNever show up for court and then they're running amok in our country and so we've got to change that so that uh and I don't know exactly what the solution will be but we've got to change that to to wear that you know there has to be more stringent policy for people seeking asylum once they cross the border\nRoy McAdams you're right we have to close loopholes and uh if you just read some of the facts here in two thousand or one half of one percent of the illegals that cross the border claimed asylum now fifty percent claim asylum\nBy two thousand Nineteen it'll be eighty percent I mean they they just they just figured it out you companies the in the United states you get Africa look if you come in and you don't get apprehended then you don't get every headed and only Fifteen Percent are apprehended eighty five percent just\nComing out of the Fifteen Percent that actually get apprehended at fifty percent of the claim asylum and then uh\nEven though eighty percent don't qualify it doesn't matter because they're already God I mean they're ... they're handed a piece of paper and they have a hearing in two years they just\nGet on the porch [laughter] I mean it's it's singing it's Saturday\nWhat is it going out and then the president said there's and like he can't get the ...\nWall Street donors and Goldman Sachs that they don't care about it they just want cheap labor to drive shareholder value so they can make a higher bonus and screw the U.S work or they could care less energy on holy alliance going on right we have to talk about a lot of other issues I got

or fake bombs through the mail we don't know the bombs are real are fake or\nThey emptied out some firecrackers put it in a in a in the toilet paper tube and a attach a digital watch to to make it look like a scary thing we don't know it's Halloween time it's easy to scare people what can I tell you\nWe don't know and I'm not going to go down that road what I can say is whoever did it is crazy in one way or another whether they're certify bleed can be committed to an institution crazy or just the they've got a screw loose\nYou don't do that kind of normal people well adjusted people don't do that okay by definition\nPat Buchanan has a column out today very makes the point that when John Kennedy was assassinated Lee Harvey Oswald who defected to the Soviet Union was pro Cuba uh he was found to be the\nShooter or yet who got blamed for it the John birth society and all the conservatives so this is not the first time\nThat the guilt by association or let's\nLet's let's slam the conservative what's blame everything on conservatives not the first time it's been done before we even know who actually sent these packages so it's\nA everybody's got to calm down take a breath and I think Sarah Sanders had it right we should be coming together the president is calling for unity dialing down their rhetoric\nAnd the Democrats are going in the opposite direction they're they're they're blaming the president unequivocally no question about it taking responsibility whatsoever\nFor calling the guy look you describe Brennan\nSaid the president's guilty of treason what's the what's the penalty for treason death he's basically a former head of the CIA had been out they're calling for the president to be hung by the neck until dead and this is not considered inflammatory rhetoric\nI it's in it's disgusting the whole thing and it's just just hypocritical each people will go down in the all time greatest hypocrites\nJust ask you something a Curtis I think you make a great analogy places as of the Democrats to cry didn't screen than wind about cabinet\nDuring the FBI\nPart of the guy to come up with a report pretty soon we're we're we're going to find out the answer I mean why not just wait\nRight exactly how about everybody say calm down let's we got we we have the FBI on the case it less this guy was or gal or or or bought or whatever [laughter] and the tea it was that created these packages and less\nThat entity was a very very very sophisticated person or a boat or by it and if they were very sophisticated they were able to cover their tracks\nBut considering the number of packages delivered to these various places coming out of one place\nAnd there are a lot of clues there and I'm confident that the FBI will be able to figure something out here and find out who did it or narrow it down and the fact that they use Debbie Wasserman Schultz as return address\nThat's kind of interesting in itself Debbie Wasserman Schultz is the one who was forced to step down from head of the\nDemocratic National committee a because she had been reading the system for Hillary against burning I don't know what that means but it's sort of an interesting clue you know maybe somebody\nThought that was funny to use her name on all these bombs [noise] I don't know [noise] uh but my point is that\nUnless this was a very sophisticated operation that they knew how to cover their tracks at every step of the way you've got twelve packages now that the FBI is investigating let's wait for the FBI to figure this out to come up with something yeah why not wait before you start\nA ... and why not why are they not waiting because they want to politicize at least the Democrats are missing no opportunity to score political points on this\nWell it it it seems seems odd to me that that all this is happening\nBut let's wait I mean that's where everybody's saying let's wait meantime let's get to let's get the economy will get to the Taliban invasion after the bottom of the hour a\nBut let's get to the new\nNumbers that just came out the gross domestic product GDP growing another three and a half percent now let me just say what this means right this is the first time that we have had\nBack to back quarter a in a\nLong time of of of over three and a half percent growth back to back and consumer confidence uh up at an all time high consumer spending four percent another great\nGrowth this is more bad news for the dams they don't want to talk about this and they don't want to talk about the economy or jobs or they grow so what are they talking about\nAre they talking well they talking about they've got this wonderful thing to talk about this horrible thing to talk about here with the with the bombs and they talk about\nFalling into a trap and and it's their own drop a trap of their own making\nPeople don't want to hear the Democrats talk about the president they want to hear [noise] Democrats Republicans the politicians in Washington talk about what they're what the politicians are going to do for them to make their life better write\nWhat I I go to work every day I got a family to support I got a job I'd like to get a raise what are you going to do to make that happen how are we going to make my life better easier make me rich uh may make make my kids you know healthier [noise] talking about President Trump talking about you're\nA Native American DNA\nDoesn't do that [laughter]\nI wouldn't do that [laughter]\nJogging about President Trump causing the bomb scare doesn't do that so and they are going back to the ... of for the last two years all they've been talking about as President Trump is is a Russian agent and now they're President Trump as a Russian agent who create created bomb scares\nI mean they're they're they're not doing themselves any favors they and and on the other side I mean it very very clear to jobs now moms a President Trump and the Trump Administration\nHave created the best economic conditions in this country in in a generation it's the best we've seen in ten Twenty years and\nThat is goes a long way that that answers peoples' questions what have you done for me lately you've got me a job you've gotten your raise you've gotten my kids or food stamps\nGotten my kids out of the basement there on their own now great thank you very much [noise]\nLet me ask you something I'm going to pose this question and then you're going to answer it when it gets back so stay with us for another segment you got to get the bottom of the hour but I'm going\nTo ask you when you get back you know you and I were in Trump Tower for the last two weeks of the campaign don't you feel the same it's almost like deja vu all over again I mean [laughter] I mean\nI could shut my eyes and go back to two thousand sixteen and it's the same thing we're only pulled out everybody telling us Trump couldn't when it was all it was all you know whatever it was that he was going through at the time with the Access Hollywood stay with us John Kennedy's running that\nAnd uh so yeah it is there is a feeling in danger here all of these national generic ballot polls are meaningless there's not a national\nWashington Post poll that came out yesterday that shows Jennifer Wexton had a Barbara Comstock Virginia's tense district like Thirteen look like that might when she should she's the favorite no doubt that's a very tough for district for the Republicans can win barb it's tough\nBut every internal poll that the Republicans have from the White House to the end are seen seen to Barbara on down shows the race ... ... does not have a Thirteen point link but this is what the Washington Post jobs they get a uh they get a ridiculous methodology to get a fake poll to get a fake\nAnalysis of it to do fake news to get a fake conclusion drawn so they can continue on with their faith narrative and like we've only been down this path so now I'm going to start calling them on how ridiculous it isn't they're doubling down it's the same nonsense by the way you're on the John triggers radio network I Am\nGodzilla of the truth in America were eleven days out to the biggest midterm election ever

guy in the next pressure cholesterol fibrous all one wow I mean what\nGreat investigation that is this your bunker show me thing for the kingdom it's such an absolute joke it is and it's just a bumbling it's bumbling and here's the deal and I said this on\nAlgeria yesterday I don't know what the president's going to do about that it's going to do something that's number one number two whatever he does he's got to consult the secretary of state Mike Pompeo he's trying to get built Gina Haspel but they're going to do something they have to do something you have to react to this now\nI don't think he's going to cancel the arms deal because he said look I got to deal with them it's economically benefiting the country and if I can see what they're simply going to buy the weapons from China or Russia so why would I Do that here's the other people said oh the president's position has a has keeps changing\nOther than\nHe discovered the idea of scrapping the arms deal everything\nElse was on the table including withdrawing or support from the Saudi Emirates coalition and again many civil war so everything else on the table so to say that well his position keeps changing he hasn't had a position he started commentary which is of all based on new facts to come out\nAnd the Saudis have changed their story ten times did they change it again yesterday and they'll change it again tomorrow\nAs more factors come out\nSo I don't understand what they're saying the president has changes but it does have a position he's waiting for the facts to commit British job is not a politician he's a businessman here's our businessmen make decisions facts numbers spreadsheets and math\nSo as the facts come in and the mathematical equation gets put together his commentary evolves as information changes that's what are you supposed to do\nThe end of the day I don't know what the final outcome\nOf the U.S reactions you got to bake but I've been saying this all week in the middle middle Middle East on TV this president does it take well to be like it and I don't think there's any doubt crown prince Mohammed bin Solomon lights all\n\nI don't think that goes over well with President Trump he doesn't like being lied to here's the other thing doesn't like dealing with the incompetent people you have to have a lot of patients\n\nI'm telling you crown prince\nMohammed bin Salman is incompetent everything the guy at thirty three years old has gotten involved in has been a complete unknown mitigated disaster for the Saudi kingdom so eventually the father just\nHave to say you know what my son has been competed bumbling fools and I got to put somebody else in\nThe country to succeed because it's guys and capable of being Jay ... does stupid stuff including this is talk of the nation allegedly\n\nThe Saudis have now ... that'll just not a wild story are saying but that's going to change again\n\nSo who knows what the uh show ... case has here's what is it is really brought renewed focus\nThe Saudi Emirates tactics and the support that we're giving them in getting involved in the Yemen's civil war which is causing a horrific very disturbing very growing humanitarian\nCrisis where I can tell you this um on al Jazeera every day I see the pictures you do today because uh the fake news networks today they don't want to show your real news they want to talk about you know President Trump Stormy Daniels\nAnd I've been really tear out your stomach you've got children starving I mean they can eat ... they they got mother's stripping far from trees bark and boiling it just matching it up just so there's something in this in his stomach are eating grass\nI mean there's no food I mean think about having a child you're sitting there and they started that we think about how the sales\nMid mid this thing is is a horror show it is the worst in the area it's worse than anything I've seen\nAnd our involvement in it is shameful and it's absolutely shameful\nAnd if there's anything that's got to come out of this show here fair or\nWe're going to get the hell out of there as we should and it's just it it's horrific that'd be not as safe as involved in something of this nature all because you know we've got the Iranian fucking men with their nineteenth street\nPost or whatever they have\nAll right let's get the phone lines Mike in Oakland you're you're on the air Mike\nJohn\nYup\nOh yeah I agree with you on the Yemen saying I think you're exactly right about that so I I Do know that comes out of this for anything good could come out of this thing like that would be good but [noise]\nI have to point out the irony or in something you said just a few minutes ago I'm sure you didn't pick up on it because you don't agree but um you know you said the president do the the two things he doesn't like he doesn't like to be like two and he doesn't like incompetent\nAnd I I Can't help but think he must be he just wants all that to him so [laughter]\nI'm sure he likes to lie to us and I feel they're using confidence for the job so she just doesn't want to share those two things with others [noise]\nWell I guess uh I guess you'd say just tremendous economic renaissance on this booming tremendous economy we have an oldie jobs I guess you think that's the homework governed confidence I guess you\nThink the fact that we haven't heard from ISIS in that they've been kicked kicked out of the majority of their caliphate and they they now only control a tiny part of terror tore yet when he took over it was a massive I get you think that's the topic I guess\nYou think that the fact that the wacko when North Korea\nHas not start a nuclear tests since he threatened that my kitchen thing that's on top of that I get your take all these new jobs we have the fact that we just keep going up in the confidence and there's a tax cut and you've figured that's in confident so I guess your nice definition of incompetence Mike uh\nIt it is just a little\nBit different\nBut I guess it is a ... some of those things could have happened whether he was in office are not\nSure either me or we know what they were\nSomeone who was confident in that position what kind of position we would be an right thank you want to know that\nThank you for straight out\nBob economy Obama leaves office there is plenty wages are Rob

think the crown prince\nKnew about that a NBS Mohammed bin Salman\nDay I think have a lot to answer for and I think they have to be held accountable so I Do think that there has to be significant penalties that they suffer I Do think the question has to be asked\nIs does the United states believes that it can carry on a continued relationship\nWith Saudi Arabia which I Do think we need to but can that be with the crown prince I think that's a pretty compelling question I think the administration is going to have to ask that I think Congress will eventually address that and ask that to you know what will be the penalties are\nTo uh to Saudi\nArabia I listen I understand the impact of those of those\nContracts for what we're doing to supply a military uh equipment to Saudi Arabia\nI think Saudi Arabia I can be a like a a force on that is is a is a is an ally to us in the in the middle east but I don't think that it can it can be that type\nOf ally that we wanted that we need to you if this is how they're going to operate I mean we have ... you know we have principles in the United states that we that we stand by and our\nAllies have to have to abide by those and I just don't see Saudi Arabia doing that\nYou know you you point out the issue with Yemen too and you and I have talked about that before a those are all questions I think that come up and how we see Saudi Arabia operating in the range of policy scene played out and these are are\nThey are they doing the same as necessary in that region or that create stability and that and that are working in the in the best interest of\nAll involved not just Saudi Arabia but ah other allies in the middle east and listen I I I understand what they're doing that to push back against the Iranians but are are they doing things in the long term\nMoving in the middle east in the right direction I think those are questions that we have to ask them off or foreign policy standpoint and I think\nThose areas are very sobering issues that we have for\nLike ... or join agreement that seems like what you're saying is the best way to solve this is for\nCrown prince and the Harvard that solving maybe for someone else

with me John triggers radio network your Godzilla of the truth in America\nBoy that nonsense going on at the everyday got ah people like a big with hosts like if he were they just get up every day they read the paper you got the fake news you've got fake polls weeks at a big poll yesterday from the Washington Post is unbelievable I mean the Washington Post like what are they going to learn like didn't want\nTo work people say well what are they going to change a pony methodology to get it right never because they don't want to get it right because it's not about\nIt accurate poll it's about big pole driving fake news to get a fake narrative to draw conclusions that's all it is it's all why the Washington Post actually putting out a poll yesterday actually putting out a poll showing Barbara Comstock\nTrailing Jennifer ... than in the ... district by third gene point now there is no way that didn't have the thirteenth point lead over Barbara droughts like every journal bull that I have seen a top stock every German voters pay four and a lot of money\nShows is raised a dead heat or Comstock\nSlightly ahead in the Washington Post has got cops are down by Thirteen this is a complete and utter lie it has to be on fake news it is it's beyond the argument it's beyond\nThe national Enquirer what they try to do they have come out so much they want that seat so bad they want the liberals do nothing Jennifer watched it in there so bad they can taste it they want their\nLeft this and that seems so much that they will actually conducted poll make things up\nDue to such a way to get results\nTom start getting money and don't work for her it's a lost cause so\nThey do a fake poll in order to do think it's unbelievable nobody in that district is going to look you in the eye and say that they think Jennifer Washington as a Thirteen point lead this racist tied\nAnd I think Tom stock is going to win or the Washington Post doesn't care they'll not own up to any of this it either one of the New York times or ABC News or NBC or MSNBC\nOr any of the polling companies that are includes when the fake news and that's what they are it's it's it's the fake news network\nAnd it's designed to drive and could closure to make you not want to do anything to help her\n\nIf you're in the ... district go volunteer because like she is going to win this race if you get out and help her but they lie\nTo you on a daily basis and that's why the president says it's fake news and he says it's an enemy of the people when you why did the people at masquerading as a legitimate news networks with a legitimate poll is not\nAn enemy how would you define that\n\nThis poll for the poster so astronaut that even the westerns most Georgia's supporters think it's a joke\n\nBecause they know it's not true so let me just let me just ask your question\n\nIf they're putting out purposely putting out the information driving it so that the snake is that not\nThe people it's certainly an hey it's an enemy of the truth maybe the president needs to change one work it's an enemy of the truth it's certainly an enemy of fact\nIt is unbelievable they're doing it again\nThey didn't do that as a sixteen and they're doing it again things were\nNothing you don't need to start with the Democrats have learn nothing from two thousand sixteen the legacy media has learned nothing in fact what they're doing now is they can't believe they were wrong and so they're doubling down and here's the thing if the Republicans don't relinquish the house bill legacy\nMedia after two elections in a row going all and for the Democrats and losing the votes on a federal level will become irrelevant this one of the structure of them are so high there'll be irrelevant\nI\n'cause I certainly tell you the truth 'cause there are roughly\nDon't become a relevant say are doubling and tripling down on more laws\nOr more fake polls and more fake news again\nTo drive the result they want on election day again and that kind of backfired\nOn them and get\n\nThem they actually think that nobody Seventy pipe bombs that don't go off\nWe're going to get an economic report coming out in about\nForty five minutes that it's going to show another over four percent GDP Growth\nAnd their banking on hatred of Trump and somebody said the pipe bombs or don't go wash targeted at Democrats had already been influencing anything right now it's very bizarre it's very the whole thing and it's very suspicious\nAnd it's very bizarre\nRight now if you're in national Democrat here's what you have to deal with mobs and caravans and you're running against Republicans who are for jobs and country moms versus jobs in country versus terrified that\n\nAnd if they really think the caravans crossing the United states that vote rushing to the border and a clip of Fifteen thousand just coming in and getting food clothing shelter education hospital care and well let's just open up our arms if if they really think that having\nTens of thousands of illegal storming the country it's going to help them get elected know see what they were hoping for is a couple of thousand\nWith kids and babies and they'd be separated and it would be chaos and Trump would be a meaning and he put troops and they'd have bayonets and everybody\nWill be outrage and he's got to go in standard has backfired they can't control is a thousand people they could can troll Thirteen fourteen Fifteen thousand\nThat's a mob you can't control that who's funding this let me ask you this question I just have to drop Whitman will start asking everybody who's funding this what is just coming off the trees just\nFalling a you know Apple's coke and not sort of falling off the trees all along that route soap wedding is putting up a lot\nOf money to fund this I Want to know\nDon't you find that interesting I Want to know a lot of things I Want to know a lot of things Republicans are gaining the Democrats right now or in a dead panic\nThree weeks ago it was a done deal they were going to get power they were going to do investigations are going to go to\nAll of a sudden start slipping away they have a cabinet to walk all they have the Taliban debacle\nAnd Republicans get energized and start showing up and all of a sudden you got for early voting is democratic precincts at a level never been seen in history\nOf measuring the stuff this is what's going on here\nIs why I'm telling you I don't know if the Republicans are going to hold the house what's going to be darn close there's no like Seventy six fifty blow out here we are going to be up to three I Am that's got to be very close to that I think the Republicans are going to hold out\nAnd they're going to pick a boatload of seats up in the Senate are predicting five every one of these red state Democrats are going down in flames McCaskill\nAlligator God to name a few Joe Donnelly out Bill Nelson of Florida have a nice day they're all going down\nAnd the
