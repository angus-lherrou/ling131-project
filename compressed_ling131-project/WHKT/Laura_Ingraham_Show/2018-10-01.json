great luck I Know that\nMe it'd be lost in the morning because I don't think it was out there\nI tell you the truth every day day in and day out yesterday New York city where I Am live again today I\nWhen the president and our twenty minutes press conference international and domestic\nAbsolutely a masterful performance he said right there he said I'm going to get reelected there's nobody on the Democratic stage there are a bunch of light waves and here's the thing you said they can't beat me at the ballot box they can't be my academy they can't beat that success I'm having\n[noise] live gentlemen and timely journalist okay Verna [laughter] but thanks for the question we shall I say right I'll be less than\nComing up in a few minutes every fan\nJohn surgeries radio networks phone lines open and thanks for you know John and it is for you know five six four six four five six or six if you want to weigh in a you want to text me seven five seven six nine to Seventeen ten ten uh Chesapeake says I find this interesting the media often says\nDr Ford and Brett Kavanaugh why won't they used to having those title judge Kavanaugh\nThey suggest Kevin a whole lot so I don't I'm not sure about that but still try a John in Yorktown you're on the air\nJohn how are you this morning I'm Sorry go\nAhead and Johnny\nYeah I called a mark Warner's office yesterday the D.C office and you wouldn't believe the response I got 'em I weigh ins but first I called Mitch McConnell's office 'cause I was trying to weigh in on you know him standing tough and getting the confirmation\nAnd his staff are asked me why didn't call my uh to Virginia senators I said what are the Democrats dot com mark Warner's office just to see what would happen and the staffer I said you know I'm kind of appalled at how\nA young cat loves being traded and she said that the Democrat Senator or standing up for women's rights I said I don't believe that Mark Warner appears if he was in judge Kavanaugh used to be thinking along the lines right there\nAnd she said it doesn't matter what or vote against anybody the Trump puts forward I said well thanks for the representation and I you know today's times and I heard you talk about more Mark Warner the other day\nIf I was on a desert island and all the way I could get rescued his vote for a Democrat I wouldn't do it\nSo [laughter] I'm at with this that's quite a diamond will like now\nHere's the good news here's the good news honesty is the best policy and at least Mark Warner staffer was honest with you and saying that it really doesn't matter who the nominee is\nMost of that is driven by politics he has to appease his face blue Virginia there Virginia progress and also he still toying with the idea that at some point of running for president or maybe being a vice presidential pick and in order to do that he's got to burnish\nHis left wing print ... press credentials that's why I'm a college\nIt's now saying things terrible collars that are crazy that he never said before because he's scared to death of the\nOr the joker Texas in the Bernie Sanders\nAnd so we have to say crazy things\nWhich are not represent that's why Germany has zero chance at the Democratic nomination because you can't bring himself if he could be a self he'd have a shot because he was pretty damn good governor\nAnd he brings a lot of jobs and it could be quite different but he can't get the nomination by being himself so he has to be somebody who's not and when he tried to do that in politics you fail so he has zero chance of being the nominee and it's too bad because these probably better than anybody else out there\nBut that's the way now of the Democratic party and they have gone so far to the\nTo the um to the left it's a whole that they have to react to they're a very left wing base and it's putting them in a bind no question but at least in one of his office was honest they're going to vote against whoever puts puts up\nLike why even bother me with the Trump put them up no\nRight next right All right thank you for that\nFor me um you know bring a case of the thinking all along so I'll talk to you find that you know a little tidbit of information there [noise]\nI don't see what it is my friend is a good not everybody for sure because I mean think you think about what John said costs marks on his office and a staff person says Senator Warner is going to vote against anybody that Trump nominee I mean think about it I think it was a staff person saying that\nIt's not well center water has evaluated Brett Kavanaugh his credentials met with them and\nDecided that this that or the other thing he's going to vote no okay well that's ... that's legit instead you get Trump nominated him center one or two voting no it doesn't matter if he nominated Jesus Christ\nYou know it was interesting what are the things that Trump said yesterday at the press conference or their forgot to mention\nHe said you know if you set a fight nominated George Washington the Democrats would vote now All right let's get to Virginia Beach let's get to bill in Virginia Beach hey bill you're on the air\nA current or even [noise] never\nHeard about in the arts network of America and then [noise] you know is there any way 'cause these people never stuck or any kind of coal whatsoever [noise] is there any way to get to their benefactors the people who who are they're all in on the air\nOf going after a company's advertisers regardless of their positions I I've never done\nThat's what the left ah I I don't think that should be looked two wrongs don't make\nIf companies want to advertise on CNN they are going to advertise and\nCNN those those companies should not be targeted\nBecause your advertising that's what the far left or it's intimidating its meaning and they go after a lot of different company a media outlets and people in that way and I'm just not a fan for doing that just because somebody else does something that's meaning\nWrong doesn't mean that I after we have to retaliate that way I mean here's the\nBottom line if you if you don't like CNN don't watch it I mean it it's so simple and if you don't watch it you're not seeing the ads and so then if you're not being on the as you're not trying to prod I'm not\nI'm not watching it but the thing of it is we're we're not really fighting this like they were not fighting like for instance you know the gay movement now they're in corporate America and they don't get to the point where\nIf you don't support the gay lifestyle than we can't send our products to you all we can't do this or you don't support you know what the Democratic Party owns four but we're all for it that way\nSo therefore we're losing battle and they keep their people on the air constantly over and over again saying the same things over with no strings back it up like the cabin all uh you know testimonies and things that they put\nOut with nope no fan of whatsoever but they keep putting it out there and we never do anything to stop them [noise]\n[noise] well uh\nI don't think you're going to see conservatives or Trump supporters or Tea Party members or other people that might be associated with the America First movement going to a restaurant where Cory Booker is having dinner with his wife harassing them\nAnd then a threatening them and not letting them leave so that's what\nThey do have a I don't think that you're going to do we feel and maybe I don't feel like something like that not everybody all upset\nBecause look what America is turning into but there are the ones that are doing it in a little medicine sometimes some people's attitudes people get tired of this stuff [noise] you know I've never known\nPeople going into restaurants and because\nThey don't support the rest of the water in the party stands for [noise]\nThey won't they won't tell you know take their order order the that just sort of say well I'm going to serve blah blah you know that maybe there are fears that the company right or the store if you are close to getting because\nThey're always love people but they don't get on the phone and they will call and then they'll come\nTo me when I left her with her\nAs a whole new through this you know when you looked at any of those when you look at those videos and\n... I'm not a Ted Cruz man obviously a you know we battled them in the Trump and the primaries and so um and when he was in Cleveland we were not nice to him we throw them off the stage when voters hype Heidi coming down the aisle\nSo no love lost but I think with the American people say that a Senator Cruz and his wife being harassed at a\nOn video [noise] it's just it's it's not something that really fits the U.S culture and I think it's got backfire all this stuff is going to backfire so look to wrong so I Hope so right I Would not encourage anybody who is a Trump supporter to do anything\nLike what the left is doing to intimidate people because that's just kind of come back and fight and uh but doing the right\nBeing respectful things will always work out at the end when you just do the\nTrump twenty twenty reelect Ronald Romney jak will send you you can bring 'em all in to one big meaning there is nothing they could have done to motivate Republicans they can get out and vote in the midterms on November sexed\nLike those ten Democrats on the Judiciary Committee did yesterday in heart pruning\nThis man judge Kavanaugh and his family in such a spectacle\nThey just picked up all disgusting spectacle what they did yesterday or are they gear park that drinking games you know once devils try what's devil's triangle what do you live under a rock it's a quarter fear game I mean\nWhat if it's like saying well it says you're you\nPlayed a shows you that you played a part cheesy what uh what what do you read into that I'm moving to pieces\nPeople off the board and docking I also see you played soccer here do you like to get us our record and knock the other person off this is that aggressive behavior and that you drink more beer\nAnd get more sorry cards do not call the pieces off and put them back into play what this is what this is what they had yesterday\nIt was an embarrassment beyond belief the Democrats embarrass himself and I'm you know I for Trump but it's not like I'm a I'm a Republican and you know that\nI don't like the Republicans to be honest with you most of the time\nIt is the most\nEnergizing thing they could have ever done to bring up opposition against them and they are going to live this will than for for\nAt least two cycles this will hurt the Democrats it will cost them and they're going to look back\nAnd how they handled this when they lose [noise] and the Republicans got a big six picks up the hold on now it's going to be you took about the blue wave forget forget that\nEmpty yesterday and they did to themselves\nI talked to so many Democrats last night at several events that I was on a who were just privately and these are these are high powered Democrats you know not that crazy partisans that just watch Kavanaugh stop because they think it's going to be the end of the world [noise]\nI'm going to tell you I talked to five of them yesterday high powered at various events in New York City and of course you know most Democrats are there\nAnd they were they were attached to this I mean they were just they were white over it because they know what I was saying to them last night they were like shaking their head yes we're gonna we we have\nThere's nothing you meaning me Trump people there's nothing you could have done to help yourself like we just sit for you in the past nine hours\nAre let's go to the phone lines for NATO John anything for you know five six for six let's get to Robert in the next thing you have been so patient Robert thank you for waiting so long you're on the air sir\nYes sir [noise] you know I'm John I think we might be missing the point of all there [noise] I I truly believe that this has nothing to do with a judge Kavanaugh often though there is a is an effort to stop anyone from\nBeing pretty court justice who would be your abortion I truly believe that if one of the main a reason that all this is happening and I think if that wasn't\nAccusations of they're not they would have been stopped and now they're desperate that that's why they act in the way they did yesterday they're so desperate to keep somebody off the Supreme Court that might overturn roe versus Wade because that's a\nThat's a big moneymaker for them that they get a lot of vote because of that\nAnd uh I I just think a deeper than we think [noise]\nWell you know one of the questions ah yesterday and I don't I I was watching it for so long I don't remember who asked um or who brought it up or maybe it would then it was one of the media feedback so I don't remember but but somebody said well you know\nGorsuch\nIt didn't happen to him and they said it didn't happen to them because there were no allegations of sexual assault and\nTo myself it didn't happen to him because Neil Gorsuch was chosen to replace Justice Scalia who was a very conservative justice so justice\nGorsuch\nMade no difference to the makeup of the Supreme Court in how they vote it was one serving of replacing another conservative the difference here with Kavanaugh\nIs Kavanaugh is replacing Justice Kennedy who was the swing vote\nSo that's really what the differences that's exactly what you're saying I think the difference here his cabinet I'll becomes the swing vote gone conservative their champion Kennedy who they\nCould rely on all the time but some of the time now they don't think they can roller we're like the the the left on Kavanaugh ever\nSo the court swings right and they go crazy and they think it's the end of the world\nI think your odds of something and thank you Robert thank you for the call thank you so much phone lines open for John aid for five six where six we also want to thank Robert inland extra for his patients he was on hold about\nTwenty minutes and I really appreciate that we don't like to uh we try not to uh make uh people on that long so we apologize for that let's get to um show is he in Richmond Josie you're on the air\nWell good morning I had a few points to make that others may try to do it\nBy the way I had a similar experience [noise] by the boy next door was attending Georgetown perhaps school\nAfter you know decades primary\nAnd he didn't know how to handle it was a motion he was sixteen I was fourteen and we were just coming out of our time where we were like the whole gang that was in the neighborhood we all played horse play

wait until as close as possible for the phone so that they would maybe get the vote after the um [noise] I'm bringing November elections in the mid term elections I think that was just\nSo obvious and I really don't don't think that this woman is really\nSomething to really believe [noise] and that's why I wanted to call in and just make that point I think the other points were also correct\nTo and the fact of NATO Feinstein holding the letter the whole screen is is just you know [laughter] it's like another little pointed Herman Cain was running for president did the strange thing to him and it

crew [noise] and she has so many people in these [noise]\nAnd willing to do that can be politicized upon the clock so when you look at the lawyers [noise] higher coordinated with Diane Feinstein you look at the fact that she scrubbed all her social\nFor social media I think the liar I didn't feel I don't want to get into a theater it did and I don't think it'll happen\nBut I Believe our cabin out over there\nWhy why yeah well you know if that's the definition of it I Believe it to you you brought something up that uh we never really talked about on my show we talked about not knowing how she got their how'd you get home what the house was and that Rinaldi inconsistency\nBut you know the lie detector test that was kind of garbled or because you didn't know where she took it how it was done what the results were who paid for it\nI mean that didn't check out either that that whole things seemed I'm a little odd to me um I also want you to stand on Susan Collins you said earlier that Susan Collins is the kind of in this whole debate here is kind of the an unsung hero I'm a fan of Susan Collins I'm a big fan of hers everybody\nKnows that don't always agree with her\nI didn't know yeah I'm a big fan of yeah and and\nAnd I don't always agree with her a she's a she's a moderate but I've always found her to be a very odd it's a very honest politician I mean she tells you the truth and she's she also happened to you bump into the hallway or something and she is super nice but\nUh you you said she's kind of the the the young son a champion here why you know when did that in some detail\nBecause from my understanding her arm\nTo the Senate staffers wondering is Sherry Mindy\nOne shot in the nurse's office not hers and also from one of the leaders [noise] one of them are one of the grocery store and most powerful and important work on the nomination\nFrom the get go I mean these board allegations of cold water came out she was approached by mark how scared I don't know anything about quite a workout\n[noise] one workout initially wanted\nThe lay of the investigation you eat in Seoul Murkowski\nWhen she was in the calls that\nThe price it after a while I'm sick or ... why don't we have an FBI gratification is closed doors with but I don't know why [noise] Suzanne Collins type ... and she was in college in the very beginning would not go along with that said that one she wants to confirm break\nRight now and to me she didn't agree with the way this process of these allegations were coming out she had argued with Murkowski [noise]\nAbout it and that should also show you what a profile in courage\nI'm Wondering what we used all Murkowski is when it comes to live with it she felt so strongly about that she should have just come out herself she would only have done it if she Murkowski Collins had gone out with her as well because they're both females and wants to tank columns showed\nHere and I found a lot of problems with her um although I I you know maybe in hindsight I don't anymore because then it died she didn't want to play the genocide Elliot car and she why tapping outlook she look here's the other thing that Merkel here's the other thing and they keep saying well we won't get\nThat power will get confirmed\nThe president would have only one choice if he polls if he polls cabin out it would be a dominate the hurt\nHim right for because people like me who are calling for power from the beginning because of the way she signed it already attacked her faith in her life\nI Would say you know you you gave us ... you know what I mean we would have that we heard from the smartest people in the room with her [noise] although I Know Don McGahn really push cabin up through [noise] we heard from everyone you know and it had to be this book she no no no no you're giving us what we want now and he would have been amenable to that\nPresident so I think she was also saying to Murkowski that she was confident with um what she has stocks were cabin now in terms of roe v way that he was the job so she wanted and I'm ... I'm looking for all the way you telling me one thing is going\nTo make calls or abortion illegal member of the way it would be overturned and then we'll see you know that God wants never\nBe an accident in the sand that one so I'm really not a tactic that will never happen\nAnd it's really a strong man argument but I agree with you a hundred percent on Kavanaugh as it relates to him and kill me I was also in favor of Amy Coney Barrett that was my first choice and it's like be careful what you wish for right\nBecause if something happens that when a cabinet nominations does now\nDon't you agree with me now President Trump will nominate maybe combing beret the following day\nWould hope so I think he should nominate or even during the next vacancy that we have hopefully the next ... next year yeah but she she should be at the what was it just kind of an eye on what you think what you're talking about though\nNominated with him I Believe right now is sixty three and a college course it was ... I I forget job of course that\nMakes me when he was the one\nOh what do you like the one the one okay so you know better than me and then you can get Barry\nOn I mean what do you have John he's already remains the bench for Thirty years so [noise] so I think but I think that you should be the next nominee I think that it [noise]\nBut I think that look the um [noise] I think the price going to have really played this well I like the fact that the president look on the first one to tell everyone that somehow Donald Trump believe it or not is not play three dimensional chess\nSometimes sometimes when you hear people on like on a certainly networks don't understand pulling your just pouring checkers\nI been there on this day and then she did it because some of the Ford allegation came you didn't say anything for four or five days and he let it all materialize\nOut and then he started at ... and then he started attacking the process\nMhm you started attacking the process and I thought that that was smart and that's something I think that states only\nBeen a very good about this I'm so weak that Saturday's ought to be very loyal the cabinet and I hope that this is do or die we don't get through after all this week we'll lose but certainly the one thing it Shawnee these showing lumping all polling Republican are\nBecoming more engaged now and they are furious about this\nWell I think it's going to backfire on the Democrats because\nLast uh there's nothing that you and I or Steve Bannon or Corey Lewandowski or anybody else that support 'em [noise] Trump networks for camping or political action committees or anything else nothing we could have done\nTo motivate Trump voters more than the Democrats have done with their Kavanaugh clown shall I mean people and I talked to are coming out of the woodwork they're pissed off and they're going to turn out on November strict and I think as a result of that\nThe Republicans are going to win and when Nancy Pelosi wakes up on November seventh and she's not speaker you know what she's going to do blame Dianne Feinstein for this whole mess that's what's going to happen\nDamn I've only got a couple of seconds make your prediction\nWill the Kavanaugh will be delayed for a week or more\nI I think it's going to be away from the certain days I think that's so whenever that come hopefully by the end of this week the late ... I think I think that what the engagement too I think that also that the reason why because I think it's been a because what the Republicans being so upset about it rank and file\nI'm sure they get all politics for five minutes can they do they know everybody says no we want more politic hardcore All right so I don't know what's gonna happen the next week here a what would you know [noise]\nRectal exam and puts scope up there see what's going on and so is that six or the number seven I don't know what they're going to find out in the FBI we understand ABC injury ports that you're talking to a ... remains 'cause we don't know if that's true because the fake news are so that might be true might not\nYou know you used to get a news report\nFrom ABC NBC CBS or Washington Post or New York times or whatever you know some major outlet Chicago Tribune things like that [noise] Miami Herald\nYou get a news report and you don't know whether to believe it or not now except for the Associated Press a pie that's probably the last\nThing and probably if you're in if you're traveling international algae era right other than that if you're in the U. S. A. T. I trust the people come into the eight people wire I'll buy anything else I don't know some ABC says\nThe FBI is meeting with Debbie Ramirez in\nFive of her friends I don't know if that's true if they made it up do you have any idea they make all the stuff I mean I just put up an interview I did with Lara Trump and uh it's a pretty good pizza but\nI'll tell you what I remember during the campaign the Trump campaign NBC News reported that the Trump campaign pulled out of Virginia you remember that\nThat they pulled out of Virginia fake net and it was fake nobody called me I was the chairman and when he called her being out he was the director and nobody called the Trump campaign they just\nYou know Corey Stewart linked to the whole story after he got fired and NBC just went with it because if it their narrative that uh the Trump campaign was falling apart\nAnd they were pulling out of the battle cry on stage and I went on thirty seven interviews and five days and still couldn't stop it I remember my son in Reno\nCollege professor jak at the University of Nevada calling me up three days later and saying hey dad what happens you campaign of Virginia I heard you guys pulled out there they're far you know somebody set I'm like I don't know how you talked about\nOh I just saw him over the last ... just NBC News scroll on the bottom of my TV screen\nIt's unbelievable thinking is so you don't watch lying we're truth ... you don't know\nThat's the problem a day and age for eight oh John and I had just gotten off the phone with Eric Trump who committed just several million dollars when you needed in Virginia\nThey committed to the vice president coming to northern Virginia on Saturday the president coming on Sunday doesn't sound like you're pulling out of state when you get the BP\nAnd the president committed to the final weekend drew you\nOf course not plus we got to to help me in the ... ... dollars for advertising [noise] ...\nFor you know John shows just sounds like you're on the air\nIs Johnny hey did you watch debate between the story and [noise]\n\nUm I did not know okay a reason why I saw it on Facebook or they got a little clip Stewart's a Facebook\nPage I assume that he said you know want to release the names of of the senators and congressmen who paid off their shoes ers hush money yeah let me and\nSo he says and then they cut it off our response to that and I wish they would have kept it out because that that would tell you a lot\nWell rounded off center dumb it's a dumb question because uh you can't do that is illegal so\nThat can only be that can that that can't get done that can only be done by the that committee so that can't be done like like teen can't release those right that that's the only by law right that can only be released by\nThe full congressional committee so they wouldn't have to go now to gain of anything is doing that but that's a that's a dumb question\nCouldn't even say that he works Iran set released\nSure but he's not on the committee I can say I want to release also but that's not too much snow was that movie\nCame out in the air inside that that would put some pressure on the\nTonight Show I guess so you know so there may be Cory gets thirty nine percent to thirty six percent I mean [laughter] who cares\nYou know and I just don't care about the response\nThat's good to know that you know that he couldn't do nothing but I still think that if it's there we started putting some pressure I mean if if it started getting our and everybody started the man I think there will be forced to\nOr ... and let the chips fall where they may you know there's certainly some Republicans in there too but just let the chips fall where they may let's let's bringing out in the ... that was our morning\nI agree I agree\n'cause there's no one else up under ... we've seen a bribery earlier what do you think about\nThe terminal hairs are worried about like\nOh man who doesn't you know they got some garbage on that guy\nYou think\nAnd the one the one beer threw me off to that came out of nowhere showing one beer it's like hey look man I've watched so many cops shows where where they pulled a guy out a poet guy over and say how many years yeah I only have one in the stomach and far never say one beer because when you say weren't that many five or six\nI mean I I guess you and I were the only ones who said this but I along with the airplane and she couldn't remember this and that or whatever the the one thing got me like\nI mean you're going to go back thirty seven years to party that you can't remember how you got there I got home where it was\nBut you can remember going in the party thirty seven years ago and that you had exactly one beer\nLike the question should have been well what type of beer was michelob Miller PBR I mean can you tell me that like what was in a bottle can was it in a glass of a draft like what what beer where was the beer once a day let's see wherever you can advocate\nWas it a new wind gold aura Schaffer did you go into the shape for the shape for circle\nWasn't a balance time those are all the beers in New Jersey New York and Connecticut that are now probably\nOut of business when I was in the balance time with the ... was it or was\nThat they are and how how hard it was ... who can wind up here\nLike did you take it out of a cool or did somebody handed to you mean if you give if he can remember that you only had one beer I Would think you could remember all the details of that here was a beer warm or cold once in a back then thirty seven years ago I don't even think they had a light beer\nSo what what type of deal with it I mean or\nShower or to drink and exactly or or did now I remember I\nRemember during all going to a party where I have here\nI I mean if you ask anybody in America go back thirty seven years to party tell me how many beers you track like one one beer garden I mean there's nobody can do that\nProbably why I didn't know if I had beer maybe you had you know apple cider spiked herself what the hell knows I mean it's the whole thing but as our\nBut up until the trash and she was drunk shoes are Fitzgerald charm this party you know that's what it would ever happen after that happened and that was impression everybody you're also came up with this war on beer\nOne beer that yeah so so I mean that right there I think\nWe should do there should be a Las Vegas should get a uh what type of beer was and probably the top five would be I guess Budweiser tops because you didn't remember\nYou're in Connecticut but you kind of federal Ritchie place but they don't know what police what so maybe the kids got it and they probably what the cheap here so it could be any of these five Budweiser top school ribbon

laying about how this disaster for the Republicans in the ... and you only give it a a straight they can keep doing that\nBut let me give it to you straight the treatment of Brett Kavanaugh has been so abusive\nAnd so beyond the pale of what regular Americans believe in the right thing to do at the end of the day when you get rid of the partisans on both sides\nAnd\nLook at middle America the people who elected Trump they have a sense of fairness and they think what this man has been through all the polls are showing this is beyond the scope and they're\nLet's see I Believe has woken Trump supporters and conservatives up that would have otherwise stayed home they don't like the Republican Party they don't like ... you know like any of the Republican there Trump supporters they believe in the sky\nBut they were not going to come out in the midterms they just they don't even know they don't care but this you have little match under Trump voters like and I've said this I'm saying that again there's nothing the Trump campaign could have done\nTo get these people out like the mistreatment that people are saying of Brett Kavanaugh and Josh homes to is the chief of staff or Mitch McConnell said\nLooking at some point in it he tweeted out\nLooking at some poll numbers this morning it's impossible to overstate how important the Kavanaugh hearings have been to the voters it's like dropping a grenade\nInto the electorate teams in red states are not gonna like these numbers [noise] they're all going down you know Americans have a sense of fairness and it cuts\nBoth ways it's not partisan if everything was flipped and the Republicans were doing this they would get punished by the electorate Americans have a deep sense of fairness\nThat's where the reactor to the kids being separated from their families and\nAll that they don't like that Americans don't like on parents they don't like people not treated well I mean it's it's the American way they don't like it and so just before the midterms they're experiencing this you cannot get away from the Kavanaugh\nHarry I think this has been our major topic the last what three three weeks\nI don't even remember when I talked about something else so everybody is talking about that even people that are not involved in politics and there's a sense of fairness in this thing is going to blow up and the Democrats face like you've never seen it\nAnd there's gonna be a predicted there's gonna be a massive turnout of Trump supporters and Republicans and in the country\nOn the metro you're going to get the biggest percentage of voters turnout in these midterms than you ever had in that favors the Republicans are they going to keep the house and they're going to getting five or six seats in the Senate\nAs a result of the Democrats shenanigans and they can't help themselves they're gonna keep doing it it's got to go on next week again\nAll next week\nAnd they have little match it's like there's a gasoline

two thirds I'm not even sure they got\nFifty percent and that was the end of that but uh and it costs the Republican a lot because it didn't make any sense that was just me though back that I don't
