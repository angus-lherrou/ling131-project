waters libertarian incumbent Tim Kaine Democrat ran for vice president and a chain the overwhelming prohibitive favorite in this race\nThe big question is can that water gets a temper Senate if he does then the libertarians get a spot on the Virginia ballot for how long has it\nWent through and I believe it's five years five years out there\nIn his five years and then they basically are they become a third political party in Virginia so the stakes for wars in the libertarians\nAre very high maintenance shift gears a minute let's go to this caravan now five thousand people make his way up through Guatemala if you are in the Senate or what would be your position right now on us\nI certainly I Would I Would you say a little differently I mean first of all there's no doubt that the crisis in Guatemala Honduras and El Salvador writers Thursdays\nIt was something we need to sit down to the leaders of those countries and have a conversation I have to put Mexico that mixture because they're coming right through Mexico um you know what I think it starts there I I Would I Would I Would rather than a ticket and approach\nI Would almost say a thief humanizing approach to their ... and and very angry or killed approach for the Trump is going I Would take that much more diplomatic approach to how how do we solve this problem rather\nWell that's another thing very long term medical center in ... you know that's a very long term view let's all sit down and I guess it ends up getting more money\nTo uh to these countries that you just said you would cut off so no money's going to get involved according to Matt waters for thousands of five thousand people are coming right now there's ... they're coming now not tomorrow or next week now they're coming out their objective is going to make you go get the southern border\nFive thousand of them cross a thousand or be apprehended we ever hear about twenty percent the other eighty percent you'd never find them again and up to twenty percent would you ever hit eighty percent of them uh end up not returning for one every piece of paper they give them\nTo go back to court or whatever and they can't separate them from their children we've already been through that kids in ... Brian K drink before the midterm something can happen\nSo basically they are getting scot free if you don't do something what would you do\nYeah no I I look at church or roller party me some of us are open border if I was actually I don't share that\nI Believe in higher border security we need to stop like I should make good press pass so so what\nWould you say anything to them I mean you need to have a nice either either guard I looked like planets to pull the forty two thousand troops you know out of Germany but among the southern border for fifty thousand Japan for the southern border for twenty eight dollars an hour South Korea but I'm a southern boy we'd have a pretty good forced out that the spent our money defending his country\nRather than the countries around the globe\nNow we're talking about now we're talking to me that's a plant\nLet's get or a troops out of Germany Japan and where else South Korea South Korea and get them out and let's put them on the southern border in that solves your problem and there is no increase\nCosts now there's an argument against them in in South Korea for a lot of reasons but why we have twenty eight thousand troops in Germany and all those troops Japan makes no sense whatsoever\nTo anybody except those that want to perpetuate the military industrial complex and make money off supplying these troops over the low because the other day Matt if you just follow the money in Washington it's really easy to just\nFollow the money and you find what it's all corrupt you got to follow\nIt and you're going to find out where does who's backing who what the donors are Wall Street smart at Goldman Sachs big donors that's all you have to do it's easy thing if you gonna run out [laughter] exactly that were on ... what is what's your website\nYeah that was dot com check it out and uh\nBottom of the mat orders not combat thanks for being being with us and good luck of having one again before November sex Curtis Ellis coming up give it right here\nFor what he described as weak immigration laws that have allowed undocumented migrants to enter the U.S the Republican controlled Senate and house\nThis year has rejected multiple immigration bills including one backed by the president that would have combined\nBorder security funding with other measures sought by the Democrats as I discuss with a Senator Tim Kaine to keep cog in this chain migration the Democrats can do for DACA and they can go for a wall and they can go for the funding but they absolutely want chain migration because that gives them democratic votes\nAnd the Republican donors on Wall street back that too because that brings them cheap labor along with the illegals\nBut the president says I don't want chain migration because that puts a lock on the American economy I Want migration that is based on job skill and job needs to win the immigrant comes into the U.S they have a job\nAnd they can contribute to society just like Australia does and the man child trigger do does in Canada if the man child can do it so can wait\n\nThe prison goes out to say today I Am watching the Democratic party led because they weren't open borders assault on our country by Guatemala Honduras and El Salvador\nWhose leaders are doing real to stop this large flow of people which I'm calling in and invasion as me not Trump including many criminals from entering Mexico to the U.S the president wrote in his three part tweet he said in addition\nTo stopping all payments to these countries all payments which seem to have almost no control over their population\nI must of the strong survive terms as to Mexico to stop the onslaught\nAnd if and able to do so I Will call up to you as a military and simply closer southern border close it means no one will come in and they'll be fifty thousand troops there you simply are not going to come in and there'll be a stand up for days and they're going to have to figure it out and then there'll be cameras on the other side saying people starving I mean this is what's going on here\n\nThe president and it that the border security is far more important to him than that then the recently concluded new North American free trade deal\n\nNow a a spending package passed by Congress a month ago put off a debate over uh getting the money for the for the wall and effectively pushing back fights the Republicans want to avoid before the midterms\n\nA record number of asylum seeking families from Latin America have recently overwhelms our current border agents and immigration authorities or having another surge of illegals coming in border patrol facilities are crowded with newly arrived families bed space it's family detached\nOur growing because they keep coming in and we simply can't process them and we can't arrest them and send them back we already tried that and went through kids in cages and you're Nineteen days for the midterm since you got to be no more pictures of kids separated from\nTheir parents so all you have to do now before that night Nineteen days is up is grab a child if it's yours because it doesn't matter grab a child and your family and you're going to get entry to the United states because the politicians are now on the Republican side petrified of kids in Cajun\nSo they're going to win again\nAnd the president knows he can't come back this politically because the PR the PR is a disaster Nineteen days for the midterms so he says well here's what I'm going to do I'm going to deport them military here's a problem with that here's the problem every solution right now Nineteen days has consequences\nIf it was November seventh there would be easier to easier to do you're going to get the military at the border they're going to be with guns confronting miles with baby that's going to be all over the New York times\nBecause these people in the fake news media they want open borders open borders even though it means that it's the end of their jobs\nAnd their businesses and they'll have no money in the country will collapse they don't care because they know that there will be the elites and there'll be fine and then they will rule over the rest of us poor slobs\nThe pro terrorists\nBut I mean I I don't even know how to even put this in in the logical terms\n\nMean what is it even want to ask Tim Kaine he had to admit I'm not far overboard it's I'm not for these people coming over I mean but you know that the Democrats are going to defend it and they are now calling them economic refugees oh we're not accepting refugees we you know where's the richest country in the world is not\nAnd then there'll be saying on CNN it's not who we are it's not who we are well here's who we are we're broke\nOur schools suck that's who we are we're Twenty one trillion dollars in debt\n\nAnd now we've got a growing number of people in our schools are don't speak the language\nAnd it goes on and on and on and on and on that too we our

the last week so things are wrapping up\nSo this is only the Democratic side no Republicans have gone up there right\nNow [noise] you know this is talk of course about John ... and or Jeff blank running against Donald Trump for the Republican nomination\nThe white paper here in New Hampshire just last week I was pretty certainly take on Donald Trump\nI'm a ... you know two years or ... any time in that Republican primary where a sitting president has been challenged it's getting on the right job and these guys will be running on the left they really wouldn't have a prayer\nFeeding the president in the Republican primary\nRight now right now that's that's right now anything can happen goodness knows who have handled that\nCan happen any thing of course and especially you know God Forbid the economy collapses\nRight right that's the way it was like no one like that but if but if what if mother drops a big one things can change All right let's let's shift to the Democratic nomination and I'm a credit primary where I think we're four hundred and Seventy nine days away something like that from the Democratic primary hamster [laughter] it was great\nBut no that's why I think it's I think it's smart Chris for you to to be talking about just stop and go to college they did the president shall I stopped as you well know there's there's all kinds of things happening behind the scenes right now\nThis is where it happens right the pros probably isn't that right bro frozen out [laughter]\nAnd come the day after November's election\nCandidates start killing things in a more public way but like I said senator or Joe a branch from New York which op hearing yesterday with the Democrats can't pay a candidate for governor in New Hampshire and show she's laying the groundwork she's\n... and you know she's doing that all across the country and um [noise] ah so she's\nStarting to to put things together\nI'm Alec Baldwin seems silly I'm sure you've heard about it to the guy who's making\nRounds you think he made his second trip to New Hampshire just this past weekend really fine tune the last six months\nAlec Baldwin\nAlec Baldwin in New York and he has not ruled out running for president\nThank you Mike we're back in the news this morning it was my comment in my producer of the show looking at we're making news this morning Steve bullock this one that was a\nYoung Alan Alec Baldwin has some spoke at the largest fundraiser for the Democratic party in New Hampshire I just last week yeah\nWow see the ran his old out Goldman is Jack Ryan you know it's kind of my ... yet but [laughter] that was back in the Cold War you know a hundred October that's right yeah\nSo so who else you've seen up in in New Hampshire into is huge asked to be the front runners in the New Hampshire primary today likely to win the twenty twenty\nPrimary in February of next year year after next [laughter] Bernie Sanders running for president he will be the front runner okay yes no doubt about it now I'm In New Hampshire no doubt about it\nIf he got a ... a little bit so Warren will likely be the front runner\nOkay so how 'bout what recently happened was Senator Warren in New Hampshire how does that play with her I mean bumbling\nDemocratic circles I actually don't think it's not as much a liberal Democrats are going to be looking for a liberal Democrat regardless of facts [laughter]\nYou know they\nThey they their their choices in possession primarily on emotion\nAnd Jesse parents from a I was just going to do if you heard that\nVery a veteran democratic operative in in Iowa was describing a I'm a ... scene but in reality in the in the Democratic vote during the primary but they also want to win and they might go you know I don't think seniors can win nationally I think you'd\nGo downstairs or they know I'm a Republican I think a little bit but Warren would have a similar problem I don't think she's electable in a in a general election nationally\nNationally okay yeah I like to talk to you know for that using I'd be an issue as an example I think so I thought one thing I Will say though I I don't think it affected her here in New Hampshire I Do think it affected them\nAgain the behind the knee operation\nAnd and you know the all the maneuvering going on behind the scenes among potential democratic candidate for her to actually take over a news cycle before the election the way she did was outrageously self serving\nHim literally [laughter] who does that why why would I mean if you knew the results of the DNA test and it was counter to your narratives that you're trying to look after you put that thing up midday on Christmas [laughter] have you been buried right you know [laughter]\nI don't understand it so how do you think okay so you got Sanders worn just because this New Hampshire but the other guys have got to go up there and compete or do they have to they might say just setting you\nKnow I think they do I think that you know because there's always get the opportunities and that is as you probably know Chris ... the bill Clinton made a name for himself by doing well and and coming back to to win at a time when she was losing\nSo you don't have to wait in the New Hampshire primary to make to make a lot of waves across the country so\nEspecially if the war's the front runner she's from Massachusetts neighboring Massachusetts the Kennedys who comes in second and third or a kitten getting all that time as a result\nYeah cause I think Clinton finished third right yeah that's right yeah so so but you have to win place your show in New Hampshire to advance you have to\nYeah that's right that is correct\nAnd I just I don't think people understand about the the democratic nomination process this cycle is that California has moved up yeah and they're going to happen that's expensive snake and Kamala Harris comical Harris is going to have a big lead there\nYes and that's the I think that's going to be the interesting thing I didn't hear you guys talked about this with but on the island\nGiven the California moved up will she tried well we'll see try and pick a state to do was to try and do well in all of them and um you know 'cause they're so different types of early primary states compared to California\nWell again I think you have to at least try to compete in some of these because\nThe reality is even though you might not win New Hampshire you won't matter in the the uh the nomination legitimately so\nYou still have to win in the in the electoral college that term because you don't you can't you can't just blow past Iowa New Hampshire because those are those who have gone in either direction especially with Trump winning Iowa last time that's right no doubt about it what issues are driving New Hampshire voters these days what's going on up there\nAnd get what they expect that uh the economy is there still the number one issue um the governor here is a Republican Christian you new ingenious and uh about what's what Donald\nTrump spin to an end and governor Sununu the economy booming we have the second lowest unemployment rate in the country then Tom are the Democrats don't want to talk about that they're trying to talk about anything but the economy\nWith a family paid leave issue ... they're just trying to make up an issue that might connect with voters other than the economy\nSo that's going to continue to the number one the second issue here Chris I don't know how it worked in other states certainly hurt Donald Trump even talk about this is the opioid epidemic to a which is pretty ... pretty severe in New Hampshire so that's the second biggest issue\nReally that's that's yeah you have to say the number that it's affected our number here we've had we've had that disease in in our family as well and it's a it's a ... member people dying as a result of that is the doors or anything else they ties country and it happens it's going to handle it but I don't think that's part of the news [noise]\n[noise] so it's not a partisan issue Mike a sign of predictions what do you think coming out with got thirty seconds punch it when he got for the Democratic nominee in the Democratic finishers in New Hampshire twenty twenty\nI say it's got to go Elizabeth Warren will win a ex she runs she's going to win\nThe New Hampshire primary nominee I there is going to do I I think there's gonna be stuck in kind of dark horse like a um a Cory Booker I expect will be somewhere in the\nTop three on Iran and then you know what I I I Would not be surprised if someone like Michael Bloomberg long ... as well because I think the Democratic\nHow how well you know we're not all that time and I don't believe it or not\nI mean he nor nor should you should anyone in politics it's constant but how do you how do you compare the intensity this year till the last year\n[noise] pretty similar I think we we're we're very proud particularly in Virginia last year when we send a message to the country into the world that you don't have to make a tree happened at a place\nHere and that we were open and welcoming for business when the election of governor north on and his team and then you know that that first set\nOf a house candidates they cross the finish line that just beautiful tapestry\nOf um of of of our our candidates\nThat are women and a diverse women and I just it just ... you know so that was that was really great but I think what's happened is people realize we how we can do this we can do this and it's just\nHow I mean we've seen for example the search and the absentee ballots seeing 'em in Fairfax County and Orange County which are a number one and two right now in the state or requests for absentee ballots you know that's good for us\nThat's when I think we're just added you know adding more excitement and enthusiasm right\nLike Clinton did was on earlier seven o'clock hour he said he thinks the turnout was going to be forty to forty five percent and large it's a large range and there but we're projecting turn out right now\nWe're just going out there looking for every single vote at the\nStore [laughter] I Know where do you think it's kind of getting your average mid\nTerm elections which normally a hard but we have a reason to get out there is a lot at stake and um and a sandwich going to be better than your average and they turned it on you know I'm not in the business of of that we're just going to we're we've just reaching out or we can\nYou're describing\n... we're in a T. V. now famous than we are just trying to get a virus and bring over anybody else that wants to count\nThe been impressed with your with your crop of Kansas this year and last year they they definitely worked hard what struck me as a sort of an obvious one is that the predominant a female candidate nominees\nRight I it just it definitely the year the women are like to talk about our women candidates and then I got an e Anthony Flaccavento out in the night [laughter] I mean\nJennifer Wexton is is I mean and they're all they're they have a different kind of experience and diversity but it is all good and it will be a good refreshing brass\nOn for Congress and across some crops up autonomy some states that are in general for waxed and up there in the ... congressional district ...\nWe're really excited about what we see up there um the volunteers are just showing up on non stop and the Washington Post indoor stroke which\nIs something that I'm a you know I Am Barbara Comstock got endorsed every other time when they were very disappointed at her and she's still after Donald Trump and that proved not to be the case so her time so cheerful ... going to be on a congresswoman and then\nDown in the office from doing real quick if you want to ask me something about him but we will garner lane L'Oreal and the second district a retired navy commander in a small business woman and of course\nScott Taylor got his own his own problems will stop or you know\nStaff put ... dos signatures on the ballot I mean that's you know that's unheard of stop that's pretty St Louis and I think it was either ... going to reject that mix but even that we you know without that we still have to sign you know could credible candidate\nWell what I've what I've seen in your in your tennis yeah those are the obviously a female when I think it sends regardless of the outcomes and we can talk about polling in and out comes in November and you know when kids got a tailor up and\nHe's got less than up and co burn and then and then you Williams and Louis in the in the six when I think it's sending a signal though is that you're going to see even more women in the future running for office regardless of party and I think it's a very healthy dynamic\nYeah yeah and I want I Want I Would say two things aren't real quickly really excited that Leslie cover just got me to get kids are reading the blame 'em programs or the D triple seats that ... thing I think you're exactly right about women women have always um [noise] um [noise] women have\nAlways study showed yes but you know then the ones\nThat would not have your mom would agree with me on gas would have\nBeen harder some things don't go [laughter] go the way\nI got raise my kids I got to get my degree that's helping alliance you know I mean you can do it better and I think really one of I guess if you have to say good outcomes of twenty six teams would limit decided well not white me anymore we step\nOn live among some to offer and I think\nThat you just see more and more of that because\nSomeone Saturday saying otherwise you know if you're not to table you're on the menu and you can look at what is that state this year with women's health care with families with health care in general you know we're not allowed to add to that and I just don't think we're going to step back a little more\nNo no no I don't I don't think you should and I think having the frankly it's not just that there are women but they're but they're in a certain age range to relatively speaking to me a couple of you know what to order a little bit younger but for the for the most part you're you're center cut on mom's right the suburban mommies isn't isn't strong voting I Wanna say block but a market\nThat I I think your party is obviously intentionally trying to attract\n... correct correct and I'm very suburban moms some of them have voted for Donald Trump\nI think can see the ramifications of that and we're reaching out and talking to them and particularly when you take something like the Kavanaugh's nomination where you know set\nAside the fact of whether you didn't dinner getting delayed doctor for this was a man who championed we saw back his chapter on there that is not fair\nTo Josh and then add on to the fact of you know her very compelling touched her testimony and on and and they you know Republicans decided not to believe I Believe there's going to be on the patients from that\nOkay um let's talk about allegedly Coburn moving from into the\nThen you're you're making a newspaper in the John Fredrickson radio show this morning we had the other folks make news about ethanol in Iowa and Steve bullock is a potential outsider and Alec Baldwin in New Hampshire we had some some [laughter] your your three for three callers here\nSo this is news was Coburn moving into this special category of funding from the D triple C talk about that\nWell we just we just got that information ourselves and I just shut the open seat\nWe've always thought it was very competitive and we will get we're pleased to\nSee that on the inside the beltway grits recognize that as well she's Seventy two thousand dollar car you know the fifth district has really really dig it goes from up in foster care counting all the way down to the north Carolina it's got a lot of different you know wrong that you know it's got Charlottesville area in it ...\nYou know then you've got sort of the D.C suburbs\nLift off here so you got a little bit of everything that she is really a campaign to every part of that district and ah I I think you know here you're sharing it towards the end they finally you know solve the value in investing more in her\nWell it also says hey they have the resources to do it right\nWell that's a good point too I think that is and if you've seen articles that you know our candidates are actually out raising our candidates not even a committees are actually out raising the Republican incumbent psyche what can they are said Abigail Spanberger\nI think she got raised him three to one maybe this last I guess this this recent filing with court on and on and you know that's just\nWhat we're seeing all across the board [noise] yeah I think in my small donations to which is like really gratifying because\nYou know the small donors are the ones that really invest in you and show up and knock on doors and time again and put the Sheila [noise]\nWell I think that's showing up obviously in the polling generic ballot is a little behind where are you all were last year at the end of the day\nOr in a small ... if you just follow those those numbers in the data you probably do quite well election day maybe not as large as the nominee that happened in Virginia last year but you know

currently on the executive dry\nFree is a nonpartisan underlined nonpartisan boldly non partisan a job as a pro business out of the advocacy organization here in the ... they're not for Thirty years I'm not over yet pro business we're also very much\nA working towards responsible pro business government ... as we heard in the in the news updates like we heard that China's economy is slowing down its growth and that's a problem we have a significant debt burden and their economy is slowing its gross down there\nYou know you're trying to like be be that guy and that has that has devolved to where we are today largely as a result of several factors I'm One of the Iraq War out to the collapse of the economy two thousand and eight and a and that has led to this massive\nWorldwide suspicion of government or what's going on to that it's unsettled place that we are in this world is not just manifesting itself in the United states we are not alone in this and this is in this cultural shift is manifesting itself in politics\nIt's showing up in Hungary in Poland and\nIn Germany over the weekend in Bavaria which is actually I ran into a [laughter]\nGerman political teacher over the weekend\nFancy that right you don't exchange program and I didn't want to go to the vet and like I my wife to like I really don't want to go on and watch football I Want to chill out Sunday night it was a great game on Bob oh go you'll have fun okay fine subsidies to German teachers\nTrying to have a conversation and thinking I don't know any German right what are you going to do ... you know you have all the [laughter] house Hitler you know [laughter]\nYou know what are you going to that conversation well it turns out they speak beautiful English and he probably better than than we do structurally\nAnd um and I and I said ooh how\nAre the elections today malaria because they're very has their lectures on Sunday it was a very important election in Germany that's the kind of guy and that's what I followed and well this one teacher was a a a teacher of politics so then we went down a rabbit hole two hours later at the dinner table with just we're just we're chewing up politics\nAnd what he's telling me about but very was\nIs that is extremely successful economically it is the richest region of Germany for full employment for like three percent unemployment youth unemployment is extremely low\nOr their school system is set up to get people to work straight away um if if you're like a tenth grade and you're not you don't really want to go to university you don't have to make it to make it\nYou can go right into a a a trade school and apprentice program and you're gonna get a job and you get a diploma so they get um really it's a it's a very work intensive area they they pride themselves culturally\nOn work and productivity an organization and good government\nRegion actually be everyone's employed at the job you have any functions ah and it works well they had this major upset in the very intellectual and you go what are you upset about what what could you possibly be that concerned about\nThat you basically blow up this I don't know if they blow it up but how does major upset and the ruling party they hadn't been has been in control for decades\nLast probably the ... the ruling majority in Bavaria and it was stunning to me to realize that we're not immune from that hearing here in America so people say\nYou know the economy republic Israeli economy going so great vote for us\nPeople don't vote on yesterday's news they don't vote on today's news they vote on the future where are we going where what is going to be happening that's my fear that's my concern because things are going well you know\nWhat Donald Trump got elected gasoline was about two twenty five a gallon now it's around two eighty or two thousand eight was four dollars a gallon or better but are we getting better are we getting worse\nYou know we see here that China news today about their economy is slowing down its growth rate of growth\nAnd that has a factor on the human psyche about how how's it going to manifest itself in my life you see these commercials they're not all about you know skills and here's my dad says there about this guy off all she's horrible there ... there but there is no big overriding issue like\nHere's what we're going to do in the future it's just that the other person's really bad therefore they're not going to be good for you [noise]\nUm and therefore because he was going to say well they're going to the economy I guess is what to extrapolate from that and the subconscious\nBut I'm going what is the big driving issue other than obviously Donald Trump and it's a fascinating time in American politics or one of reasons why do what I Do because it's so interesting but also to teach people\nAs I used to tell my my students I really don't care I really don't care [laughter] what you think I care that you think if I can encourage people to be more interested about what they're talking about do read another article to dig deeper to challenge themselves\nThey will in turn create a better outcome for the rest of us and I tell my students I don't care who you vote for I just care that you vote but if you don't vote I understand that's also a vote in itself because you are saying I'm not I'm not doing that I I vote none of the above and it's\nAnd that's and that's tabulate it in you know aggregate itself just like a vote will and that people do that doesn't make any sense\nActually it does if you don't show up for something the two political parties going to try to get you to show up next time we're trying to reach out to you in some way shape or form that data point will register\nI told her story of a family I was at a baseball game with\nAnd they were so upset or I just can't stand voting off out if they haven't earned your vote don't vote and tell them that you don't vote put it on social

dissected by the political class to determine what they want to do and there and that in every election that swings on the undecided voter right the independent voter in October is like oh we're going to\nStop talking about these issues that motivate our base to the great we're going to focus on these\nOh I'm really happy to work with the other side received is now in in certain cats I work with the president what shows up at the polling independence they might not like President Trump but when they agree with something you'd better work with them to get connected they just you know all politics is personal not just walk anyway this course action and filling in for John frantic to be tending to hear me drawing on\nAbout politics and government was this guy a I'm a former member of

having all these costs calling today and stir up the conversation on big go a little deeper going deeper today in politics we're going to go deeper dive in not just you know the public polling the top one numbers but how those posters got to those numbers who are they listening to who are they calling and why are they calling because it's a very different when a university does\nA polling like CRISPR Newport you'll hear quaint and just talk about this they start with a very broad universe\nUm and it keeps coming down to a smaller University of actual likely voters minutes and we'll get to that we're getting to the nitty gritty look we'll get you take you do a deeper dive so when you look at the polls when he got like a real clear politics which\nWhich I spend unfortunately way too much time on 'em but I guess it's healthier than other websites right [laughter]\nThis is the healthy Internet or a ... you look at these different polls and and you go like that just to take a look at the uh\nThe the polls on the generic ballot it's insane what a what the what we're looking at here pulled up its it's fascinating like generic ballot\nI still haven't Democrats plus one what how do you get there\nYou say the polling is wrong well pose always right it's just data you're collecting other people call what the differences in the methodologies who you're going\nI talked to one leading I'm\nDemocratic stores and I said okay what's your polling showing me he said Democrats are around mid Los thirty thirty four thirty three percent thirty two that range Republicans\nWe've never seen self identification for Republicans this while it's around twenty four percent\nAnd what used to be you know thirty four thirty four is now thirty four twenty four and independents are up around the load of mid forties\nHe goes Republicans have never been lower on self identification but we haven't picked up any of those voters they're all self identifying now had independents that is huge\nAnd when you get down to it with people when they understand what's really going on that's when they get more excited more engaged this is Chris X. men so John Frederick eight eight eight for you know five six for six stay tuned come on back\nHappy birthday have a beer you know put a picture of him have his her brother with the with the Budweiser I'm just reminded me so much my friendship and I'm a black how blessed that wants to have it in my life but also\nA what a what a blessing and it's just to be alive right to be able to ah just to be experience at all and I'm Wondering is I I enjoy coming during his radio show where they get to hopefully get people excited about politics I'm a good does governor lives it is important you know we can't break down we have to work with each other\nOut to get good things that we should have to debate though we should have a vibrant vigorous debate that right and lose the country forward um and we shouldn't be afraid to have that debate but we should have in a in a civil manner and I think today we see it a a lack of civility more and more and that's difficult\nIn my professional life I Am the executive director for junior freed the foundation for research in economic education and uh you know we're probably want to see three ... and we're not partisan which is a great lane to be in these days because everyone is\nYou know red or blue and I'm like okay for you well you know aren't you might not really I don't have to be actually I'm paid not to\nEven get healthcare so [laughter]\nWhat we did was we represent businesses and uh we have membership and we try to do is educate them on politics and as a former teacher and a former business person my family had a bottle of water business for years old a couple of years ago a blessing [noise] um you know I\nI like getting people excited about learning about politics seeing it differently and what's that makes me do it was on an even deeper like you know when you when you go the teacher subject you better than other subjects you have to really get engaged in the subject so it's an every day I get to learn more and more\nAbout politics it's it's it's a deep\nEconomics and history and I was a history major so I I get to bring out altogether because it manifest itself is Andrew Breitbart said the last ... last segment you know culture is down politics downstream of cultures so if you want to impact culture or the politics impact culture first and foremost stuff you're culturally it'll\nLeader you'll be you'll be a political year give us a call it eight four five six for six we got some great guest calling in today are not just congressman Rob Wittman but also the leaders of the two major parties your Virginia posters Clinton kid and Robin McDougal\nAnd then two operatives one from Iowa and one from New Hampshire we're only I hate to say this 'cause you'd probably second tardy elections already midterms we are four hundred and Seventy two days away from the Iowa caucuses [noise]\nFour hundred and Seventy two now it seems like a long time but let's be honest as soon as this election is over you're going to start hearing reports back from Iowa and New Hampshire and we're going to be at the forefront of that we're going to get calls and they were going to shoot up with their with uh some operatives their Republican and Democrats\nTo see what's going on the ground I think Trump's got the lock on the nomination you never know\nYou never know you never know goodness knows you never know with Donald Trump because um that that that that's that's who knows it actually does what he says it says you can do it but you never know what's going to happen around it and I think that's one of the more interesting parts about politics today is because he's brought that dynamic up what max and that sort of it was if you remember from your\nDays in school or or worse you know when the leader changes and it's like a substitute teacher what's this going to be like here you know you get you get a new boss or whether it's a it's there's just a newness and from\nSince June fifteenth of twenty Fifteen this has been a very different political dynamic are not necessarily unhealthy because it has made us think and react differently and respond differently and I don't think that's necessarily unhealthy\nUh but we do have to be ever vigilant to make sure it does not become too unhealthy and I think people are recognizing that we have\nAh some some discourse in this country\nThat can be improved we can get better at that as a people and how we do that is every day one on one with each other you want to impact politics if you want better representation be better people sort of comes down to um they represent us and if you want them to be better it's up to us to be better [noise]\nSo it was called an eight four five six for six we'll talk about polls goodness knows there's more polls and I don't want to do with these days\nThe generic ballot what I pay attention to him first and foremost is what I check every day I'm On the real clear politics they give you the um average of all the different polls and they break down the individual post\nUm now polling should be looking at what a cult Elvis likely voters polling companies should have an understanding of who they imagine are going to be showing up on election is you have a pretty good handle on may ... began in Virginia about a month ago so that we should know who's actually voting\nI'm In Virginia in or you can always tell by Arlington [noise] because they're the tabulate in there\nIt's up to the last round of elections to see what the intensity is\nBut when you look at the er the averages of the generic ballot them and this is why I Do this is why I Do that\nIn twenty Seventeen when governor Ralph Northam defeated that Gillespie he won by eight point nine three percent a point nine three points the generic ballot on that day was nine\nPoint one if I'm trying to instruct the class what do you want to follow Fox News Reuters Rasmussen CNBC Emerson Maris Quinnipiac\nWilder pool poll a crystal Newport which one do you follow follow generic ballot right now because that it that is fairly proximate to what happened last year and the year before and twenty six team if you look the generic ballot in twenty sixteen\nIt was very close it was like tied and Republicans over performed on election day by about a point\nAnd they want in a generic congressional ballot I'm obviously Trump lost by about three points a nationally three million votes um so that's something to consider when you're saying okay we're just going to go I think\nI think the the objective view here is look at the generic ballot look at the average and you can pretty much extrapolate where it is right now\nIf the election day were held today and because on that basis it it takes away the the the partisan lens you might have or a would be inclined to if at nine point one percent the dams one by three point nine nine point one point nine that's very close\nAnd they are at seven point six right now\nIn a safe to assume that they will not perform as well as they did and twenty Seventeen but still will win and likely when the house of representatives given the the dynamics in the Senate it's very different because of individual races\nLikely that Republicans a hold on to the Senate what's the dynamic that if the Democrats have the house and Senate Republicans have the Senate\nWhat's gonna happen the next two years and that's how you can sort of figure out where this thing is going so that you can understand what you need to do or not do like myself I don't watch cable news I don't watch broadcast news every papers in the morning ... times Wall Street journal\nAnd I get mine on information what's going on in the economy and politics and culture and whatnot\nAnd leave it alone don't listen to you know the the uh the national talk radio shows I go to work right you know I I but with my eyes I see what's going on and I think most voters do that you look at the the aggregate numbers of\nYou know the Fox news of the world and the MSNBC and it's a very small subset of the American population but they're the ... they're the most active voters they are the their the activists so those shows are pretty much you're broadcasting to the activists about what they want to hear about the all the messaging points that they\nThey they they're supposed to repeat so when you watch when you go to Facebook or Twitter or Snapchat are interesting\nThe replica repetition of the message and you're like wow I I go to a town hall after I got like a congressional panel was from my friends you know if there is now in Congress the receipt mates in mind I watch them and take questions from the audience is like where do you know getting information it's fundamentally wrong but they're really upset\nI mean angry not pleasant not understanding but what do they show up for [noise] do they show up because they're angry they are concerned\nBut more importantly like anyone else in the world they just want to be hurt right how important is that in a conversation to hear\nWhat the other person is is really feeling and get down to okay what is that what what is what is making your data say oh 'cause there's no no no that's that's the operative subject matter [noise] what is triggering this fear and when you get down into the to the nuts and bolts you ... you really can understand\nWhy people do what they do and hopefully get them to a better place in stations life and it's not easy to do but it's a it's it's what we do it in a democracy in public and form a democracy which we have\nThem in America thank God I'm so we can just live more peacefully amongst each other governors self self governance I think it's really important a historical concept and I think we've lost sight of that a little bit it's easy to\nUh but more importantly it's up for

and ask a question eight eight eight or eight oh five six for six were going to call him\nTalking about his polling from Chris er Newport university um I think one of the most accurate or posting pulling operations in the in the world and you can do a great job Clinton they're\nAnd that's and that's what that's what campaigns they follow the data they followed that you you look at\nThe cross tabs in the in the polls and they go okay I've got a problem with um women between the ages of twenty five forty five don't go there on crime let's just say you know and then they know structure their messages according to be or if they have high positive for their opposition go trying to attack the tack to bring down\nThe positives and bring up their negative to have an outcome in the election\nExtra short\nI we're not we're not having any more difficult to time than we had been having 'em in the years leading up to today so Virginia is about two thirds cell phone mostly or a cell phone only users and\nSo our sample we we actually drop samples of cell phone numbers and so we do quotas on her cellphone versus wireline sample so we basically go into the field or the batter to third one third sell for land line split already\nAnd we haven't found our response rate on cell phones to be any different than it has been which is\nNot great um you know the people typically aren't taking cell phone calls to do surveys like they were landline calls in the seventies to do surveys show we're not finding it any more difficult than we were already um I Do have college around the country who are finding\nCell phone number is being blocked more um and and it's driven by this um all of this fishing that's been going on with our cell phone numbers lately\nThe number of Idaho worms right\nAnd we we did there are two things that we do to try to help us with that we are Dennis Hi ourselves as Chris rooting for university so we're not we're not an anonymous number or we're not unless the number you'll see who we are when we call\nAnd then um if you look put me on your call list will put you on our coldest and we won't call you back or we don't have to do that because you know according to the federal regulations were doing research academic research for not working and we're not getting paid to\nYou know do this we're not making a profit so we're considered um researchers so we don't have to comply with the Coleman is what we do keep our own do not call list and if somebody says don't call me I don't want to do surveys\nThey will put 'em on earth do not call it so we try to be transparent in that way as well\nWell that's fascinating because most people go ah yeah I'm On those on those do not call me they are because because you are academic nature interesting so your turnout model is showing forty to forty five percent that's interesting because the people I talked to was the campaigns are they're hoping is going to be around forty ...\nThat's so that's so it depends on who you talk to 'em it could be forty eight um\nIt could be higher I mean they're so here's the real sort of question that I have in my head right so\nIf there is very big blue wave if there are a lot of voters are engaged right now who didn't even vote in twenty seven and then we're missing them in our survey and we're not capturing that right and that's some\nOf the pushback I got back um what do we want to put out our second district poll showing Taylor leading Luria some Democrats put back and said well you're not even capturing some of the voters that were newly registering in and they're going to vote okay fair enough but we didn't have the luxury in\nVirginia in in that we had a twenty Seventeen election\nThat we think captured that surge pretty well it it really brought Ralph Northam into the governors\nPretty well but it may be even bigger there and and also Republicans may have responded by by engaging their base voters already know if they've done that we think\nWe capture them because they were already voters anyway um but it turns out is higher I think it's going to help you um I don't know that helps one party over the other all the way it might be helpful to Democrats because it might be that extra surge that we might\nThat might be a lot of new voters were not capturing\nSo you ... you you saw search I combed through suburban tsunami twenty Seventeen you saw that you saw coming in\nI think you had an aunt yeah we knew we were we were a lot of\nWaiting 'em in twenty Seventeen like we are likely model this year or what we were doing twenty Seventeen as we were we were modeling the same way but we're also looking for nearly registered voters 'em in twenty Seventeen because of that was that was the surge that was the difference between\nTwenty six twenty Seventeen with a lot of the new suburban voters um and so\nWe did see the surgeon twenty Seventeen we all know what it looked like in Virginia and so there is nothing says to me that that's going to be any less this year than it was in twenty Seventeen and there are things to say to me it might be a little bit bigger than it than it was one twenty Seventeen and by the way\nIn twenty Seventeen the Republicans were as engaged as as you would want them to be it's just that Democrats were a little bit more engaged\nSo you think it might be even bigger this year\nIt very well could be I don't think it can be\nMuch bigger but it very well could be\nDemocrats in particular are trying to register new voters here they they were until the deadline\nAnd Republicans I'm worth trying to register new voters as much as they were trying to mobilize their their base voters that are already there so I mean look if both parties it's not likely to be because we don't have a really robust statewide race going on 'em and we have ... competitive congressional races some\nPlaces and not in other places so that's part of the reason I'm thinking forty five um but if it ended up being forty eight it's because there were ... there's massive turnout going on in some of these really competitive congressional races\nUm I don't know if you're if you're if you're looking for a competitive state wide grace to drive a turnout we just don't have that this year and so that's part of the reason I'm hesitant to say it's going to go as high as forty eight but look I've been wrong many times and I'll be wrong many times in the future\n[laughter] goodness no that's what I'm Talking about the state why not close\nClose um if I you know what I find interesting about the statewide races there um it's not close yet you see Tim Kaine campaigning in his campaign campaigning as if it were close he's running ads on on every in every television network in in the commonwealth\nHe's campaigning like he's got a a more for a bit of a formidable candidate\nStatement there I've moved beyond twenties sixteen um and and and sort of the difficulties of being a vice presidential candidate on the ticket and twenty sixteen\nBut I think he's also recognizing that in some of these are really close congressional races\nUm if he can pull any coattails um if he can run out and he ...\nIt could be really helpful to democratic candidates downtown and so I think oddly enough Tim Kaine is running a campaign to get reelected to the U.S Senate and running several congressional campaigns to elect Democrats\nUm in in in some of these competitive races at the\nSame time um and he doesn't really have a challenger that has a lot of money but Corey Stewart is all over local talk radio which is where his voters are going to be and so I think Corey Stewart running the kind of campaign that he needs to run to give voters out given um how difficult situation he hasn't had a little money is\nSo your state wide pulling that\nWaste we pulled the Senate race several times and then decided it wasn't going to be competitive to pull it throughout the final\nStretch from Labor Day on stand decided to pull these congressional races because really for the first time in probably in decades in Virginia if if if a hundred and some odd years we've got a lot of a lot of really competitive congressional races going on so we decided to pull the congressional races instead of\nContinuing to pull what doesn't appear to be a very competitive Senate race\nBut we are we're wrapping up here in the segment with which you have a final call here on what the memories is going to look like in the day\nWell probably somewhere Fifteen Fifteen ashes mine is where my\n... I'm at right now it could be a little bit higher could be a little bit lower if it's a little bit lower it's going to some of these congressional races are going to look really good for Republicans are going to be really tight if it's if it's higher if it's closer to twenty than some of these democratic congressional candidates are going to have a better night I think\nFifty six fifty seven fifty yeah anything moving a libertarian from making an impact and all you\nKnow in a in in in ... when they mind given that that you know a lot of the country club Republicans might not be interested in Corey Stewart but at the end of the day we're in we're in a very tribal period of our politics and if there's an hour by your name a lot of Republicans were going to just vote for that are and not actually give\n'em the libertarian their their vote so we don't see any uptick I'm I'm among libertarian candidates either state wide or\nIn these congressional races um there was a libertarian and attempt this libertarian seven we're not seeing any uptick with either one of them\nOkay thanks Clinton kids were calling in looks like an opportunity last a Libertarian Party they had a chance to to crack the correct in marketing or a little bit Virginia they might have fallen short this is Chris ... filling in for the vacation and John ... come on back\nThis morning I'm doing well Chris I Hope you're doing well this is our third day this week we've seen each other on your stock in their own stock and you haven't figured out yet\nLet's not go there [laughter] you're the elective reading a standing joke so uh you know if you heard the last second with Clinton kid from Christopher Newport or are you seeing anything different than what Dr kid seen out there\nWhen I heard the other factor is um interview and I I sort of got the sense from the discussion that perhaps we see more of a blue wave than I'm seeing you know I'm In regular contact with all our congressional campaigns um\nThroughout the commonwealth and frankly most of them are doing really well um [noise] I Will be surprised if it got really come down to perhaps just to the congressional districts being really in play when we get to election night\nTo just to which\nI actually sat in the in the tent clearly or other to battlegrounds right now I thank God the other ones that perhaps people are looking or the fast but I think Denver Riggleman is clearly running a far superior campaign there and so I think Denver\nWill allow will be fine come election night on there have been some talk of Scott Taylor's race Scott's really working hard um I mean if perhaps we'll be closer than we otherwise would hope that get together today Scott should be fine as well so\nThat's where it comes back down to Barbara Comstock in the tens I'm Dave Brat in the seventh this way I see it at this point\nCatches a conductor kid he didn't mention Nebraska Sandberg are racing I live in a district I see it every day at least in western in Rico county and\nThere's a stark difference in what's going on the ground at least but I I pulled back and try and do the objective follow the data you follow the data the Clinton kids right in following what you're saying oh the Taylor and ... are the ones that are most in play as far as changing\nI'm changing party right if they're accurate um you get held up by seven and calms down by nine times like that\nSo if that's consistent in his polling is accurate um it would probably show up if you if you do one on bread Stamberg and imagine that he would but what he also pointed out obviously the quality of the candidates important local issues are important but also what you pointed out was he didn't see the big Kavanaugh\nKicker or that everyone in talking about this is going to have this big search for Republicans or if it is it's pretty quiet people make up their mind just going to vote and that she said Republicans just show up in midterms\nAnd and I sort of see the latter I mean obviously when I'm looking at is totally but during a prior to the to the judge now justice Kavanaugh hearings um there was some um\nPerhaps apathy on the part of the Republican base um but that changed almost immediately uh with those hearings and I think the Republican base in Virginia and I think the Republican base around the country saw what a Democratic majority\nIt would look like constant um investigations calls for impeachment says the president's investigations of justice Kevin off and so what I saw it as a state party chair with a clean tech enthusiasm response to emails fundraising jump significantly\nAs a result of that and I'm as it's been said before if somebody's going to write a check or\nSend some money to the party or a candidate they're more likely going to vote for that person as well so it may not be showing up in the polls quite yet but I Believe\nThat there is a renewed enthusiasm they're clearly wasn't enthusiasm gap between the Republicans and Democrats prior to the Kavanaugh hearings racket that gap spent eliminated so now it's just a matter of turning our folks out\nSo you're seeing the enthusiasm kick if I talked to Morgan Griffith about a week and a half ago and he said the same thing you said you know it was a if you were doing the scale of one to ten ten being you know absolutely out of their mind showing up no matter what\nA he said you know Democrats were around Ninety in my folks around thirty sit but my folks are now up around the any uh so he he he sensed that he felt on the ground inclined told me the same thing\nOr so from the anecdotal standpoint I Do think there is a renewed a server in the in the Republican base that quite frankly getting a lot of what they want it in the last election as part of the hardest thing in politics you know you know when when you get what you want your show up are you satisfied or you know you're fat and happy new stay home 'cause things are going pretty well what what's the point\nBut I think the the cabinet things sort of re energized refocus or at least the Republican base on uh wanting to come out\nAnd vote but you're seeing that throughout the state\nI Am and I and I think you know again what I think folks realized you're right I mean they got what they wanted and twenty sixteen we have the president and acting tax cuts\nThe economy was booming stand on corners and in decades and certainly what price some complacency in that but then I think now the Republicans I see all that can get done very quickly what the Democrats control the house and Senate and so\nI think Republicans are saying we've got to roll up our sleeves and if we want to keep what we've got we've got to go to the polls and vote for it\nUsually the cycles Baltics right so what as the new chairman of the Republican Party in Virginia or what is the next step for RPG where are you all go on what should Republicans in Virginia Beach got because when you look at Virginia and Maryland you have to give to the very strange electorate you have\nA democratic Maryland with a Republican governor who looks like he's going to Fifteen and twenty points in Virginia which has been a battleground trending now towards a blue state\nTim Kaine Clinton get thinks he's going to win by Fifteen up or probably maybe twenty points as well you didn't really do have this dichotomy don't you across the Potomac we're we're the the the dynamics in politics are changing Massachusetts has a Republican governor\nWho's up polling are the leading Democrats in the state Charlie Baker you have a governor I Would probably governor of Illinois\nUm is is is the ... other Republicans in Virginia sit right for the electorate well\nYou're whether any of the three candidates you mentioned governor Hogan and others would which secure the Republican nomination in Virginia right now but I think what will recognize it and I and I sort of sense to perhaps a more pragmatic approach among Republicans I'm again coming out of the Kavanaugh hearings I'm\nSomebody you know six months ago had mentioned you know Susan Collins and Lindsey Graham the I'm sort of the star wars for the Republican Party people to laugh but\nNow I'm getting requested how can we bring Lindsey Graham and to speak in Virginia for candidates and and have as a featured speaker and places so I think the Kavanaugh hearings and showers at what we need to do is have a broader based in the Republican Party\nThat can bring conservatives together around core principles and perhaps\nUh if we can agree on eighty percent of the issues we can disagree on the other twenty later on after we start winning again\n[laughter] again just like we can look both parties are having their their ah ... battles for I mean the Democrats have their own battles Republicans are having their battles were going to have some posters\nAnd that pollsters are some operatives from Iowa New Hampshire calling the nine o'clock hour should listen to that we have one calling in from a Democrat from Iowa Republican mantra is going to tell us what's going on there are said to the national caucuses 'cause it's really what they're really\nOnly I don't have time to worry about that I Do kind of holding out for those allegations of the things that it up for reelection there's nothing that worried about twenty twenty after we went in to preserve our ... and the house and the next year in Virginia and the\nGenerally pushback you because the dominant theme in American politics is what's going on in Washington DC is being reflected back in in the states and then the local to the district because Trump is the issue right now since\nSince June fifteenth of twenty Fifteen\nThat man has driven the conversation every day in American politics and if you know four hundred and Seventy two days away from from the Iowa caucuses people are going to be focusing on those issues\nBut it's going to get very retail very quickly while the Virginia races are going on and that's the beauty and the dynamic of Virginia politics isn't it I mean you because we are we are the polls\nWe take the temperature all the time\nWell that's exactly right and I think um for our congressional candidates this\nYear I think last year gave them sort of a wake up call and they said OK perhaps around to roll up our sleeves and work much harder than we thought we were going to have to and so um you're right that this year will sort of perhaps give us a preview of what we can expect in twenty Nineteen but that will be a sort of a pulse of the of the country for as you say\nBecause we have the entire general assembly up\nThis time next year all one hundred and forty members who are the district attorney general simply are going to be up for election and there's so many issues at play and what Clinton kid was talking about what he's sitting in his polling is that quality candidates matter and local issues matter I got an email last night from a former colleague of mine\nTalking about Corey in northern Virginia and basically local development and he was engaged on he also sends out emails on traffic patterns in potholes and I'm like\nThis is not what you do in the general assembly but if that's what the voters want\nFrom their elected officials and the things that are impacting most people today\nWith a booming economy and job I'm strong and wages growing\nPeople are looking at some of those other issues that impact them on a daily basis traffic and tolls up in northern Virginia and as you say the potholes in in in more rural areas of the country those are things that people are focusing on now because the kitchen table issues are doing great", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Laura Ingraham Show", "city": "Portsmouth",
