whatever okay I\nDidn't know you're putting it on the air [laughter] Ryan uh\nRyan I'm not a fan of that Ryan let me just ask you this straight up so you're going to I'm Republican I'm Sorry ... credits stronghold of Don McEachin and African American churches and other things obviously you have to get Democrats ... ...\nWhat did they say well we have a program to back up a little bit\nOne of the things I think that makes me unique is that I'm a pastor must have been a social worker I care about a lot of the things that I Believe the African American typically the urban area's really care about like we've already talked about welfare public housing I care about criminal justice reform I've seen that close and so those are things we're talking about the economy is just as you believe in I Believe is\nGoing through the roof is booming and that's good for all Americans really been good for African Americans actually the unemployment is you know the lowest it's ever been so we talk about the economy\nAnd as you know a lot of African Americans particularly the the conservative African Americans in the church are very conservative socially so we talk about her life and who knows what are they saying what they're saying what what\nYou have to challenge them but when you go to a Democrat who voted for McCain voted for Clinton there a democratic voter and you go in a rich man or Petersburg and you say I'm Ryan McAdams I'm a Republican running for Congress blah blah blah what\nDid they say what are they what they said to me is you're right because I'll tell them you know what the Democratic Party has done anything for you they made a lot of promises but they really haven't produced anything and they say you're right and then I say you know what and Republicans haven't\nCome and talk to you and message to you and ask for your vote and they've taken for granted in that sense\nAnd they say you're right and I say well I'm here and I said I to me I'm not about\nRepublican or Democrat about solutions that I have solutions for you I've conservative solutions for you I've got different solutions in the Democratic party has but I've got solutions for you and I believe that the work I Believe that's going to give you\nThe jobs that you need in this community I Believe it's going to give you the redevelopment that you need opportunity zones and we talk about that I Believe\nIt's going to give you the Ford about housing that you need I mean we were not going to solve all their problems but I Believe that hey compared to what the Democrats have given you which is nothing I mean we are a huge step up and I'm actually here I'm president you know that's the one thing that they said you know what you're here and I appreciate that\nAnd then when I tell them I'm a pastor when I tell them been a social worker their eyebrows go up you know they're like oh really and they want to know more they want to know they want to know why I'm In this race they want to know well how do you feel about the president and I tell them I said you know what I Love the president I Love his policies but I'm not the president on my own person\nI have a different tone or you know I have a more moderate tone I'm One that wants to be a bridge builder I Want to reach out I Want to bring us together I'm not a device of voice and say whatever you think about the Democratic party or your current congressman is easily the vice avoids all he has to do is tear down tear down the president I said I'm here to build up I'm not here to to talk\nEven to tear down the Democratic party for the most part I'm here to tell you the solutions that I have for your community and you know what it resonates with people because you know what people see me is that I'm often it just like the president I Know that you love that about the president I Love that about the president that he's an authentic guy and what he says is really what he believes whether he says it right all the time\nOr he says it wrong he says what he believes and that's how I Am I'm just going to tell you straight and not going to try to\nPaint it you know just to tell you what you want to you\nShould be going into these areas with pollution and that's what we haven't done the past and that's what I'm doing I Need to do it but you know what I'm a unique candidate because\nI have a hard to do it and I'm ... qualified to do it as a pastor I've worked with the African American community\nReally my whole career and a social worker I worked in public housing I worked with or without risk youth mentor to African American kids we we ran a taekwondo program with the police department so I have credibility not like I've just come lately you know I've been there I've done it\nAnd uh they see that and they know that and we're going in African American churches same thing and um\nSo it resonates because you know what I think African Americans are very sensitive they they can they can read people and uh I think they they I think most of them can read where I'm coming from and my heart and so a lot to me we're getting traction what's your website Ryan McAdams for Congress\nTaco rhyme exams for Congress dark comedy any Mike Pence coming in for a rally seven forty five PM ah at sun trust building enrichment on Saturday October twenty and Saturday October twenty that will be on his website want to thank rhyme McDonald's for being with us Denver rhythm and coming up kids reading\nFor an authorized by America First policies in corporate and joining us now Denver Riggleman [noise] you know just when you thought it wouldn't get worse after big fight Leslie Coburn his Democratic opponent in the fifth district when it crazy campaign this has been\nBecause uh I guess when you're down so that you gotta like throw\nHell marriage or something but luckily Coburn under debate Monday Night a week ago she went after Denver's military service on the grounds he was three thousand miles away from Afghanistan at NATO support facility Diego Garcia\nWhile he works on plans as you know for bombing missions um apparently applying that they didn't play a big role which of course we know we did and I'm Mr ... coauthor\nHusband are dangerous like Don said that he was snorkeling I mean this is a really crazy campaign that coal burns or running [laughter] I mean that would go to like say Denver like didn't serve okay what else are they going to make up joining us now to do that again is the truth\nIs Denver Riggleman he is the Republican candidate for the fifth district in Virginia that's the Lynchburg area through Rowan Oak and Denver a is running for that seat to replace the retiring Tom Garrett Denver regular great to have you got to hey good morning John how are you okay\nUh after the nine eleven attack in Afghanistan that you were snorkeling and ... Garcia\nYeah I mean I'm you know maybe I think um I think the co burns have a problem with ... and they seem to they seem to to get angry and lash out\nOn Twitter but that's how they run their whole campaign as they they say disparaging things that make up things whether it's big foot or radical or white supremacy and you're making fun of military service or saying I don't care about women are taking things out of context and then they rushed to Twitter to their Hollywood friends\nAnd I try to make at national news because you know they have such extreme policies um and I think are true believers but they're just so out of touch and\nFor a Andrew co burned to get involved to talk about my military service for somebody who's biggest service has been you know making a fantasy books I tell you almost get to the point you just start shaking your head it's hard to take them seriously I'll tell you that and\nAnd you know they they just ... a lot of veterans to and by the way John Diego's not the only place I've been in and that's the other thing I just I don't have to defend my military service to election them\nWell uh it was drawing a desperate attempt I mean you've got a very very well documented military service and you were the one who was head of the group that was the other one I mean\nYeah the thirty fourth esque expeditionary bomb squad during the amount of Diego which you know what I mean you have talked about many times before and you know like I always told you you know there are situations el harm's way there you know I wasn't I was supporting a bunch of just um awesome individuals\nI'm never going to battle and when you talk\nTo some of the other guys who objected over the Indian Ocean or I was trying to keep them safe with the threats in Afghanistan and they're going after the caves and also all kinds of other things that I Can't talk about honestly then yet um you know it's just funny because they don't understand\nAnything about military service everything they've always done has been about themselves and now they don't understand they in joined war against the war fighter and they thought this would be a walk over when I came in as a new candidate and they're finding out right now that I'm an alley fighter and um plus\nYou know I mean I I've had a gun stuck in my chest so you know with their children so I don't think they understand the gravity of what they've done and they made this person on a level I never thought somebody would\nWell they're desperate or do you what are some of her you you mentioned at the beginning of the segment Denver Riggleman you mentioned that some of their positions were extreme liberal or can you just name several several of them for\nSure I mean I mean everything there are extreme you know with the Medicare for all you know forgiving knows all student you know there's one point for a trillion student loan debt debt debt free community college um the fact that they she called 'em I stick to stop\n'em there's other things that we have that we're going to roll out I'm open borders um my goodness um you just go down the line everything that Ocasio Cortez says is pretty much what largely Coburn beliefs and and that's what's scary about is that she can't come across as moderate now she's trying to run into the middle\nReally go outside the district much anymore she likes to stay in her ... her cocoon and\nI think it really comes down to she's a true believer and I and I know what I got to respect that I mean she's a true believer in these causes but I'm I'm a true believer unconstitutional you know policies but also in individual liberty so it is truly a war of ideas now and I just hope that the Republicans get out and vote because she is dangerous for the ... district\nWere with the Denver Riggleman Republican candidate for Congress in the ... district he's running against his Democratic opponent Leslie Coburn uh she's an author has a lot of friends in Hollywood\nAnd a Denver running for the seat of the retire on retiring Tom Garrett Denver let's get to uh some of the pressing issues on the world scene today that I Want to get your\nOpinion on a let's start with ... ... the a so called a\nJournalist if you were living in the United states living\nIn Virginia doing a column for the Washington Post very critical of the Saudi Government goes to the cost of living in this day in both for routine paperwork to get married and it's like the older Roach Motel he went in but he'd ever came out a hurricane or\nNever came out so it's like the the Saudi Roach Motel\nNow the stakes get elevated because President Trump said over the weekend um if he gets clear evidence that the Saudis were involved in this cold blooded murder within their consulate and he's in this than ball he said there would be severe punishment\nThan a prince Mohammed bin Salman MPs thirty three years old turns around on Sunday fires back\nAnd if there's any ah\nSanctions against us or any retaliation\nOr we're going to double down and we're going to affect the economy's in world markets and pull our sovereign fond and raise the price of oil and uh cetera I we bought this arms deal with them a hundred and ten billion dollars but they've only spent Fifteen billion\nWe've also were backing their war there are civil war I'm with the Emirates in Yemen where we go with it\nWell number one I think um shall it used to have in Saudi Arabia to have a lot more leverage uh but now that the United states is the number one oil and gas producer in the world\nUm it's very difficult for them to I think\nYou know sort of big jerk I kind of leverage on us as far as President Trump's concern I think he's very serious I mean if it's found out that the Saudi Government sanctioned um this type of behavior I don't I only think she I don't take your justice and ours pay much I think he'll talk about pulling any type of support\nI'm against the tea in Yemen and I you know and that is that's that is something because you know we we really do not like Iran\nThey are our enemies there I'm just really interested to see because it as a to try to extract Iran from what they're doing\nIf the salaries are doing this type of behavior now you're talking about things that we just can't get done and I think President Trump would go all the way I think he would not only sanction them and and take away their arms sales I think you would ignore this right on the oil and\nI think she would start to extract support for any kind of military stuff that they're doing over in the middle east they have a military you know exercise is hurt or any type of operation so it's it is serious\nDenver the other side of it is that uh some people are saying well look or the president and the Trump Administration has invested a lot in the Saudi\nRelationship in the Nineteen months he's been there and we do have this hundred and ten million dollar arm so do I I Want to keep pointing out that it's on paper it's a memorandum of understanding for hundreds of dollars but they've only spending\nYou yeah it's an Emily really spent Fifteen so it's it's not I mean there's and there's no sign deals or anything it's just and understanding right right so it's not really want it\nSo uh so somebody was saying you know why maybe we just we just rented under the rug and move on business as usual but a Marco Rubio the other day said\nThat whatever action we took could not be symbolic what is your take on that\nHe's he's right I mean again if the Saudi Government participated in killing somebody and it was sanctioned and we have the proof is my guest service going to be much more than symbolic um I guess there's probably removal support on\nMultiple Bronx and\nI Would say that that is going to happen if if we if we find that's been proven and you know I don't I actually on that line I don't have all the classified information All right and I couldn't answer to it anyway but if\nOne hundred percent and look at the testament to the administration that's worked very hard on the campaign trail people at the G the CD interest in the house can really put their shoulder down raise\nMoney historic levels of vice president you know pac which I'm part of that money and historic levels to give to those Kurdish zone on the Republican side so I Will tell

news and you got that just left a few minutes ago I was in another room where all these firefighters are up from central Florida would come over to be helpful and help them out here but there's a lot of work to apply to the head and not number one thing right now people made their power back\nThat's going to take a little bit and it's not about restoring power to actually in many cases about rebuilding the entire grand sort of a lot of work that lies ahead and um\nI'm really prevention and get in there as quickly as they can look from the images that we're seeing as you said that there\nAreas and it will take weeks months maybe years for them to get back on the way they were before the storm [noise]\nYou know again I'm going to talking about power for a moment I mean it's usually in these storms in some lines are down you put them backup you start to get power rolling in\nAnd this particular case since a total rebuilding the system I mean there's stuff everywhere and then many of these structures that you can't even turn the power are going to start a fire and hurt somebody got to clear a lot out first\nSo those are the multiple week of and multiple month and then\nIt'll get better every day I'll get a little better but then the day before but right now they could just get power and better communications up and running into cell phones working in the like\nAnd everything else starts to flow and but the crews are from all over the country that are helpful or two hundred people working almost around the clock to get power restored and long term you worry about for example the agriculture industry down here and a forestry industry peanuts\nAnd the cotton crop wiped out and I mean these are people that I can make any money this year in many cases and the economic damages that will be here long after the towers are stored and even some of the structures are rebuilt there's a lot of work to\nEncouraging me in the panhandle into watching our communities come together and they're tough they will accept each other neighbors walks out there but we have a long hard task now\nSo I can hop strengthening centered and while they had the about Saudi Arabia as minute by minute things are changing\nBut it's happening today to call it the king said he absolutely secretary\nOf state Pompeo over their potential Saudi Arabia turkey maybe other places as well to try to get to the truth or the president mentioned it intentionally road killers it's language that people think that he may have gotten directly comment administration um your democratic counterpart\nIn the Senate Chris Murphy says that's been hearing of ridiculous called rolling killers theory where\nTonight why we fight his new book case Arab great to have you back here and the Jon Stewart who's radio network great to be back\nThank you said let's get to a Saudi Arabian situation said not too good\nFirst they say well Jamal came out then they say it didn't come on like the Roach Motel you go into the Saudi constantly the ... you don't come out now they say well maybe it was rogue a\nIt was a rogue murder that he went in for interrogation and uh but there is no official statement coming from someone who denies the whole thing\nAnd now the Saudis threatening other ... there was any sanctions or they're going to retaliate and disrupt the world's economy and shoot up oil prices\nJournalists opinion piece cry that he's not an American like it was a resident alien he's been caught up in the middle of a geopolitical competition between two\nSunni nations who want to dominate the Sunni Muslim world that turkey which is becoming a meal or two minutes you'll see all the crime you ever go on and Saudi Arabia where Islam was founded in the second century of of this person has been caught in the middle and individual who report true\nAbout what happens if it didn't deserve what happened to him by well thanks very very said each character with very close ties to the Muslim Brotherhood even to the bin Laden family\nI'm an individual who was the biggest um state of the twentieth century ... so it's it's basically an individual caught in the middle of a giant competition\nSo the president's sending a secretary of state Mike Pompeo a to react to try to get to the bottom of this find out what happened\nObviously the Saudis the first name and they put out which was that this individual was there an hour got his people work in a department but they said the dog in the cameras or something they they couldn't produce the footage of that now they're changing\nTheir a story how does this affect us relationship with the Saudis as it relates to Mohammed Mohammed Mohammed bin Salman\nWell when we were in the White House we were very encouraged by the reforms MPs was an issue\nThat we always used the term behavior modification Saudi Arabia has been in bed with the wrong people for far too long team members of the elite had been funding and supporting\nA jihadi out the audio ... how they act just\nAround the world that was going on a very very close to ...\nThere is not what we expect coming based on the surface recording itself so my complaints top guy talking talking to all these clocks at West point former director of CIA he will get to the bottom of it\nOn their record turnout to recruit about what happened took a shock that it will be consequences for Saudi\nArabia definitely in the field or a um I'm trying my expectation\n[noise] do you think that this might affect the United states backing of the Saudi Emirates coalition and the Yemeni civil war\nYes ... says the the big big muscle movement right now in the region as a wedding where you were in the beginning of the administration and the ISI\nThe Gulf Cooperation council turn to get back on ... which is the worst offender in the region when it comes to sponsoring radical Islamic groups or is that that's going to be the primary concern that we we we maintain pressure\nOn cops on the G cc continues to behave in ways\nThis is the second the second third\nOrder effects are most important look all being wrong so you know that there is the balance in the region but the cost of the competition between the Sunni Muslims and shoot the ball is okay Rob recall we won't we cannot have negative consequences from this brand making Iran stronger\n[noise] so you are inviting President Trump right now you just turn the clock back and you're in the oval office one would be any advice or\nYou would give to the president as new information comes out of their peers\nThat it appears that this guy was murdered allegedly in constantly because as\nMarco Rubio just sat on Fox and friends he came in he didn't come out so he's still there are his dad there's only two really outcome to this what would your advice me to a Trump\nNow well I I'm not going to speculate what happened what happened right much garbage been written will read the story a what\nA what I what I meant by the president is that what we we have to do more than we have to have supplied absolute full disclosure that by the Saudi regime as to what happened and then once we have full disclosure we will make the wreck was which was not the Obama administration because you're walking clams away right but we have to have\nFull disclosure and then the president will will decide whether it's arms trade thing whether to support we give economically to uh to Saudi Arabia that that will suffer or whether it was something else\nWhat did you think of when the president went to the un\nAh this this pattern two weeks ago at the annual meaning and he and he said to king Salman he's looking a you know what's this all fine and we're friends and all but like you got to start paying up for this defense were given your protection you're you're you're only paying three percent\nI Want that double your your your oil prices are too high a lot of people were outraged by that\nBut ah and then she said well gee nobody ever asked me that that he said well I'm not going to do that how does that all play out that\nWhat the president is a pragmatist and he's calling from ... in with questions about Saudi Arabia is about our partners and friends and age with elsewhere in the butt in Europe but he also very simple question why is it the countries that are incredibly wealthy need us\nSlip to subsidize the defense so it's a very rich reasonable question that we're going to keep on because if you're one of the richest countries in the world that you don't meet up the subs to subsidize your goal defenses in another place any part of the world not the Saudi Arabia\n[noise] tell several ... about the new book that you have out why we fight why should people by that\nWell look it's it's a great read it's about all the threats we face that you want to understand all of the dangers out there and how the president's going to beat them where the trucks\nBut in the book gives you that strategic analysis but more important to both the big picture stuff with the stories or great American heroes going right back where he was all over the years go up through World War two with the marine corps electric shifts the cooler\nThan Vietnam with capital red McDaniel spent six and a half years have\nOil to the prisoner of war but never never ever losing faith in God or the

true story give me five or ten dollars\nTo read it and that was one of the first one he brought home and uh that was the ten dollar bill because it was pretty big and then I Would read them and I say I'm done and it would give me ten dollars\nBut then like three days you'd asked me a question and I got to have the answer that question because I couldn't attend out but I'll never get the big thick

to blame well I Know there's nothing happens in Saudi Arabia without envious knowing it who's NBA he's the thirty three year old crown prince who jumped him over other people he sounded existing team\nAnd I think he's on a and a bad track\nI can never do business with Saudi Arabia again until we get this behind that phrase and what does that mean that means I'm not going back to Saudi Arabia is longest this guy's been charged you're selling the crown prince has to leave their stuff to them but I'm not going to have been the biggest offender on the floor of the United States Senate

special interest money millions and millions of dollars coming in the last thing we want to do is have the government running pharmaceuticals the best thing\nTo produce competition and to produce patents which makes sense and will eventually generics and low prices is a lot of firms competing against each other to produce low cost outcomes\nAnd so the contrast between me and my opponent could not be clear it's not my opponent for example on the tax cuts wants to return the money from the tax cuts back up to the federal government\nMy philosophy is to take the government and the federal dollars and bring them back down to the state at every opportunity and back down to our local officials to know how to deal with them better\nAnd it looked when it comes to drugs the opioid crisis is exactly this problem we passed a ton of rape builds up at the federal level but the problem is the money is trapped got our community service sports at the state level and it's not making its way down\nTo our [noise] our local sheriffs in Chesterfield in Waco and all kinds of our county and those drugs are vitally needed and we need to low cost drugs and so the basic idea is to return power back to the states and localities\nThank you congressman brat I'm Sorry I Want to remind our audience that we do have reception penalty seven seconds for Mr Brown Dave sorry or Mrs spanberger Abigail if you would um would you ask the question again I guess\nWhen I have traveled across this district the number one issue that people are talking about the rising cost of prescription drugs medicine and the cost of health care across the board is number one thing that people are talking about and how it is that we can actually interactive prescription drug\nIssue is we need more competition in the marketplace currently as possible for pharmaceutical companies to get what's called patents picketing where they are Longate the patents and they they depressed competition\nMedicare for example needs to be able to negotiate it's prescription drug prices the Veterans Administration is able to do so and some drugs or eighty percent keeper I mean ... minutes facing site and they are on Medicare fat\nIn terms of what we need to do overall with health care and\nI think we'll probably be talking about this quite a lot we need to strengthen our current healthcare system and we need a public option you will hear my opponents very frequently at some expensive program that I Do in fact not support I support the public option but while we're talking about the costs and special interest money I wouldn't know that in our tax bill\nDollars pharmaceutical companies the top five pharmaceutical companies got forty two billion dollars in tax\nAnd so when we're looking about at\nThe reason we cannot find a we cannot lower the price of prescription drugs and Medicare cannot negotiate it's prescription drug prices because of the pharmaceutical lobby it's so great it is so great that when we have a congressman like congressman brat\nWho said he would not add to the deficit who voted against spending bills because they would add to the deficit is willing to add one point nine trillion dollars to the deficit in order to get tax cuts to the tune of forty two billion dollars to pharmaceutical companies\nThey can discriminate on out here we are trying to you next question which I have to deal with immigration what impact if any of the current administration's immigration policy had one for juniors workforce\n\n\nWe as a country need comprehensive immigration reform is something that has been talked about for years we have not achieved bipartisan comprehensive immigration reform and right here in colpepper\nHave heard stories from people in the agricultural business who are concerned about\nWhat their long term they will have the employees that they need\nPeople threw out or district are concerned about the way immigration has become such a politically divisive issue the truth of the matter in we need immigration reform comprehensive bipartisan immigration reform that achieves a number of things first that secures our borders and our point of entry I worked at CIA at the former\nAs a former CIA officer I worked undercover I worked counterterrorism I worked in narco trafficking traffic\nUnderstanding the drug cartels working throughout Mexico I Am well aware\nThe threat that present themselves at the southern border and it's for that reason that we need comprehensive immigration reform that is strong on border security and strengthening our points adventurous but we also need immigration reform\nThat will meet the needs of the employers here throughout the seventh district here throughout the commonwealth of Virginia and we need comprehensive immigration reform that gets turned teach and dreamers children who were brought here through no fault of their own by\nAnd that what bipartisanship should look like this is a pressing issue that is impacting communities and economies across central Virginia and across this country and we need bipartisanship to actually drive\nA change on this issue but when we looked at what my opponent has been advocating for it is not a bipartisan solution the the bill the compromise bill that heat so frequently talked about it was a compromise between the far right and the more moderate\nAnd the more moderate Republicans there was a compromise bill there was a bipartisan bill that was put forth in Congress but it didn't get out of committee this time around but it was put forth by a Republican and Democrat there are people who are willing who were working to try and find ... bipartisan solutions but there are currently not enough of them in Congress\nThank you how to do such a good question\nHe has the current administration's immigration policies Adam Virginia's workforce\nYeah as I say we achieved a fierce result by first of all avoiding a huge amnesty bill which would have had a devastating impact on wages for the nation as labor supply goes up with a huge amnesty American wages go down\nAmerican Jobs go down and so our efforts on that front had been very positive\nAnd so uh my opponent just brought up comprehensive immigration reform we had the good last ... this year and she says that's not bipartisan Obama wish for that the Clintons worked for e verify and the major components in that bill every one until the last couple of years left has gone off the rails\nAnd so every major Democrat including Barbara Jordan the great civil rights leader was in favor of all the components in that good ... it is bipartisan we compromise we took care of seven hundred thousand DACA kids gave them a legal status that's a compromise no Democrat would vote for it\nThen President Trump up to one point eight million Dr kids the Democrats said no to that compromise than I did a bill that United parents and kids at the border with Senator Ted Cruz and Chuck Schumer the Democrat said no to that bill\nSo if you look at the facts of the matter and the actual legislation that came up and the vote it's very clear that my opponent falls to the very far left\nOn this issue of immigration she's been on the record in favor of sanctuary cities she said the states and localities can deal with these issues we don't need to cooperate with federal government that's what's sanctuary cities are you don't cooperate with the law of the land\nWe have plenty of write laws on the books if we would only follow the law and so it's just a matter of simple law enforcement\nAnd of course we need our federal ice agents working with us at the state local\nHer her objection there is very radical if you think about she said don't follow the law the way we should not cooperate with federal law enforcement and that's done it\nThe ice agents are the ones who are protecting us from the three hundred million lethal doses of fat and all that came across the border last year the heroin the ... the human trafficking\nThese are real and talk to the sheriff's up here in colpepper talk to the sheriffs in hand right go down in Chesterfield if you don't think it's a serious problem we have a hundred and fifty badge and had rifle alone for this and it's on the on oh sorry thank you very much thank alright I'm\nAbigail is chosen to use one of a red cards you have one minute to ... to ...\nThank you so much and congressman brat I appreciate you explain these me in the role of federal law enforcement agents because in heat I used to be one I used to work jointly with ice I work

holding farmers to break even prices since the terrorist went into place I haven't been above nine dollars we're creating challenges in our community and\nTo answer them the president's desire the president's choice within factor put a twelve billion dollar bailout\nOn the American taxpayers back at twelve billion dollar bailout farmers don't want bailout they want to sell their crops and so the notion that we would start a trade war to begin to get ourselves to the point where we're\nDoesn't make any sense to me it is reckless foreign policy it creates detrimental relationships with our friends our allies and our trading partners and long term it is tremendously detrimental to our stability in the world\nThank you Robert you [noise] I Do think you very much room to move to our next question I'm when I'm Sorry I Apologize this question is for you so you're in Second Amendment public said there continues to be a growing public concern regarding gun violence and school safety\nOne measures would you put in place to provide a safe environment for students\nAs I mentioned I Am a former law enforcement officer I guess that carry a gun every single day I Am well aware of the responsibility of gun ownership I grew up in a house with guns I grew up in a family a sportsman\nBut we can have Congress patients in our community about how it is that we can balance our Second Amendment right which I firmly support with the rights of our school children to go to school and he'll face in our county Indian rights our county I say our\nBecause the Congress and lived there as well one of our schools had\nViolence that day that I put my children on the bus\nWhen there was a threat of gun violence in our county which is a hard day no parents should feel that way No Child should feel concerned that they might die\nIn their classroom three out of four dues paying and are a number I Believe that background\nShould be in slate background checks on all firearms purchases this is simply applying the same standard that exist if you go to a federally licensed place a point of sale because that was as if you buy at a gun show\nThat is a first step forward that we can take the other thing that we should be doing when looking at gun violence is ensuring that our schools have the resources to deal with students who might be facing trauma or who might be facing stress\nMight be at risk for violence behavior this is a comprehensive issue is not one that we can solve in a day but it's certainly not one that we will be able to solve if we do not have leaders in Washington who are willing to have this\nConversations but the good news is there are already members of Congress who are willing to have that conversation there is a five part isn't background\nBill in Congress it couldn't get out of committee because there was not a ...\nPart of these discussions again I understand gun ownership I understand the responsibility of gun ownership and either Congress stations we can have about ensuring that people who are at risk themselves their community or others are not able to do harm in our schools\nThat you have a gal Dave\nIs thank you very much a this is a tough conversation to have and we've had plenty of them in the seventh district I have a daughter in the audience that goes to public schools well and of course we all work hard every day on this issue to keep our kids very safe\nSo I can be a major group\nOf all the folks across all ten county school resource officers school counselors mental health experts sheriff's police first responders everyone who was in a room with school councilors so that we had all voices and and they came up with three solutions are they all share with you tonight\nAt first and this was after the Parkland, Florida incident and a lot of this was in response to the failure in Parkland and we don't want to repeat that\nIn our counties here and so the first ones to hardening schools with school resource officers the second was to enhance significantly mental health\nEveryone was agreement that that was probably the major peace we need to work on and that's connected to the third piece which is to connect the dots between the federal government state government the FBI their local the localities and law enforcement and then the schools themselves\nAnd that was a total of tragedy in Parkland, Florida case they connected note that the FBI did not talk to the states states didn't talk to localities still look at the local police force visited that young boys home twenty times\nAnd no dots were connected the school resource officer was not in the school\nIn our districts and across our county we have outstanding law law enforcement you see them with us today the FBI is in constant communication with our state leaders\nAnd I'm very proud of the work our law enforcement does on these issues and so those are the primary solutions that I received by listening to my constituents those are the experts in our community and that's what they came up with\nA when it comes to gun if you want to follow the Nancy Pelosi liberal agenda and if you look at blue states\nCan I finish the question I have a few more seconds that when if you want to look at the liberal Nancy Pelosi agenda and my opponent will be a vote for that entire agenda all you have to do is look at the blue states and blue counts they say let's just work on this issue in this issue in this issue and have conversations about it\nBut up in those blue states they want to take away your guns and they have taken away guns and crime has not gone down at all in San Francisco or Chicago or New York\nThank you again there was a ... there was a a penalty of nine seconds on that answer thank you and I see\nOur next question goes to you as well sir I'm dealing with education and workforce readiness\nAccording to the Federal Reserve national student debt reached one point five trillion in the first quarter of twenty Eighteen because of this and the challenge challenge recent college graduates are facing in finding fulltime women more unemployment of adequate or implement adequate pay high school\nWhat plans do you have to either provide insurance to future collegiate or expand higher education funding to college alternatives such as the tea and trade schools\nRight thank you very much for the question is you know as a professor of run for Twenty years at Randolph Macon College\nAnd I work with students every day on a career planning you got to work with community colleges with senator stylish and not for years our our districts are blessed with great uh current technical programs already an excellent programs in the trade but we have huge moves we can still making sure man is part of that solution\nAnd so last year our results we improve the K. to twelve education bill by taking away federal mandates and so now our states and localities are not under all of the federal burns for high stakes testing constantly and they have the latitude to add these courses and internships and on the job training and career technical education\nAnd that's step one and it's got to this year I'm On the education committee and we also provided result\nIn higher read by doing it to keep the bill that enhanced in bronze all sorts of opportunities for kids to to follow new and

denied knowing what happened to his jokey President Trump suggested on Monday after talking to king Solomon that or he may have been a victim of road killers as I said on Algeria yesterday\n\nIt is inconceivable to me that Mohammed bin Salman crown prince Mohammed bin Salman NBS did not know about that it is inconceivable\nThat they would have set Fifteen operatives\nTo stand bowl and they had no idea why they were there there was no communication back to the authorities are in the government of Saudi Arabia now the new explanation seems intended to\nEase a political crisis for the Saudis and to diffuse some criticism of the Trump Administration which has refused to back down for billions of dollars in weapon sales through the kingdom so everybody here is looking to save face Trump Administration is looking to save face\nSaudi Arabia is looking to save face so they're going to talk of the story look the guy was murdered right he went in there to get a piece of paper and they chop them up into little pieces and put them back and you're going to tell me that that was not authorized by somebody\nAnd this is after they lied and said well he just left\n\nNow they have to come clean here because the Turks apparently intercepted his apple watch communication\n\nBecause like it's inconceivable that decided that the Saudis didn't have a camera working you know you go around these embassies and everybody spying on everybody that's the name of the game and especially when you're in a host country they got satellites and microphones that communication and bugs all over the

um I I I'm a journalist so I of course if they killed me I I Would be upset but I'm a lot of money writes on that um the wellbeing of millions of people right on that if we had an international\nEconomic crisis so I think people should step back and say to themselves do we really want to have a crisis assuming that these parties could set off a crisis and I I think they could\nUm and Saudi Arabia you ... have different forces inside Saudi Arabia that are battling each other you have forces in the Gulf that are battling each other and forces inside the United states that are battling each other and a lot of parties are trying to take advantage of this and\nTo score political points up which is very dangerous I think\nIt's an open here me yes go ahead so let's go to the let's let's go to the sudden situation when you when you said you you have a division there uh what is the division and what I mean look they now they're trying to save face because they change your story three times\nAnd now the story is laughable right so obviously they murdered this guy chops them up into little pieces and carried them out in McDonalds bags or something\nOr but when you speak of the division within the Saudis tell me a little more ill elaborate on that\nMom at Ben Taub man I can tell\nMan you're a with not originally supposed to be crowned print or his cousin Mohammed bin ... was supposed to be crown prince\nAnd there are a lot of forces inside the kingdom that would like to see him become crown prince including a lot of forces in the United states that don't like Mohammed bin Salman man and they're trying to score points with this I mean\nI guess it's normal uh assuming could show that he was killed we have no proof that he was killed we we're assuming he was all but once again a lot of noise that's coming out on that it's coming out from the forces that oppose Mohammed bend down ban\nThe forces that I'm opposed President Trump because President Trump is aligned with Monica then thought man and what what can count man [noise]\nUm and also what's up aligned with the Muslim Brotherhood which to which I I don't want to say that I come out because she'll be belong to it but he's sympathize\nWith it and a lot of the people that are making loud noises here are from the Muslim Brotherhood and they would love to see at the stabilization in the middle east\nUh places where they have made your interests and where they stand to gain if Saudi Arabia suddenly became incapacitated\nOr their economy suddenly what's in deep trouble and it's certainly a succession can come and we're no longer no longer clear so a lot is at stake here a lot is riding on this um and millions of people depend on the economies of the ... the countries that
