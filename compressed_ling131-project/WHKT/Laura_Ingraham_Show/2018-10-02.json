the other day\nYeah well a good news right it's that makes the the personnel and small business taxes from you know a lot of other nice features permanent passed it in the house\nI go to the Senate the Senate slow moving so I don't know whether they get to it before the election\nUh but all the Democrats including Bernie were critical of our initial package and they you know went on the\nPress and said hey you got to your favorite in the big corporations it's not fair you got to make this permanent for everybody and so we did and now they're not working right so they they're just politic the Democrats are just political always never policy and so now we did what they said\nThey want it and uh I don't think they're on board but we'll see we'll see we'll keep our fingers crossed they want to see some economic growth for the country where we're getting a lotta new folks independence and even some Democrats to take a look at the Republican\nParty not because they're feeling in their business and their family income in their pocket books the average\nFamily getting over two thousand dollars back in the kids are getting jobs and there's more job openings than there are people thinking right now it's just amazing\nA time that should be the story of two thousand Eighteen but the mainstream media of course has other objectives then run reporting the news and die instead they're just attacking one party state or the other well\nCertainly the uh Kavanaugh fiasco has dominated news congressman now you're not in the Senate obviously so you're not a decision maker on it you were in the house but look everybody is watching it everybody has some thoughts on it\nOr you want to share your thoughts on that uh where the processes now\nYeah well just in the in the last few days I mean flake kind\nOf threw a curve ball when he said you were going to\nMove on and half the vote and so now the Democrats were asking to delay and have the FBI look at it\nAnd the FBI can't form conclusions and so that you know the most troubling part is the Senate ears tasked by the constitution with doing the oversight and the advice and consent clock not the FBI\nThe parents' job to do that and they had all these documents for six weeks and the senators didn't do their duty not advise and consent and so at the very end of the new documents come out that they had for weeks and now the Democrats want to delay it\nI Wish they would ask them why did you ask any you could ask any of these questions you're all the documents for the last six weeks and instead they're just you know trying to push a pass the election for Strategic advantage\nI mean look whenever they whenever the FBI comes out next week I Know the Democrats going to ask for another to lay a but it'll it'll be interesting to see if the FBI she finds anything um you know they've investigated him his background six times let me let me ask you something you've been criticized\nCongressman by the Democrats\nAre on the VA saying that you voted and I I I Want you to respond to this that you actually voted in opposition to the VA end to military spending when you voted against one of the budget and you've been criticized by that by the spanberger team\nSaying look you're saying you are back in the VA you're backing the military but when push came to shove you voted no on that how do you respond to that constant\nWell I mean that's just you know simple politics than most people don't follow the details so they could be anyone wants to go look I've always voted for the military plot stuff that's all we want to write the Democrats won't do that in\nIn order to get a budget last year we plug up the military and nothing else that's the house budget that I voted for and at the end of the year in order to get a budget the Democrats insisted that we plots up government spending under social side by four hundred billion dollars the military park up was Seventy billion\nIn social science plants up and everything else in the in the mix was four hundred\nBillion dollars the tax cuts also for example where a hundred and fifty billion dollars they're paid for now if you're grown at three and a half they're totally paid for and the four hundred billion the Democrats\nWanted and guy and that we should not have allowed to happen at just goes onto the kids right that there is Twenty one trillion into we're trying to preserve a principled with a bunch of states flag\nPlus it except washing up the military [noise] certain democratic critique is exactly\nWrong has always right they're trying to say I vote against the military no the whole point is if you keep plugging up the social spending you won't have any money for the military [noise] and so it's a clever trick or that's what the Democrats do because they cannot\nTell the truth on power and the you know the the spanberger campaign they the curiosity is no one knows what she's running are\nI I seriously don't know what she's running out she came all weigh in on health care and then she found out the price tag was thirty two trillion and would double our tax rate and she backed off health care\nAnd then you know I I don't know what else I mean she's against the tax cut she said they were dangerous and so what did she for an immigration she won't name an upper bound so I guess it open door to seven billion people open borders\nI Know she's for sanctuary cities\nI don't get it I I don't I don't know what she's running [noise] and so if you ever had around after you know everybody would love to know when she won't even put a full biography and on the on the campaign website it's fairly shocking [noise]\nWell I'll I'll ever on thirty AM on Thursday and I will ask her just that also uh we're trying to get the big date worked out the debate that we're sponsoring\nAnd between yourself and Abigail I'm Still trying to get that day that I should get that in the next couple of days I'm told by a both of your campaign managers\nThere if I Want to ask you about something you put up the other day you said that and they are in the mail or that is a promoting to spanberger campaign that your kids found something in your mailbox for somebody had written on a on the mail or\nDave a rod in hell and you turn it over to the authorities and your kids found that it says right in the hell Dave I'm\nWhat it was turned it over I mean did you actually feel at risk or didn't think that something my comment that\nWell we we don't know if someone puts Ryan how on your door John I think years later it's not a good natured tank right though if you have kids at home and you get someone put palm card from the right on your door\nYes everybody has turned concerns these days whether it's you know heated political rhetoric guy and\nThat and so of course\n... in hell yeah that I wouldn't I wouldn't think that would be a fun thing to find on your door so um\nIt's it's it's not\nI mean what can I don't know why the spanberger campaign people keep doing this kind of stuff just just run your campaign run on the issues you have your debates and what are the parties is going to win I don't know why there you're not you don't find this from the other side you know ... from\nThe ... campaign and I'm just pointing out if you're spanberger supporter out there this is not helpful it's not helpful to your candidate it's not helpful to anything it's just it's just horrible so it's not stopped just run your campaign all they are\nThey're folks are stripping date burnt up or sign\nWhen we're getting big signs out they had people coming steel big science they say I I'm I signed up to put these up for Dave they stole sign they take stickers off people's cars I mean they have their science placed illegally all over the place we stop this is a law enforcement candidate and\nShe doesn't follow the law [noise] and so that's a little striking right and so we we follow the rules [noise] I always tell the kids that are folks at the door to always be underground have you're always be positive to everybody you know activity at all and\nCampaign would go to Abigail's home where she's got children and put Abigail rotten hell I just don't think they would do that and if they did they should get a\nAdmonished for that because it's not it's not setting I write tone\nAnd I would just tell the spanberger people that are listening to be now\nJust knock it off just run your campaign right I mean there's just not helpful all the stuff is not doing anybody any good whatsoever\nAnd it's really down to just stop it just ... you can't and if you're willing to win and that's David ... Eiffel go right nobody's going to die so just knock it off and run your campaign\nDave thanks for being with us more information go to they don't ... dot com Dave Brat dot com Abigail sniper will be

Coburn and that will be decided in the germs on November ... ring them in the paper they're Denver good to have you on the\nGood morning thirty days in a wake up and then November sex is that what it\nIt is now thirty five days\nIn a way you have thirty thirty six days here tomorrow that delivers Tuesday so I think it's five weeks out [noise]\nWhat is the most surprising thing so far you heard on the campaign trail like some you've heard from a ... century constituency voters and you said wow that's a shocker\n[noise] gosh a shocker for me [laughter] and it's probably something that's a little bit minor comparatively but almost everybody I talked about infrastructure so at one town I I Can't remember payment down there but um or Victoria [noise]\nAnd I think it was a Victorian one of the city managers or you know come up to me it goes in Denver and I said hey what's your biggest issue and [noise] he sort of looked at me and they said sewer lines not replace since Nineteen [noise] like you gotta be kidding me he goes yeah it's not good [laughter] I said sewer lines at break\nShe's like oh my gosh that's crappy [laughter] it's amazing to me the things that people are dealing with on the trail and and just some of the things you're really amazing or [noise]\nYou know the one in ... county I had one of the mother come up to me and she goes I'm really sick and drive them I Can't [noise] you know your homework every night where I could get why fine\nHe really get to hear all the real problems on the trail [noise]\nFlorida isn't this interesting because the district that you would represent is very diverse obviously in for people to say look I don't have a wife by where I live a that's a real issue for for people in today's environment that\nReally does it go up when when when you talk about the the urban and suburban districts\nLet's get to the president's when on Canada last night Kennedy came\nInto the president's demand NAFTA which I think is now dead All right then never be seen again\nAre replaced by us and the U.S Mexico Canada agreement now here's the reality the Canadians dropped every single demand they had before midnight because the president was going forward alone at the press conference on Wednesday\nHe said he was done negotiating with candidate he didn't like their negotiators you didn't like their attitude and he said he told his staff he was done with him he was going forward without them then they acquiesced on every demand this is a good thing for the American worker in a good thing for your district tell us why\nWell I mean the first thing in the first thing you see is that they upped the limits the TPP right on actual dairy exports I mean we're talking about you know the import export of dairy with Canada\nWe can ship more dairy products into Canada they've opened up and for the district I mean that's just amazing [noise] um and I think that's what what I've been saying on the trail you've heard me Jonathan to farmers weren't screaming they said we believe that there has to be some short term pain for long term game [noise]\nUm they they have supported Trump [noise] they should have at some point it's probably gonna be too much but they understood system for so long and they want free trade but they don't want subsidies they won't trade and I think free and fair trade is what we're looking at right now and\nI'm a military guy guy so I called it to tea right fear free and fair trade what we need and I think you're seeing\nThese promises being kept by the by the president [noise]\nAbout the ...\nI was at the un all week last week and a ... one of the key provisions that\nCame out there is that the president is looking\nFor some way to solve the Yemeni crisis I'm there they haven't gotten there but I Know that was that was a big topic along with with Israel and the Palestinians on any on everyone's mind\nBased on your military background how do we solve that because right now a there seems to no end in sight\nFifty thousand Yemeni are dead and we've also got a humanitarian crisis that could go beyond the pale of anything that we've seen children are starving there and we're backing the Saudi along with the\nYou know it's pretty interesting John it's\nA great question because I don't even know right now there's an answer in our military intelligence circles about how to extract the Iranians from what they're doing and their support the hate to use and I think that's been a big deal for us as it\nYou know Iran at the number one number one per state sponsored terrorism and I think that what they're trying to you they're trying to use terrorism is like a hedge demonic exercise\nTo do all these awful things I just think if it was made going in there I Would try to find out that we could be more surgical and removing the Iranian influence uh based on intelligence gathering and based on a special operations\nThat would be the first thing I Would see is there any kind of alternative of course of action\nWhere we can concentrate just on removing Iranian influence um arms money and the things that they do and I think that would be the first steps that I Would take [noise] also I think when you saw General Mattis go downrange I think it really comes down to the mission planning also in process we'd have to improve our mission planning processes are the Saudis do\nOr they have to improve their mission planning process is like a process does save lives\nWe have to have some kind of legal structure there well we're not doing something or not supporting something that sort of ad hoc when it comes to targeting so those would be the first things that I Would do is how do we surgically removed Iranian influence in the second thing is how do we improve the mission planning process that everyone is collateral damage while we're trying to remove that cancer\nDenver I've got to go to a quick word from our sponsors stay with us and want to ask you about

arms\nSurreptitiously through has by law and um I think they want to keep that conflict going in Iran has said repeatedly that they think Israel with an illegitimate state so they believe it has no right to any territory anywhere so so long as they repeat that position you're gonna you're not going to get anywhere\nWhere with Edward uranium here the John triggers radio networks he's alive in Cairo, Egypt he's our\nCorrespondent for the Jon Stewart who's radio network in the middle east is also with the voice of America and he's a CBS News correspondent for very long time covering a Middle Eastern affairs [noise] so let me ask you this and we're Hamas\nWhy would the Hamas not be in favor of some sort of a two state solution to give the Palestinian people their own nation why would they be in opposition to that what's the alternative just perpetual war\nUm I think many a radical militant Islam is ah the the Hamas people or the Muslim Brotherhood and they ultimately believe that they're going to vanquish Israel anyway um but what they're aiming for right now is to have their\nOwn little independent conclave enclave in God's law Bob ... and they are are they were going to find a deal with Israel for a long term truce\nAgreement which I think Israel because they don't really want to see Israel doesn't really currently want to see a two state solution anyway so they would be happy to see God's the guy's a stand and West Bank stand up and down up\nHave those two sides not reconcile a but God's out the amount of people found that to Egypt was pushing them [noise] ah to come to some sort of an agreement with a with a president a bath and then they just stuck their foot down and that sort of squashed\nThe long term truce deal with Israel so I think they're willing to have a long term truce deal with Israel but just not to have a um a two state solution\n[noise] so it sounds like what you're saying is that the president's grand plan here to bring peace to this region um which they've not unveiled other than we know that involves two states they leak that what you're saying is that uh in your estimation your analysis that Jared Kushner\nPlan is going nowhere whatever that might be\nI I don't want to be that pessimistic I mean it looks that way but I mean\nMoments Bob I I think what we've seen over the years is\nThe change from the ground is mostly been the result of complex and I shudder to think that that's going to happen again but it could very well because the middle east the tender box and could go up at any minute in any particular place ... people keep organizing their\nTheir protest on friday and they keep playing the Arab News stations that there are people are getting killed after they marched them into the into harm's way um\nAnd the Israelis are not budging an inch on a two state solution so I don't think either side is willing to make the necessary um moves towards a peace deal and ah as I said once again we could see a conflict that would set the whole place up or you know a conflict that could ultimately have results on the ground\nWell the only hope here is that I think what the president has done in moving the embassy to Jerusalem the U.S embassy is he gave Israel the biggest chip they wanted right at the outset and he got that John and of course President Abbas was saying at the un in his speech that based on that\nHe doesn't want the U.S a faulty can't trust them he doesn't have there been centrist he started one hundred percent aligned with Israel so why would I Do share with them\nBut the other side of the coin is that the president now I'm In a in a position where he can ask\nThe Israeli government for a number of concessions because he's already given them the ... the one big thing they want to write so that I think that's what the strategy is whether or not Edward that's got to play out I have no idea but\nIt's look it's a place right I mean at least it's the plan and we'll we'll see what happens but I think your analysis is spot on President Abbas\nSays oh he's really in a lose lose situation because Hamas is not going to sign off on anything he does so then the other question becomes ... or ... or you're better off getting a facilitator in there just\nI'm just negotiating with Hamas or you better off\n\nI think that they they are\nA lot closer to an agreement with Hamas than they are without bath and bass\nIsn't a bad position a internally with respect to his own party and if he made concessions with his own party could could toppled him he's an old man I think he's eighty three now waiting for getting close to eighty four\nHe's had heart problems and uh\nI I I think with all the pressure the Egyptians have put on him I think he would have come up with a deal he cut up so I think we're just they're claiming a with respect to his own party he's not able to come up with a deal never mind with him on [noise]\nUm so you've got a lot of players here that are unstable um I don't want to analyze\nUh there are there people who are trying to pull down prime minister Netanyahu is well um and you remember of course a prime minister or being not who was shot 'em so\nUltimately or if he were to making a deal make a deal and they work to agree on it to God God only knows if there would be someone out there to shoot him as well so um there's so many\nSo many factors in this kind of a a situation that it's difficult to see how you could move it forward but President Trump the merits of trying new things every time you look at him so I mean I I give him credit for that and who knows you might think of a new a new plan\nWell look at least she's trying we're trying to do something uh so I I\nI really do though like the fact that the president leads that he was he was a he was going towards the two state solution because many of us that really want to see the solved that don't have um some of the viruses that go with either side\nYou really can't see this ever getting solved without without each country having their own state I mean you just can't see it and I thought the president was spot on\nWhen he says the Palestinian people have a right to be just self self rule they certainly shouldn't be\nYou know one of the some of the Israelis and I think that makes I think that makes a lot of sense and we're only got a couple more minutes I Want to get very quickly to um the Turkish situation\nWhen did the Turks play now in in this whole thing like in a I've only got two minutes but to find\nTurkish foreign policy right now as it relates to the Gulf and Syria and ... where where where\nWhere are the\nTurkey is divided because they were trading main trading partners\nAre Iran and Iran is in trouble so they need to you know they need to find new outlets the countries there are there other main ally proud for a president or the ... he's a a promised he's a Muslim Brotherhood guy and he's in a corner\nOf being in a bind because he he's he needs to come to an agreement with the Russians I despite the fact that there are opposed to his positions in Syria and with respect\nTo what I it'd be a sonic world in general um he had to walk the line and a cut cut deals with President\nBush did and that's what they sort of done in not in Lebanon north of Syria a so he's struggling aligned with everybody he's making compromises while at the same time are putting out harsh rhetoric um so I think are under the surface he's trying to come to\nTerms with both the U.S or because they keep saying that they're going to be put down a you know patrolling the north of Syria together it hasn't happened um I suspect that may not happen but I think they're trying to repair those bridges they've tried to repair a Brit\nEach other on a lot of different issues um so I think he's in trouble economically witness currency in trouble with its trade with a with Iran and a lot of people want to putting gas and oil pipelines and so he sort of trying to cut deals here in the ship afloat [noise]\nAll right well to replace out any uranium from Cairo\nJ.

go meantime beat Dave Brat\nCampaign [noise] under some fire yesterday because they had announced that there were three debate [noise] one debate in coal pepper on C SPAN one debate was supposed to be in Richmond with the CBS TV affiliate though that was supposed to be televised\nSo that was October twenty fifth and then the third debate which was the radio debate which was hosted by myself\nAnd NPR's Kathy Louis [noise] ah we don't have a\nDate for are the other two actually had that [noise] so the spanberger campaign as you know Abigail Spanberger who will be with us on Thursday Abigail Spanberger by the way a without on Thursday an Abigail or she\nHer staff put out a statement saying that the ... campaign had cancelled all the debates and they weren't having it including by the ... campaign that responded to that\nAnd let me read their statement this is from the Dave ... for Congress reelection campaign [noise] uh\nThey said this is nothing more than the spanberger campaign trying to distract from the real story that span burgers own volunteers were caught harassing Dave Brat and his family it was our campaigns understanding\nThat we were in the midst of negotiating the second two debates with the spanberger campaign we simply want on his terms with both candidates having equal opportunities to present their arguments in a fair for them\nSo here's what happened and I got under the er the spanberger\n[noise] agreed to the first debate on October Fifteen which will be covered by CSPAN and coal pepper [noise] they said the second debate which was October twenty fifth in Richmond by CBS [noise] uh\nThey had not they had backed out of that commitment\nAnd I was pushing for a date for mine debate [noise] and the spanberger campaign was saying we can't get a date from day [noise] so I called the ... campaign and here's what they said they said the fifteenth is good [noise] we never agree to the twenty fifth\nAnd we've never agree to a date for fragrances radio debate that's what they told me they agreed to have it\nBut they didn't agree with that that's true and what the ... campaign told me is they were going to do the first debate on the fifteenth\nAnd see how it goes and they were also criticized the spanberger campaign they said they were negotiating in bad faith [noise] and that they wanted to dictate the terms [noise]\nAnd that's where we stand right now so both camps claiming blaming the other um but the ... campaign\nAbsolutely denying that the TV debate another Fifteen [noise] has been cancelled they said that is still on and that they wanted to go forward and see how that debate goes on what they were concerned about is three things\nThe spanberger people stacking the audience with anti ...\nActivists [noise] I'm liberal moderators not giving each candidate a fair opportunity to engage in express their views and uh basically biased [noise] format\nThat turns into a sideshow [noise] so that's what they the ... campaign said they were concerned about\nThe spanberger people\nBasically said that's just not true we don't want to dictate anything [noise] I can only talk from my experience in negotiating the\nFormat of mine debate I submitted it today they said fine [noise] I submitted the spanberger and they had a number of changes they want it [noise] so\nI can only do from my experience I don't know what happened with these other the other debates but I have a format that's proven successful on the radio a center to Katie Price [noise] campaign manager\nShe had she had signed off on it then sent it to spanberger I'm Justin Jones or communications director and they have certain revisions but there were officials were not a big deal I mean the only thing that I'm not agreeing to but the judge\nThat works on TV [noise] look I've been through a hundred days that simply does not work in a radio format so we're not doing that now they you know we'll have something where the audience can submit questions but\nYou know giving people microphones instead standing up you can't follow it on the radio so we're not doing that so I reached are rejected that other than that I think they had a few minor changes I mean they were cosmetic a time and things of that nature but it was like an hour Fifteen minutes anyway\nA debate or both camps signed off on it was minor revisions\nAnd that was that so I don't I don't know what went on with the Richmond debate with CBS I've no idea although I did try to get CBS engage with me and they turned it down and said they had this whole big set of a debate rules [noise] so I'm not sure how that how that wet\nBut um [noise] here's my general position on this right this is a very competitive race I'm very upset by the way it's been dumbed down from\nPeople writing go where the hell on cars and putting it that Dave's door to forty a request to substitute teaching to town hall meeting the whole thing is ridiculous I mean these are very intelligent candidates with a lot to say and we should be debating the issues", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Laura Ingraham Show", "city": "Portsmouth", "day": "02"}
