you tell me how are you\nI'm doing well doing well busy busy these days but uh but but during well\nYou're giving me and I tell you that this is not an endorsement but there's a a reflection of what I saw when you were in the general assembly working again I think we're in the community together\nYou're always justice energetic smiling go get them kind of guy you know like the um you know like a Mickey Rooney was put on a show you're always just like vitamin ... are you able to maintain that\nYes you know I I Am you know I'm Glad to represent great poked and the the first district you know I I get my energy from that they are they're very has an individual that they work hard every day and uh do do great work so it's hard not to be motivated by that but it's it's\nHard not to be motivated to ah by the by the true honor that it is to represent them\nAnd I appreciate that and I'm having been\nWashington at all\nBut you know Chris I mean I think it's certain times it it it does it does give you pause as to you know where we are at the country and the divisions that are out there but but I always work every day to try to find\nIs that you have deadlines are constitutionally\nA enacted that hold the line on these things you can't go to continuing resolution that's an awful term I'm all for it but they also have I I Love the single object rule in in legislation ... where do you deal with one subject and that's it you don't have this big mash up coming back from the other from the Senate\nOr vice versa that just just blows up the whole deal\nThough I agree and and you know be a good good good thing is that in the in the U.S house we remember the same rules that you offering their general ... every ... you and I both know that is\nStill Pruitt you figure out the rules about how things are happening on the site has different rules so many states kind of get combined together and you look at it go and how to balance is related in any way shape or form in the ... the the\nThe most highlighted example is a political act passed\nThe title of the bill was not the horrible act they they they took they took a ... bill script all the language out of it kept the number and the title of the certainly the house version of the Affordable CARE Act so it it it's that kind of procedural stuff that you just wait for the why how\nCan that happen but I Would argue that you know sticking with\nThe logic of systems Waikiki injustices manuals to wait to make sure that your keep debate on track you make sure you don't have a lot of you know related to the doctor a piece of legislation people go how did that get in there and it's kind of like you know crawling everything on the last train leaving the slaves it's like\nWell that stuff doesn't doesn't or are there are not related or should be used you know as the ... as well as a vehicle to pass things that are unrelated so I I agree and that's that's one of the I think the problems up here is that it doesn't\nIt doesn't require the necessary debate in twelve plus see when you're using that mechanism when you have unrelated ah aspects of legislation or language or way to build a people just you know I look at it and go how how could that\nWell I Hope you all will take a look at some of the rules and get more to wherever of Virginia way of governing up in DC because\nI I one of the things that are when you pull back from politics and and watch sports people get upset when they see rules violations because they know the rules ... last night there was a has just in Berlin or through as a wider was a beautiful smart\nIn Enron darling he was a pitcher for the Mets and the age and some other teams\nSaid that is a pitch you when you are warming up that you put your Mitt down and say grab Patel I'm done that's a perfect pitch and it was and it was called the ball and the next pitch the Boston Red Sox guy hit it for a home run\nAnd as a as what I'm saying you go that's outrageous only because the the the teleprompter had\nThat was wrong and what happens when people in in politics people they don't know the rules to get upset about that is just not cricket you're not doing it the right way guys you know we deserve better and so they pulled back behind the scenes they shrugged their shoulders and throw their hands\nYou know it's just it's just not working on on on my behalf you know I I don't get right into the distance and or anything you can do to to to change that would be for the benefit of my rent let's get back to the ... let's get back to the national district what what are your voters telling you\nWell you know we're here a lot of state I think ... they are they're very interested in\nHow do we create a a continual um increase in our economy I think people are are very positive about where the economy just\nAh I think they appreciate what's been done by Congress lessons regulatory burden in changing the tax code to make it on your for businesses\nIndividuals but the things that they want to see going forward or what I call a stinging Park Service economy and first of those who knows how to next to a system that assures that our children students get the necessary uh educational experience to be watching them\nTo feel adopt or they're seven point one million jobs over and\nChris and Seventy five percent of those jobs will not require a four year degree and that means we have to emphasize career and technical education as much as we do college track education because that's where the jobs are in those towers today are skilled jobs that have occurred as far as a career when you go from an apprentice\nYour journey that to a pastor and have a career there and do well in many instances better than you really want a job that requires a college degree so I think people look at that and say that's where we have to a New Hampshire looking on going how it's going to make sure that my child is soft on like how to make sure the education\nSystem gives them that knowledge skills abilities\nTo compete for the jobs that are available today any future and and I think they look at it and say hey the other things when the economy are going really well but Chris when I talked to him it's just across the district I can tell you the top three things they talk to me about our workforce workforce in workforce area and they said\nWe could grow up business today we can just find workers to do the job and it's you know there are more job openings to build the job openings\nSo we're really going to happen is out there that must have happened in one other element to this article and that is brought in his village for both the connection\nIs important and that was a supportive education so that when a ... a lot of families children go to school and have their tablet computers they bring them home and they can't connect\nAs they are hard for them to do the signs that said they've been given or the mom and dad my political vehicle take according to the library\nDonald wife right businesses many times the areas that don't have high speed can't do the business they need to do to be successful\nAnd her one of the ways to bring\nAwesome doctors can connect with patients without going to go to an office only ... miles and miles away and can get care and quality of those things out game change right so we are we brought on that we have to make sure we have education system of South Korean talking about education is Washington Post college truck education\nAnd these are these are these are the tough issues because people don't go broadband which workforce\nDevelopment those those don't get the people out to the polls I mean they're just like that that makes sense I like that you know because when people get down into the the ... and I've talked about with other callers today in politics and the government is complex and people don't like complex it like five were bumper stickers because they're pretty busy trying to make their lives working\nIn putting that into the context of their daily lives come out and vote whichever way is a tall order for a lot of politicians right\nSure\nPolicy is complicating it takes a lot of hard for anybody anybody in our in our leadership position whether\nElected or not has that allegation hot those conversations and you know those things that I'm projects are really still things I hear from the south it's just something that I come up with some people say hey clerical\nAnd yes it could be soundbites in a way to help our economy but we drill down is okay we've done these things happening and you can always say or something that was quite shocked\nAbout us but I think people are going to cost a lot I don't want a team owners elected office or asking for people to say I think that well that's great you know chocolate set up to an ACC and eat that's great but what people want to hear to work if\nI'm going to play smartphone again what are you going to do in the future how do you understand the things you have to beat on what are you gonna do to accomplish that one did you what you want to come back to us or if you are ... ... s just you know approaching the last ... last things are hidden abuser\nBut I was able to accomplish and I just don't want that they want you to understand which of course they want you to project vision of what the future about how\nThose things are going to be addressed so it's not just the laundry list thanks you\nGuys what are you going to happen next or stolen people's concerns and but on the challenges facing a place\nTo tell people Ortiz is all going to politics is about the future not the past it is and you can be like look what happened to various the economy is great you know unemployment is historically low and they just threw out the government pretty much there's ... there's some there's some\nUndertow currents that you just have to go out there and pound doors\nYou understand and listen to people\nBecause the elections are about tomorrow night yesterday that seems awfully right you know I I really appreciate your calling in today we wish you the best out there and the campaign trail you got what Eighteen days left\nEighteen foot\n[laughter] everybody 'cause we've only got four hundred and Seventy two days to the Iowa caucuses that there isn't that isn't\n[noise] well there are already out there already out there getting their campaign strategist and consultants lined up for the for the caucuses and people are starting packs and all that kind of stuff but never ends Virginia is always a test case and\nNow we're blessed for people who will offer themselves up for public service and a regardless of party or we thank you Rob thanks for calling and we'll be joined in the next segment by Dr Robyn McDougal the Virginia Commonwealth University Wilder school joined\nWhat do you think his future in Virginia Republican Party is a he would have lost two statewide races and want a nominating convention but in this hypothetical would have done better than some people anticipated certainly did in the last ... primary\nI did that make him viable going forward because people say well he's got a built in base of support in the parking\nAnd has to be reckoned with or will people say you've had your chance on the stage and you've lost several times so a lot of time to exit\nGreat question Julian thanks for calling and I would suggest that it is dependent upon how\nWell he actually does relative to the national spread and the Virginia I'm nor I mean does and I think that the north um raise last year was a point that's a big number if you're a Republican especially because three years before that\nThat Gillespie got within here's breath and a beauty mark Warner I think if he's in double digit losses it's very difficult for him to to ah to run again a state wide but who knows\nI Do think the Republican Party is going to be going through some changes are gonna be like a soul searching after this election you know um and there'll be looking at at new directions new candidates or to to go forward I don't know how much staying power Corey would have with a double digit loss and I'll just after three statewide offices but thanks for calling you\nGot any other questions no sir\nHave a good thanks man hey uh NBA what do you what do you like they're the warriors\n\nAh you know my position if anybody about the war [laughter] the throne Golden State in the in the finals or the playoffs let's got to be one of a couple of got to be Boston Celtics looking pretty good\nWho else in the west yeah\nI bought Boston most good I mean we'll see what happens with the rockets that they can integrate their new pieces including Carmelo Anthony ... a lot of people are down on 'em\nA reason for the whole not very good he's never listen I think ...\nShortcomings but I think the sort of move up in a recent the bias overlooks a a pretty pretty impressive tenure in the league or despite some of his uh his recent a sort of a downgrade in his in his game\nSimilar I think um you know and as you know I've got some Philadelphia connection so I've always got a soft spot in my heart for the Sixers ah I'm I'm I'm not sure if they're quite ready to make the leap but we'll see other than anybody but them lawyers 'cause I I\nFive six seven Philadelphia Seventy six or something like that we all these advantage on her shoulders\nSo sort of ingrained in the Seventy Sixers culture back in the day for us to proceed Conan joins circular you took thanks okay as a doctor McDougal patiently waiting for us Yes sir I Am there she is now are you Robert yet\nI Am happy to Lincoln's Birthday by one day [laughter]\nStores are still open by the way\nI exactly I I Will make sure that I make my you know purchase and get it you know drop to your doorstep eight that\nAmazon is pretty much a daily stop at our house so just to get everyone in the order for either in there you go perfect\nAnd we look folks if you're listening to stock in cardboard boxes whatever the company is publicly traded that makes cardboard boxes that Amazon buys by that stock because we have so much cardboard box in our garage backed up with\nDogs and we're we're right there with you yet are I'm sure so a doctor Robin McDougal is with the Virginia Commonwealth University in ... Wilder school tell us briefly about the water school when you're doing\nYes so uh we're we're a school of government and public affairs at VCU um rains in the top fifty in US News and World Report for schools the public affairs for undergraduate and graduate program focused on criminal justice homeland security and emergency preparedness\nPublic administration as well\nAs programs and the master's level in urban and regional planning and a PHD program and public policy and then we also have our Center for public policy which I direct which ended our consulting and community engagement arm of the work we do in the wild her school so you will see a lot of things around economic development\nAh leadership in training look when the government outreach and things like public policy polling\nThat we knew within the center for public policy in the wild her school\n... we're going we're coming up pulling real quick but you guys actually go out and work with uh other local governments and businesses that you helped him not just I think people don't understand that about higher education the value that you bring to the community and the state yes\nWe really do I mean we're done\nEverything from looking hoping that localities looking at potentially providing incentives for certain business to come into their community and doing a return on investment of what that economic impact would look like on the proposal stage with regards to incentive then come back and provided down that actual economic impact\nIf they went forward with a business and the impact that it had on the community with everything from revenue to job creation other aspects and that way out we've done valuations of um you know criminal justice programs so the implementation of a mental health program or a drug treatment program on reducing recidivism for\nLocal jail or a a community partner we worked with a non profit from everything from their evaluations of the program done projects that they do to our so coordinating and combining the\nActual help that they need with regards to our students and our staff\nSector as well as the business community are\nLooking at a third party evaluations of programs in projects for the private sector looking to pitch to the general assembly and need an actual third party non biased evaluation of that work being able to provide that report\nFor that company for the general assembly to look at legislative impact so we do we are a continual partner\nEvery single day with our local and state governments around the commonwealth um and it it really is what we live and breathe in the wild or school specifically um we do it at a much more of cost effective rate than our private sector\nCounterparts\nIf you will because it really is our mission our vision and it allows that can bring to bear are academic\nExpertise is well within the Wilder school you know we have every three academic faculty in their area of expertise and you want to talk about the economic impact I've got four economist in our\nUrban and regional planning program or you want to talk about the impact of an opiate program a treatment program I've got to criminal justice or academics me that their area of expertise and they get asked all around the country to look you know present their research and were able to bring expertise to be here for our localities are\nIn the commonwealth in Virginia so whether you're a service higher education school because\nI mean we are we are you know we we provide at all give us your students that we will educate them freshman in college and graduate school in PHD program give us your workers that we will train them in executive leadership and management preparation\nI give us your legislators and you're allowed to us and we will trained in policy analysis on the impact\nOf a variety of hacker on legislation and give us your community that will help you come up with good solutions and then you need the evaluation impact on medically shows that we really are um the one stop all encompassing education and consulting\nAcademic arm for a local and state government and our our independence students around the common law\nAnd that's why I brought it up and it will go to the polling but your that your operations down there because I think it's so important for people to understand the totality of a lot of things the government can especially hard he says which has a bull's eye on his back around the country but in Virginia we've got a great higher education system we really need to be proud of it\nUh even though it's you know it's it's appropriate to hold them accountable national questions but a lot of things you're talking about are free they are an exclusive of of usual operations and they are a complementary to what you are doing and actually facilitate what you were doing in higher education I think it's wonderful I think it's misunderstood mountain understood at all\nBut let's jump into some polling a that's a while the school has done what are you sitting out there what have you seen what direction are we going\nWhy don't we talk a little bit like Clinton on earlier so let's talk a little bit about policy and in polling in public policy that we did on this summer we were out in July we'll have another poll rolling right here after the election in November but in our in our public policy arena you talked about higher ed so we're talking to\nAround the entire commonwealth so true representative sample of all five Reagan um\nOf our commonwealth and when we look at and ask people what they think about the value of higher education in Virginia over eighty percent of our responded believed that the community colleges that we have\nEncouraging our work their car over sixty five percent believes that are public four year institutions are worth the cost and then right under fifty percent believe that our\nPrivate schools in the commonwealth and worth a car so it's really important that you said that question around them in Virginia we value higher education and not only did we value it but we're putting out a product that comes around the commonwealth think is age appropriate return on investment\n\nThat's our town halls are tough I read about [noise] weekend to learn the caravan of Central Americans trucking\nNorth through Mexico was

a Chinese no what happened\nSo the idea that we need days and days of investigation uh and forensic work and it's ridiculous\nJust tell us what happened and\nIn my opinion I you know in the United states government that was\nCommitted to the values that we shouldn't be standing up for\nWould be saying that we wouldn't be sending people over the smile next to the crown prince we wouldn't be raising ridiculous theories about road operators we would be saying we need the fact we need them yesterday and then we can figure out what the right policy\nAt the post in our global opinion section

there's no one better experience or first in America then you know on what is going on with his cower ban\nIt people coming up through Mexico's from Guatemala to get into the United states uh illegally basically flaunting some of their nose at our laws many people like me see this as an invasion\nWe don't know who makes up the seven thousand caravan elite we know there's people that are there for economic things we also don't know what the bad actors that might be better did there why should we do in the situation of regime\nWe should immediately the part of the military to our border and make sure not to eat when no one can get into the border I get into the United states\nThough I middle Easterners or we all are very aware that for a lot has major\nOperations center in South America to train people on how to go to the United states and look at the work that out to anybody who wants to come to America we have to do is make your way to Mexico pay some money to the drug cartels and you'll be smuggled into the United states this has been going on for decades\nAnd no one president before President Trump has basically put these put down whether they are Republican or Democrat I mean this is happening under Bush that's what's happening under Obama this what's\nHappening under Clinton had just got worse especially under the Obama years so we know right now than they are operative when this caravan from people from the middle east to embed within that care of that trying to get into the United states\nThere are many actors are trying to get into the United states who are involved in putting together in this caravan including people from within the United states from political party within the United states basically creating this\nWhole problem right before the election\nFor purpose but the American public is not down at the American public are waking up and the American public is behind it president\nWho is committed to putting America First and is doing everything he can to ensure that America remains protected and safe and you know what John in a way this is good this is happening before this very important election we're heading do\nBecause this is doing in it if you will not be conservative\nAnd back and freedom loving Americans who love this country who are concerned about this country and not just talking about Republicans or conservatives I'm Talking about independence I'm Talking about these and people\nAre thinking okay we can understand about helping some people who need help you know here and there\nYou know maybe a hundred here on the hundred there but the caravan upon caravan over it within seven thousand this caravan it's coming you cannot control your country and allow open borders with this type of care that's coming into the country\nLast year to what you said earlier I Want to get to do things to the Caribbean coming over and the president saying look if Mexico the opposite we just heard some clips from above the vice President Pence and six receive a patio they're really banking on the Mexican authorities to stop them\nIn the event they don't and I think it's fifty fifty right now whether they're going to be able to do that\nIf they get to the border and the president does deploy the ... the military as he said he would whether it be National Guard or not in closing the border\nUm what is the risk that that becomes another PR disaster for Trump in the Republicans like kids in changes when we went to the zero tolerance policy how do we deal with that\nLook it will just mobilized the base for Trump and those who care about the country at this hotel nightmare look the lead paint us anyway that left turn on the left does not want to pick your borders left on the open borders bring\nAnd let them search for it you know what that that is an old that's not to identify with the American public anymore\nThey they are the ones at the less friends in the one that's making the screaming and yelling but in the last election the presidential election and twenty sixteen thought us one thing is that the decent American people who care about America be America which was written by our founding fathers\nWant change will be really wants to take your borders they want one language they want the economy how can we have a bad economy if they have people like this coming into the country when you learn to use me John you mentioned my new book arise\nI don't mind will cry because I wanted Americans to understand what's at stake and I'm going to run a little bit of with you about what the legal immigration is doing to the country and I share these numbers in my book arise\nAnd didn't billion dollars to twenty two billion dollars a year is spent on welfare to legal criminal aliens by state governments\nTwenty two billion dollars a year is spent on food assistance programs like food stamps a wink and pre school lunches for illegal criminal aliens\nTo appoint a billion dollars a year it's not the Medicare for illegal criminal aliens twenty billion dollars a year it's not the primary and secondary school education for children here illegally and they still cannot even speak English John Seventeen million dollars a year it's been for education for the American born children\nOf illegal criminal aliens alternate anchor babies\nThree million dollars a day is spent in Carson aid illegal criminal aliens\nThirty percent of all federal prison inmates are illegal criminal aliens Nineteen billion dollars a year it's been on illegal criminal aliens for welfare and social services where the American taxpayers\nTo a hundred billion dollars a year in suppressed American wages are caused by the illegal criminal aliens I'm into insects illegal criminal aliens send home forty five billion dollars and remittances to their countries of origin\nWhen you add all this call up this is a whopping three hundred and thirty eight point three billion dollars a year\nOut of your pocket to my pocket our children's pocket and everyone listening to us right now and I encourage everyone listening if you want to understand more about the problem we are dealing with\nHappened there based on the facts that are presented to the states will determine what was really fun\nIt was just alive [noise] plus covering\nBody um secretary of state Mike Pompeo on the show get fair which is just it's just a total mess\nAnd um we're going to get to cook for here Mike here's the president\nSaying that it certainly looks as though missing Saudi journalist ... dead and the president and we understand very upset by the lives that have come out of the Saudi embassy again\nUm you know I had a couple callers earlier that really questioning like why are you know who cares and it doesn't matter what he's Muslim Brotherhood and he was an operative and maybe it's a conspiracy and maybe it was a set up that don't believe the Turkish government\nBut you have to really understand it that's why you turned me and you have to understand what's going on here and uh Sean Spicer said the same thing Dave Brat said the same thing\nUh this is a slap in the face to President Trump and you just heard Spicer an hour ago who was there in Saudi Arabia when the president made his first trip and chose to go to Saudi Arabia is his first trip in order to build a relationship that they basically took for granted\nAnd put the president that would have very awkward position and so it was a trust issue and the problem with NBS is thirty three years old see this is why you have a law in the United states like like you can't be president until you're thirty five\nVictory there's thirty three years old Jared pushed her is thirty three years old and that's why you can't be president who you're thirty five you you know you're just as a maturity issue\nAnd you know what they did and they're sending these operatives in and somebody coming out with a look at life look alike where it gets close are we sending in a a a setting at a at a\nUh for Clinton said Dr flying I mean there were the bones so\nI was crazy stuff man it's crazy stuff to do in a conflict I mean they knew this guy would get an appointment to go in to get his paper work done and they chopped them up in little pieces and\nYou know sold him to bits and the Turks say they're going to have the evidence of this and it's you know the person is not happy and so you know before you jump to conclusions like oh you know doesn't matter\nIt doesn't matter he's dead he's that it's not an it's not a ... he's not a journalist its debts that\nYou know this is that what to buy their arms it's got nothing to do with that there's there's they embarrass the president of the world stage they embarrass them\nAnd they further embarrass him by telling them that ridiculous story about he was in a fight and then right after that the Turks released video of somebody coming out this close so they ... like again because the president said\nWell this could be credible and then a day later that's proved to be false so they lied to the president and embarrassment publicly again and so what is the president what is Trump supposed to do now\nAbout can't do it and there's he's going to take action but this president or President Trump is going to send a message that\nYou know what a if you're going to have this level of disregard for our relationship or for the United states I don't take action it's simple doesn't mean we have to disrupt the relationship or not be an ally or\nCancel a hundred and fifty five hundred million dollar arm so don't you have to do that with the other things that we can do and the best thing to Saudi could do not because they can't get out of this thing\nIs to get rid of MPs I mean the father drink so much to just say you know this guy's not equipped right now to assume to throw at let's find somebody else let's get uncle Mohammad over there or\nMy nephew whatever let's find someone

forty and very sunny skies so great to have you with us one of the most interesting things here that is going on is this caravan which many of these migrants have\nCross Mexico I'm not sure\nI'm not sure really how steadfast the Mexican effort was in order to stop the caravan but we understand now there's a it's about five thousand people strong and many of them have gotten through the Mexican authorities they were stopped on a bridge they jumped in the river many of them now just getting through and the\nShort period of time on this caravan I'm just going to say the straight out when you have four or five thousand people storming your country and this is what this says they're storming the border\nTheir strength and numbers they're getting money along the way they're being encouraged as the president said we don't know who's part of their certainly CNN is going to play mama with babies that's all they're going to play they're not going to play the traffickers or anyone else that happens to be involved in it that might not be the type of\nPerson you want the United states are open to show the mouse with the babies but at the end of the day you have five thousand people crashing the border of the United states where I come from at sixty years old\nI think that's called an invasion I don't know what else do you call it a migrant right at what is it a like may we come in\nI mean we have laws in this country the president's going to have to act on this he has no choice and he's threatened to send the military there\nAh hopefully they'll turn back hopefully they'll turn it back and they have to turn back and fix their own countries everybody would love to come to the United states as an economic refugee\nWe'd fill the country up with five being people and it would collapse you simply cannot allow five thousand people but simply storm over you border and then be fed closed education and who's paying for it\nAnd the minute you do that the next ... that will be fifty thousand and then five hundred thousand and then what do you do then you have a country that's common that is absolutely coming and it's coming sooner\nThan you think it is because thousands of these um what what you want to call them migrants or a caravan ers resume their journey on Sunday despite a Mexican Government or just submit\nTo processing by the immigration authorities they simply ignored or just like though will ignore ours\nAnd the differences CNN will be there with cameras and God Forbid and all they're going to do is take pictures of moms with babies that's it they don't put all the miles of babies up at the front and take all the pictures\n\nAnd I don't know one or the CNN people in all the other liberals just take them into their home and go through just drive your car down there take five other men driving through the processing yourself spending money how's the feed them clothe him I don't know maybe you do that then it got to that they're not going to do it\n\nAnd all of the news that you're going to see is about how mean we are and not letting them it\n\nIt's incredible now this is going to turn into a major campaign issue and to be candid this is the worst possible scenario you're talking about an October surprise here it is\nYou're watching five thousand people trying to invade the United states from the southern border and there was no wall and President Trump got elected on this issue and now here comes a week before the election a week\n\nAnd a James said this is the timing of this terror of an interesting yes I think maybe it was put together\nBlow up in their faces backfire\nI mean average Americans look at this and they're like I don't think it's a good thing for tens of thousands of people just\nStormed the country I mean that's where the Taliban is your storming the country is is not like you're there's a group of people in an orderly fashion or they sneak through a rancher there's a handful here and a handful there\nI mean you get five thousand people that's a mob and then it's an invasion and what are we going to do there is no one is I mean what are you if you put the military and string them out at the border\nHow are we going to stop that you're not going to shoot them so her going to stop them then the confrontation goes on TV and the Democrats are screaming about how mean we are or Trump is it\nIt's a it's a powder keg it's a powder keg and you've got fourteen days away fourteen days but it's going to blow up because look if you listen to me right now\nI don't think you're excited about\nFive thousand people just storming into the United states and breaking all of our laws and suddenly their nose at everything and then say take care of me I mean you don't have a country if you allow this to happen\nAnd Trump said something to get the reading that I agree with him he said you don't like the Democrats here and you're basically saying an invitation because then I got a sister and I got to stop it and the invitation is come on it he said the next caravan will be fifty thousand and he's right\nBecause the Democrats are campaigning on what they're meant basically they don't want to stop them I don't care what they say when they come on my radio show about secure the border to obtain secure the border how ... how are we going to do that to him\nI asked him three times on

engaged in a deception that goes beyond the pale I mean they have a light at every turn the other line again\nAnd so this is an ally you can't you can't have this way and they're going to have to be accountable for it and the bigger problem here is\nCrown prince Mohammed bin Salman he is thirty three years old and everything this guy is touched us trying to collect right he's the one that got the Saudis involved in the Yemeni war that we should have no business being and that's number one\nHe's the one that did the uh whether all along with the gang of club of four did the blockade on guitar that blew up in his face that's been a disaster now this is a disaster\nAnd he's thirty three years old and the guy's a disaster\nAnd so this is who are big ally is there a it's got to be reevaluated um and the president or like you said he's going to do something doesn't doesn't mean everything has to be upset but he is going to do something as he should\nGo ahead one more question\nTrust

just is a serious issue\nAnd so do they will be a response Steve a mid new should the treasury secretary's already canceled his trip to uh to some Saudi economic summit\nSo there's going to be a response it's going to be a bipartisan response and we'll see what happens but like the president says let's wait till the facts urine let's not jump to conclusions and last week to the facts of rent pump pale went there we've got our own and tell people working on it\nUh but you simply can't have people going embassies and get their bodies chopped up okay it it it's\nIt defies international world order and without that then you go you go to some kind of a one world government you can't have it both ways right we don't want to be sovereign I'm there's got to there's got to be an order here and and\n... a crown prince Mohammed bin Salman authorized this in in in the face of\nThe relationship that the Trump Administration has built with the Saudis that is a really a slap in the face to the president like I don't really care or at the end of the day I got money buying arms and you're basically going to do a deal with whatever I Do\nAnd this president has gone with the Saudis on a lot of issues including the disastrous civil war in Yemen so it's got to be dealt with man it's got to be dealt with you you certainly can't say oh he's Muslim Brotherhood it doesn't matter you can't do

just like we did with a Joseph Stalin who murdered millions and millions of his own people zone officers all the polish officers that the mass murder and we decided to be an ally with them\nAnd the fight the second World War so look I get it and then again nobody is saying that we have to completely disassociate ourselves from the Saudis are cancelled the arms deal or a or upset or the balance of power in the middle Middle East\nBut it's Congress is saying or we're going to have to do something that's going to have to be severe or whether it be economic sanctions or whatever they decide to come up with but you simply cannot sweet just under the carpet because somebody says the guy was Muslim Brotherhood you can't do it\nNor will this president do it cause NBS embarrassed them MPs embarrassed to present his payback for all the grace that this president has given the Saudi regime and MPs his pay back\nIs to put this right in his face that was his payback you can't trust them simple as that\nAnd uh the easiest case is for the father king Solomon to simply say\nUh you know what we're gonna we're going to turn the thrown over to somebody else they got a lot of people in that Family Guy has proven to be a disaster so far that might be the answer we don't know the Trump Administration is considering classifying gender as determined by Gina cilia at birth\nPart of big government white effort to roll back recognition of transgender people under federal civil rights law\nThe New York times obtained a draft member of the department of health\nAnd Human Services that went to find sex as either male or female and on changeable the move would be the most significant of a series of maneuvers to exclude the estimated one point four million Americans who identify\nAs transgender from receiving civil rights protections under the Obama administration the recognition of gender identity\nBecame more fluid as you know so the Trump Administration are gradually doing away with transgender as a sex for purposes of gaining civil rights\nNow that has nothing to do with gay rights it has to do with\nI don't know I Am at you know pro gay rights and uh people want to be transgender I'm for whatever they want to be but I don't know that this is a tough one job perfect radio network we'll be right back they would\nAuditor pet bottle organize and train them to know what the ads for when they get to our border and\nMaybe a supply didn't look good food and water to help them get here and if so aren't those people also in violation of the United states all helping someone to interact country illegally and can't be prosecuted\n[noise] ah well let me get back to your question the answer to that is I really don't know so I'm going to be honest about that I don't know what the how the law applies to that\nUh if people are giving food and water to the caravan war there are\nOther sponsors supplying them with cash they need to feed themselves to go forward what how you would implicate them or how you would go to a foreign country to prosecute them I don't know that certainly if that money was coming from the United states or they're not only on the same way\nThat the organizers Robert is [noise] excuse me that a lot of churches and God Bless structures but a lot of churches are or are taken care of these people once they get in there making a good loser dollars off of uh doing that and I just wonder if the um [noise] a\nPro quo going on with him so um\nKept these people who do they're likely shit from the United states or maybe other foreign countries or be prosecuted for what you can give you a violate the United states all\nWell know number one or there's or even the president said at this rally they were getting money he didn't know what we're from but there there is no evidence is coming from the United states doesn't mean it's not okay so let me just stop there doesn't mean it's not but there is no direct evidence right now might come out this afternoon but right now\nUh there's no evidence linking to that the churches that make money off this the reason they make money is because they set up businesses\nIn order to take the refugees in seed them close them and then they charge the government and they make a very tidy profit of what they mean a lot of money I mean this is a migraine refugee illegal immigration thing\nThat people always find ways to make money off the government and so there's plenty of companies associated with plenty of church is making a lot of money off the government because they provide for the food the clothing housing in the education and they get more than they put out so it's becoming a very profitable business for people and these are short\nTerm I think it's right it's a very profitable business\nPeople more than you could say it's a it's organized crime\nAnd I think what you're going to take a very close to who is organizing these people who is finding these people and see if their parents to these organizations in the United states didn't profit off of them ... once they get here no good\nFor the eagles coming means no means\nMaking ... Glen you make you make a very good are you making very good argument for that I mean they should get looked into now if it's being funded by drug runners and sex traffickers and other uh bad people that are having better themselves in a caravan and if their funding it then there was a lot that we can do about that\nAnd there's a lot of people are\nInferred that that's where they're getting the money in order to make the trip to the United states is by bad actors or they\nHave access to resources that have a better themselves in the Caribbean whether it be sex traffickers drug traffickers meals if you'd call them uh you know there's been rumors that there is a a that there's other people from parts of the country and this caravan\nThe way that I look at it doesn't really matter who's there good bad or not it's an invasion if you enter the United states and if you let the stand\nIf you let the stand if you'll let them come in 'em and the political pressure become such that they get in or the majority of them again in five seven thousand to get in and you you know apprehend five hundred of them\nThe next terror van is not going to be seven thousand glad that's got to be Seventy thousand and the one effort that's going to be seven hundred thousand and then they're simply going to crash the United states and you can't do anything about it so they're gonna have to stop this and if you remember ah\nThe zero tolerance policy which was the antithesis of catch and release was put in place by the Trump Administration and Jeff Sessions in order to act\nAs a deterrent and for a short period of time it did until they have to go back to catch and release because they separated the kids from the parents and we got the CNN kids in cages headline and it all blew up and it was a PR disaster and that was the end of it\nAnd so you know there's not we have to figure this out and some kind of immigration reform and the whole the Congress is it going to do crap when you got seven thousand people ready to crash the poor they they're going to have to figure it out ... Glenn but we'll have to see how that goes right\nA meantime the\nUh the caravan is becoming an election issue the Democrats like it's going to help them they really do they think that\nThe fact that these people are coming and there's miles with babies and it goes back to the kids in cages and don't you have a hard and Trump's meaning that all the Trump supporters of me that they don't want help the kids were debate the moms with the babies\nAre they think it's going to help them I think this is a disaster if you're the Democrat\nStates they are losing votes because people look at this and they said the same thing I Do this is an invasion into our country that we're powerless to stop powerless powerless because of the media and because of what happened with zero tolerance\nAnd so I don't think the president is kidding what he says he will put the military there but you're gonna have to have a wall and then they're all gonna be camped out right at the border and they're going to need food water and they're they're not going away they have to go back\nThey have to turn back it's gonna be a very it's we we don't know how this is going to turn out but right now for the Denver crabs right now at the snapshot in time\nThis is a political catastrophe for them two weeks before the election\nNow what they're hoping it turns into is more kids in cages propaganda so then they can blame Trump the administration and Republicans on having the heart and separating kids from ... that's what they're hoping it turns out too\nBut if it doesn't if it's just a humanitarian catastrophe on the border\nAnd people see pictures of ten thousand migrants tried to invade their country the Republicans got hold the house because no one in their right mind can think that that is a good idea other than\nThe most left wing partisan that believe that every one that comes over is a potential democratic vote that's it and that does not represent the majority of people in America\nSo the president regardless of the political ramifications President Trump ran out of this issue this was his signature issue it's coming for wishing there is no wall\nAnd he is going to have to take a stand and stop these people from coming in but they have to do it in a way that is a with in our value system if that makes sense\nJimmy Williamsburg says this could be a powder keg if they get to the border before the election imagine troop stopping this that's what the Democrats are hoping I mean that's why they were behind this at the beginning to figure okay if we can get this and it's a PR catastrophe\nOr with a military with bayonets and miles with babies I then uh it's it'll be great for the Democrats New York times poll CNN LA Times will be a beside themselves will sleep\nSo you're right this is a powder keg uh Jennifer in Norfolk says the gets back into the transgender issue\nHas really complicated things with for the majority a man just won the women's you see a cycling championship identifies as a woman\nAnd won't suppress is just tossed around and they compete says a woman with a male body\nIt should be identified as what science themes them at birth it should be listed as a male or female on their birth certificates\nI just don't have a lot of passion for the ... I'm Sorry I don't I'm pro gay rights or you want to identify as a woman and when it's likely contest or I guess eventually women that are real women are going to get mad over and filed a suit or something but I just I'm passionate about this I\nMean if somebody wants to identify as a transgender and marry another do whatever they want I just don't care I mean that's how they're made it and that's what they want to do and\nI have no interest in it and I'm In favor of people identifying themselves or however they want to identify themselves has no bearing on me and I'm you know it is what it is and I know a lot I have a lot of transgender friends and they're", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Laura Ingraham Show", "city": "Portsmouth", "day": "22"}
