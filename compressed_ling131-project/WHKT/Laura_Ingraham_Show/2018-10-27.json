issues have taken back seat on Coburn campaign now\nI mean it's all personal it's taking Halloween pictures from my Facebook now she's doubled down you know now it's not big but it's you know that they're trying to portray me as crazy based on I guess Halloween costumes and you know me John I have a good time so\nIf they it's just it's amazing that last week she pretty much apologizes for marginalizing veterans says she's going to stick to issues then she puts out a commercial or calling me an extremist and trying to make fabricated things up again this is what the left does their own hands it's desperate ploy by desperate candidates and that's why common sense is back\nThat's why conservatism is packed and that's why I'm going to win the theft\nComics that the back of your commander of commonsense Dennis ... without running for Congress fifth district Virginia let's get through the caravan I'm the president with my later today saying it's going to deploy a\nThousand troops he's got to do a series of executive orders that would stop the Taliban from coming into the United states the problem is as soon as they step foot and say the word asylum\nWe can't do anything or laws in the loop\nHoles in them Denver are written in such a way that all they have to do was get a toe in get their hand grabbed and say asylum and that we can't do anything they cannot go back what you've seen the president's proposed action here if you were in\nCongress now what what gender riggleman the proposing on the terror of it\nYou know where a rule of law and ah we're we're we're a nation of laws and we believe in the rule of law and the way the laws were written right now you're exactly right John I don't know you know how we we don't honor\nThat based on what we believe us conservatives in rural and and people who follow the rule of law however I think Congress needs to start fixing these immigration laws as soon as possible and I also believe once that happens are vetting process\nFor any of these people that are coming through has to be extreme vetting uh we do have some of the technology in place now but we don't put time limits on this if there's that many people are that are headed\nTowards the border or we don't know which invented in those in John my biggest fear um it's easy you know it's like a Trojan Horse right listen Ninety five percent Ninety nine percent of those\nPeople could actually be seeking asylum um those that you know our hearts sort of go out to and with compassion however\nIf you have people inside there that are bad actors and they're able to hide you know within this caravan we have to ferret them out and my guess is this going to be sending some pretty healthy intelligence assets down range I think we're going to be monitoring and my guess is I can only speak\nSeeing any type of missions that are coming out of there talking about radio emissions or any kind of been told that we can glean this is not a good situation and this is not good and at some point I think we have to fix or immigration laws in a way that again are\nAre much more common sense then the sort of sort of ridiculous since we have now are going on on the border\nUm uh the\nI think the concern that everyone has Denver is that\nOkay there's twelve or Thirteen or fourteen thousand people we have to deal with it and uh\nEverybody wants to be concerned everybody's concerned about\nThe humanitarian aspect but a lot of my color here's what they're concerned with okay if they get in\nIf it's Fifteen thousand to get then the next one is going to be a hundred and fifty thousand and you're not gonna be able to stop that either because we'll never get a wall up at the time and even if you have a wall you got a hundred and fifty thousand people that it's just a lot of people so um are you in favor of the president\nTaking action now to stop these uh this a mob caravan from bomb rushing the border and coming in are you in favor of stopping them from coming in now\nYes yes I mean it's it's I mean this is a matter of national security or it is a matter of precedent um and again this comes back to normal American will say hey you know we understand people want to come to the United states but there is a legal process [noise]\nUm and we're going to have to we're going to have to follow that legal process you know we we think that legal process needs to be applied all immigrants and you and you're exactly right John this would set a precedent that\nCould really be damaging to the United states' security to our policies and to our rule of law or you're right if the if we just allow everybody in we're actually sort of acknowledging that open borders is what we want if we don't follow the rule of law and we don't stop these these migrants sadly we we have to stop him now from coming in and set a precedent Denver\nUh but uh in about five or ten minutes the U.S government is going to release the new economic numbers or GDP expected to grow again this quarter at so over four percent that could be four point one four points to four point three Obama's\nTime he was struggling along in about a half percent growth I mean\nThis growth unprecedented where do you look for in that report and ... what's your clothes and you think you might throw out\nIt on the economy gender regardless\nWell the thing up first I'm going to look for [laughter] it's just because I'm a geek out on the stuff is I'm going to look at the specific whatever report that I have I'm going to look at the number of jobs are based on that are\nOpen right now and I look at Virginia but I also see what we're going as far as unemployment but GDP Growth I'm going to look at manufacturing\nI'm look at agriculture I Love looking into the numbers and see where that growth is and if we're continuing on the line John if\nWe're continuing with the lowest unemployment claims and forty nine years of her continuing with Los minority unemployment if we're continuing which he did he grow four percent of every quarter which you know is amazing a it's a new normal was too I mean this is ...\nThat's where the jobs report Mak works opportunities zones can be leverage here in the in the commonwealth a ... and opportunities\nOn investment all the things that we look at to encourage opt entrepreneurship to encourage people keeping their own money is working and that's what I'm gonna look at it this report\nIs is this just a continuation of this amazing just amazing surge or are we seeing and even more positive future for the people in the fifth district but also in the United states and then the commonwealth of Virginia I think we are I think we're just seeing the beginning of this economic boom and um\nI I'm really just really excited to see what those numbers say based on where job growth on my sectors are growing right now\nWhat kind of interesting to see these are coming out momentarily we expect that\nThat we're going to get over four percent growth and it's really really tough for a Democrat right now to talk about economics the economy or any of the issues that pertain to jobs and prosperity in America so they'd rather talk about something else that's why your opponent Leslie Coburn is talking about\nYour Halloween costume 'cause he doesn't want to talk about the economy she doesn't want to talk about jobs she doesn't want to talk about growth should want to talk about kids moving on to the basement she doesn't want to talk about the boom and small businesses she doesn't want to talk about the deregulation she doesn't want to talk about the number of investments that are going on because of the tax\nCut especially as it relates to one hundred percent deduction of capital investments Rob doesn't even understand it and so she doesn't want to do with any any of that she'd rather talk about your Halloween costume\nAnd two thousand five\nYeah and I mean which I Will not take down off the net by the way so here's what she would rather talk about she'd rather talk about forty million dollars in spending not only for Medicare for all but also for forgetting student debt right which is one point for a trillion dollars right now free community college for all are free college for all everything she said and even a debate she was like I Want to give away this\nShe doesn't understand the taxpayer money is what you're using I get so limited\nBased on what I fought for you know in government overreach she says she loves government I feared government I think government should be limited I think government should be efficient she's also said that taxpayer money for the middle class\nIs nothing more than confetti she's compared\nEyes to the Nazis I mean I I find that to studying John ... anybody would vote for Leslie her views are great for San Francisco and maybe a three square mile area there or somewhere up in Georgetown right in DC\nBut for the fifth district it's absolutely appalling that she thinks these values are actually a political ball to the people the fed is not every day and work for a living and don't give a rat's\nWith the chattering class as saying on CNN or MSNBC or any of these other far left and they are now they're just they're just propaganda machines\nAnd I think at some point ah that's going to break through that you have comments you have this coalition of common sense against progress of candor is over and I think that's what's happening in the fifth district and we're going to win this job because I represent American values I represent conservative values but I represent what the fifth wants to do right now and that's why we're going to win this\nDenver Riggleman I Want to thank you for being with us what's your

to go down that road\nCan be committed to an institution crazy or just that they've got a screw loose you don't do that kind of normal people well adjusted people don't do that okay by definition\nCopy counting how the column out today very makes the point that when John Kennedy was assassinated Lee Harvey Oswald who defected to the Soviet Union was pro Cuba\nOr he was found to be the shooter a yet who got blamed for the John birth society and all the conservatives so\nThis is not the first time that the guilt by association or let's let's let's slammed the conservative let's blame everything on conservatives not the first time it's been done before we even know who actually sent these packages so\nIt's a everybody's got to calm down take a breath and uh I think Sarah Sanders had it right we should be coming together the president is calling for unity dialing down the rhetoric\nA and the Democrats are going in the opposite direction they're they're they're blaming the president unequivocally no question about it take you know responsibility whatsoever\nFor calling the guy look at the sky Brennan said the president's guilty of trees or what's the what's the penalty for treason staff he's basically a former\nHead of the CIA had been out they're calling for the president to be harmed by the neck until dead and this is not considered inflammatory rhetoric I it's it it's disgusting the whole thing and it's just just hypocritical these people will go down as\nThe all time greatest hypocrites\nAfter something I'm sure it is I I think you make a great analogy the depression and that's of the Democrats who cried and screens and whine about\nCabin on getting the FBI not investigating everything I mean why don't we just wait you're I mean the FBI seems to be home again and southern part of the guy to come up with a report pretty so we're we're we're going to find\nOut the answer why not just white\nRight exactly how 'bout everybody say calm down let's we got we we have the FBI on the case unless this guy was a or gal or or or bought or whatever [laughter] ever enter the it was they created these packages\nAnd less that energy was a very very very sophisticated person\nOr a boat and by it and if they were very sophisticated they were able to cover their tracks but considering the number of packages delivered to these various places coming out of one place\nThere are a lot of clues there and I'm confident that the FBI will be able to figure something out here and find out who did it or narrow it down and the fact that they use Debbie Wasserman Schultz as a return address that's kind of interesting in itself Debbie Wasserman Schultz was the one who was forced to step down\nIs she had been reading the system for Hillary against Bernie I don't know what that means but it's sort of an interesting clue you know maybe somebody thought that was funny to use her name out all these bombs [noise] I don't know uh but my point is this\nUnless this was a very sophisticated operations that they knew a how to cover their tracks at every step of the way you've got twelve packages now that the FBI is investigating it let's wait for the FBI to figure this out to come up with something yeah why not wait before you start\nA ... and why not why are they not waiting because they want to politicize it the the Democrats are missing no opportunity to score political points on this\nWell it's uh it it seems it just seems odd to me that that all this is happening but last week I mean that's where everybody's saying let's wait meantime let's get to the economy will get to the Taliban invasion after the bottom of the hour a\nBut let's get to the new economic numbers that just came out the gross domestic product GDP growing another three and a half percent now let me just say what this means right this is the first time that we have had\nBack to back quarters or in a very long time of of of over three and a half percent growth back to back and consumer confidence uh up at an all time high consumer spending was four percent another great a\nQuarter of economic growth this is more bad news for the damn thing I Want to talk about this and they don't want to talk about the economy or jobs or the growth so what did they talk about\nAh they talk about all they talk about they've got this wonderful thing to talk about this horrible thing to talk about here with the with the bombs and they talk about the president again they're falling in they don't realize they're falling into a trap and and it's their own traffic crop of their own making\nPeople don't want to hear for Democrats talk about\nThe president they want to hear Democrats Republicans the politicians in Washington talk about what they're what the politicians are going to do for them to make their life better write what I I I go to work every day\nI got a family to support I got a job up I'd like to get a raise what are you going to do to make that happen how are we going to make my life better easier make me rich uh make make make my kids you know healthier talking about President Trump talking about you're\nA Native American DNA doesn't do that [laughter]\nThey do that talking about President Trump are causing the bomb scare doesn't do that so and they're going back to the for the last two years all they've been talking about as President Trump is a Russian agent and now they're President Trump as a Russian agent who Craig creates bomb scares I mean\nThey're they're they're not doing themselves any favors\nVery clear jobs mobs President Trump and the Trump Administration\nHas created the best economic conditions in this country in a generation the best we've seen in ten Twenty years [noise]\nAnd that goes along the way that\nAnswers peoples' questions what have you done for me lately you've got a job you've gotten your race you've gotten my kids are food stamp kicked out of the basement there on their own now great thank you very much\nA question and answer\nBack so stay with us now there's a word Trump Tower for the last thing like deja vu all over again I mean [laughter] I mean\nI could go back and it's the same thing everybody tell us when it was all was all whatever was going through at the time with the Access Hollywood stay with us that we're\n\nComing out of the towns coming out other farmers\nComing to vote for Trump never voted before and uh so yeah it is there is a feeling if things are here all of these national generic ballot polls are meaningless was on a national election\nOther they're all like I mean this whole thing falls are talking all day about the Washington Post poll that came out\nYesterday that shows Jennifer ... Santa Barbara Comstock is tense district like searching and look like semi when she should she's the favorite no doubt that's a very tough districts out for the Republicans to win barbers but every internal poll that the Republicans have from the White House to\nThe at our ceasing to Barbara down shows the race ... ... that's not happening Thirteen plainly but this is what the Washington Post jobs they get a uh\nThey get a ridiculous methodology to get a big hole you get a fake analysis of it to do fake news to get a fake inclusion drawn so they can continue on with their fake narrative and like we've already been down this path so now I'm going to start calling them on how ridiculous that isn't they're doubling down saying\nThat's why the way you're on the John triggers radio network I your your Godzilla of the truth in America were eleven things out to the biggest ... election ever Curtis Ellis is with us She's a senior policy adviser for\nAmerica First policies this segment you buy the job creators network you know folks I've been saying this is about turnout Curtis just said the same thing the upcoming election\nYour tax cuts are on the ballot the American economy grew in another three and a half percent on the ballot are great comeback\nOr renaissance that's on the ballot too so Wallace on about your jobs are on the ballot your energy jobs that they just kind of moved down to the basement that's on the ballot your race your wages you're for what changed that small business owners like me tax\nCuts uh yeah that's about two and here's the biggest issue on the ballot eleven days who's in charge of America's future politicians and corrupted crafts\nAnd the deep state of Washington DC or you know if you want to preserve the victories of the past two years I'm urging you've got to get involved this November\nYeah I Know you've got to vote yes I Know you've got to do early voting I Know that I can count on you for that but you got to do more choice election dot com stinky choice the elections out Tom they'll make it easier for you to get involved you can make calls you can send emails you can send text you can knock on doors\nYou're too shy to do that okay you can take a neighbor to the polls I don't have a car trouble you're going to make the coffee there's all kinds of things that you can do what you got to get involved big choice election dot com because the only way you lose the two thousand Eighteen is if you don't show up and you don't work\nIf you turn out and volunteer you're going\nTo win a big choice you let what elections out every vote matters big choice election dot com junior part don't get out work by the other guys and I don't ever sex scored a big choice elections come this message paid for an authorized by the job creators network we want to welcome\nAll of our new listeners on the brand new talk station in West Rick Richmond and groups and the county W.

election before you just said it's about turnout and that's what this is all about you got the polls you've got all this nonsense polls that got this that it's about identifying voters [noise] sometimes pockets of twenty five voters here fifty voters they're\nSeventy five voters they're a hundred there distinct pockets of voters that are on our side in identifying them and getting them out to the polls that's what this was going to come down to that's what it's coming down to\nThe Republican National committee and others are doing a great job of that and uh that's what's going to determine this as much as all that it's probably more than older [noise]\nAnd bring your friends and if they're going to vote for the other side don't bring them okay hope for letting the air out of their tires\nI don't know you cannot don't do that we don't you know we don't do\nWe encourage your look if you're if you have a democratic neighbor and the good of all the all the way down and they can't get in the polls you don't have a ride to the polls do the right thing\nAll your ... nice to get ... you know what we want every Celtic knot everybody that as an opportunity to go\nGet them out

to game the system\nOnce I set foot on American soil they claim asylum there they've all been taught to say the words credible fear they have credible fear credible fear what credible if you're not getting a job credible fear of having to live off mangoes and bananas\nA rather than a food stamps and welfare\nA so once they get to the United states is set foot on American soil and say the words credible fear they qualified for that triggers the whole asylum seeking procedure and once they're enmeshed in the silent seeking procedure\nAll of the interlocking court cases and rulings and judges

going to do everybody a great big favor\nAnd it just becomes a big mess so the way to stop them to not let them into the United states in the first place to stop them at the border build the wall\nTo wall literally and figuratively President Trump is sending up to a thousand troops deploying the military on the border uh that's what the military is supposed to do defend our country and if we're going to defend the country in Afghanistan\nAnd defend the country in Iraq and defend the country in Djibouti where we have troops\nHow about we defend the country in Tijuana in Mexico the Mexican border and in Texas\nThat's right in San Diego and everything else we need to build his wall and the president to Germany says I'm going to stop this because I think the president Curtis understands I'm almost out of time here but I think you have to understand that it's Fifteen thousand today if they get in tomorrow it's going to be a hundred\nAnd fifty thousand and then one twenty five million because it's just\nIt was riveting and then I got to take off you said that you said there are four billion people in the world that on a trip to the United states so you must let the oil and and then

joke it is it is just a a bumbling it's bumbling and here's the deal I said this on\nAlgeria yesterday I don't know what the president's going to do about this was going to do something that's number one number two whatever you guys you got to consult the secretary of state Mike Pompeo he's going to just fill Gina Haspel but they're going to do something they have to do something you have to react to this now I\nDon't think he's going to cancel the arms deal because he said look I got to deal with that it's economically benefiting the country and if I can see what they're simply going to buy the weapons from China or Russia so why would I Do that here's the other people said oh the president's position has ... has keeps changing no the president hasn't had\nA position [noise] other than you discourage the idea of scrapping the arms deal everything\nElse was on the table including withdrawing or support from the Saudi average coalition and again we have a war so everything else was on the table so to say that well his position keeps changing he hasn't had a position he started commentary\nWhat'd you serve all based on new facts come out and the Saudis have changed their story temp jobs did they change again yesterday and they'll change it again tomorrow\nAs more facts to come out so I don't\nUnderstand what they're saying the president has changes his\nPosition he's waiting for the facts you commit perjury Trump is not a politician he's a businessman here's our businessmen make decisions facts numbers spreadsheets and math so as the facts come in and the mathematical\nEquation that gets put together his commentary evolved as information changes that's what he's supposed to do the end of the day I don't know what the final outcome\nOf the U.S reaction is going to be but I've been saying this all week in the middle middle Middle East on TV this president does it take well to being lied to and I don't think there's any doubt\nCrown prince Mohammed bin Solomon lights all I don't think that goes over well with President Trump\nHe doesn't like being lied to here's the other thing doesn't like dealing with it competent people he doesn't have a lot of patients I'm telling you\nEverything the guy at thirty three years old has gotten involved in has been a complete undone mitigated disaster for the Saudi kingdom so eventually the father just have to say you know what my son has been a top rated bumbling fools and I got to put somebody else in\nThe country to Killeen because it's capable of being stupid stuff including this assassination allegedly\n\nThe or Saudis have now said that'll by just not a final story they're saying but that's going\nTo change again so who knows what\nThe ah to showcase has here's what it's tough it is really brought renewed focus to the Saudi Emirates tactics and they support\nThat we're giving them and getting involved in the Yemen's civil war which is causing a\nHorrific very disturbing very growing humanitarian\nCrisis where I just got to tell you there's a um on algebra zero every day I see the pictures you do see because ah the fake news networks today they don't want to show your real news they want to talk about\nYou know President Trump Stormy Daniels or whatever they do\nBut I\nI see the pictures on TV and I mean it'll really tear out your stomach you've got children just starving I mean they can't they they got mother's stripping park from trees bark and boiling it just matching it up so there's\nSomething in there and that's in the stomach green grass\nI mean there's no food\nI mean just think about having a child you're sitting there and they started that they think about how that feels that make this thing is is a horror show it is worse than the area it's worse than anything I've seen\nAnd our involvement in it is\nShameful and it's absolutely shameful and if there's anything that's going to come out of the show is there a\nWe're going to get the hell out of there as we should\nJust horrific that the United states is involved in something of this nature all because you know we've got the Iranian bogeyman with their Nineteen speed boats or whatever they have I looked at that point like Mike in Oakland you're you're on the air Mike\nMark John yep\nI agree with you on the up and say I don't think that you're exactly right about that so I'm I Do know that comes out this for anything that could come out of this thing I Would be good but\nI have to point out though the irony or something you said just a few minutes ago I'm sure you didn't pick up on it because you don't agree but um you know you said the president or the the two things he doesn't like he doesn't like to be lied to and he doesn't like incompetent and I I Can't help but think he must be\nAnd I feel incompetent for the jobs just doesn't want to share those two others [noise]\nWell I guess uh I guess you think this tremendous economic renaissance on this phone make tremendous economy and we have an all the jobs I\nGuess you think that you worked on the top and it's I guess you think the fact that we haven't heard from ISIS in that they've been kicked kicked out of the majority of their caliphate than they they not only can troll a tiny part of terror story yet when he took over it was a massive I get your your thing that's on top of this I guess you'd think that the fact that\nThe wacko and North Korea has not done a nuclear test and threaten them I think that's the top of that I guess you think all these new jobs we have the fact that\nWe just keep going up and the confidence and there is a tax cut and you've figured that's an confident so I guess your nights definition of incompetence Mike or\nThey'll just a little bit different\nI guess [noise] uh some of those things that are not\nSure it's not me I Want\nSomeone who is competent than that and what kind of progress should we live in right now you are right now that\nThank you for straightening yeah its\nEconomy Obama leaves office\nSupplies wages savings ends up jobs there are people are\nOut of the things that kids have jobs everything is that what it's all because I bought on your site for

of course since the war there in the San Diego area you know I I talk to our control agents tell me they said yes the wall ... job\nEasier but another thing that has to go along with the law says you

country nobody was comfortable with it I think it's really hurting the Democrats but there's a lot of people saying that who is funding this like who organized this I mean these people have to be fed obviously they have to\nHave supplies water like who is funding this whole thing there's trucks carrying that we see it on TV somebody's got to be funding this you have any idea\nI you know there's

it's now clear this was a premeditated murder this guy got chopped up in a\nBasically got out of there and some kind of a doggy bags and they buried him in the garden or something the whole thing is just a horrible situation but look a\nCrowd ... the administration has been a lot of things in the sky that Jared Kushner has\nAnd a lot of people are saying you know maybe this guy's just incompetent\nAnd capable of running the country everything he touches turns to craft whether it's the Japanese civil war that's a disaster the gang of four embargo against the state of Qatar that ... to blow up in their face guitars better off today than they were\nNow he's got this thing where they changed their story die times where do we do hear\nJohn as you point out it's clear that show was brutally murdered it's clear that it was premeditated it's clear that uh that I think the crown\nPrince knew about that a MPs Mohammed bin Salman\nBay I think have a lot to answer for and I think they have to be held accountable though I Do think that there has to be significant penalties that they suffer I Do think to the question has to be asking like does the United\nStates believe that it can carry on and continue relationship with Saudi Arabia which I Do think we need to but can't that with the crown prince I think that's a pretty compelling question I think I'm going to straighten that's going to have to ask that I think Congress will eventually\nAh to Saudi Arabia I listen I understand the impact of those of those contracts for what we're doing to supply a military uh equipment to Saudi Arabia\nI think Saudi Arabia I can be a like a a force on that\nIs is a is a is an ally Josh ends up in the middle east but I don't think that it can it can be that type of ally that we wanted that we need to you if this is how they're going to operate I mean we have you know we have principles in the United states that we that we stand by and our\nAllies have to have to abide by those and I just don't see Saudi Arabia doing that\nYou know you you point out the issue with Yemen chewing you and I have talked about that before I those are all questions I think that come up and how we see Saudi Arabia operating in the region have policies being played out\nAnd these are are they are they doing the same necessary in that region\nThat create stability and that and that\nAre working in the in the best interest of all involved not just Saudi Arabia but uh other allies in the middle east and listen I I I understand what they're doing that some pushback against the Iranians\nBut are are they doing things had in the long term moving in the middle east in the right direction I think those are questions that we have to ask or foreign policy standpoint and I think that U.S policy toward Saudi Arabia you know needs to needs to be directed by those I think very a very sobering issues\nThat we had before us\nSo it seems like congressman Whitman a were drawn agreements and it seems like what you're saying is the best way to solve this is a four crown prince MPs will hammered the dominant to maybe a step aside for someone else had his father for somebody else in their final question I\nOnly have half a minute and I got to get your will not let out so very quickly um is there going to be a vote in Congress on our involvement in the Yemeni civil war and backing the Saudi Emirates coalition yes or no\nI'm John I I I I Can't can't predict that because I don't know where the discussion is going to go over all with Saudi Arabia but I Would say that he wants it will be hard to debate in Congress about what our policy is I Wish I out of your abs and accomplish their cameras\nAre they going to go more information Rob Wittman dot com Rob Portman John John early voting has started in Virginia get out and get involved go to Robert The dotcom congressman thanks for being with us I got to go\n\nThe everyday got um people like a host\nThe poll yesterday from the Washington Post is unbelievable I mean the Washington Post like what are they going to learn like they don't want to learn people say well what are they going to change the pony methodology to get it right never because they don't want to get it right because it's not about\nIt accurate poll it's about big polish driving fake news to get a fake narrative to draw conclusions that's all it is it's all wise the Washington Post actually putting out a poll yesterday actually putting out a poll showing Barbara\nComstock trailing Jennifer Wexton in the ... district by Thirteen points now there is no way that western\nHas a third two point lead over barber contact every journal poll that I have seen in our top stock every internal poll that his pay four and a lot of\nMoney shows this race a dead heat or Comstock slightly head and the Washington Post has got Comstock down by Thirteen this is a complete and utter why it has to be on fake news it is and it's beyond the onion it's beyond the national\nEnquirer what they tried to do they have cops not so much they want that seem so bad\nThey want the liberal do nothing Jennifer West and then they're so bad they can taste it they want their\nLeftist in that seat so much that they will actually conducted poll make things up doing in such a way to get results that they want so they could put\nIt out there and say the races over don't give Tom start getting the money and don't work for her it's a lost cause so they do a fake poll\nIn order to do think it's unbelievable nobody in that\nDistrict is gonna look you in the eye and say that they think Jennifer Washington as a certain gene point lead this racist tied and I think cops are just going to win for the Washington Post doesn't care do not own up to any of this either one of the New York times or\nABC News or read the senior MSNBC\nOr any of the polling companies that right girl who was the fake news and that's what they are it's not it's it's ... it's the fake news networks and it's designed to drive into the coalition to make you not\nWant to do anything to help her\nIf you're in the tent district go volunteer because like she is going to win this race if you get out and help her but they already\nOn a daily basis and that's why the president says it's fake news and he says it's an enemy of the people when you lie to the people and masquerading as a legitimate news network with a legitimate poll is that not\nAn enemy how would you define that this poll for the post the\nAstronaut that even in the west in most staunchest supporters think it's a joke because they know it's not true so let me just let me just ask your question\nDriving it so that is to make is that not an enemy of the people it's certainly an hey it's an enemy the truce maybe the president needs to change one word it's an enemy of the truth it's certainly an enemy of fact\nIt is unbelievable they're doing it again\nThey didn't do as a sixteen and they're doing it again things were\nNot think gee nobody in Germany the Democrats\nHave learn nothing from two thousand sixteen the legacy media hasn't learn nothing in fact what they're doing now is they can't believe they were wrong and so they're doubling down and here's the thing if the Republicans don't\nRelinquish the house bill legacy media after two elections in a row going all and for the Democrats and losing them both on a federal level will become irrelevant this one of the section of them are so high don't become a relative\n\nI Am more relevant that they are\nBecause I tell you the truth but better ugly\nThere'll be relevant say are doubling and tripling down a moral odds\nOn more fake polls and more fake news again\nJudge drive to result they want on election day again and it's kind of backfired on them I get\n\nI mean they actually think that somebody sending pipe opposite don't go off it's like a change that your trajectory the election\nIn general like we're going to get an economic report coming\nForty five minutes that it's going to show another over four percent GDP Growth\n\nAnd their banking on hatred of the Trump and somebody sending pipe bombs that joke go wash targeted at Democrats had already been influencing anything right now it's very bizarre it's very the whole thing is very suspicious and it's very bizarre\n\nRight now if you're a national Democrat here's what you have to deal with mobs and caravans and you're running against Republicans who are for jobs and country Bob versus jobs ... versus ...\n\nAnd if they really think that caravans crossing of the United states and bump rushing to the border on the carpet Fifteen thousand just coming in and getting food clothing shelter education hospital care and well let's just open up our our if they don't really think that\nHaving tens of thousands\nOf illegal storming the country is going to help them get elected you know see what they were hoping for is a couple of thousand with kids and babies and they'd be separated and it would be chaos and Trump would\nBe a meaning and he put troops there in a band hats and everybody will be outrage and he's got to go\nStandard has backfired they can't control it a thousand people they could troll Thirteen fourteen Fifteen thousand that's uh\nQuestion I just have to drop what will start asking everybody who's funding this what is just coming off the trees are just falling ducks or you know Apple's and coke and ducks are falling off the trees all along that route so pointing is putting up a lot of money to fund this I\nWant to know who don't you find that interesting I Want to know a lot of things I Want to do a lot of Republicans\nAre gaining the Democrats right now or in a dead panic\n\nThree weeks ago it was a done deal they were going to get power they were going to do investigations that we're going to do that all of a sudden start slipping away they have a cabinet to walk all\nThey have the Taliban debacle\nAnd Republicans get energized start showing up at all of a sudden you got early voting is democratic precincts Adam level never been seen the history of measuring the stuff\n\nThat's what's going on here this is why I'm telling you I don't know if the Republicans are going to hold the house was going to be darn close there's no like Seventy six fifty blow out here we're going to be up 'til three AM\nAnd she'll be very close to that I think the Republicans are going to hold out and they're going to pick a boat load the seats up in the Senate are predicting five every one of these red state Democrats are going down in flames McCaskill dead duck Heidi Heitkamp gone Jon Tester see you later\nAlligator God to name if you Joe Donnelly out\nBill Nelson of Florida have a nice day they're all going down and the Republicans are going to hold serve in Arizona which is gonna win handler that's not going to be close they are going to pull out and about a black person pulled way ahead of hapless Phil Bredesen that's done\n\nYou're going to get in fights thinks you're going to get an economic report that jumps out this in the in Fifteen minutes with another four point two three four five six percent gross I drew a bomb and you were getting a half a percent now you've got to tell me just to be a bomb icon I mean that's like a thing that's like in sync talk\nGive me a break\nAs you
