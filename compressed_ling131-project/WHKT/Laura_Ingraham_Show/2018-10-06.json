Scott from now till the end of the time but there's gonna be a conservative there's going to be a conservative vote that's going to come out\nAnd whether uh uh Maria I don't know how to pronounce it ... whether or not she can get people out based on her name as opposed to you know Tim Kaine is not as big a magnet there as he is enrichment um so I I still think it's a pill for the Democrats even though I agree that looks like Scott's kind of watch this one issue\nNinety six and tell me this one member this well I'm ... we had a we had a scandal um statewide where John Warner put a television ad up against Mark Warner who was John Warner was far ahead and um he photo shop Mark Warner and do a picture\nI remember who's in the ... I Can't remember who he ... he thought it was up at Clinton I think ... with Clinton was while her was when I was glad there was a racial aspect to it too I Can't remember what they did but they do to shop Mark Warner into a picture he wasn't in and um ended a television ad\nAnd it was a huge went national scandal for John Boehner who had a moderate brand and was a guy that you know everyone looked she likes you know what you're trying to states got Taylor is\nThere like had a friend okay and and and that people you know like respected John Warner much higher than Scott Taylor them and and his numbers\nAnd he said on the needy person and and the captain of my ship and I'm responsible for what happened and I apologize and it's got Taylor had done that he would run around\nSo I just I was worse campaign chairman that year and it was a it was a close race much worse than fourteen million dollars to his own money that year that made this really much closer race than it might have been other was concerned when it was used on ... and it was on the map you can earn it after running a close race there but I remember at the fired\nThe people that were involved in the ad and everything else and you broke it in it it was an issue for a week or two and then jumped accountability and he took accountability [noise] said or has mishandled this thing I think it's just kind of destruction and tapping his people take the Fifth Amendment doesn't help it just keeps it in the news\nIs that enough to bring down somebody with a good reputation it's done a good job in their first term or not\nUm and also I think the the ... turnout are they talking about a new wave I think you're really talking about ...

believe are 'cause every everyone believes it and then once Pittsburgh got the last year everything changed\nYou could feel the change their um Tom in the season ticket holder promising to take it out or we said a poor sections away from each other sometimes to each other and not the Dunkin' Donuts line in between factions [noise]\nUm but um [noise] this is going to be a great Arabs or the caps now I don't think this was a one year thing I think that you look at who's that's often is young I'm only in in his you know not in the mid mid thirties I think when you're thirty three thirty two\nUm [noise] he's gonna make a run a Gretzky for the most goals scored of all time the regular season is over six hundred grand is eight Ninety four\nHe's going to make a serious run it being the number one goal for an inch on history and the caps have an incredibly bright future um\nAnd I just and re saying this my dilemma right now I put a thousand dollars in the capital last year when the Stanley Cup in Las Vegas Fifteen the one\nWe want to in Vegas got the cash for tickets Fifteen thousand dollars when I catch the ticket the person at the counter told me the biggest payout she's ever paid at the sports book\nOr when people will take about like that and roll it over for two or three seasons and she said you know the caps three feet and he wrote us money over it'll be two million dollars by the time they have a three feet so I'm Still having this dilemma for the rest of the season I have not done anything with the money yet because it may be that like you know it was just a thousand dollar additional investment\nI might need to roll it over a couple of times because I think the caps are legitimate threat not only to repeat the sheer potentially do you have to repeat I'm only a drone every year by year so that's my dilemma but I'm leaning towards the right now I actually think this team is a special team and one that um is going to have a lot of ...\n[noise] well uh\nI get what you're saying I bet the Astros last year to win the world series attack and one as you know because you put Tibetan I read about in for you [noise] are you in fact the way that we didn't we didn't catch the ticket as\nA high concentration and those two districts but also in a several other [noise] I mean you know we're not going to spread it all out all over the state [noise] um [noise]\nYou have to know you know you got to play where you were just through your strength and it would be there I think a Ralph one uh [noise] I think ... [noise] one by twelve points twelve to Fifteen points I got an ear\nA in a [noise] blacks district and even more I think uh in Stuart events district\nAnd uh you know the dynamics are changing in this and it's not just so much a matter of of Trump or anything the demographics in this state are changing and they're changing almost daily and\nAh it's obvious which way in Europe they're moving are we going to be like Maryland now we're not going to be like Maryland but we um northern Virginia is beginning to look more and more in northern Virginia suburbs more and more not totally but more and more like the Maryland suburbs\nNational it's not just reached one right happening nationally and he's kind of various\nRight in New Jersey suburb same things going on everywhere not out of sight separate but you're seeing this you're seeing this an awful lot and um [noise] I think we have an excellent chance\nAnd no question we're getting help from the guy in the White House whether it will be there or not you know a A R I was joking with Mark Warner and I said you know we well we we need them they're just more and more election [laughter]\nBut I mean it's you know I'm a generally speaking we done better [noise] generally speaking when there's been a Republican and the White House have there been exceptions yes\nGenerally speaking the Republicans have done better when the Democrats been in the White House have there been exceptions yes but the trend is there and it was a mistake kind yeah understand and I\nI Would be surprised if we didn't know you know get to Twenty one in the election Adam minimum\nI tend to agree you know you still have to defend a couple of the like you got a couple of comments you got one over on the eastern shore that it didn't it didn't play I think Republicans can hope with the black sea things they don't have the black I\nI think that is far weaker today a competent probably anybody else 'cause it's just some personal proclivities and\nAnd and things that I think that hurts him among some of those voters we have some stronger candidates or black or I don't know what happens there he's got a hundred and fifty thousand in the bank so I didn't sound like he's ready to go away very quickly but I\nWill do my advice him and he got nowhere to hold them and when the phone and you want to go out to undefeated not indicted if you could do that and it gets lost before and loud and when he and house of delegates and you move over the first district to run for Congress and then he comes back but I don't think you want to end your career because I I think you beat him a journalism\nThe matrix where he has not really thinking or his voting record um [noise] ah to that district and you've got the state house at fifty one forty nine into redistricting that critical happened many many I mean we have to wait and see but may work and the Democrats thinks that\nThe um [noise] I mean it would appear that the judges are going to wind up drawing that house district of south Lebanon house districts\nAnd I think that's what whatever formula when they come up with that is going to also be what the Senate's going to have to abide by twenty Twenty one\nAnd a eight to change or you know a kicker changed an awful lot [noise]\nUm you know a hog the districts aren't unpacked totally but below the numbers I mean look what Bobby Scott\nI mean his district one from what fifty some fifty six percent down to you know one forties and I'm a [noise] you know produced another democratic district so you're going to have to see how that plays out but it seems to me\nThat uh the judges drawing that district is by far and away their their best bet\nAnd if they do you know Supreme Court I think it ruled before the gerrymandering is is has been constitutionally permissible until it spills over into racial discrimination\nAnd therein lies the problem and that's what\nThe Republicans are facing there and\nIt's going to change its going to change the way you know a whole makeup of legislatures around the country of course they do for a five to four court will do this differently blocks of each other and they aren't back\nIf I may be wrong but I think when they send it back to the lower court he was like seven to ...\nWell I I just think one of the thing is you got to understand the Republican base for better for worse is migrated from that country club in the country and in so doing they've taken so out of some competitive districts were these were economic issues Republican you'd be very viable [noise]\nSo it's not just the demographics of the fact that things have changed the emphasis on issues in ways that help them in South West Virginia but but it hurts them in the growing parts of the state\nCan we talk about the ... and also with a very popular governor with very low negative and you look at ... number ... ... support amongst Democrats\nWas not popular among Republicans was more polarizing in numbers Ralph Northam has incredibly low negatives\nFor somebody in this environment you look nationally\nUm he has very high positive very low negatives\nUm and in going into these competitive seats [noise]\nUm I remember in ... eleven and Democrats drew the state Senate lines and they lost the majority and who was the the person who was in every Republican TV ad that was flipping seats with Bob McDonnell a popular governor can play a big role now and that's a big um item that timetable here\nThese are still nationalize right I don't care how ... ...\nThere are special arm you're turning out the Thomas right the\nThe I mean it that that national seeing ways very heavily you know which is why you had you know the the patterns that you've had\nUntil McCarthy Cuccinelli him and you know what happened for almost fifty year I'm gonna I'm gonna get just about the surveys like let's take for example that started in the disturbing seat was not driven by national politics and twenty fifth and it was driven by local politics in Chesterfield versus Richmond and I'd like to be democratic\nUm and I think that we and we don't know if we'd had more aggressive candidate but we don't have we ... campaigns don't matter you know I don't think we had a I don't think we integrate messenger that I think if you really run that same race in twenty Nineteen and you had Ralph Northam auntie\nI'm In that district Ralph would flip it on to not let me just say oh they're going to vote the votes stardom and it's chaos is going to create problems for them\nI think that's a greater problem is that he he he's not harmonious with the district on some of those hot button issue I just say that like Rob Portman been good governor and he's a wonderful man but he gives a fireside chat and the fire goes down you put him on TV ... it's it's not the same kind of rally the team but he\nAnnounced that we can get the handy to use that ... I don't want to know if that's the kind of governor you actually meet this man he picked up not a fiery\nHe picked up Fifteen states I mean I think\nYou know turning the color business fiery and I'm at a carnival Barker one and and he doesn't he didn't pick up the playoff north I'm dead\nWell north and didn't pick 'em up Trump picked\nHim up for him yes if if Trump would have been president and twenty Fifteen we'd be in\nAll right let's look I don't I don't want to do on Ralph Northam disagree however I think he's been very much to say the\nChemical upon by three points and rapper with them on by eight and ... pick up the euro seats mouth and pick up Fifteen five point difference was not a fifteenth ... tell you that but there was also a hotel different let me tell you this\nWhite House mistake about it Trump okay I was a driving factor church last November on top of that um [noise] you had a ... and spilled over into everything [noise]\nAnd keep in mind Gillespie was not good you know\nI mean he was very polarized [noise] but um I just think people keep underestimating as governor oh oh I don't think anybody underestimating I don't think anybody under estimates name\nBut they know it was I mean you know what's driving politics in Virginia right now is not a Ralph up its it's what's going on across the Potomac River\nIt's negativity is driving politics on both sides right now in the one thing about Robert he doesn't that many negative [noise] doesn't have any ... he's a very likeable Austin immigrant\nI've not you know art now go you know been knocking on doors since may I have not gotten one negative comment about Ralph non and that's you know it's I mean people like him he's just a likeable person\nIs you know I'm not really the politics\nFor you know I I think comedy is not a fire eater they got to put up for the Republicans for Twenty years every single Republican Murphy she would have thought the person was married to Tom Davis because the Republican candidate had his picture bigger than their own picture with a quilt for him saying like here's why they'd be great for your time sometimes without permission um so I mean having a messenger\nIs important and Democrat here not had good luck to lend rocks north in the first time in a sense Mark Warner and we've had a messenger live near blind\n... I I agree but now he's taken out an incumbent that we are not entirely different that\nI don't know I tell you what man I I'm a joke joke kind of Peter ... you can't underestimate or see and I'm telling you\nWhat he had a disastrous press conference I wasn't there and it was a disaster of all types of hitting a disastrous press conference that really hurt him to all kinds of underhanded things going on\nBut you know after that Morsi's mayor and uh [noise]\nYou know the thing about Joe is an independent thinker he's got to go with the only way [noise]\nAh you know he's not\nA he's not a\nWhole bunch of any of the establishment caucuses or anything like that\nI think he's gonna play very well in that district and I think a lot of ... of friends there that I don't think that he got screwed by what they just throw 'em in and say\nCan I just want to see that the smartest thing I've ever seen anyone to in politics when he won the ... I think it was the mceachin people one Mickey chintzy on each and moved up I think\nAnd in that primary people and think he was going to win that primary crowded field any more than a landslide networks people are asking what did he do he went around and after he knocked on doors at night\nWrote a handwritten note every voter he spoke to the data that for a week and a half before the election in the context that he had remembered the conversation\n... kept these postcards for six months and send them all out of ten days before the election\nWith a handwritten note from him talking about how their conversation and you know I met your dog spam or you're a teacher here and I remember that conversation and you know hope I can count on your support next Tuesday and people\nCame out in droves coming for him to go do that though and I see people read postcards but I've never seen one posting them to make it appears that month later okay well Tommy Thompson is everything better than anyone in politics later but [noise]\nBut he did that and and he won in a landslide and like they have been done before it ... on on on the rest of me Joe I'm just saying take on incumbent in a district like I did it it's I feel I'm not I mean there's not going to be four or five people in that race either gonna just too\nA lot of people have gotten in the journal stomach because we don't have run on purpose\nIn this day a hole and you won't have that you'll just have to people in there\nAnd she's well why [noise]\nI don't think I I if I had the gas and I think until the wrong way to live in that district and I guess that round dance has extremely low name id pardon I Would guess that rod dampers extremely low name id and that if you have that they have a gym or says our name any not to say there's Powell part\nI'm just in [noise] but like in terms of I'd name id Richard Nixon had our name on it\n[laughter] you know like I don't think rises like real superstar this on his\nBack on your now Joe and I don't you\nThan it's got to get out how were something like Fifteen or twenty to one okay Joe was out there knocking on doors are making phone calls now will just\nBetween the basketball primary too in that primary like Dick was in the ... district for Twenty years before I got drawn to have the ... has a concept of campaigning and knocking on doors and doing the things that you do when you're in a competitive political rate for\nSeventy percent of the vote in my district against Mondale\nYeah rock that's never been a personalized jumpers yeah but not any Confederate says she's never been\nMatter of you guys actually performed since you've got to get out of work I mean just got out worker he's fighting Joe he's gotta he's gotta worker and\nThe other thing is I don't get I'm telling you he was going to get a typically are the sympathy vote out there for the fact that the power banks enrichment screwed this guy out of it is the likelihood\nAnd that's that's real I mean he got screwed I mean what do you have to pull this law license it looked senator Stanley told me that old but I guess I ...\n\nIt was pouring okay [laughter] what happened there was an overwhelming and it was because uh it was it was it was big cars challenged the Richmond system that's what happened that's why they told them and so I I just all kinds of member\nThat like you know there are a lot of people in that area that have and and this is a loyalty the job or see the reason he does well there's a lot of people there that he has represented and when families have had a time of need\nYou know the attorney they went through the criminal defense attorney to help out someone in their family was Joe Morsi and that created in level of loyalty he had they [noise] I\nI'm not ready to call this one one way or the other yet but um he has a real base [noise] it's it's across that district from being an attorney I'm In the same way that Donald McEachin you know when he when he ran rubber and his running\nYou know even as a primary challenge of what three times two incumbents are twice twice in the challenger don't come in Delhi gets been one to the challenge is going to come and senator\nAnd and mceachin was the guy who everyone news on TV give us a lawyer um he had to help so many people in the community it didn't matter that he was a challenger to encompass um that's how they live so much they thought he was income right and ... I mean he has helped a lot of people in those in those communities where they don't know who to turn to joy Morsi's then the guy who's just\nHe's one of the top defense attorney there so I just I I I think that it's an interesting race them in ... we got to see you know will rise even run again maybe not\nLet me look ahead to twenty Twenty one the governorship or when it comes comes through and a lot of um determine who's in the White House has used in that dynamic and so on but when north and goes well the attorney general Montana governor clashed at that who else is looking at this at this point in the Democratic party or as I Know\nI mean there are name pops up there on that Perry yelling was not out of the picture and I'm going to know how I Would imagine if you're running you know of course but I Would I Would hope that herring in Fairfax and yet things worked out or not you're congested nomination but [noise]\nYou got a lot of people in the back looking for upward mobility you're the mayor of Richmond stony you've got some other ones just\nThem getting her yellow sitting there on you'll have a primary and you'll just have to see if it's a [noise] six extra can be dangerous if only I think it's only a [noise]\nLong as you don't have a two way right [noise] uh between Fairfax ... an hour and a [noise] I think it's a\nThem if it's one of them against the whole batch of other people like when [noise] uh you know the Fairfax\nCounty somebody out so I like you guys are talking about\nAnd a Fairfax wrong you're not talking about large stony who was absolutely going to do something because the other person you're not talking about\nWho can pull the upset in a two or three person race and\nThat's ...

shop confirmation the impact is going to have\nAnd their segment we'll get to Redskins child naps Astros and everything else about sports which is going up a restaurant with Tom Davis Tom the or the

veterans [noise]\nWell [noise] I I think he probably get confirmed\nAt this point there that didn't the FBI didn't find any operation um so I think through you're going to get the Republican members um and probably Joe mansion I think mentioned puts his re election in jeopardy if he does it does a fourth\nThird third party cooperation none but I'm telling you it's somebody has to try these kinds of cases in court there's a lot different markers or better test maybe we should point to somebody's being credible so I you know talking to a therapist about ten years ago which apparently the document and the therapist I mean who can help put themselves out there and put themselves through this crap\nUm if it if it didn't happen um I mean what what are her motives I don't I don't see why she would\nHave you can convict somebody based on what just not even convict anybody but this guy's applying for the highest court in the land is not applying for a job the dominant to deliver pizza and I think the the burden that you have in terms of\nUh keeping somebody off of a lifetime appointment is entirely different than so anybody can make any allegations you want to talk of operation at your ... nobody's talking about taking away the guy's liberty and putting them in jail that's a that's a different issue than it is you know the way that the Republicans\nAnd that Trump would put up somebody can come come out and say he uh did something to me forty years ago have no evidence no cooperation and that's the\nYeah they didn't say something that the sexual assault which is an entirely different issue and you got to put yourself in the context of the time and the place and back then in the Nineteen eighties wasn't some people can't afford\nIt don't they don't come for nearly as much today about it they should that they back then when I was in high school and I kinda think people in\nYou you didn't hear about this guy and I'm not a machine but extremely credible I'm just very emotional ...\nAnd and I do think that I I think that taking that extra week going back and interviewing some of the people more judging others around it I think it was with the right thing I think's slam dunk in the spring or the day after her would have been terrible politics would have been a terrible on the institution having said that\nNobody else can remember the party was there ... there's just too many holes to really make the case that doesn't mean she's wrong but but that's a tough standard for the future you know what he can come forward and say anything\nAnd I appreciate that but I just wanted to go back within six days and remember after she testified Chris Wallace from Fox News and the president to talked about how\nCredible she was an old Republican operatives were text everybody right after she testified this is done it's over she's toast and then seven days later without Rob back to where we weren't amazing to me how fast the world changes but back to what we're talking about before I had just gotten his crop rotation sidebar\nFive or ... blood outside saw a poll last week that I'm a ... thing that's ... that's all the polls you read when they're asking you to tell us why not heal certainly certainly are he's got an apartment but\nBut you know under fifty well into well ownership and I and I think what you gotta remembering this in if he ... his independence this whole shtick I think [noise] for him is the changes the outcome if that's right\nYeah I I Can't I and I'm not an expert on West Virginia but it's nice to meet Joe Manchin told position that I'm an independent guy I'm not beholden to either side and uh\nI think it would be hard for him to get reelected it would seem to me in a what a Trump when the state by like fifty points something like that\nAnd I'm not on also documents and Susan Collins is going to run again either\nAnd I don't know that that I think it's all I'm not easily but she says\nShe's never voted against the Supreme Court judge ever you have any group in the state to put a million dollars a snake unless she votes against million Spanish yeah okay now come to a million and a half to go find me but then it looks like a ... I mean I think at the end of the day without corroboration she's going to be there\nFor for for which she agree with Tom ... not only twenty twenty twenty is she going to run again well should make that decision at the appropriate time [noise]\nI I think I think Tom now that I think she is going to vote yes ah the one that I have no read on\nThe top Davis is I'm Lisa Murkowski of Alaska what about what about you [noise]\nPretty independent I mean I just remember this when she lost that primary to Joe Miller locked Republican primary right she run as a write in with the ... that we get started and ended up and also as you want to laugh but you know the the part about the independents pieces when you guys mentioned when it's because they claim they're they're reelect\nIn terms of looking out for their state right mhm yeah and Murkowski has a big issue with the cabin opinion about Alaskan natives I think\nWas something that you know when she ... she she she does on on that issue so now it's not clear cut I haven't seen the polling in Alaska or the but the I think if you get towns like and I think you're going\nTo get flaky booed him out of committee so I think without some ... operation Jeff Jeff is fundamentally very conserved right you've got to be a little more research to he's also very independent and I think a very principled guy which is why people think he's flaky because he doesn't always staying in one boxing\nIsn't always predictable but this judgeship you're going to understand for Republicans this ... this this is a very important building on the court as it is on the Democrats on the other side of it [noise] wanting somebody else\nCan I ask a question has a has a a vice president were broken a tie on a Supreme Court nominees knocking on where here or there that would be unprecedented everybody [noise]\nBut that can and then we also have a challenge that but it's still count how do you know that it just sort of thing you talked to she just says invite you can set and there's got to be no\n... or you want you to President Bill but he's not a member\nI I can tell you in the state like Virginia right not reunion states then it's not Virginia yesterday and I'm not you know [laughter] yeah I've never had already lawsuit there's already a lawsuit\nAnd they take over the house or the Senate to move to impeach that would\nBe a disaster two thirds of the Senate good luck\nYeah let's just um I I think you're going to get on ...\nOf elections have consequences that's what I take away but here's ... let's get the Republicans to do to stealing Supreme Court [noise] well I I mean all of a little more and fall Trump one here's the problem you still can't get over the fact that Trump won two years later he's still can't get over ... where am I Am married\nGarland well let me let me talk Grammar Girl I think by by every indication is a very honorable straightforward have made a good Supreme Court judge in in the traditional sense with these balance the it's not completely a liberal democratic operate before he won the when bench but but met the criteria for free judge\nBut what is better not holding a hearing on them are doing what they've done in this case and that is bringing is putting the sham of of hearing him and then finding a way to trashes reputation and voting no they weren't there to confirm it it was election year Republican senators were confirmed Scalia's seat and putting on a more liberal members just wasn't going to happen\nIn a presidential politics here not a mid ... who knows who knows what the rules are writing about it but if the president it's the president United States who nominate somebody from the frame court out to set their rights that threat\nSo therefore I think McConnell's argument is out when he says look a that was the presidential election year like one of the voters decide that step\nBut I'm just saying they they stretch it each time I don't know who started it but it keeps getting worse and worse and worse\nAnd once you do it for one year you could do it two years you can do it three years I I don't know they're already guard rails long enough I think it was they moved it from sixty votes to fifty votes for everything but the Supreme Court of course they're going to do it for the Supreme Court if there are new guard rails anymore on this and that's what's scary\nAre not going to be here again it's actually you're from a DJ Republican operative in Virginia Beach if there is such a thing did you Joe mansion is only apply for in the latest Fox poll as of a two days ago apply for not Fifteen so Scott nice to what check his email was what one of our listeners said\nAnything for a shot I might have gotten another email on that let me check that got another email where here\nThe boys are factory town waning right\nBy rather Breitbart than or so that must be well then if Breitbart and says I just got to Glendale eight or\nWhat's his name battle is destroying Ted Cruz\nSaid oh it's not going to win that were top the top Democrat on the Republican congressman from northern Virginia and in Cambridge his favorite congressman ever we've got ... percent is with us we're at jeopardy this world headquarters here\nIn uh Fairfax city and Scott surveillance state senator from northern Virginia Democrat and part of democratic leadership I'm\nNot part of the ... I'm fairly soon but there isn't room for saying that if you challenged if you if you challenge the godfather of anybody you know the godfather is not here\nReal clear politics average on Mitch right now is nine points for well that's a far cry from Fifteen here's one plus twelve or Thirteen or Fifteen minutes and plus twelve and when I was\nI mean like the answer is spent just instantly had I think he's got I'll give you I'll give you that and I think but I think a no vote\nHere changes have that dynamic there was a poll earlier before all this controversy or that showed that if you voted against it all took me numbers change on\nThis ... I don't dispute the fact that the numbers would change\nUm but from my perspective I think Kavanaugh's confirmation does is probably the terms of the Democratic enthusiasm prime that's five to ten feet maybe than in Cedar too I mean well I think it helps in the house and her too because when it's on very red territory North Dakota\nUh Missouri I mean these are pretty solid see West Virginia\nIn the Senate races Kavanaugh thinking soccer public\nOr where we're where we're at a time for a couple of guys get finally our news but one thing I think Tom nailed it this is the only thing I've seen and since Trump announced that has a unified Republican I've never seen anything like that we couldn't figure out how to do it we're going to talk about\nI just Fifteen I was twelve point for when I went back and actually look at the polls\nThat limits the cabinet discussion yet you want to go ahead what do you think about it but then we got to get the fuck for football hockey but God go ahead\nOh I've always been um last night\nAnd the Senate Judiciary committee be official account of the Senate Judiciary committee is tweeting about Democrats do not understand the definition of ... that would be a Senate Judiciary against this thing is so off the rails and and and I feel like [noise]\nYou know people were completely missing the point with all this process crap\nYou know the reason the judiciary committee's tweeting is that the Democrats have the definition Ronald book it's all process\nAnd none of it is actually on where people are on it and where voters are on on this is the Kavanaugh only has the support of the conservative base and the message that women are getting around the country is that you know people are OK with sexual assault\nNo I think that that is in the metro they're getting in your now a pronounced wrong doing or what is the only way to get a little bit about this this is the same democratic\nParty that defended Bill Clinton that attacked his accusers ma right especially the one that got rates well\nOf all first of all I was I went to the extent the allegation of rape against Bill Clinton which which it actually didn't exist during the impeachment process if you remember\nSo when you say the Democratic party rallied around through whatever that allegation one thing out there at the time I Will say second thing is when\nThat was why he lied they say\nIf you're talking about with all the junk where LBJ genders different than Joe then that was on right after the judge was actual capturing yeah I've been working out after that was ever catch him was interviewing\nA week after the Senate and house in about that you had to sequence Kevin really was the same topic Paula Jones or that you're\nThinking about the need about money to buy train abroad I the first to where I Am the first thing you were not retaliation anyway the point [laughter]\nThe message that women are getting around the country is that this is okay and Republicans are now into a debate about the definition of ... I mean general trend and double struggle I mean it is a is this is on the official Senate district ... look everybody knows what Butina\nArt or not you have to first of all I don't know what I\nAte boating is Butina is inserting drugs in your in us instead of taking them down your throat because you for your body will process it faster venue that Iraq because you believe that I learned during the eighties right where that everyone knows what that means or are they going to be a very\nVery interesting out here memory innocent crowd here that has no idea what that word means you're not and then and then you don't count on going to go on national television taking notes and be like oh it's a party in jail I mean this is so ridiculous and absurd wasn't embarrassing nominee that talks\nAbout the process a Democrat and let me earlier that you just really get around the world you're talking about\nPolling going on there and wait for bowling on this very split the ... this is not overwhelming polling against capital which is right down the mental at this point in which is the worst in history but we get Supreme Court justice or never done that all the way down the matter because we're just\nTalking about the electoral repercussions when he was going to you kicked the hornet's nest\nThe Republican base that was kind of depressed at this point in what you're seeing now in in terms of the energy brings to both parties the enthusiasm gap closes next critical Democrats a couple of times at least you know\nI guess when you look nobody wants to have somebody that is uh doing sexual has done sexual assault get off of it we want people to come over here it's okay you have public that there is a double standard right Keith Ellison the or\nThe guy who was the guy the ravens beat up his girlfriend and ... by the hair and they they pay them more\nJust for for whatever it's worth I mean I I totally concur on the telephone I set out publicly I campaigned for his opponent you know on line when he got into the primary for attorney general I said this is not right the way he's doing it um\nAnd you should you should be that's in it or not you've been listening in general but it is it ... and it is bad\nBecause a lot of people will look the other way 'cause any should not be the number two person on the Democratic National Committee right\nBut this is the Supreme Court and you have a guy who not only has a credible accuser and we'll put the other two aside from that but I think Dr Ford is an extremely\nOf your cooperation what's your cooperation her collecting contemporary\nHis he's the people she started Bush President at the party he turned over his calendars from the same month and at the same people are listed on his calendar and ... and being like a social event\nAt parties and she didn't go to school so she wouldn't even know those people and that was all his calendars were released after she made\nIn none of them you know reading her best friend can remember this right but that's not to robbery you know what but you know in in\nTown and parents I mean I Am I'm equally much money at high school reunion in next month it's been a long time or not and I'm the youngest person here if I was at a social function in high school and no one told me that a a a traumatic event for someone else had occurred\nI Would have not remembering the event the next week\nLet alone Twenty years later came to me now and said oh were you at this party had to I don't know if I was at that party or\nNot this guy produced calendar of what he was doing that number and nobody can pinpoint nobody can pinpoint where and when the party was where it was with my how she got there how she got home you got to have something outside of some memory\nWhich you credible witness absolutely but I've seen credible witness is before going wrong memories get over Thirty years I don't remember a lot of things Thirty years ago or or I remember them differently than they were you get corrected\nLook I don't know who's telling the truth there but I think the mere allegation enough that's now the standard that take somebody down I think we wanted\nTo I don't think this is an allegation I mean I I I think we know it I think that when you look at you know um people have put a lot of holes in the story of the the third accuser um and I think that you know you obviously have to hear both sides of you know when an user comes over to their credibility\nThis this accuser everything she has that you can cooperate with what she had done with how she lived her life\nWhich are the notes from her therapy sessions\nWhere it is accurate long have you do not early in the notes from earth or the operator you get them to the she offered
