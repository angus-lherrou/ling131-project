you're the one that said you keep covering ... giving government this unlimited power\nOf surveillance and its eventually going to come around and bite you in the bud center that's exactly what happened\nHaving the same very saying the conversation yesterday with the director of the odd because I asked him point blank argue gathering information including the president phone calls and of course he fired and said oh I Can't answer that at the center\nAnd the answer for him I said the answer is yes there was an article about two or three years ago saying that they recorded Fifteen hundred of President Obama's own calls and then they minimize hand which means ... mark his name now but is it to tell when President Obama or President Trump was talking to a foreign leader your them\nHear their voices [noise] even if you lived or worked out in Ames\nAssist conversations were listening to journalist conversations businessmen and women conversation and they record it and then they're out there and then the FBI condemned search this database without a warrant\nAnd my point him was and I think he didn't understand it or if you're recording things on potential terrorists from overseas that costs because it really apply to them but\nIf they're talking to Americans or just random people are talking to America and we do get constitutional protections because many of the phone call our discussions with terrorists in fact the vast majority are innocent international phone calls\nAnd so we have had this discussion with down and it should be protected by the knocking back some said or the you know John Adams says the spark that led to the revolution because when you get like the British soldiers coming into our houses you know breaking down there to work with they stop tax [noise]\nUh we really wanted protection and we wanted to say the government and never come at your house or any private\nConversations are belongings without talking to a judge first\nWell and that's a that's why you were so adamantly opposed to when you were a predictor of the future what this whole thing senator\nYou've also been a very strong voice on the disappearance of ... to show the there's a lot of talk about what should be done and we want more information\nAnd like I get that but as a member the Foreign Relations committee you're the only senator that has proposed action which isn't to get answers on his disappearance because\nThe thing is we haven't videotape showing that he went in there is nobody takes showing that he went out and I'm a crown prince NBS Mohammed bin Salman says the camera footage was corrupt or the battery went dead\nThey can't really only by that is like the dog ate my homework or I didn't get an ever ready battery and so the battery died\nNow you have called for an immediate suspension of ah the arms sales to the Saudis until we get some kind of a satisfactory answer can you elaborate on that sir\nI think everybody should remember that Saudi Arabia is the largest state sponsor of radical\nIslam around the world but I mean by that or if they had been funding for\nMature authors in Pakistan in the Philippines\nEven in the United states teaching critical west hatred of Christianity and teaching radical violent jihad\nThis is just out of your car we shouldn't be selling a weapon simply because of the Nineteen hijackers who came here were from Saudi Arabia Saudi Arabia is a part of our terrorism problem they are they funders of terrorism and teaching\nYoung radical Islam around the world this latest episode\nOr I see no way that this could have happened without there being too private clients were two guys who some of them have been linked to Saudi security services and intelligence I'm now it doesn't pass the smell\nDescribe their arms sales to halt the arms sales are the only thing they listen to be an addition to them killing a journalist there maybe tens of thousands of civilians killed\nIn Yemen they're doing it with our bombs\nWhen we're ... when they're flying in there and it flies and two weeks ago or three weeks ago they killed the school bus full of children in school children were killed a year ago they killed a hundred and fifty people in a funeral procession and we wonder\nWhy someone in Yemen wants to drop a bomb on and kill the Saudi are killing American because they climb the fragments of the bombs are saying you know America parents so we have to realize their birth reaction there's reaction and that's a blowback\nFrom us being involved in some Mr gotten civil war is one that we actually create more terrorists but here's the other possible thing that's going to happen\nAgain or what happened in Libya when we toppled Gadhafi we got chaos and more terrorism it became a breeding ground for terrorism mind\nHere is that there is some remnants of fairly fairly strong rent it out or India and we're not fighting them that were Mitchell stricter\nCivil war between the who in the salaries and also we're going to rain here and says well the market here is that it sends into chaos and that you get the rise of al ... the same thing happened in Syria is that the war that we got involved in standard into chaos you got the rise of ISIS\nWill actually uh the network that I go on June near a a couple of months ago was reporting that al Qaida fighters were actually given safe haven a by the by the Saudi forces in Yemen in ... in in order to fight the who the so\nCalled this wouldn't it wouldn't be surprised to hear that the Saudis support in Syria they support her down news round which is essentially an offshoot\nOf al ... so the Saudis are always poor people who hate America who\nHate a western ways and yet we kinda big arms deal the president says oh it for jobs are creating jobs that's not something that we consider any more we argue arms deals we need to be considering our national security not trying to have some sort of Keynesian job scope\nYou're on the John triggers radio network truck in the truth across America we're with Kentucky Senator Rand Paul Republicans on the Foreign Relations committee a he's been the strongest voice in the U.S Senate on how we react to the uh Jamal to show ... disappearance\nSo have you recommended this to the president\nCenter have you want to direct conversation can remember a look there was I was a an original Trump supporter everybody knows day when it came down the escalator he campaigned on getting out of these entanglements not staying in them have you had a direct conversation with the president on how we should react to this\nNonsense the killing of the journal after he does know my feelings are talking about once every week or two [noise] and when we have our conversations I generalize by saying\nThat uh he has a say\nA million times it's a natural instinct on Syria or that we should stay forever\nYet he's surrounded by the state forever crowd and that's the real problem there I think the president's instincts are good at I'm sort of in the crowd at what the credit and I'd be your president right and yet the people surrounding him are\nI think ah to offer you know part of the traditional foreign policy round here but you go skating forever and bankrupt America\nSenator pull the president has invested a lot of political capital in the Saudis and it was the first place that he went in his first foreign visit a MPs came to the United states he did his media tour within the Saudis spend a ton of money\nOn media PR as you know uh in in in the swamp\nAnd so he's put a lot of uh and and you know we kind of looked the other way when NBS rounded people are jailed him in that hotel whatever they did\nThis mystery ... has looked the other way is this going back to our relationship with the Saudis and my ... and tying it to that is it going to change the president's position on the Saudi ... book Largo of the state of Qatar where we have or\nThey get the military base in the middle east\n[noise] yeah I'm not so sure you got to change his mind he seems to be ...\nAre now continuing to sell our the Saudi Arabia\nI think Congress is also the same way
