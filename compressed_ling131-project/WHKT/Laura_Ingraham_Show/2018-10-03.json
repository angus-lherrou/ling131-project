nation's capital great to have you with us today trucking the truth across America your Godzilla of the truth\nRight here Curtis Ellis coming out few moments we're going to be doing a victory dance on this great trade agreement know born after we've been fighting it for thirty five years I hate NAFTA\nI never thought I'd see today where it was done to put John and replaced by something better than actually helps the American worker and more good news\nIf you're working in America today you have a job even more good news if you wanted to three hundred and fifty thousand people that worked for Amazon guess what you just got to read [noise] if you are below fifty dollars now you're going to be starting November first at Fifteen dollars\nAmazon saying you know what we have to raise wages\nWe have to find a cute people see when you're competing is booming and you have more jobs than people to fill the jobs that means companies are searching for good people they\nTo applicants for three jobs and if they're good applicants they're gonna have to pay them\nSo I'm In favor\nOf the Fifteen dollar minimum wage as you know\nBut here's what's even better when you don't even have to have it mandated by the federal government when the market driven by Trump's economic is so vibrant\nThat companies have to make decisions in their best interest to raise wages to keep good people that is a great thing to think of all the entry level people that went to work for Amazon or are going to work for Amazon and taking a couple of good things to grow\nThat just got a ratings because of the Trump autonomy\nDistrict in half of what is an air\nBecause wages are rising so now Amazon has to compete with other companies UPS FedEx whenever they have to compete and they\nAnd that's what Trump atomic centers and that's how the rising tide lifts all boats so wages continue to derive this is this is great it was just an amazing thing today and we finally got rid of NAFTA [noise]\nOh my God I just thirty you don't want when that was first going down Curtis Ellis is with us so we're we're going to bring him in a prison cell is a senior policy adviser with America First policy and\nYou could go back to the nap today I mean I remember the so vivid it was like Nineteen what the Clinton that got elected and then getting rich came up like Ninety five and speak NAFTA thing was going on and\nIt was going to be like the panacea in all these jobs are going to be creative and and you know we were going to be the service economy whatever not since they were selling it back then you know how many Republicans were fighting NAFTA like ... like me Trump and ... that's it\nAnd if you're against NAFTA you know what\nIn the nineties you were looked at as like some kind of an economic Neanderthal\nLike dumber than a boxer rocks like you couldn't see the future you're via word mired in the Eighteen hundreds and you wanted to bring back a black students or something the horse and buggy like you just couldn't get where they couldn't understand the global world economy and\nAnd then with the help of the wall Street Journal editorial page and the wall Street Journal is of course the the the mouthpiece of the global corporations who I Believe in open borders no countries at all just let us rape and pillage anywhere on earth without\nUh any anything like a national legislature or national board or getting in the way of our ability to just exploit the cheapest labor anywhere\nAnd rape and pillage all over all over the world as as we wish the wall Street Journal editorial page invented this lie that the Smoot Hawley that the terrorist act of Nineteen thirty created the great depression\n[laughter]\nAnd and now has become accepted gospel wisdom everywhere and it's still pops up and you can find Republicans saying it you find Democrats saying it you find better work saying it in Texas you find every moron idiot who doesn't even understand\nEconomics but they know for sure\nThat it was the the the the Great Depression was caused by terrorists right that's what caused it the Smoot Hawley tariff act\nAnd that's what caused the great depression and it's a complete lie complete fabrication and no basis in truth whatsoever but that is now the accepted wisdom and anytime anybody attacks Donald Trump's for standing up to China\nAnd putting terrorists in place for defending American industry to say well don't you know that terrorists called the great depression suffer and how do you know that well I read it somewhere you know where you're at a while everybody knows that\nCase close and so that all happened as a result that all came out of the debate over NAFTA in Nineteen Ninety four thank you\nAl Gore another lie from the Democrats had founded by the Republican at the wall Street Journal editorial page for all of the Republican\nI mean I mean back then Curtis the Republicans were totally complicit in this this was driven by Newt Gingrich I mean Bill Clinton basically came along for the ride being rich and Republican majority John chases they all drove it see people forget that I remember and you remember\nThe Republican drove this and they really believe that you know this was open trade open borders everything's going to be fine\nAnd look at Wall Street driven right they got they got big donated by Wall Street lower Manhattan\nThings will be good for you because you make more money and they workers as they please\nTake commodity the first thing you learn in economics one on one is going to a junior in high school and they they talk to you about diminishing resources that supply and demand and they say the number one biggest cost the businesses what\nLabor labor labor right\nI mean you learn that as a sophomore in high school\nSo it never stop now or were which Curtis Ellis is a senior policy adviser for America first policies he's also the chairman of Emma richest of the American jobs alliance Curtis uh worked in the Trump Administration and the department of labor he was also on the campaign\nCurtis so way out for us this is a great victory for American workers American farmers lay out like the top three or four changes and housing\nPositively affect the Americans going from ending FDA to United States Mexico candidate or us and say hey\nLook at the top ah some of the top changed it increases the amount of a car that must be made in North America it increases it up to Seventy five percent three quarters of the court to enter the United states duty free three quarters of that automobile\nMust be made in the United states it increases the amount of dairy products that the United states can sell in Canada so that our dairy farmers in upstate New York Wisconsin and the northern tier in California a lot of dairy in California [noise]\nNumber one dairy state America will have a greater access not just to Canada\nBut to third countries because Canada under this agreement will reduce subsidies to the dairy product\nExports to third countries it subsidizes its excess dairy production\nAnd a ... under cuts are prices in third countries are you there you go okay\nI heard a click that wasn't true [noise] and ah it\nIt it it increases are protections for or digital trade intellectual property rights in the digital trade which of course did not exist at all and the previous now after ... there was no digital trade there was no Internet or if\nThere was a and and what's happened over the last twenty five years\nIs Canada put in all these crazy a protections in requirements and regulations so that Americans couldn't even sell stuff to Canadians on E. bay it became virtually impossible\nSo a e commerce there's now increased we can now actually sell stuff to Canadians over the Internet and um [noise] that that we couldn't do before and\nIs a stipulation in this us MCA that if Canada or Mexico enters a trade agreement with a non market economy and that means China right there the biggest non market economy out there\nIf they do all bets are off we can withdraw from NAFTA we can withdraw from our trade agreement with that country so\nBasically what they say you can't set up Mexico or Canada can't enter into a trade deal with China and then trying to be ... and then use NAFTA as a way to get there's the subsidized goods into the United states\nRight that's that's what that's what was happening on NASA\nAnd that was also what was going to happen on steroids if we if we can see the the exactly the Chinese she like\nThan shipping to a straight to the you you you you with us they go to Mexico or they go to Canada becomes part of that and we have a great deal right they yeah it's like you know the\n... the other huge thing about that sense it's on a step back for a minute and look at the big picture NAFTA was supposed to be the first step in the free trade area of the Americas right first we bring together North America countries\nThen we get kept or Central America free trade agreement and the next step is going to be the free trade area of the Americas from\nFrom tierra del sway you go to the north pole one big happy free trade zone and then we saw was with TPP the Trans Pacific partnership we were going to bring in the other side of the Pacific as well and see all of these things are part of the\nOf the vision the grand vision of creating a border was world and I am not exaggerating misses some John birth society conspiracy top ...\nIs the fact the wall Street Journal again they have said\nOn the record there should be a law or they want to amend the constitution to add a this phrase there shall be no borders that he's been dream of the global is of the global is corporations the fortunes fifty the\nFortune five corporation\nThey want no borders no nations\nThey don't want pesky things like Congress or the president's ... making it difficult for them to do their thing anywhere on earth fine cheap labor over here find cheap minerals over their combined them into third place and sell them into fourth place that's their vision it's\nBeen laid out before in front of Congress this is not a conspiracy\nThis new deal recognize that we have a country and we are entitled to have a country and it's a privilege for people in other countries to sell their goods in America is not\nIt's a labor laws environmental laws whatever laws that are good for the American people can decide what are the conditions in situations for me to step in this country\nTreat everybody right treat their workers treat private property rights respected and you can make things and do well and have a good living in this country if you're from another country and your company is from another country\nThe privilege to be allowed to sell stuff in this country not\nAbsolutely something better than anyone we could have had a\nThank you for being with us I've only got twenty seconds so I got to change the topic and asking for a yes or no answer doesn't Brett\nConfirmed by Saturday afternoon yes yes yes yes I also I Would say yes I think he gets on Saturday afternoon job for this radio network Barbara Comstock coming after you've been right here\nEverybody's predicting a western victory except me are predicting hey Barbara Comstock victory and job I could start by this and we're going to bring Iran but uh I think it was a week ago or two weeks ago right two weeks ago I covered the yeah two weeks ago or ... I don't remember I covered\nThe alarm county debate between uh Jennifer Wexton\nBarbara ... and we ran out live on the radio and\nTo tell you that was that was the biggest debate crushing I've ever seen in my life partner was at the top of her getting all all property was rattle off solution after solution after solution success after success after six times plant\nAfter plan and western had nothing I mean I was embarrassed for actually uh I went to Paris for Jennifer it was so bad with like she was an dilated and\nThere was a lot of talk after that debate like who prepared or and what the deal was but um you know what is what it is so okay trick shooting joining us now we declared her the huge debate Victor Barbara Comstock hey Barbara good good to have you with us\nGreat to hear John morning [noise]\nUm what was the deal in that debate I mean\nI really expected Jennifer to do better than that I was embarrassed for her [noise]\nWell what can we focused on without hurting read that you dont and we can do to help the rebels that I'd heard all I got that I've worked out pardon [noise] to promote our prosperity you know the tax cuts and the economic growth me out for\nPercent economic growth a booming economy that is you know making\nFunding for things like Alzheimer's research and cancer research support for veterans the largest military have raised so many things are good things\nThat she can't say anything about of course these are things that she resisted the agenda that I'm getting attacked the ad that they have up right now attacking me is an eighty two percent bipartisan agenda that included things like you know records funding for opioid\nAddiction treatment and education and computers and so she's doing is resisting and when you actually look on her legislative record it has\nBeen cruel she doesn't have any job accomplishments nothing on her website about anything she got jobs ... jobs because that was not as focused and so when she was there with the chamber is is networks time thanks to focus on you know the job she is they read this since\nLeft wing number one liberal candidate who's opposed things there's reasonable as that's just too soon for victims victims of domestic and sexual abuse chip\nPosed that a justice here she's opposed she opposes the bill one of the first thing she oppose when she was elected in the state Senate with a bell I had to help victims of domestic here's a bill that God's ... told me it was a great bill and um and he was voted\nFor so this is how far out of touch she and she doesn't have a record I mean a bunch of her ... she\nCites her bills Joey says I vote I have a bunch of bills passed its with things like moving the borders of her again and all of these little you know changing papers the file in court you know there's nothing major that she passed\nShe's a follower NATO leader the things you talked to she has not been able to get\nTwenty one vote this time that 'cause I Need to get to pass a major bill\nAnd this is somebody who cannot go out work across the aisle to get anything manager with Twenty one clinical now when you go to Congress you need two hundred and twenty and I've done that and I've gotten my bills and things like my two thousand dollar child tax credit got\nIt into the tax bill got my colleagues to report that my project states neighborhood which is providing\nMore funny thing right for a crime and put ... put a gun fight gun crime drug crime and er nurse Thirteen Gehring crime to get her that that's in the score card that they're attacking\nSo she just doesn't have a record to run on for a dollar resent sensors on negative and it's going to fail because people are just as much someone focused on their priority and getting resolved on prosperity public safety and national security not hurry the journey starts out fighting you know saying no to everything\nWell look I think that was obvious that the thing and\nIt was as far as you go your hardest crowds\nAnd saying Trump socks and all that but then when you go into the debates\nWe just want to resist the other guy and\nThink that's where she fell down in this debate or she really didn't have anything and that her closing statements she attacked I'm your record on women which I thought was laughable to be honest so I don't think she did her yeah\nSomebody Jennifer what than had been campaigning with former representative Jim Moran now this is the man who had not one but two I call it the only time for abusive behavior yelling for by one and this is somebody\nSeems hypocritical campaign is seen as not called out a single Democrat not Bill Clinton\nNot John Conyers not Ellis than who I still you know that he hadn't seen\nA coach hair and other members of Democrats who are still there that I have to occasionally get on the elevator website called out is single wanting to them or their behavior I mean she hit the critically a silent\nPartner then I don't I think as we discussed before someone who mindlessly attacked George Mason university her name any law school after Justice Scalia and you know getting thirty million dollars for a scholarship as a result [noise]\n\nLet me ask you this last time the hometown newspaper a shirt west or from the county and they have a forum nothing in the fire to you and Jennifer to be at a\nApparently they're telling me that senator west and turned it down or were you were willing to be there [noise]\nYeah we had accepted this was something that Ralph Northam and I thought they did last time\nIt was you know a discussion on our local insurance and you know in that debate is um [noise] you know what I mean listen she didn't go to a single [noise] nine eleven memorial ceremony to be in the coming days\nThey didn't go to a single national night out he's not going to a public\nForum at all not putting her heart in a band that are invited over the world you know they're they're trying to keep her head and and I think he thought that debate why\nThat that was pretty bad I mean I I mean I've seen\nI've seen senator west\nLot of other venues that I Know she was a prosecutor\nAnd the social turning and um you know she did run a pretty aggressive campaign in a special election so I mean I've seen her speech and she's really not that bad it was just that day that morning I Would say she was shot at the top of her game and you were and that's why we're such a last minute\nNever see representing very Democrats threat that wind seven percent per hour north and I'm I'm well I'll tell you that is seeing its run ahead of of other Democrats she's actually run a coin behind chicken hunger performer team had\nAny district where often has to do is\nTo and if the Democrats get them across\nPrior candidate won out here they are now in the valley that you couldn't have local events bipartisan democratic city council cocaine was singing literally and and\nThen entire community and said nope don't want to be at a public forum have another event the case now don't want to hear that she doesn't see the pan out in the western part of the district [noise] doesn't really I think I understand that diversity at the desk\nYou're on the John for his radio network you're Godzilla the truth in America we're with Republican congresswoman from the district Barbara Comstock running for a third term this is the seat that Frank Wolf health forever demographics have changed is flipping to blue however\nAre predicting that Barbara is going to win the seat even though I'm the pundits ever someone of another dog\nAnd she's running against a snake center Jennifer Wexton it'll be decided on November six you want to be sure market on your child there turn out and vote no matter what your preferences have to get\nInvolved so I'm Barbara Comstock let me ask you this the president [noise] finalizing the trade deal yesterday no our protection is so we come from different angles here so we're going to uh\nNot debate that but I think after I was glad to see it go I did a champagne dance [noise] uh when we finally got rid of it but there's a lot\nBenefits here with the new deal Canada actually came in before midnight because the president said it was a\nForty dollars an hour they're putting food on the table for their families um there are thousands of people across the region who are getting trained learning a new skill or a trade just work on this project and they're going to use that as a launching pad to know the whole new career in the construction industry\nSo this is an exciting time for working people\nUm and we just really appreciate your staying up for the working man\nWell working men and women in this country before Trump had no advocate and they have no\nAdvocate because they don't donate any money and uh they're not part of the uh of of the uh lower Manhattan Goldman Sachs class that's been running this country for five decades that's come to an end though now Aaron

what a great last night there was a play at third grade and we had this thing I've ever seen in my life but\nBut I Know what they were doing yeah there was a time that was put on a guy at third base

I went to bed at the other nine so when I get up today but um I Love Oakland today this is I Can't\nWait for this game today I really can't wait because this to me is going to be like last night one of the most classic game or you've got two teams that are very very good one team won a hundred games the other one Ninety seven games will be a great game tonight\nOne game playoff winner takes all and Oakland goes to the rocks will rate to organize your parent\nI tend to agree with you when the thing is is that the political kid gets you know five six senators under the touch down a few

single team in the major leagues that my son and I are concerned about except to Oakland I Want to play the I'd rather play the Yankees Red Sox I don't care Cleveland I don't want to play on\nAnd so uh but I think they're going to win tonight and then I wouldn't be\nSurprised if they went to Fenway and I'm One of the opener there to visit they look they play the Astros or something like Eighteen

Katrina look I\nWant the FBI to conduct as\nInvestigation as they possibly can within whatever restraint are\nIn public upon them um but I think for anyone who believe there is such a thing as a judicial temperament and that we want judges particularly those on our highest court\nTo approach issues approach plaintiffs independence with\nUm a sense of fairness that there's a lot to be concerned about [noise]\nBut I I watch as much of her testimony as I could I found her they're incredible you have to ask yourself why would anybody put themselves through them if they did not believe that they had in Port information or to convey to the Senate\nShe basically said that she thought it was her civic duty on until I found I found her presentation I found her\nA willingness to say I

John Frederick showed John term\n\nAll right John John triggers radio network great to have you with us hey it's being my time you'll be in my debts don't forget across all our John triggers affiliates this weekend again it's secret stadium that's in home what\nAlabama where they take on the Sanford bulldogs don't want to miss that's not one minute of it right because you never know me and my eyes and every game now\nAnd they're very exciting football team\nTo watch their at Sanford this week although Archie that's her own five yeah they have had three just nail biter one after the other losing by three to ...\nTo E. T. S. you a couple of weeks ago then the fifty two hundred fifty game Western Carolina then last week Mercer\nOr they were in until the final minutes and they put a lot of football up for you a lot on the score boarding they're never out of the game and\nCoach walking I was with us and I got this often just rocking I mean look if you're thinking of my fat you'd never telling you see the day with is a very young team where they're putting up fifty and thirty eight points a game\nAnd these are not at the end of the game right this is very into the final minutes\nAnd ... although there are only five they're going to start to uh get some of these W coming up maybe this week at Stanford the er Sanford dogs one and for a win for in the conference joining us now coach Scott walking habit of eating and Mike you that's head coach great to have you been\nGetting beyond John okay look these games man there is so exciting I Can't wait until a Saturday\nTo put my on my key that's\nOn and I I'm just amazed and I\nGot to give credit where do I know you're always five to ... you know when you're going to give me the speech about winning and all that stuff that I get all that but what this is coach just exciting football and you're starting all these other class men I mean you've got something going on man\nOr I think we got a really good job recruiting we just got to be hurting a meeting yeah they were in the Bible you can you know recruiting can be very unique and it takes a little bit of time to learn it and I think the staff to buy it you know\nHow to figure it out that way to go out of business on the road recruiting and we got some really good young players that are contributing\nAll it was definitely my old to do so um I don't know if you follow Mike Leach on Twitter you know he had a great quote on balance you know balance is not ... percent Ron it's not fifty percent passed it it's getting your skill players all five of on the ball and then\nIn a balanced manner and I think we do that and then he acquainted it to the ... all kinds of doing that and then it's true you know in the ... often quarterback pulled back to have\nBack them both receivers of a chance to touch the ball and then in ... off and running back in the for receivers in horse quarterback I'll get a chance to touch the ball and we got a lot of guys catch the ball making plays and they know the ball and I'm going in any way so they're playing at a faster\nLevel and we like like bath\nAnd now the ball a bunch because we felt the advantage we have to be a motto is we can be mentally and physically better condition than our own assault going a hundred wave the game is to just walk off\n[noise] okay so in last week's gay and that was another great game and in another pretty gritty offensive performance fire team you're young quarterback you density\nThrows for another four hundred plus yours for thirty yards and yet twenty first first I was in this game Nineteen and I'm coming on the parents but\nYou got you got nine for South on the ground so I mean you can't see the team's not balanced you can just tell ... yards when you need them but I'm\nThe level of sophistication in this offsets um\nAs you as you you run your various teams is pretty impressive in and or the other thing is you did skiing is throwing everybody right I mean you've got like six or seven receivers involved in this involving assault that's\nCorrect yeah that's the designers irritate movie um deepens gives us again it's very similar to her blog some football [noise] it's just throwing the ball the spot person who's reading it died old back in pitching the ball I think it's more exciting for the fans because they see the ball the whole time and it definitely\nHelped us in recording because uh we can find a lot of guys that like to run and cats and a lot of guys like the role the ball biting running quarterback that can also growing up keep the defense honest is it very difficult nowadays because everybody's looking for that guy\nWith you know all the art you owe teams and those are all ... teams so the guys that are kind of get left out or the guys like read that you know maybe you're a little bit like maybe there was one or two deep facts that Clemson or somebody doesn't want them but they're ... and we can find those guys and ah I think it's playing dividends this season off at school [noise]\nUh there's no question a let's let's get to the game coming coming up this week\nAnd this is a winnable game no question I mean Sanford's having their good team that they're having some struggles also or they're always pretty tough at home though going Alex Alabama I'm how you prepare\nJohn So we're not we're not playing Saturday and now we got Stanford and then we've got the the citadel the following the lead salt everywhere else I'd been on an opening week you take the next two opponents which you're going to play and\nYou kind of divided up the practice time so we get young men on Monday off other than film study and ah lifting weights was very impressed one of our receivers gave on lower on the\nPlane Ninety five plays having a hundred and fifty yards and the touchdown on ten catch me as a went in there and set a new PR for a squad max on Monday by ten pounds [noise]\nGeorge More did as well Austin barrette did so we had three guys said PR as you know during the season on on squads which is a testament to the job they Mormons doing it in our weight room but we're taking this week working on being the best are getting better hey what we need to improve\n\nThey got you know input on what they saw me as compared to and then worked on what I Need to work at it and what style of leadership\nOr would be most effective at at a place like the mind because there are several different styles of leadership all are effective at different places and you know everybody's got an actual band and sometimes your natural bend of leadership [noise] can be trained or tweet or\nYou know coach into a better way for the people that you were coaching so you know read a lot of books I'm I'm a leadership the first one and I actually had the alumni he didn't\nGive his name so I couldn't send my bank you then be two other books that I've read on a multiple Belgian plus other reading articles and I've been working with pat on my own to\nImprove myself as a head coach how I respond to my assistance with you know give me a suggestion or something how respond acquires making a mistake [noise] um\nAnd the ultimate way to do that based on my personality and there [noise]\nThat I tell you what that is a fascinating way to um look at things and obviously having success when their\nCoach Scott walking I meant tells you might see that football my two deaths they get a week off the swing then they go to Sanford and boy I'm looking forward to that same then home against the Senate always great to have him in great\nTo have you

North America the president is just an amazing guy because he actually keep the promises that he may ... concept for a politician and\nHe promised back in June twenty six [noise] he would renegotiate that NAFTA the\nNAFTA is now dead now have the U.S Mexico candidate agreement and it's great news uh for workers in manufacturing industry as well as farmers and innovators we go through some of the some of the elements of it if you want but yes top line is great for America [noise]\nLet me start with I I Want to get to the elements and as you know [laughter] you know as well because he talked many times I hated it NAFTA from day one I was one of the only Republicans a\nRailing in opposition to it when it first came out and I always said that Ross Perot at the end of the day he was corking but he had that sucking sound that nailed that's exactly what happened so I never thought that was the day what it would go and so to me a Sunday night with like Christmas but\nI Would say that the un on Wednesday or and so I just want you to spend two minutes on this and then we can get to the specifics of the deal so that's the I I was in New York on Wednesday was at the president's alive press conference that was fascinating\nBecause somebody asked him about his negotiations there with a Canada and he and one of the questions\nWas a a prime minister Trudeau asked for meeting your ... your turn it down is that true and he said absolutely and then he said not only that I turn the meaning down I've instructed might trade team to stop negotiating with Canada they're not shooting in good faith\nUh I don't appreciate how they're going about their they don't understand the stakes here and so I've told them we're going to\nMexico and maybe they'll come back to the ...\nThat was when Sunday night you get a deal why after\nMao Ninety nine percent\nOf the deal was done based on a framework laid down with the the Mexico deal member a some weeks ago\nWe entered into a bilateral with Mexico and that he had all the high notes hit ... uh in the manufacturing space a strong domestic content and the cars we bill renting it hit\nMarket access for agricultural products you hit the notes for protecting digital trade and so called biologics which are pharmaceuticals [noise]\nUh at at the modern the end of the spectrum that we were still a little a little part on a couple of things like dairy and some dispute resolution mechanisms\nAre and I yeah I I said this on the air on TV and radio you know I was puzzled why was taking so long to get too I'm In agreement that really benefited all three countries so I mean at the end of the day like in this to a boxing\nMatch where we're a lot of punches I get thrown but at the matches over now that all three parties raised up their hands and and trying and I'm like that thing that that that abomination that they signed in Nineteen Ninety four for NAFTA [noise] um this is actually\nGood for America what a concept [noise] I Know\nWith Grassley cannot make these things public I mean whatsoever in there the centers can sing it and they can vote and they can vote their conscience if they don't like it vote now if he goes down so be it but to make these public it's a very dangerous precedent [noise] I don't I I wouldn't want to do it for sort of my ear\nI wouldn't want to do it for Ruth Bader Ginsburg I wouldn't want to do it for judge Kavanaugh it's a bad precedent I mean there's got to be some level of privacy in this world [noise]\nAnd and getting them out and it'll get leaked somebody will make it but it's certainly shouldn't come from the Senate Judiciary committee and actually I Hope it's not really because it's very dangerous [noise]\nWe all get background checks there's all if if you're working and and the federal government depending on your level you are going to get a background check from the FBI you really want all of that public like at a public filed a unique go search the Internet\nNow in contrast Senator Cornyn of Texas said there just needs to be some sort of public statement\nIt's not the reports themselves well it's kind of leak out because the Denver the Senate Democrats if there's anything negative and they're like you had Fifteen beers one day that's that's gonna lake\nI don't see making a file public is a good idea [noise] corn and what\nNot to say that since the accusations have in the Republican seems to me that people\nAre not going to be satisfied until some public statement about what the FBI investigation show doesn't matter what it shows that the Democrats are going to criticize they're going to they're going to interpret it in a different way it doesn't matter the hope this whole thing doesn't matter\nIt doesn't matter what the FBI comes back with unless they found corroborating evidence beyond doubt and that's something I'm an Asian or what ever they have in that report the Democrats will refuse it it's not long enough that it's not big enough they didn't do enough people there's other people to interview there's other witnesses they haven't done it\nThe White House managed it it's a sham\nWe need another week it doesn't matter what it comes back what you do with the Democrats are going to say a cabin on the bottom line is this guy that died every\nSingle ... every single one so the question becomes then where do you go from here so this report is going to come out today or tomorrow\nIt's going to go to the Senate Judiciary committee that's going to go to the full Senate because everybody has to see it in order to vote on it

reporting on print teams are safe toward that were actually beginning to find out that she hasn't been truthful about a number of things and by the way she was under oath and that committee rum as wires\nBrett Kavanaugh so to the extent that ever either one of them told something that was not true that is under penalty of perjury and you know I think it's becoming clear that all the things she told us a lot of equipment and may not have been true and\nTook quote Richard Blumenthal astonishingly one\nUntruth does indeed undermine a person's credibility and if she lied about the polygraph if she lied about travel who knows what else he lied about I think it's third stories get out and I I doubt that you're going to see him in the New York times that anytime soon I I think their narratives going to change\n[noise] okay so what happens on Saturday leader McConnell saying look we were going to have\nA vote I Believe it's going to be on Saturday and respect the FBI report to be released what either tonight or early tomorrow so those senators will have a chance to look at it assuming there's nothing in it that is a bomb shelter some corroborating evidence in their report what happens on Saturday\nI Would hope but it is really only hope at this point [noise] that Republicans mustard their inner fortitude and vote for Brett Kavanaugh thereby ensuring a shift to the right on the Supreme Court which of course what all this mayhem is about for the for example future this is a very\nImportant Supreme Court choice and the nomination and an confirmation because it will indeed impact our country that liberal progressive agenda that has merely windmill along with U.S Supreme court for many years it's about to end\nAnd doesn't go through it obviously it comes down to play Collins and Murkowski I think both Collins and Murkowski will vote for Kavanaugh if there is nothing in that report fake\nI have no idea he is compromised but at the end of the day he portrays himself and in fact his ratings than voting records show he\nIs a conservative who is he really willing to squander it possibly unique opportunity to put a conservative on the court and guarantee is I take quite a few years of conservative bias on the court\nIs he willing to throw that away or because he's so eager to be the loved by the left I have no idea the man is so full of hatred for Donald Trump than it appears he'll go to any lengths whatsoever to confront him but honestly I Would be shocked if he votes against him\nWell where are we differ on that he's going to vote now yeah it'd be obsolete he wants to be lying in the New York times and the Washington Post or some kind of the Republican hero\nOf our time and so you got to write a book and the whole thing and and make a lot of money he's going to vote now it really comes down to Collins and Murkowski there'll be no it was just this is no secret and um I Would be personally shocked if there's nothing in this report and Collins voted no I\nI just could not even seeing her getting on TV and try to explain it\nBecause she never says anything stupid I mean if you follow suit in college like I Do I Love following her because every time she speak just like okay that makes it even if you don't have I think\nYou're right I don't think she have any grounds for doing it and she has to have to open mind from the start and she has basically said unless something's surface you know there's no reason not to vote for him what do you think about Murkowski\nI could not imagine if college to tell the least she's going to vote yes yeah that Lisa Murkowski all alone in Alaska sinking this nomination and seeking the state of the last\nTwo years of the Trump Administration up to twenty twenty\nBecause it'll it'll destroyed the Republican Party as we know it I Can't get Trump voters out and neither can anybody else if this guy goes down with no weapons I Wish there is evidence that's different than the\nGreater than it is way rain so that is older than her hands and\nKnow how you take somebody down where there is no evidence because and then you basically read more than the Democrats\nYeah that I think it's almost the most offensive part of that scenario I totally agree will show boating self promoting a heinous behavior the lack of decorum the lack of decency Dianne Feinstein sitting on there is in her Mason\nThings are going to come down I sure as heck hope not and I think I agree I think Mitch McConnell is the other\nA card in this attack Mitch McConnell has been absolutely\nFerocious about getting judges on the Supreme Court and lower court he has made it his cars he has basically\nRefused to put through a lot of other a senior administration officials who are awaiting confirmation because judges have been his priority and I think he's very smart to do it I think he's ... I mean the Republicans across the country should be applauding us because\nNothing more than the judicial branch needed to repair it more than that and I so I think it's incredibly important but he's doing that um and I think he will get mccaskey\nAnd colon set a room and promised them the moon politically or if they go along with this and I don't mean that he should have to because as you point out if there is no evidence to support any of these charges shame on them\nFor even wavering mean whether you got drunk and high school or not what we know now is Steven briar was arrested for underage drinking that\nDidn't seem to stop his confirmation and yes it's not necessarily equivalent\nBut let's get a grip here folks and look at what we know about this man what we know is it for Thirty years he has behaved with unbelievable dignity integrity a decorum he has had no charges ever leveled against him like anything like that as an adult so on the other side\nOf that nature we have hundreds of opinion said people things so highly of that they are frequently used as a reference point in a other judgments and other argument legal arguments this man deserves a place on the\nSupreme Court I really hope it gets there\nOkay we're we're teaching to tribute to\nThe the newspaper the hill and also the hill on line at all so far and she has a new column called Trump's America First policy scores a big win with a new NAFTA deal also lists I Love your website I Love the way we're\n[laughter] me in a good mood really\nAgain I I have to say it's a kind of thing that you know you put off doing for like years because it's just too much trouble but I appreciate that thank you know I like it it's\nWeird I I also like I don't know if I can say this on the radio I guess I should just have your feedback was were were friends but\nI also love the way uh your name is at the top and what does that cold when you're writing it much thought it was a script script yeah not a script and very soft and it also matches address you have\nAll that is on the same um like blue so it just works\nIn the kitchen and I appreciate that more than you know I Would\nA pass it on my helper who basically pushes me to do everything that's constructive and pushed me to\nRich lover [laughter] well thank you [laughter] I have that\nThank you for having me on I gotta run [noise] always trying to talk to you pretty\nLet's pick thanks for being with us Steve Bannon coming up at\nFive Cuba right here on the John for his radio network that have you with us and also sheriff Clarke will be joining us seven thirty five plus your calls got a couple of text year that I can read\nA real fast I got about why we got about a half a minute and let's get to this Jeremy in Chesapeake says what all of us has shown me is that we have an issue with using the justice system to legislate\nInstead of the legislative branch doing the job that might be the point to great cabinet so it was written opinions are not\nUse is a scorched earth policy\nMight be the plan\nI don't think it matters once you've confirmed it doesn't matter what you think of it it doesn't matter I mean you saw that with the Clarence Thomas he is he is a storm or George from Newport News [noise]\nYou'd never passed out drinking beer because you drink rolling rock it's a cheap beer drinker real clear he says and you will blackout\nRolling rock that's my brand John's records radio network trucks you stay with us\nIt shouldn't be about it shouldn't be that it should be about the cost to sit in the American people show like because we were slain Danny to families to come out\nFor that it did [noise] for him and of course that's like really bad as it gets them which I don't think there will be at least at least you know [noise] [noise]\nYou know that's a great\nWhere's the Bush family wears George Bush where's the Laura Bush where's all the places where Jeb Bush nowhere to gain nowhere to be found not one of them you're right\nWhere\nWhere's the Bush family does anybody know yeah there there's there's certainly not shy about criticizing President Trump when they don't like somebody does right they jumped right into that ... I mean they got time change but [noise]\nI don't want to ask you is that is awesome I was like a perfect person to run that [noise]\nIt should it takes me I Would have answered that question I also\nDon't text and drive your good never I tell you what you're the\nThank you because we're the places where they don't want to be found not up to Canada not think you're right I can show man\nCame back All right joining us now former sheriff Milwaukee County as senior advisor to\nAmerica First policies action sheriff David Clarke hey Sean Clark great to have you back man\nTakes a lot then loaded listeners again\nCheryl I'm actually I kinda\nI kinda get your comment\nMatt just said from Richmond what are the four corners you just heard that he said look this whole confirmation process with judge Kavanaugh he worked in the Bush White House so did his wife where is the question what do you think\nWhat we're talking we're talking about politics in politics don't expect anybody to have your back you can't trust anybody in this political from this goes to Washington DC so when you ask where are the bushes hiding somewhere on the other is hiding somewhere\nTrying to figure out a hate on Trump's more what's going on with gene pool but you know like I said you know it's sort of thing in politics you have to have your own back don't expect anybody to yours\nOkay so\nLook some of the some of the comments that are being made by the left are appalling\nOf course it doesn't get any play in the media you can imagine sheriff Clarke if Republicans were saying any of this stuff but um you know we've we've got this one a lady in in Georgetown here in Washington DC where I\nSays that white genial ... senators deserve miserable that's after Kavanaugh like hearing\nThat she did a profanity laced Twitter tirade against Kavanaugh calling him a rapist and a perjury her she described the Republicans as a a death coal and filthy swine and she's teaching at Georgetown University\nWhat's the Daily Show\nYou know what the deal is here to get away with whatever they want and then when something mild is by somebody in our society they go through I mean look at this this whole shooter assistant dean at Catholic university says something queen some things\nThat got suspended by the university and she has a right to do that but at the same time what you said was not near nothing close to what a\nYou know some of the language used by\nThe people on the left and you know our site blood say her son is qualify that the conservatives there were tired of the tactics used by the left but instead of sitting back in and whining what we need\nTo do it you know and getting outrageous what we need to do is to find better counter measures counter strategies to deal with this stuff more effective once when I see\nDifferent kinds of strategies because to sit back and pointed out is one thing and that needs to be done because the line with me they won't do their job\nOn the other day I'm ... Ford Mustang\nGet there was the guy from Fox News will go wire that was Sam ... a little bit of a little over the top there's no doubt about that fire but then you look at the New York times higher that one woman who said she hated white man don't say get away with whatever they want to\nOne of the ways that we can counter that at ground level in fighting back is to make sure that we get\nThis judge Brett Kavanaugh confirmed this job one any people to stay focused on\nThe task and it's getting just\nKevin all come from a new one he's been put through and he said it best I think when he said this thing it's turned into a joke I Wonder if these senators on the Senate Judiciary committee and I'm Talking about both GOP at a Democrat that one of the proud\nOf themselves as to how they conducted this search and destroy mission which is another thing another crazy that took Kevin argues that's what it's become a bomb you know this man\nIt's been put through enough his family's been through enough this cruel and unusual punishment is I'm as far as I'm concerned that is prohibited by the eighth amendment to the constitution to all these constitutional issues\nThat are involved in this um [noise]\nYou know guilty before proven innocent of the root of due process is trash the rule of law has been thrown out we live in a country where you don't have to prove your innocence but all of a sudden now when it comes to judge Kevin how you got to ... and it's in these charges so this whole thing has been passed\nOr dies I say enough is enough I was disappointed when Chuck Grassley initially move that date from September twenty fifth and he moved to the uh the Thursday and then they moved again you're all trying to appease the Democrats nothing's going to have peace them you see what they're doing now the Democrats\nCome up with a list of twenty five people they want interview\nTheir job I don't know if if if I Know what kind of understand that he said it in the\nSenate or the other day but you know appeasing the Democrats and well why John think about this three senators clique\nMurkowski income was reportedly wonder the president said hey we need political cover to fold why don't you just do this this ah FBI investigations so we can get by this when ... why would you need political cover to do the right thing but see that's what politics in the squad has become\nThe doing the right thing would have just been holding the vote but in any political cover I think the sick\nSheriff Clarke uh I really appreciate what you're saying and sharing that perspective because I hadn't thought of it that way\nAnd you're right and what happened here's the problem with being in DC all the time like me is you take that for a grain of salt because it is kind of the way to swap\nCell or I never really reacted to that but your one hundred percent I target why would you need political cover to vote for somebody who has false allegations against him and I say they're false because they're not proven they're not\nThere's no witnesses and the ...\n... or refuted it so you're right sheriff Clarke what political cover did need for that\nThey don't need that you just need look there's there's no evidence and it's incredible and\nI think are just like it's going to vote no he's he's he's got some and\nI said this earlier today it's got some imaging his head where he's going to be you know why and I was going to be the darling of the New York times and it'll be you know featured on CNN has some great free thinker or something\nSo it really comes down to a Collins and Murkowski I mean that's what it comes down to why do you think they're going to do on Saturday sheriff Clarke\nWell I don't know what to think in terms of what they're going to do this people it flip\nFlop around they don't vote their conscience it's really hard to say I mean we all thought John McCain made some rest in peace was going to vote to eliminate\nObamacare and he came in there\nAnd cats the deciding vote to keep it alive so it's hard to see these these politicians you don't know where they're coming from and it's all of them are in the swamp and and you know they murdered by the minutes in terms of Collins and Murkowski probably whoever gets to where we're going to vote\nYou know what that that that might very well be it so I guess you could say it's the FBI Reid for his release we think it'll it it could be this evening early tomorrow if there's nothing in it and they have the whatever his political cover they needed\nAnd you would think this nomination would go through 'em let me just ask you this if it doesn't go through what type of the fact you think that's going to have sheriff David Clarke on Republican turnout on November six only thirty three days away\nAnd that's a good effect because political critique is setting and John you know that yes we've done everything we again conservatives voters the base with everything we've been asked to do we elected Donald Trump president United States has not been alone from the one", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Laura Ingraham Show", "city": "Portsmouth", "day": "03"}
