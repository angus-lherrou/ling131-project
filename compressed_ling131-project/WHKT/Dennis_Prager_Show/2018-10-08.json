Chevy disappearing things about Yemen that the U.S needs to react\nTo Yemen I don't think the people who are saying that really other than maybe a save the children really care about children in Yemen they're more interested in about disrupting the relations between the U.S presidents and Saudi Arabia [noise]\nYou're on the John surgeries radio network truck insurance across America\nLive Washington DC where west Edward Iranian our man in the middle east been with us since we started eight years ago and he is based in Cairo, Egypt so lesson and\nThe bigger geo political situations here but\nThe guy missing\nHe's based in Virginia and he works for the Washington Post and he's a little a gym journalist and nobody knows where he is I'm going to get to our um Interpol executive in a moment nobody knows where he is you've got the the president calling on\nNBS Mohammed bin Salman that solving the Saudi prince calling on him to pay off a\nFor a bigger percentage of the defense and protection that we provide him he just over the weekend he said no he wasn't going to do that you've also got the\nPresident mad because he's continued to raise OPEC prices while in Trump's mind or the U.S government has funded their defense so he's pissed about that so you got a lot\nOf things at play here but let's get off the geopolitics get back to the journalist I mean my question again is where is it and if he was abducted you know don't you think David ministries should should back channel it and find out\nIs and what happened to him based on the fact that you know he works for an American company and he lived in um northern Virginia\nI'm sure they're doing that right now I I Hope they're doing that right now if I were secretary of state Pompeo I wouldn't be doing that right now I I I that that is my assumption\nJust to follow up us relations with Saudi Arabia knowing that he works for the Washington Post then knowing that the Trump Administration isn't a bad position would have to react and knowing\nEspecially considering that you got all these media organizations that have made that are close to a computer and and um the Democrats were were were making a lot of noise about Yemen and before that because they were saying that the U.S\nMust stop supporting Saudi Arabia militarily I mean that wouldn't follow up relations with Saudi Arabia oh from the get go and not um you know I I I couldn't possibly divorces from the political implications of it [noise]\nOkay so we don't know\nWhere he is your contending that let's not jump to conclusions you may be fine and this may be part of the bigger picture or maybe he's in the hands of someone else then abducted him\nAnd then send it on the Saudis to her of course are saying that he left the embassy but they can't show footage of him leaving the embassy because they have generally if you're constantly you're getting me in cameras all over the place or you have to do was released the footage shows and leaving and then they have a good day I don't\nWhat happened to them not all travel you know things now produce that that's a problem\nYes that's right I agree with you on and I I I'm dismayed about this too but like I have heard from the Egyptians and obviously they um our allies in Saudi Arabia and they don't want to say anything bad about Saudi Arabia their their argument basically that that you know people in the Egyptian system I I've spoken with said that\nThe Saudi an intelligent people are not that stupid that they would knock him off um and I I think that's\nThat's true and there are a lot of their theory is that a lot of that there are other parties that would have wanted to follow up relations between Saudi Arabia and the U.S that would have um you know wouldn't would not have thought twice about stopping to kill someone like democracy okay assuming that's what happened which we don't know\n[noise] okay so I'm your advice here is waiting to see don't jump to conclusions I get that I'll take that\nFor what it stands for let's get to the China Interpol situation right so we've got the\nOf Interpol who was a Chinese national goes to China and now he gets the rest of\nIt's inconceivable to me that he wouldn't even gone\nI mean why do you go there to protect yourself at risk you know if you go there there's there's a high chance you gonna get abducted by the communist government\nSo my question is why on earth to do\nWhat happens now\nAccording to all the media reports he is a government official he's the deputy intelligence minister I think at some point someone who's a government official is obliged to return to this country um as a matter of course whether he likes it or not um although I mean he could have\nHe he could have resigned from that position or he could have resigned I mean he could have remained in France\nThe French are very upset about that\nThe calculated risk and he thought something could happen but you know hope that wouldn't turn down\nAnd got caught um [noise] as a sad situation obviously the Chinese government was very proud to name him or have him name I had to enter called so clearly what whatever it is that they have against them has to be very\nPowerful for them to do that considering that they were proud of having their own national as the head of Interpol\nSo uh you're right I mean that's that's good that's good now so they were they were very happy that he was named the deposition um\nIt comes back and now they've arrested him for what did they say a\nCorruption bribery and things of that nature so\nWhenever they've got him on whatever you did that they didn't like you're just a must be thing because you know they they didn't really want to give up that that session of authority they had I mean look being being in the head of vinegar Interpol in France\nAnd claim your audience how big of a position [noise]\nWell it is a bit Mario in terms of the actual cloud that he has I mean he doesn't run in the day to day operations at the bottom of the people who are putting out the warring and things like that\nUm but he is a publicly highly public visible person who would get a great deal play in Europe in the media um and do clearly Ito gives a positive impression of China to\nThe world um to at least the European audience in America are probably of the American media doesn't cover him that well but he he is well covered in France [noise] um yeah I mean he's\nGot a ... and this one of the worries when he was named in two thousand sixteen was that he could possibly have an influence on rounding up Chinese dissidents across the world that has been proven to be the case so far as we know\nUm but as I said because he doesn't have the day to day operations in hand\nSo let's get back to the ownership let's get back to ... and the Saudis issue wasting Edward make a prediction how do you see it playing out\nI'm I'm I'm hoping to find him that he will surface in Riyadh and that they will be ... be holding on to him and that they will be willing to release them after all this pressure as they did\nOr what the former with the Lebanese prime minister Saad Hariri went right or detained him maybe six to eight months ago I guess right beginning of the year yeah so I'm hoping that's what happened\nOr goes there will play out and where it's great to have your perspectives and certainly a different perspective than we've gotten from other\nLegacy media and certainly the Washington Post New York times are going to be over\nAdam Schiff head of Democratic House in cell

Lincoln Graham during a camera now nearing he put it very eloquently I probably would I Can't believe I'm quoting Lindsey Graham\nI mean it shows you the way the Republican Party has changed right yeah no more John McCain and will back to uh and we don't want the party of Trump\nFelicity Graham said the Democrats\nWant our God help us I Hope they don't get it and what they did the cabinet now was a dress rehearsal for not only what they're going to do to Donald Trump or what they're going to do to everyone and anyone associated with him\nOn anyone from any White House advisor can anybody who worked on the campaign to the business associates they will all be cold and\nThey will try to end up this president um God Forbid if they win that God Forbid if they win the second I think that's tight in fact that they may try to do teach in a trial\nOf a cabinet now I don't know the the house can do with the baby will look to um forcibly take those articles teachers will pass through a Democratic House\nBy the time of which will be a historical ... will be the second half of the first term president and his um obviously fighting a fight so both parties have ignored with China that both parties\nI'm not trying to do with North Korea ah you know trying to read and read and re strengthen the middle east from the damage left over\nFrom the sheer cracks in of Iran Iraq Obama\nWas all too happy to help promote um they're going to shop around the world stage and and they're nice thank God help us because the Democratic state should not have time or they they used to when the time and time again if you remember two thousand nine to two thousand ... we were in water like party by\nAmerican came together the Tea Party movement and\nNot even my first choice not your first choice but I counted out not come out and given that response in his opening statement after reports testimony you would have had he probably would not have it right and he would he would have had something where the politics of destruction\nWhere you're allowed to use each group court\nAnd it sounded like you know it sounded like cops and it's funny to you know I say bowler who didn't so why shouldn't act like put them in jail in political enemies and trying to undo election but\nThe Democrats who you know very they're very they're very tough against Russia don't you know I think that one day a day off so they were acting like a Russian a Soviet communists mom you know mom trial Chinese pull up euro against\nAgainst common out so I think that that was very important is now from a political point of view\nObviously this is a win for the Republicans the issue is do we maintain and where are we ... we had in Detroit now we remember why we realize why why does selection is important to remember what happened now shows he could have it wasn't only about the Supreme Court wasn't about time but now\nIt was about the direction of the country we wanted and if there was about to elections matter or you know what the Democrats\nTake over the house in the Senate and really throw this country into disarray so we'll find out for that point of view from a strictly political point of view him remains an open book we don't know yet\nWell look\nYou're right because one of the the the only apprehension\nI have is that uh the Republicans who were very fired up\nRight now by the time we get the the end of the next twenty nine days see how the hell that uh we get we got the guy we wanted to kind of forget about it\nSo you you've got to keep them far enough no doubt because this like you're saying saying this is this is the most critical midterm election in our history I mean\nI Know a lot of Republicans were fired up about Obamacare and I remember I corners calling me up when the Supreme Court past are saying that it was the end of the Republican and it was like okay it's a tax I mean you know you get a tax you don't have a tax\nIt it was just policy it's no big you know we didn't like it but it was attacked so why this is quite different maybe because now you're talking about the direction of the country um\nGive me the biggest loser in all this\nKind of the biggest loser [noise] [noise] I think I think the biggest loser one unfortunately are women who have been abused now look I'm getting pretty tough on Dr record\nMhm um I was much tougher and I made a point when I spoke about it even two weeks ago on your show and thank you for having me on a lot it's an honor but I said I thought she was line [noise] um I don't know what happened to her\nHouse going Brett Kavanaugh out\nJogging has mental problems but the biggest loser\nBeen courting and entertainment industry in the news industry likes to point out mostly attendance Democrats but these are minor details are pretty good I Would say I love her but she was used in the way they said she wanted to keep the confidential\nShe didn't want to go to Congress remember she looked at her lawyers when she won Grassley said you know that we could have gone to California just shows you that this really has stopped because I didn't care about her\nThe Democrats didn't care about what actually may have happened to her well did Democrats were I just wanted to throw the kitchen sink in the worst kind of way\nTo address this what are you surprised that look what you're talking to somebody who frankly and I said there are some people want to criticize it I don't really care I dealt in part to resume\nI have a birth read them I was born in the United states I mean of course can produce probably I think he's real problem with the issue is that the politics of the presidential politics and stuff for a lecture is what they did here\nWas they went out to sea can destroy someone and in the worst possible once again so I think that's really the biggest loser Democrats don't mean by law armed\nThere will be very fires they're raising a lot of money as well um I think it's pretty clear
