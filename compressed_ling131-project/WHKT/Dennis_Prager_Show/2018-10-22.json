idea that we need days and days of investigation uh and forensic work and it's ridiculous\nThere was what do you think it's great to have you on the John from the radio network\nCompany live today from West Palm Beach Florida Florida one of the biggest states that has a Senate race\nIt is very close Rick Scott the governor has pulled even our ahead in some polls of incumbent Democrat Bill Nelson men expected Bill Nelson to have ... time to get reelected here it's not going to happen we're predicting\nPaid for and she did not have a response to that because there is not one Democrat and do all the spending Republicans blocked up the military or for our national defence and that's it all the rest of our approach to build a within the bounds\nBut the Democrats plus up every single program every item because it's paid to play up at the the everybody knows it right if you say yes everyone out there they send you a check\nAnd that's why Abigail Spanberger is getting to point two

neutral\nAnd there's not promised that the people anything that she's going to do that I Know she came up with health care now she slipped on that because it was everybody thought it was a terrible idea\nAnd so but that's the Democrats nature nationwide there was a great political piece a couple of days ago just do a lot of people want to go see it on the nine points up the Democrat but many people as liberal agenda and it's not a policy agenda I urge everybody go take a look at it\nYou're on the John from his radio network where with incumbent Republican congressman Dave Brat from the seventh congressional district that's central Virginia and he's in a tight\nBattle for re election to a third term against a very well funded democratic challenger Abigail span for this will be decided along with all the other ... germs in fourteen days on November sex early voting\nIs already underway in Virginia costs but let's get back to the caravan and seven thousand people did not is it not unreasonable for a average people to see this and think okay if the seven thousand people are allowed to come in and\nBreaks our laws are just coming to the United states what what stops in next caravan from being Seventy thousand people or the one after that from being seven ... seven hundred thousand people I mean what would be the deterrent\nIf they're simply allowed to I'm Jane a basically seen them mob status and just overrun the authorities in and come in as you've seen them do in Mexico what would what would stop the second ...\nNot that not that the exactly the point right that's why we need e verify ... and the green light right once you have an aunt just eat for a promise to amnesty the whole world wants to come to the richest country on the face of the earth with a rich benefit package right and so once\nYou let down your guard at your picture right just picture President Obama in charge\nRight now with all those in charge and Abigail Spanberger in charge and what what they do and you know what the answer is there'll be total chaos folks\nFlooding in their natural signal to the whole world hate they guardian right they got an extra green light let's go right and so I thank\nGoodness the president's ... some strong signal\nThat Congress has got to set up some strong signal a we had a good laugh bill that that you dealt with the DACA kids I had a bill with Senator Cruz to deal with the uniting the parents of kids at the border we all compromise on that Democrats that no\nReasonable compromise because they want open borders cheap labor ...\n... you know get sanctuary cities and just look at Nancy\nPelosi right look at San Francisco they gotta they gotta make sure he studies the city is in decay right now go Google San Francisco everybody look at it and that's what they want to bring to Richmond and it's already starting to happen\nIn power the already not just idea like in policy\nWell San Francisco has the seventh largest population in the United states and the third largest homeless population are and that is growing and I'm pretty sure it's going to be rivaling Los Angeles as we know\nAh the estimates are about twenty five thousand people at night are homeless in Los Angeles a sleeping under bridges and drain pipes that's a lot of people and San Francisco rivaling that\nAccomplishment I Want to get to a wedding exactly a Jew I mean I've asked this question a number of times to pose that you also the Caribbean is coming they've caught to Mexico and it's becoming the president says I'm going to stop it I might send the military there\nWe've already gone through the zero tolerance policy and that was a public relations disaster so what I mean there's not time to enact anything in in in eight days and it's going to happen you guys aren't even in section\nSo what should the president to how does he stop at like what exactly when he says I Want to send the military they were in close the border what does that mean\nYou can be stopped by the defense or ... you know to where they started a folk\nCare are coming through out but more importantly we have a lot of leverage over Mexico right and that's where it's got to be done to president Mexico was already a hundreds and hundreds of law enforcement a two week and then pick off\nSome of the folks and send\nThem back home already and I think that the primary loop that's what happened last time\nWe got to send our own resources to send the wrong signal\nOur that our our border is secure and and obviously you need to build a wall and put up security measures to keep this threat from happening and and people say walls don't work and all that kind of thing\nCan you imagine the difference if you had a wall versus what we have day and die ... it's the fact that the left is so hard and against it is is almost the evidence itself that they know what will be effective right if they thought it wouldn't be a fact that they just wanted to go ahead and do it but they know\nThat would be effective in and they don't want it so we need all the above we we have good a wine for spent on the book and we just need to enforce it and so that's that's the play golf\nCarts review and texture American Richmond who's in your district he says I'm In the seventh district if I were to go to the ER and not pay I'd be chasing the end of the earth and threatened with every type of legal action imaginable\nAnd anywhere garnish my wages since double standard is just crazy I mean isn't this one of the issues for average people struggling to pay their bills\nYeah no that's that's right you traced because he's a citizen these records from the book with her parents he's got an income stream [noise] that is that the feds have\nBy the Irish have all his personal information in terms of income what he's made and that's the whole point that's the total unfairness of citizens versus non citizen citizens are on the hook for everything that the non citizens do illegally\nAnd ... it's eighty percent issue right I mean it is the number one\nA polling Republican issue right now\nAnd that after they they ... the last show that the tactics their ears and they're using them in my district right the left just the way in businesses one after the other downside\nStealing private property or and you know leaving\nCareful notes on my own ... that was widely reported and so the American people see the choice right\nThe economy's growing we've got a strong America First policies in foreign policy at the border and the alternative by ear phone think of all to me it's just simply on think why not I do have people coming our way now right the Republicans are all coming home\nIndependence are breaking our way up for the cabinet story and so in the end I think the uh Virginia people are going to do the right thing\nPunishment I have a minute I have I have a minute or the show he affair we're going to get more information or the Turkish government is saying the next several weeks of MPs was involved in this\nOr do you favor some sort of sanctions or can crush all actions in response to allegedly won it appears that the Saudis did within their own constantly\n[noise] yeah yeah absolutely you you you cannot ever since the big milk to another world leader even if they're an ally in in other respects credits like or to take\nUp there on a on it you know more than just a narrow targeted basis I think they're going to be significant and does the Congress for sure a command and back that up by a it we we have the right though that you're going to have an ally but when the airline cross the line like that you got to go from from like\nAll right we're in total agreement with that congressman Dave Brat thanks for being with us safer more information or to get involved in the campaign\nHis only have to go to Dave Brat dot com Dave Brat dot coms got the easiest website\nImaginable Jay Pratt dot com you can volunteer you

you've gotta joining us now is Sean Spicer he was the former\nPress secretary for the president of the United states is now the author of the book called the briefing politics the press and the president you can get on Amazon or your favorite book store you can go to Sean Spicer dot com and get it there\nAnd he's also a senior adviser with America First policies Shaun welcome again great to have you\nTried to John I [noise] I don't know why you're not hearing for getting it is it nice Bonnie like forty two degrees [laughter] the right time had done Florida\nI Know I heard the weather was changing so like I got to get down there and find out what's going on in the Senate race so what better time than we have the a balmy weather in Virginia and I can finally get out of the rain it is beautiful here showing no question about it okay we've we've got a\nWe've got some things I Want to go over I Want to start with a caravan coming here to ... to the United states fourteen days before the midterms sure we understand is now grown to seven thousand people to president saying or they're not going to come in it's going to close the border if need be how does this play out Sean Spicer\nOn it I think it ... it ... there's a lot of things right now it's going to get into the midterm election they're sort of that very electorate is a demonstration of what the difference between the two parties are in it you see these things happen it Chris Wise it be important to the elections he thought that to some degree\nWith this administration and having a party power similarity I think that you look at these people kind of a coming marching on up through Mexico trying to come into our border and\nThe president's been very clear about what his position is that he's going to make sure that\nWe are eight eight hundred law and order and they can't just march on into our country if they see fit\nUh I don't think the Democrats clearly have that same set of policy oriented so so you know getting back to it I think a lot of time that you into an election there are event than in circumstances that crystallized what the differences are between the two parties in various candidates as you head into an election and right now could be quicker\nSo what should uh\nWhat should the president's action thing now as they get if they if they did get through Mexico and you'd have seven thousand I mean I understand the politics of it but let's get to the policy what should the president says he's going to send the military there how would how would that work how would\nThat play and wouldn't CNN be saying okay you've got bayonets so pointed at mom's with babies that is what CNN will do\nYou know I it's just it's a it's actually a very complicated policy that I'm probably not the right person to get into it in the sense that there there's something about I think that you can send you the national guard a federalized or national ice them or or utilized certain aspects of National Guard I there is a tricky\nIssue between titled ten and titled thirty two that detail how you could use certain members of the military for domestic purposes but regardless I think that the point that he's making if he's going to figure out what it takes to do that\nPut them along the border and make sure that people can't cross over a but there is an obligation for anyone to make sure that we're ... for any president especially this when he's made it so clear with his priorities are that we protect the border and we've got to make sure that people coming into our country or coming so legally incorrectly and and not with not sort of [noise] uh\nI Will eat nearly an ad they see fit this is a country of laws are eight I'm you know people are here to seek asylum I understand that we need to make sure that it's done through the cracks process\nWhere with Sean Spicer he was the former press secretary the first press secretary for President Trump and it's ... minutes raised and he's also a longtime F. O. J. that means friend of John ... us Sean\nAnd Sean is also the author of the book called the briefing politics the press and the president which you can buy on Amazon your favorite book store or you can buy it on his Web site\nGo to Sean Spicer dot com is also a senior advisor for America first policies the number one political action committee in America that supports President Trump's America First agenda\nUp showing the to show the situation and Mohamed been solving um you're in the White House at the time all a lot of our relationship with the Saudis was being discussed that was the president's first ... says it\nUh but now in the U.S has really embarrassed President Trump with uh the nonsense that's done on this or what appears to be\nWhat do you think the president does now is a it's proven to be true and\nDon't you find when NBS if he was involved in a signing off on this don't you think that was a a basically a slap in the face to the president\nI think you're absolutely right that the idea that if you're that comfortable with the relationship you feel that you can be just great and that that really salty to President Trump\nA to think that you can get away with something like this never mind whether you whether the United states you know it could be getting away with it but but especially with the relationship that this president is trying to partner with Saudi Arabia that was his first if you recall abroad because he really wanted to strengthen that relationship so\nI think that the actions that have been taken and the idea that it's taken a week or a bit ridiculous you know the guy from the get go how serious this why are they do clearly it's it's one thing when they initially claimed that they didn't know anything about it that was tough to believe\nBut the two weeks later they say well okay cause something did happen and there was a fight with that you do that two weeks ago that this is this is an unbelievably insulting stall contact\n'em and and I think that you know all the steps that they've taken has just been ... I mean the the cleaning crew sending in their team\nUm they either have to explain all of this which I think it's beyond the pale of of explaining [noise] um but right now I think the president should not just looked at in terms of the relationship that we Saudi Arabia but it's a personal insult because\nThe idea that we treated Saudi Arabia the way that we have and he made a such an amazing gesture of respect by visiting them first and the presidency\nAnd trying to foster and strengthen the relationship we have with them and this is how we get repaid\nOr the president needs to be strong in town\nI'm In agreement with that show in a hundred percent I think that is spot on a ... exactly what we've been saying for some time it is insulting there's a slap in the face and it was very disrespectful and it's kind of like hey look we're friends I've got a hundred and ten million dollar arms deal therefore I can do whatever I Want\nAnd ah I I think they're gonna find with this president that's really not the way a relationship work so\nWe'll see how that plays out she wants to myself I Want to uh I I Want to ask you about these mobs needs left wing wing moms that are going around I mean in Minnesota last week or two candidates were actually assaulted\nTwo Republican candidates were assaulted by these mobs is going all over the United states that threads through Susan Collins and others\nAre people getting chased out of um of a role ... being a being chased down some subway stairs what's the deal here\nBut look here's an interesting thing I was really not a column last week that I'm I'm a constitutional lawyer or a scholar I Can't remember which what were the closet an interesting theory which is that what he's talking about how our constitution protects the reality is if you actually read the first amendment it sent me to protect our ability to peacefully assemble\nRight and that's the key word peacefully assemble and if you think about how ...\nFor getting her anywhere else you get a permit you don't do it that's that's because you have a right to do it just doesn't give you a pin or do you do it where however you want her to think about that because\nIt all of the action from the last to get the right it is not it it we have a right to to express ourselves to we you know I address our government and our elected officials but I don't give a carte blanche to do it however we want them touching something and threatening way\nHere's the thing that I think the bigger problem to me John not only is it happening but they're actually not a deafening silence from the laugh but almost encouraged ... Nancy Pelosi Maxine Waters Chuck Schumer\nAll of the people who are leaders of their parties\nShould be standing up and saying this is on a capital you have the right to protest\nBut there is a way and it needs to be let go into a restaurant and basically threatening someone sitting there having dinner and let's be clear because for all these people on the left to go oh well they just stood in front of them went rent let them try to have that kind of tell you how it feels when you are surrounded by ten twenty thirty people\nCan't connect you to get out get out we're going to throw you out\nYou can't tell me that that doesn't make you feel threatened\nAnd that's what they're doing and I just I think the biggest thing the media is frankly ... because if this is happening on the right\nPeople would be calling for people's resignation why are you standing against that whatever good because they basically agree with them the folks from the mainstream media all sort of complex

versed in America than you on what is going on with this caravan people coming up through Mexico's from Guatemala to get into the United states\nIllegally basically flaunting some of their nose at our own laws many people like me see this as an invasion\nWe don't know who makes up to seven thousand caravan elite we know there's people that are there for economic these we also don't know what the bad actors that might be embedded in their what should we do in this situation busy\nWe should immediately deployed and military collar border and make sure not to even one of them get into the border I get into the United states look all we know that a part of the people in the caravan members of the law for example\nMiddle Easterners or we all are very aware that has a lot has major operation centers within South America to train people and how to go to the United states look at the work that out to anybody who wants to come to America to do is make your way to Mexico to pay some money to the drug cartels\nAnd you'll be smuggled into the United states and this has been going on for decades and no one president before President Trump has basically put these put down our Republican or Democrat I mean this is happening under Bush\nIs what's happening under Obama this what's happening under Clinton had just got word especially under the Obama years so we know right now that they are operative the women that caravan from people from the middle east to embed within that caravan trying to get into the United states\nThat many actors are trying to get into the United states who are involved in putting together in this caravan\nIncluding people from within the United states from political party within the United states basically creating this whole problem right before the election for any purpose but the American public is not done by the American public is waking up and the American public and behind the president\nWho is committed to putting America First and is doing everything he can to ensure that America remains protected and safe and you know what John in a way\nBecause what they're doing it if you will not be conservative\nAnd back and freedom loving

seven thousand this caravan it's coming you cannot control your country and a lot of open border with this type of of gas coming into the country\nOr ... let's get to what you said earlier I Want to get to do things to the German coming over and the president saying we'll give Mexico with the opposite we just heard some clips from both vice president Pence and six are safer pale\nThey're really banking on the Mexican authorities to stop him in the event they do and I think it's fifty fifty right now whether they're going to be able to do that\nIf they get to the border and the president does deploy the ... the military as he said he would whether the national guard or not in closing the border\nUm what is the risk that that becomes another PR disaster for Trump and the Republicans like kids in cages when we went to the zero tolerance policy how do we deal with that\nLook at little jumped mobilized a base for those who care about the country at this hope they are not married no pay anyway that left tapes to the left does not want to take your borders left open borders bring everybody in the here and give them I'm given shelter and give them free it's free that\nHave the money

screaming and yelling but in the last election the presidential election in twenty sixteen thought us one thing is that these American people who care about America the American which was written by

... he's not a journalist its distance that\nYou know this is that let's buy their arms it's got nothing to do with that there's there's the embarrassed the president on the world stage the embarrassment and they further embarrassed him by telling you that ridiculous story about he was in a fight and\nSo the barest them like again because the president said\nWell this could be credible and then a day later that's proved to be false so they lied to the president and embarrassment publicly again and so what is the president what is Trump supposed to do now say oh well you know\nHe was Muslim Brotherhood so it's okay to have any talking about can't do it and there's he's going to take action but this president a President Trump is going to send a message\nThat you know what a if you're going to have this level of disregard for our relationship or for the United states I don't take action is simple\nDoesn't mean we have to disrupt the relationship or not be an ally or cancel a hundred and fifty five hundred billion dollars in arms so\nIt doesn't really have to do that to other things that we can do and the best thing to do now because they can't get out of the thing is get

sunny skies so great to have you with us one of the most interesting things here that is going on is this caravan which many of these migrants have\nCrossed Mexico I'm not sure I'm not sure really how\nThan what we understand that there is a is about five thousand people strong and many of them have gotten through the Mexican authorities they were stopped on a bridge they jumped in the river many of them now just getting through and they're on their way to the United states now\nThe Trump Administration has got to make a decision in a very short period of time on this caravan\nI'm just going to say the straight out when you have four or five thousand people storming your country and this is what the says they're storming the border their strength in numbers they're getting money along the way they are being encouraged\nAs the president said we don't know who's part of this certainly CNN is going to play a mom with babies that's all they're going to play they're not going to play the traffickers or anyone else that\nHappens to be involved in it that might not be the type of person you want in the United states are all going to show the miles with the babies but at the end of the day\nYou have five thousand people crashing the border of the United states where I come from at sixty years old I think that's holding invasion I don't know what else do you call it a migrant right uh what is it a like may we come in\nI mean we have laws in this country the president's gonna have to act on this he has no choice and he threatened to send the military there\nAh hopefully they'll turn back hopefully they'll turn it back and they have to turn back and fix their own countries everybody would love to come to the United states as an economic refugee we'd fill the country up with five being people that would collapse\nYou simply cannot allow five thousand people to simply storm over the border and then be fed close education and who's paying for it\nAnd the minute you do that the next candidate that will be fifty thousand and then five hundred thousand and then what do you do then you have a country that's coming that is absolutely coming and it's coming sooner than you think it is because thousands\nOf these um what what you want to call them migrants or a terror banners resume their journey on Sunday despite a Mexican Government or just submit\nTo processing by the immigration authorities they simply ignored or just like the will ignore ours and the differences CNN will be there with cameras and God Forbid and all they're going to do is take pictures of moms with babies that's it they don't put all the miles with babies up at the front and take all the pictures\n\nAnd I don't know one or the CNN people and all the other liberals just take them into their home and go through just drive your car down there take five of them in driving through the processing yourself spending money how's the feed them clothe them I don't know maybe you do that they're not going to that they're not going to do it\n\nAnd all of the things that you're going to see is about how mean we are and not letting them and\n\nIncredible that this was going to turn into a major campaign issue and to be ... this is the worst possible scenario you're talking about an October surprise here it is you're watching five thousand people trying to invade the United states from the southern border\nComes a week before the election a week and a James says there's and the timing of this terror of an interesting yes I think maybe it was put together they thought it would help the Democrats because we have kids in cages again\nIt's going to blow up in their faces are back fire\nI mean average Americans look at this and they're like I don't think it's a good thing for tens of thousands of people just stormed the country I mean that's where the caravan is your storming the country is is not like you're there's a group of people in an orderly fashion\nOr they sneak through a rancher there's a handful here and a handful there\nI mean you get five thousand people that's a mob and that's an invasion and what are we gonna do there's no way this I mean what are you if you put the military and straighten them out at the border\nHow are we going to stop that you're not going to shoot them so her going to stop them then the confrontation goes on TV and the Democrats are screaming about how mean we are or Trump is it it's a it's a powder keg it's a powder keg and you've got\nFourteen days away fourteen days but it's going to blow up because look if you listen to me right now I don't think you're excited about five thousand people just storming into the United states\nAnd breaking all of our laws and suddenly their nose and everything and then say take care of me I mean you don't have a country if you allow this to happen\nAnd Trump said somebody gets a relative that great with him he said you don't like the Democrats here and you're basically saying an invitation because then I got a stern\nAre going to stop it and the invitation is come on it he said the next caravan will be fifty thousand is right because the Democrats are campaigning on what they're meant basically they don't want to stop them I don't care what they say when they come on my radio show about securing the border Tim Kaine secure the border how ... how are we going to do that to him\nI asked him three times on Thursday specifically what action center are you going to take when this caravan hits Texas what are you going to do what we have to get immigration reform okay what does that mean what does that mean you put the military there", "show_name": "Dennis Prager Show", "year": "2018", "city": "Portsmouth", "day": "22"}
