take the tent the Republicans will hold Congress I doubt I agree with I don't think yeah it's it's not and and right now that's not in the realm of possibility\nBut the Republican polling is telling me that she's tire or slightly ahead\nBarbara it's going to lose by double digits Tom when she's over perform for polling every time her whole career she's over ...\nYears the problem is in every

to almost\n... Barbara gets none of that uh because the Republicans get away with their constitutional obligation uh on on do you know to to designate projects\nSo this makes it even more difficult race it it's a single\nA lot of her fire into the closing weeks on a jet or for in terms of their op research I'm not going to tell you what it is so I think this race quotas since I've seen races close a lot more at this point but this is this was a tough race it's a tough atmosphere and it's been tough districts and remember\nWe're driven by what was that somebody thing you said he had just\nWants to be a mix of ...\n[laughter] I go to ... I got to treat that out at eight thirty are driven Tom Davis and ... and then you've got a lot of the truth you John Schroeder let's get to the other races um\nLet's get to the seven I just had Barbara I just said ... drama show yesterday she's a very complex candidate no doubt but ah I see a little momentum going for Dave I didn't think he was going to win a week ago now I I think he is going to win a\nHow do you see that race so I I had that one a slightly new Republican up until the Kavanaugh hearings at this point I think it's a toss up on because what the Kavanaugh hearing stand was really re energized and fire up the one voter block\nThat's the problem for Dave Brat in some district which is suburban women\nUm and I think that the seven districts historically Republican it should be Republican including Republican ... left me um so I did last year but I'm the one path or a Democrat there isn't and raking in Chesterfield with the suburban women\nUm and I think Abigail the match for them and I think that the Republicans are doing everything they can to lose that block naturally right now um and so I haven't it's tough\nI think men to drink the Kool Aid on his cabinet nominations in terms of I mean I Am Turk let me just say yeah in in terms of what this is doing politically and I think we all live in our own echo chambers and we all have our own perceptions of how it's done but what this is done in the ... and some other polling demonstrate this is the Republican base is now\nActivated enthusiasm gap which is favored the Democrats for the last year and a half is now closed substantially\nAnd I think that works to perhaps paper they bred has two two issues though outside the demographics district in the DNA of that district is Republican number one he is not close the deal with some of cancers people and they were just as soon thrown under the Boston rent that she out for two years\nAnd bring back or ... you know somebody it's more in line with their thinking and and even some scores and secondly Tim Kaine is going to be exceptionally strong in that district he was mayor of Richmond if he has\nA political he's widely ... he's the same amount of wind energy\nThe I think that's right this this jacks up that democratic turnout there so you got a factor that into this thing I still think at the end of the day that the DNA of that district establishes itself and brought wins but the but this was a close race from Democrats have nominated maple camp [noise] she's very\nAt the at whatever happens you're talking about uh somebody that's got to be involved in democratic politics for some time I think I think Abigail Spanberger is going to have to be somebody is going to be reckoned with a and a democratic circles for some time\nNow I you know I don't I'm not I don't know a ton about the district uh uh you know I Will say I was driving down the south side Virginia to go to an event last weekend and going through some of the rural counties and it seems like if Brad can pull margins out of those counties are but obviously the critical mass of the district is in Chesterfield man right go so\nYou know I I Would probably say you know robotically it's a Republican district but obviously if it's a wave here than it could be one that the Democrats deal than would have to defend a twenty twenty\nOr let's get the second district Taylor Maria whatever happened was Scottsdale or the other day I had him on my radio show or the a campaign put my [noise] my name and their team of TV ads so I appreciate the PR for that one out of that race but\nThere are this is my first chance to respond to Scott right after he had to melt down on your show and that went viral yet I'm Upset about our analysis last time um and now says has not changed she still is [noise] um and\nUm I don't think I don't believe in New York Times poll I think it was you know I I ... up to this point I knew how close are pretty good at the last week they've they've not been um I think there's some noise going on\nUm but I think we're is gonna win and she's gonna win going away um so I think she's going to win going away I think it's going to be a [noise] a secular up until two months ago I was doing everything right um and he's really blown it\nAnd he's not going to win reelection and so are you saying because of the whole the validation Israeli citizenship this year in a way he's handled it and remember that this district in one of the few in the country\nThat not only sits in the ... side a media market but is in a media market that doesn't really stretch too many other districts so the media has been all over this this on the evening news every night you know\nIt Barbara Comstock kind of partition scandal in Tempe district it would've made the CD for forty five seconds one night or maybe a week later they quickly re mentioned that you know because like\nYou you cannot get away with something\nThe tide water it's been on the road here so let me ... let me look I think are the New York transport property rights trader is fixed that district very well\nOr you know it was a Navy SEAL all that kind of stuff in ... issue matrix and he has chosen I think you're in line with that district is not a far right kind of guy he understands us a suburban Virginia Beach in those areas so we have all that going for him this protest\nAnd you've every year that favors Democrats or what's ... is a Republican what scares me about this is the fact that if you look nationally Democrats just a ton of cash and dropping a couple of million dollars on that race and the last week that megaphone just can overwhelm at this point in exaggerate these things I think\nI think New York times pulls correct Huntington or is up to date a again if are betting I I I think he wins\nBut in this environment with a kind of money Democrats put down a you've got to be nervous about this you're going to watch this aren't election night if the Democrats window seat it tells me it's going to be a pretty good year farm in terms of chocolate thirty five forty yeah I think about\nThat are the thing about this district is different than Comstock and it's definitely different than a brat\nIs the turnout model is totally different and I think it's hard for Democrats to win the seat in a non presidential year are just based on who votes democratic and Virginia Beach Norfolk it's you know that the typical democratic voters will be a minority down there and unless you get an outsized performance it's not\nI think it's tough for the Democrats to win that seat I mean Glenn Nye one or two thousand and he got flushed down the drain and twenty ten\nAnd the reason was democratic vote came out in the presidential year for Brock Obama it wasn't there the next cycle for Glenn Nye 'cause nobody knew Glen I was [noise]\nUm I think Scott Scott an advantage is that the turnout I remember back when I was in the house carcass we'd look at the turnout bottles and the numbers and [noise]\nYou know Virginia Beach in Norfolk the numbers are just forty percent of what they are in other parts of the state so it's just a it's it's you got a lot of people that live there that are you know enlisted men or women that are registered to vote elsewhere so it's just it's hard you know to to bring people out in that type of environment even though it's bench correct you have one media market and\nYou know they could possible Scott from now till the end of the time but there's going to be a conservative there's going to be a conservative votes that's going to come out\nAnd whether I'm a ... Maria I don't know how to pronounce it Laredo whether or not she can get people out based on her name as opposed to you know Tim Kaine is not as big a magnet there as he is enrichment um so I I still think it's up to them for the Democrats even though I agree it looks like Scott's kind of watch this one issue\nNineteen Ninety six and Tom Davis one member this well um we had a we had a scandal um state wide where John one or put a television ad up against Mark Warner who was John Warner was far ahead and um he photo shop Mark Warner and do a picture\nOr who's in the ... I Can't remember who we thought ... shot but Clinton I think yeah you socialize with Clinton but was it was all her I was glad there was a racial aspect to it too I Can't remember what they did but they sort of shut Mark Warner into a picture he wasn't in\nAnd um ended a television ad\nAnd it was a huge went national scandal for John Warner who had a moderate brand and was a\nGuy that you know everyone looked she likes either but you're trying to states got Taylor is there like had a friend okay and and and that people you know like respected John Warner much higher than Scott Taylor them [noise] and and his numbers collapsed and Mark Warner was going to win\nOn a navy person and and the captain of my ship and I'm responsible for what happened and I apologize and it's got telling her down that you would want to\nGo I just I was worse campaign chairman that year and it was a it was a close race Merck worse than fourteen million dollars of his own money that year that may just really a much closer race than it might have been other was concerned when it was used on the beat of course we'll put them out kind of earned it after running a close race there but I remember it out and I mean they fired\nThe people that were involved in the ad and everything else and you broke it and it it was an issue for a week or two and then John ... kinda does he took accountability said or has mishandled this thing I think it's just kind of destruction in tapping his people take the Fifth Amendment doesn't help it just keeps it in the news\nIs that enough to bring down somebody with a good reputation just done a good job in their first term or not\nUm and also I think that the ... what do you turn out and they talk about a blue wave I think you're really talking about I think wage that's really what's happening with the Democrats is that the in the suburban female voters have swung radically or to the Democratic party and that's what\nWe're going to take off will get our predictions ruin your facts and the next segment we got to get to the reds yeah I agree with that\nI'm an ... billion Thirteen were there but not that popular when they're running and libertarian broke five percent and libertarians to automatic ballot access to the next five years in Virginia which are going to church the Republicans that was going to expire this year because North Koreans have not cracked five percent again\nNow the ... the word there'll be another five years the libertarian automatic ballot access [noise] wow\nThey're great at one point as Matt waters are going to get over five no no question probably seven\nGodfather's here to tell me what is your job you think you'd think Barbara going to win or lose\n[noise] uh what what ... what about Scott ... Maria [noise] drop [noise] you know what's going on [noise]\nAnd ah I see you alert [noise]\n\nAnd [noise] ... I'm a terrorist got nothing but negative publicity from a over the last several months and I don't see him climbing out of that whole could be wrong but I don't see that and I also don't [noise] I mean there [noise]\nComstock can talk about her internal all she wants that's not what people are picking up going door to door [noise]\nSo what have you heard of that risk [noise] I'm just I mean\n[noise] you know going to try to bolster the Democratic vote on the Democratic doors\nThat those people are telling her there with her\nAnd went on occasion they've asked what's the main complaint [noise] uh and this is for Kavanaugh 'cause I talk to anybody since then [noise] uh it was the n._r._a. [noise] those ads have been effective but this cabin all thing\nI mean that's all you know I can door to door and that's all I get\nThat far back this for the shots gotta go we've got to get to the red yup we've got to be getting Monday Night right Carolina right how did you start with where the early in the right to be happy so far\nYeah generally happy I think the defence like I said a month ago young fast a good and and they're going to get better I think there are deep Pence will get better [noise] um I I think they need to give a couple of guys more snaps a couple of guys less naps but\nBy and large I like their defense to be a top ten defenses Sharon for the next few years going forward that makes it for us I think they did they have one issue they need to solve and I can solve it if they listen to me\nThey all week on the ends they don't have any big play receivers that can go down catch the ball you know catch eight balls for a hundred yards and you need to have that too when consistently in the NFL you can't just keep throwing too you're tied into your backs especially with a\nTitle like Jordan read the genetically gonna get injured then\nDesmond on the street [noise] he's bet on the street I in you know Bruce was my firm Booz Allen I emailed him literally within twelve hours if they're being cut by Dallas [noise] begging begging them to pick up as I have repeated it every time I said um [noise]\nThe day he sets his foot on Redskins park you'll be the number one receiver they could get rid of Josh dachshund yes I said it they could keep Jamison in crowd or in the slot they can get that keep decade retro Senate they're number two receiver cruise fast\nBut then you need a big receiver who can pull down eight nine temples again for a hundred yards desk and do it and so what if they put him on the team they will be the best team the NFC East and will make the playoffs why does\n... [noise] Dallas lakes losing um I think it's [laughter] you know they don't like to when they like to lose a why did you know why do they do what they do I do they keep Jason gear to take coach you know I mean\nWhy do they get rid of Tony Romo and uh it's just I I think somewhere Jerry Jones just decided he was tired of winning and want to start losing for a while and so that's that's why does what he does\nThat for the things that I mean is that the answers that dependency [noise]\nYeah I I'm I'm favorable and dance and I can't believe we're talking about the Redskins are not referring to him as the first place\nYeah that's true worst place for a different type yeah that's\nI'm going to say at this point a lot better than I thought there'd be this year still very very tough schedule or next week I'm going to say nine and seven and that may be enough to make the playoffs because the eagles are\nThat I'm actually kind of one of the things it's always hurt [noise] they're over ... you're going to the game since Ninety four\nAnd one of the things that the red skins of lack for some time as a speed demon [noise] and I can't remember the last time I'm sure I probably missed something but I cannot remember the last time I've seen the Redskins a Redskin return upon her kickoff first touchdown\nAnd a while and it's been a long time and I remember one of the hallmarks of a global body was that he always had her parents he called it more burner\n[noise] whether it was you know on your nerves whoever I mean it was he always had at least one bird [noise]\nAnd we don't have that and uh it it shows\nHow many how many ... when you're there for you can get Ben nine ...

eleven o'clock season or say non [noise]\nAll right I'm going to go in the middle I think they're going to win ... games I think you got to make the playoffs and here's your here's the thing about Alex Smith [noise] I'm not a fan of it because they can't win big games in the playoffs and so we got an exciting quarterbacks but you know I've watched them now three weeks I'm not a fan one way or the other but they're on TV [laughter]\nBut I'm only managed games I mean he's never going to be you know he's never going to be yourself and\nCould see one thing I can see quite a Allen got him I mean he does fit it kinda fits what a\nThe whole crew in philosophy is now that I don't know when games [noise] and\nThink that I think just seems kind of winter games that they could get in the playoffs or be dangerous [noise]\nI got I got a sign off I got to be in court today okay thank you for sharing your events I asked for it and they let me just quickly add the unemployment down to three point seven percent the lowest since Nineteen sixty nine Lewis is making [noise]\nWhich you know the answer for you to not get a raise what can I comment on this really quickly John [noise] this is it's an amazing stat but not for the reason the Republicans want it to be an amazing stat [noise] because [noise] people say nothing sticks on Trump\nAnd I think it's the opposite I think everything sticks on Trump\nThe fact that you have an economy that's as good as it is and he's having a going to have a bad of an election that he's going to have everything is sticking to him because you should have with the economy [noise] one of the first time for the president picks up see if there was an economy election [noise]\nUm the Republicans could actually be gaining ground in the ...\nAnd the biggest gains in the high income areas are the ones turning against in the fastest so for people to say nothing sticks to Trump everything sticking to try [noise]\nWell I think he gets credit for the economy and I think [noise] I think he gets credit for the economy and I think that mitigate against the law says they take just because of the ... the cycle but these coalitions are basically cultural coalitions\nAre not economic coalitions and\nAs I said the Democratic enthusiasm and the independents wanting to balance the government is really what hurts the Republican point people don't trust the Republicans to have the Easter bunnies want some kind of check on ... he's doing okay they may vote for him in two years but in the mid term may want to put a check on it [noise] I I was saying this do I think the Democrats take the\nHouse is I think it's more likely than not\nAh I I don't know how they don't impeach the president when it comes out you got the Democratic base right now is rabbit\nThey want to impeach him now before motors a commission and when you [noise] I I don't know how Democrats going back to their primaries in twenty twenty can't not to impeach Trump I I just think\nThat happens in rent for tonight is not the kind of our nature whether they have any any reasonable evidence or not 'cause you're like a ... a lot of them think they have reasonable evidence now I don't know what most of the things you know what are you going to say um but I just think you look at the base and you look at the fact that the primary elections or what most of these members worry about that it's politics\nAre going to do it I'm not arguing with the insurance now\nTakes on Capitol Hill yeah well I think what happens is it changes the dynamic for twenty Nineteen [noise] it was one thing that twenty Seventeen Trump's than Republicans control everything to put a check on what\nThe Democrats come in Congress like our class of Republicans in Nineteen Ninety four it's kind of embraced the under Clinton never really played off against the Republican\n... yes you do better than they would do it yeah and I have some of that\nDynamic in twenty

the game and and and the whole the whole right at the edge media just\nUm I've never seen an arena just go so last year game seven against Pittsburgh in ... when we when we went out the ... in in twenty sixteen and um they went down one nothing and it was like you know one nothing that hockey is nothing nothing and and I mean you get a funeral that we already lost the game because they were they're spread\nShort head against it [noise] [noise]\nRight [noise] and and and and that's and now it's like it's lifted and and and you could steal the playoffs last year once we got through Pittsburgh it didn't matter if we went down and again people could still\nBelieve in the team and the team could believe in itself I think I think the\nThe the caps in their history was Wayne on the players were they were believing when they went down a goal that the the games where you can also and how they because the fans believer\n'cause every everyone believed it and I once Pittsburgh got the last year everything changed you could feel the change their I'm Thomas receipt and taken over on a season ticket holder we said a poor sections away from each other sometimes to each other and not the Dunkin' Donuts line between factions [noise]\nUm but um [noise] this is going to be a great Arabs or the caps now I don't think this was a one year thing I think that you look at who's not soft is young I'm only in his in his you know not in the mid mid thirties I think when you're thirty three thirty two\nUm [noise] he's gonna make a run a grassy for the most goals scored of all time the regular season is over six hundred rescue the Ninety four he's going to make a serious run it being under one goals for an edge on history and the capture of an incredibly bright future um [noise]\nAnd I'll just end restraint is my dilemma right now I put a thousand dollars and the cat flustered when the Stanley Cup in Las Vegas Fifteen to one\nWe want to in Vegas that the cash for tickets Fifteen thousand dollars when I catch the ticket the person at the counter told me the biggest payout she's ever paid at the sports book\nOr when people will take about like that and roll it over for two or three seasons and she said you know if the caps three feet and you wrote us money over it'll be two million dollars by the time they have a three feet so I'm Still having this dilemma for the rest of the season I have not done anything with the money yet because it may be that like you know it was just a thousand dollar initial investment\nI might need to roll it over a couple of times because I think the caps are legitimate threat not only to repeat the sheer potentially do you have to repeat\nI'm the only after all that every year by year so that's my dilemma but I'm leaning towards the right now I actually think this team as a special team and one that um is going to have a lot of success going forward\n[noise] well uh\nI forget what you're saying I bet the Astros last year to win the world series attendant one as you know because you put to better ... better for you and I in fact the ticket we did when it when it gets the ticket as\nYou have to know you know you gotta play where your\n... your ... your strength and it would be there I think a Ralph one uh [noise] I think ... [noise] one by twelve points twelve to Fifteen points I got an a in a blast district in even more I think in Stuart events district\nAnd uh you know the dynamics are changing in this and it's not just so much a matter of Trump or anything the demographics in the state or changing and they're changing almost daily [noise] and\nAh it's obvious which way you know they're moving are we going to be like Maryland now we're not going to be like Maryland\nBut we um northern Virginia is beginning to look more and more in northern Virginia suburbs more and more not totally but more and more like the Maryland suburbs\nNational it's not just reached wanted right happening naturally in these kinds of areas\nRight as we get New Jersey suburb same things going on everywhere not out of sight and everything but you're seeing this you're seeing this an awful lot and um [noise] I think we have an excellent chance\nAnd no question we're getting help from the guy in the White House whether he will be there or not you know a a ... I was joking was Mark Warner\nAnd I said you know when you well we we need them they're just one more election [laughter] you know but I mean it's you know I'm generally speaking we done better [noise] generally speaking when there's been a Republican and the White House having to print exceptions yes\nGenerally speaking the Republicans have done better when the Democrats bending the White House has there been exceptions yes but the trend is there\nAn unmistakable trying yeah understand and I\nI I Would be surprised if we didn't know you know get to a Twenty one in the end of the election Adam minimum\nI think I I I tend to agree you know you still have to defend a couple of states like you got a couple of comments got one over on the eastern shore that is in play I think Republicans could hold the black sea if they don't have to buy I\nI think that [noise] far weaker today a it's an incumbent and probably anybody else 'cause just some personal proclivities and\nAnd and things that I think that hurts him among some of those voters we have some stronger candidates don't or black\nOr you know I don't know what happens there he's got a hundred and fifty thousand in the bank so I didn't sound like he's ready to go away very quickly but I Will do my rights him if he got no when ... when the phone and you want to go out to undefeated not indicted if you could do that and they lost before\nIn mountain when he and house of delegates any moved all over the first district run for\nA German some very attractive candidate a you've but you've got some issue ... after the initial matrix there where he has not really thinking or his voting record 'em to that district and you've got the state house if the one forty nine into redistricting\nThat's critical happened many many I mean we have to wait and see but may work and the Democrats faced with\nThe um [noise] I mean it would appear that the judges are going to wind up drawing that house district as hell eleven house districts\nAnd I think that's what whatever formula when they come up with [noise] that's gonna uh also be what the Senate's going to have to abide by twenty Twenty one\nAnd uh it could change or you know or it could change an awful lot [noise] um you know a hog the districts are unpacked not totally but below the numbers I mean look what Bobby Scott\nI mean his district one from what fifty some fifty six percent down to you know low forties and I'm a you know were produced another democratic district so you're going to have to see how that plays out\nBut it seems to me that uh the judges drawing that district is by far and away their their best bet and if they do you know Supreme Court I think it ruled before the\nGerrymandering as has been constitutionally permissible until spills over in racial discrimination\nAnd therein lies the problem and that's what the Republicans are facing\nHere and it's going to change its going to change the way you know a\nWhole makeup of legislatures around the country\nWe're going to court for a five to four court [noise] we'll do this differently blocks of each other going back if I may be wrong but I think when they sent it back to the lower court it was like seven to one nationally\nBut I just say one other thing is you've got to understand the Republican base for better for worse is migrated from that country club in the country and in so doing they've taken so out of some competitive districts were these were economic issues Republicans it'd be very viable\nSo it's not just the demographic snake when I in fact that they have changed the emphasis on issues in ways that help them in South West Virginia but but it hurts them in the growing parts that\nWe talk about the ex now an office with a very popular governor with very low negative and you look at ... numbers ... support amongst Democrats\nWas not popular among Republicans was more polarizing in numbers Ralph Northam has incredibly low negatives for somebody in this environment you look nationally um he has very high positives very low negatives\nUm and in going into these competitive seats [noise] um I remember in ... eleven and Democrats drew the state Senate lines and they lost the majority and who is that the person who was in every Republican ... seats as Bob McDonnell a popular governor can play a big role now\nAnd why is racist I don't care how you slice it the national environment place where did you have to have a messenger boring to celebrate their special I'm turning out the Thomas writes the the I mean it that that national scene where he's very heavily you know which is why you had you know the the patterns that you've had\nUntil McCarthy Cuccinelli I mean you know what happened for almost fifty eater I'm a I'm In I'm In his ... it's like let's take for example the start of in the district of unseat was not driven by national politics and twenty fifth and it was driven by local politics in Chesterfield versus Richmond and I'd like to be democratic\nUm and I think that we and we thought we'd have more aggressive candidate but we don't have we ended its campaigns don't matter you know I don't think we had to I don't think we had a great messenger there I think if he rerun that same race and twenty Nineteen and you had Ralph Northam on TV\nI'm In that district Ralph would flip it on that I'm going to be as they are they all vote the votes would stardom and it's chaos is going to create problems for him\nYeah I think that's a greater problem is that he's he's he's not harmonious with their district on some of the hot button issue I just say that like Rob working in a good governor and he's a wonderful man but he gives a fireside chat in the fire goes you know you put him on TV ... it's it's not the same kind of rally the team but he's\nAn asset to them every week and he didn't even have to use that I don't want to do that is not it is that's the kind of governor you actually need this you know and he picked up not a fiery he picked up Fifteen states I mean I think you can't tell you the color fitness fiery and I'm as a carnival Barker one and and he doesn't he doesn't pick up the flavor up north I'm dead\nWell north and didn't pick 'em up Trump picked\nHim up for him yes if if Trump would have been president and twenty Fifteen we'd be in the majority\nThey look I don't know I yeah I I decided I don't want to wish on route north I disagree however I think he's been pretty much just stayed\nChemical upon by three points and rapper with them on by eight and ... pick up your us each and reports and picked up Fifteen five point difference was not a Fifteen ... but it was also hotel different let me tell you the\nWhite House break about it [noise] Trump okay was a driving factor sure last November on top of that\n[noise] um [noise] you had a ... and spilled over into everything [noise]\nAnd keep in mind Gillespie was not good you know\nI mean he was very polarizing [noise] but um I just think people keep underestimating as governor oh oh I don't think anybody underestimating\nI don't think anybody under estimate same but they nervous I mean you know what's driving politics in Virginia right now is not a Ralph uh it's it's what's going on across the Potomac River\nIt's negativity is driving politics on both sides right now in the one thing about Robert and he doesn't have any negative [noise] doesn't have many many either very likely to or not\nI'm not you know I've now go you know been knocking on doors since may I have not gotten one negative comment about Ralph non and [noise] that's\nYeah he's a politician you know I I agree with that he is an asset but he's not a fire reader that gets voted out for\nYou know I I think comedy is not a fire leader that got to put up for the Republicans for Twenty years\nEvery single Republican let these you would have thought the person was married to Tom Davis because the Republican candidate had his picture bigger than their own picture with a quilt for him saying like here's why they'd be great for your time sometimes without permission um so I mean\nHaving a messenger is important and Democrat here and I had to let them is the first time in a sense Mark Warner and we've had a messenger like\nYour arteries right I agree I agree but now he's taking our income but that was not entirely different that\nI don't know I tell you what man I Am I to Joe Joe's kind of Peter ... you can't underestimate Morsi and I'm telling you what he had a disastrous\nPressed to offer I wasn't there and it was a\nDisaster of all time sort of getting a disastrous press conference it really hurt him\nTo all kinds of underhanded things going on but uh you know after that Morsi's mayor and [noise] you know the the thing about Joe is he's an independent sector he's gotta go its own way uh you know he's not\nA he's not a whole bunch of any of the establishment caucuses or anything like that\nI think he's got to play very well in that district and I think a lot of friends there that I don't think that he got screwed by what they did to him and and take a gym or see that\nThe smartest thing I've ever seen anyone to in politics when he when the when I think it was the mceachin the one mceachin the on the eastern moved up I think\nAnd in that primary people didn't think he was gonna win that primary crowded field and he won in a landslide networks people are asking what did he do he went around and after he knocked on doors at you know and I wrote a handwritten note every voter he spoke to\nThe data that for a week and a half before the election in the context that that he had remembered the conversation\n... kept these postcards for six months and send them all out ten days before the election with a handwritten note from him talking about how their conversation and you know I met your dog Sam or you're a teacher here and I remember that conversation and do you know hope I can count on your support next Tuesday and people\nCame out in droves I mean for him to go do that though and I I actually people read postcards but I've never seen one posting them to make it appears that month later okay well Tony I'm Tom Davis has everything better than anyone in politics later but [noise]\nBut he did that to anyone in a landslide and like\nBeen done before it really wasn't I don't underestimate Joe I'm just saying taken on income but in a district like I did it\nThat race either gonna just to I'm not an expert on that's the big difference you know if we had you know there's a whole lot of people have gotten in the journal stomach because we don't have run on purpose in this day a whole lot and you won't have that you'll just have to be on there\nAnd she's well why [noise] I don't think I if I had the gas and I think until they're on whether or not district and I guess that route dance I've extremely low name id pardon\nI Would guess that rod dancers extremely low name id and that if you test it they were ... his name I have to say the power part I'm just not like in terms of I'd name id\nRichard Nixon had our name out\nThere [laughter] you know like I don't think rises like real superstar the\nRadical you know Joe and I know Joe\nThan sort of got to get out out were something like Fifteen or twenty to one okay Joe was out there knocking on doors are making phone calls now we'll just see\nBetween the fastball primary too in that primary like Dick was in the ... district for Twenty years before he got drawn to have the right to actually has a concept of campaigning and knocking on doors and doing the things that you do when you're in a competitive political rates\nFor Seventy percent of the vote in my district against Mondale yeah rock that's never been a\nBetter place their lights on presumably better right now she's ever been\nOf you guys yesterday before and she's got to get out work I'm a joke that out worker he's fighting Joe he's gotta he's gotta worker and\nThere is a human donate get\nI'm telling you he was going to get a sense that there's a separate the vote out there for the fact that the power banks in Richmond screwed this guy out of his livelihood\nAnd that's that's real I mean he got screwed I mean what did you did to pull us long license it looked senator Stanley told me that old but I guess I ... it was blown it [laughter] what happened there was a total bologna and\nIt was because uh it it was it was the cause challenged the Richmond system that's what happens that's why they pulled him and so I just I don't remember that\nLike you know there are a lot of\nPeople in that area that have an end to the loyalty the Joe ... the reason he does well there's a lot of people there that is represented\nAnd when families have had a time of need you know the attorney they went through the criminal defense attorney to help out someone in their family and and it was Joe Morsi and that created the level of loyalty he has a big\nNot ready to call this one one way or the other yet but um he has a real base [noise] it's it's across that district the from being an attorney I'm\nIn the same way that Donald McEachin you know when he when he ran rubber on his running you know he ran as a primary challenge of what three times to incumbent twice twice as the challenger don't come a delegate to the ones that are challenging senator\nAnd and the teacher was the guy who everyone news on TV it was a lawyer um he had to help so many people in the community it didn't matter that he was a challenger to incoming um that's how they are much they thought he was into right\nDon't know who to turn to joy Morsi has been the guy who's defending their nephew there's time um you know against major charges that any he's one of the top defense attorney there so I've just I I think that it's an interesting race than an we've got to see you know will rise even run again\nLet let me look ahead to twenty Twenty one the governorship or when it comes comes through a lot of um determine who's White Houses that dynamic and so on but when north um goes well the attorney general within a governor clashes that who else is looking at this at this point in the Democratic party or as I Know\nI mean there is a name pops up now and then very yellow and was not out of the picture you know I Would imagine the running of course but I wouldn't\nI Would hope that herring in Fairfax and get things worked out or not the contested nominations and you've got a lot of people in the back looking for upward mobility to get the mayor of Richmond in the bar stony you've got\nSome other or just getting her yellow sitting there on you'll have a primary and you'll just have to see if it's a [noise]\nA successor can be dangerous if only I think you only a\nLong as you don't have a two way race a between Fairfax and [noise] ah I think that if a if it's if it's one of them\nAgainst the whole batch of other people when [noise] uh you know either Fairfax\nYou're carrying somebody out though I like you guys are talking about herring and a Fairfax you're not talking about the horse Tony who was absolutely going to do something she was the other person you're not talking about\nWho can pull the upset in a two or three person race and that's Kenny handling Alexander\nMayor of from Norfolk right now who in a three way primary against to progress is trying to out liberal left wing each other Kenny Alexander comes and business guy this is track record\nAnd the mold of who water businessman McAuliffe business model ridiculous why\nThat's ridiculous first of all just there's obviously there's a there's a moderate right or the Democratic primary is any way for the first piece safety but the fact that you're in a rough is north of your work at state they're not going to line up behind ... I like the ... the good friend\nBut they're going to either line up behind either herring for Fairfax what about stony and I don't even know now I don't I don't I don't know I'm Out in the same thing with all of our record guy people liking but they're either going to go with one of those two\nWell how ... going to be a Republican anyway 'cause Trump's going to be gone and twenty twenty I was going to win again [noise] ... I mean first years of presidents Israeli when they run the same type of campaign that\nGillespie or you write a\nRepublican won't win that governorship you can't ... I'm telling you you know it's disgraceful\nJet Republican ever win again in Virginia\nHow do you how do they want to explain that probably that's absurd how do they\n... for a Christie how do you account for that you know in in ... in Massachusetts I mean you know\nGovernorships in particular are not parliamentary ready and people make and you know but but let me tell you something as long as people in the Republican Party is trying to turn a ... a a political Nicole at the expense of somebody color or somebody ethnicity or somebody's religion\nIt ain't going anywhere I Would agree with you there and you can tell they can get away from that you bet well that and they shouldn't be reject\nOr they gotta I got a text year from a Senator Bill Stanley he says never bet against fighting Joe so it'll sailing agrees with me\nYeah he was a it may tell Stanley that we know with Joe ... lawyer huh bill Stanfield Stanley yeah yeah okay what's that going to do a little biased\n[laughter] speaking of the biggest statewide races and until ... going to be a very dangerous candidate for attorney general I'm very like you have to run 'em and if he runs for attorney general gets the Republican nomination I think he's going to be very dangerous game well if he does run he'll get the nomination but he has to run\nOr what the Republican problems up here you can't come out of your
