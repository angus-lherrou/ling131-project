to have you got to be on good morning John tell us about your big town hall meeting the other day\nYeah well a good news right it's that makes the the personnel um small business taxes than in a lot of other nice features permanent pastor in the house I go to the Senate the Senate slow moving so I don't know whether they get to it before the election\nBut all the Democrats including Bernie were critical of our initial package and they you know went on the press and said hey you got to your favorite in the big corporations it's not fair you got to make this permanent for everybody\nAnd so we did and now they're nowhere can be found that they they're just politic the Democrats are just political always never\nPolicy and so now we did what they said they want it and I don't think they're on board but we'll see we'll keep our fingers crossed that they want to see some economic growth for the country where we're getting a lotta new folks independence or even some Democrats to take a look at the Republican\nParty now because they're feeling in their business and their family or income in their pocket books the average family getting over two thousand dollars back in their kids are getting jobs and there's more job openings than there are people seeking right now I mean it's just amazing\nA time that should be the story of two thousand Eighteen but the mainstream media of course has other objectives than run reporting the news\nAnd die instead they're just attacking one party instead of the other\nWell certainly the a cabinet fiasco has dominated the news\nConference and now you're not in the Senate obviously so you're not a decision maker on that you were in the house but look everybody is watching it everybody has some thoughts on it you want to share your thoughts on that uh where the processes now\nYeah or just in the in the last few days I mean flake kind\nOf threw a curve ball it when he said you were going to move on and half the vote and so now the Democrats were asking to delay and have the FBI look at it and the FBI can't form conclusions and so you know the most troubling\nPark is the Senate is tasked by the constitution with doing the oversight and the advice and consent why not\nThe FBI the in the Senate job to do that and they had all these documents for six weeks and saboteurs didn't do their duty not advise and consent and so at the very end of the new documents come out that they had for weeks and now the\nGet in what he's missing there you know I I Wish they would ask them why did you ask any you could ask any of these questions your documents for the last six weeks and instead they're just you know trying to push a past election for Strategic advantage\nI mean look whenever they whenever the FBI comes out with next week I Know the Democrats going to ask for another delay\nA but it'll it'll be interesting to see if the FBI she finds anything um you know they've investigated him his background six times let me let me ask you something you've been criticized congressman by the Democrats are on the VA saying that you voted no I I Want you to respond to this\nNow you actually voted in opposition to the VA end to military spending when you voted against one of the budget and you've been criticized by the by the spanberger team\nSaying look you're saying you are back in the VA you're backing the military but when push came to shove you voted no on that how do you respond to that ...\nWell I mean that's just you know simple politics that most people don't follow this stuff to do just that I [noise] if anyone wants to go look I've always voted for the military plus up that's all we want to write the Democrats\nWon't do that and in order to get the budget last year we plug up the military and nothing else that's the house budget that I voted for and at the end of the year in order to get a budget the Democrats insisted that we plus up government spending on social side by four hundred billion dollars\nThe military plots up what Seventy billion and social science plus up and everything else in the in the mix was four hundred billion dollars the tax cuts also for example where a hundred and fifty billion dollars they're paid for it now if you're grown at three and a half or totally paid for and the four hundred billion the Democrats\nWon it in God and that we should not have allowed to happen at just goes on to the kids right there that there is Twenty one trillion yet to we're trying to preserve the principle that the budget states flap plus except pointing up the military [noise] certain democratic critique is exactly\nWrong that's always right they're trying to say I vote against the military no the whole point is if you keep plugging up the social spending you won't have any money for the military [noise] and so it's very clever trick or that's what the Democrats do because they cannot\nTell the truth to power and the you know the the spanberger campaign that the curiosity there's no one knows what she's running on I I seriously don't know what she's running out she came all the weight on health care\nAnd then when she found out the price tag was to thirty two trillion and would double our tax rate and she backed off health care and then you know I I don't know what else should against the tax cuts she said they were dangerous and so what is she\nFor an immigration she won't name an upper bound so I guess it open door to seven billion people open borders I Know she's four\nSo I mean it's I don't get it I I don't I don't know what she's running and so if you ever have around and ask her you know everybody would love to know when she won't even put a full biography and on the on the campaign website it's fairly shocking [noise]\nWell I'll ever on thirty AM on Thursday and\nI Will ask her just that also uh we're trying to get the big date worked out the debate that we're sponsoring and between yourself and Abigail I'm Still trying to get that day that I should get that in the next couple of days I'm told by a vote of your campaign managers\nDave I Want to ask you about something you put up the other day you said that and they are in the mail or that is a promoting spanberger campaign that\nYour kids found something in your mailbox for somebody had written on a on the mail or dating a rod in hell and you turn it over to the authorities and your kids founded it says right in the hell Dave I'm\nWhat why do you turn that over I mean did you actually feel at risk or do you think that's something my comment that\nWell we we don't know if someone puts rotten how on your door John I think usually that's not a good natured bank right so\nYou have kids at home and you get some input palm card from it right on your door yes everybody has current concerns these days or whether it's heated political rhetoric guy and and so of course\n... in hell yeah that I wouldn't I wouldn't think that would be a fun thing to find on your door so um it's it's it's not\nI mean it was I don't know why the spanberger campaign people keep doing this kind of stuff just just run your campaign run on the issues you have your debates\nAnd what are the party is going to win I don't know why there's you know you don't find this from the other side you know try and this\nFrom the Davis campaign and I'm just pointing out if you're spanberger supporter out there this is not helpful it's not helpful to your candidate it's not helpful to anything it's just it's just horrible so it's just what is your campaign on they are\nThey're they're folks are stripping Dave Brat bumper sign when we're giving big\nSigns out they had people come in steel big science they say I I'm I signed up to put these up for it they stole sign they take stickers op people's cars I mean just they have their science placed illegally all over the place we found this is a law enforcement candidate a and\nShe doesn't follow the law and so that's a little striking right and so\nWe we follow the rules I always tell the\nKids that are folks up the door to always be on your best behavior always be positive to everybody you know activity at all\nI think that anybody in your campaign would go to Abigail's home where she got children and put Abigail ... rotten held I just don't think they would do that and if they did they should get a\nMinus for that because it's not it's not studying by right tone and I would just tell the spanberger people that are listening to me now just knock it off just run your campaign right I mean there's just not helpful all the stuff is not doing anybody any good whatsoever\nAnd it's really dumped so just stop it just run your campaign and if you will you're weird and that's again too high for going on right nobody's going to die\nSo just knock it off and run your campaign\nDave thanks for being with us more information do do they ... dot com David Prescott Tom ... will be with us Thursday in thirty am hopefully this week we'll have a date for our debate day thanks for being with us John traveling so radio network Denver Riggleman coming up\nThat's the south side of Virginia area of the largest district in the state is bigger than New Jersey Denver Riggleman Republican candidate\nThis is the seat of retiring Tom Garrick and going up against Leslie Coburn and that will be decided in the midterms on November six room in the favorite there hey Denver good to have you on the\nGood morning thirty five days in a way and then\nIs that what it is that what it is now thirty five days\nIn a way yeah thirty ... thirty six days yet tomorrow that delivers Tuesday so I think it's five weeks out [noise]\nWhat is the most surprising thing so far you heard on the campaign trail like some you've heard from the central constituency voters and you said wow that's a shocker\nGosh a shocker for me [laughter] and it's probably something that's a little bit minor comparatively but almost everybody I talked to him down sides about infrastructure so I had one town I I Can't remember payment down there but for Victoria [noise]\nAnd I think it was a Victorian at one of the city managers you know come up to me and it goes in Denver and I said hey what's your biggest issue and he looked at me and he said sewer lines not replace Nineteen [noise] I'm like you gotta be kidding me [laughter] you get a chance to not good [laughter] sewer\nLines at break [noise] she's like oh my gosh that's crappy but [laughter] it's it's amazing to me the things that people are dealing with the trail and and just some of the things you hear really amazing or you know the one in the in the county I had one of the country and she goes I'm really sick or driving my kid\nIn homework every night\nIt'd be Fox they got real problems and he really get to hear all the real problems all the\nFood isn't this interesting because the district that you would represent is very diverse obviously in for people who say look I don't have why fly where I live a that's a real issue for poor people in today's environment that\nReally doesn't help when when when you talk about the the urban and suburban districts let's get to uh the president's when on Canada last night Kennedy caving\nIn to the president's demand NAFTA which I think is now dead or I never to be seen again\nAre replaced by us and the U.S Mexico Canada agreement now here's the reality the Canadians dropped every single demand they had before midnight because the president was going forward alone at the press conference on Wednesday\nHe said he was done negotiating with candidate he didn't like their negotiators didn't like your attitude and he said he told the staff he was done with him he was going forward without them\nThen they acquiesced on every demand this is a good thing for the American worker in a good thing for your district tell us why\nWell I mean the first thing in the first thing you see is that they upped the limits over the TPP right\nActual dairy exports I mean\nWe're talking about [noise] you know the import export dairy with Canada\nWe can now ship more dairy products into Canada have open that up and for the district I mean that's just amazing [noise] um and I think that's what I've been saying on the trail you may Johnny [noise] the farmers weren't screaming they said we believe that there has to be some short term pain for long term game [noise]\nUm they they have supported Trump at some point it's probably going to be too much to bear but they understood that they have been unfair system for so long and they want free trade and they don't want subsidies they want to trade and I think free and fair trade as what we're looking at right now and\nI'm a military guy so I called it to tea right [noise] free and fair trade what we eat and I think you're seeing these\nPromises being kept by the by the president [noise]\nAre at the ... I was at the un all week last week and a ... one of the key provisions that\nCame out there is that the president is looking for some way to solve the Yemeni crisis I'm there they haven't gotten there but I Know that was\nThat was a big topic along with with Israel and the Palestinians on any on everyone's mind\nBased on your military background how do we solve that because right now a there seems to no end in sight fifty thousand ... are dead\nAnd we've also got a humanitarian crisis that could go beyond the pale of anything that we've seen children are starving there and we're back\nDenver oh man that you know it's pretty interesting John it's a great question because I don't even know right now there is an answer in our military intelligence circles about how to extract the Iranians um from what they're doing in their support of the ... and I think that's been a big deal for us as it\nYou know Iran is the number one number one state sponsored terrorism and I think that what they're trying they're trying to use terrorism it's like a hedge demonic exercise\nTo do all these awful things I just think it was me going in there I Would try to find out that we could be more surgical that we're living the Iranian influence based on intelligence gathering in and based on special operations that would be the first thing I Would see is there any kind of alternative are of course of action\nWhere we can concentrate just on removing Iranian influence arms money\nThings that they do and I think that would be the first steps that I Would take all so I think when you saw General Mattis go downrange I think it really comes down to mission planning also in process we have to improve our mission planning processes are the Saudis do\nOr they have to improve their mission planning process and like a process does save lives\nWe have to have some kind of legal structure there were not doing something or not supporting something that sort of ad hoc when it comes to targeting so it'll be the first two things that I Would do is how do we certainly remove Iranian influence in the second thing is how do we improve the mission planning process\nSo that we reduce collateral damage to our trying to remove that cancer\nDenver I've got to go to a quick word from our sponsors stay with us or want to ask you about what you can see the campaign\nGoing and so what are the biggest differences are between your issues in some of them mostly hang with us I'll be right back on the John Edwards radio network more with the Denver Riggleman will we get that\nWe started in one car garage in Nineteen eighty eight or first contract signed in ... a little known company from Rochester New York today we're calibrating precision equipment for hundreds of manufacturers the fence and life science companies around us in the wrong\nSide my Washington found her cat limit currently channel recent laboratory smart teams the history of the rings ... else has\nTo be clear we built our business but his are dedicated employees to the free market longstanding climb relationships in the fall through our success in their\nProcess control specials count bonus for prompting will I Will tell us when\nWe make our mission to deliver Everytime they can't lend we know that if we are loyal customers nobody will do it and that's the way it should be a member of the firm's nearly Thirty years ago today they're one of the world's most recognized controls just a matter of fact there's our customers were still break\nYou want to read more about your success check the eighty belly beast\n[noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise]\nThose most perfect ways ... shoes you John\nFrederick show your ...\nIt's a little commentary analysis and listener interaction\n\nYou'll hear where again bereavement he'll be back just a moment\nYou know folks you and I know the off year elections are about one thing showing up this segment wrote you buy job creators network in this election is the most important in decades your tax things are on the ballot the American economy is on the ballot\nIn America's great comeback is on the ballot your jobs your kids jobs there on the ballot to your wages\nFor when king's you're saving all on the ballot for small business owners like me\nYour tax cuts on the ballot and here's the biggest issue on the ballot who's in charge of American future politicians in Europe ... in Washington D.

type thing or is it where something happened to her but not\nTough enough\nDon't know what happened to our but I have no idea if something happened to or [noise] in the coast highway the one thing to do and it's all ... of trying to take a man and destroy your life based on [noise] some Internet Mike that's where she\nShe has so many inconsistencies [noise]\nWilling to do this and be politicized upon the also when you look at the lawyers [noise] she hired coordinated with Diane Feinstein you look on the fact that she scrubbed all her social for social media I think Stillwater\nHow do you still I don't want to get into a theater at dinner and I don't think it'll happen or\nWhen you talk to leave our cabin out over there I just\nLike yeah well yeah and if that's the definition of it I Believe it too and you brought something up that uh we never really talked about on my show we talked about not knowing how she got there how she got home what the house was in a federal nor the inconsistencies\nBut you know the lie detector test that was kind of garbled or because you didn't know where she took it how it was done what the results were who paid for it\nI mean that didn't check out either that that whole things seemed I'm a little odd to me um I also want you expand on Susan Collins you said earlier that Susan Collins is the kind of in this whole debate here is kind of an unsung hero I'm a fan of Susan Collins I'm a big fan of hers everybody\nKnows that don't always agree with her\nOh you didn't know yeah I'm a fan of yeah and I\nAnd I don't always agree with her uh she's ... she's a moderate but I've always found her to be a very honest a very honest politician I mean she tells you the truth and she's she also happen to have you bump into where the hallway or something machine is super nice but\nYou said she's kind of the the the young son a champion here why you home when did that in some detail\nBecause from my understanding her on two Senate staffers\nOne hundred years you Sherry committee one of the senator's office not hers and also from one of the leaders\nOf one of them one of the groups are showing most powerful and important work on this nomination from the get go Steve Ford allegations are on the line came out she was approached by Murkowski I don't know anything about like oh I Know workout ski [noise]\nOne Murkowski necessarily wandering nomination old she would have gone that far too for the FBI investigation you even saw Murkowski\nWhen she was getting the calls the price that after a while [noise] picture what why don't we have an FBI investigation's closed door she was I don't know why [noise] Suzanne Collins had sent to getting calls from the very beginning\nWhen I go along with that said that one she wants to confirm break\nOut into she didn't agree with the way this process of the allegations were coming out she had argued ... Murkowski [noise] about it and I should also show you what profile in courage on what a what a legal Murkowski is when it comes to this\n[noise] she would only have done there and it's worked out scheme Collins had gone out with her as well because they're both females and wants to tame columns showed here and I had a lot of problems with her um although I I you know maybe in hindsight I don't anymore because of this\nIs that she didn't want to play the genitalia cars and she white tapping outlook she look here's the other thing that Merkel here's the other thing and they keep saying well it's one won't get a barrel and get confirmed\nThe president would have only one choice if he polls if he polls counted and now it would be to dominate Barrett\nWho's right\nFor because people like me who are calling for power from the beginning because [noise] uh nobody's buying Stein had already passed her face\nHer life I Would say you know you you gave us kept you know what I mean we would have said I we heard from the smartest people in the room we've heard from roads [noise] although I Know Don McGahn really pushed through food from everyone\nYou know and you have to be the book she not no no no you're giving us what we want now\nAnd he would have been amenable to that the president and so I think she was also sang to Murkowski that she was confident that way um which year Scots with Calvin now in terms of ... the way\nThat even with the job so she wanted to look at the Robie ways you tell me when the state it's going\nTo make all over abortion legal\n... would be overturned and then we'll see you know that\nWas never a big impact on that one so I'm really not going to be a tactic that will never happen\nAnd it's really a strong argument but I agree with you a hundred percent on Kavanaugh as it relates to even tell me I was also in favor of made me kill me there that was my first choice and just like be careful what you wish for right\nBecause if something happens that when a cabinet nominees goes down don't you agree with me that President Trump will nominate combing beret the following day\nI Would hope so I think we should nominate heard than that during the next thing you can see that you have hopefully the next ... next year but she she\nShould be what the judge Kavanaugh is they were just talking about though he is a very good nominee and he's very young and the president will have nominated with him I Believe right now in sixty three and I believe course of course I I forget the job of course it\nMakes me want to do was fifty one oh I see like if\nTo see one okay so you know better than me and then you can get Barry\nOn I mean look you kind of you have dropped eat already remade the bench for Thirty years so um so I think that but I think that you shouldn't be the next day I think that [noise]\nBut I think that lucky I'm I think that the president had really played just well I like the fact that the president look I'll be the first one to tell everyone that somehow\nDonald Trump believe it or not is not play street I mentioned all chats sometimes sometimes when you hear people on like a hundred certainly networks you understand you playing\nAnd then she was on the Ford allegation say anything for four or five days [noise] materialize\nOut [noise] and then he started at ... started attacking the process mhm he started attacking the process but I thought that was smart in some states only been a very good about this so\nWe need to be very loyal to cabinet [noise] hold dishes do or die we don't get through after all this we will lose the Senate the one thing is showing up at all polling Republican [noise]\nBecoming more engaged now and they are furious about this\nWell I think it's going to backfire on the Democrats because\nLook uh there's nothing that you went awry or Steve Bannon or Corey Lewandowski or anybody else\nThat's part of the Trump campaign or political action committee draining nothing we could have done to motivate Trump voters more\nThan the Democrats have done with this tavern a clown shall I mean people and I talked to are coming out of the woodwork to pissed off and they're going to turn out\nOn November six and I think as a result of that\nThe Republicans are going to win and when Nancy pull over she wakes up on November seventh and she's not speaker you know she sort of do blame Dianne Feinstein with this whole mess that's what's going to happen\nSam I've only got a couple of seconds make your prediction where all the cabinet\nVote be delayed for a week or more\nI think it's going to be all ages seven days I think that's so wherever that comes hopefully [noise] delays what was ... I think I think that what the engagement too I think that also got three then why because it's been a while the Republican base so upset about it can file\nAll right so it's going to be a week and that would be a this coming friday and then again\nNext week it could be on the weekend I mean we have a justice got on the bench for the Yankees are ... you\nKnow well I'm Talking about that first they have to get by Oakland no and uh the the problem with Oakland is if you're traveling in the fifth inning they get like Nineteen closures on that's the problem\nAll right Sam Nunberg thanks for being with us by the way to see him and he seemed visor for ... check this out citizens for the American republic this Steve Bannon's brand new pack and uh he got Sam and they're making some hey so Sam thanks for being\nWith us men and keep stir up my best to your puppy [laughter] Simms dog Winston judgments radio network group he writes\nCan I Do that no everybody says no we want more politic hardcore All right\nSo I don't know what's gonna happen the next week here a while we do know is that the FBI is going to do another background check it's like kind of like what till exam you put scope up there see what's going on and so is that sticks with these nominee number seven I don't know what they're going to find out\nThe FBI would understand ABC News read porch that you're talking to a different Ramirez 'cause we don't know if that's true because the fake news are so that might be true might not\nYou know you used to get a news report from ABC NBC CBS or Washington Post your finger tops or whatever you know some major outlet Chicago Tribune things like that\nMiami Herald you'd get a news report and you don't know whether to believe it or not now except for the Associated Press a pie that's probably the last thing and probably if you're in if you're traveling international algae Sarah right other than that\nIf you're in the U. S. H. P. I trust the people come to the eight people wire I'll buy anything else I don't know some ABC says\nThe FBI is meeting with Deborah Ramirez than [noise] five of her friends [noise] I don't know if that's true if they made it up do you have any idea they make all the stuff I mean I just put up an interview I did with Lara Trump\nAnd uh it's a pretty good piece but\nI'll tell you what I remember during the campaign the Trump campaign NBC News reported that the Trump campaign pulled out of Virginia you remember that that they pulled out of Virginia fake news\nThere was nobody called me I was the chairman or when he called her being how he was the\nDirector and nobody called the Trump campaign they just\nYou know Corey Stewart leaked the full story after he got fired and NBC just went with it because of their narrative that the Trump campaign was falling apart and\nThey were pulling out of the battle cry on stage and I went on thirty seven interviews and five days and still couldn't stop it I remember my son in Reno\nCollege professor jak at the University of Nevada calling me up three days later and saying hey dad what happened here campaign in Virginia I heard you guys pulled out and they fire you that's what my son said I'm like I don't know what you're talking about\nOh I just saw him over the law says they just NBC News scroll on the bottom of my TV screen it's unbelievable fake news so you don't know what's lying what's truth telling lies you don't know that's the problem\nA day and age tornado John and I had just gotten off the phone with Eric Trump who committed to several million dollars we needed in Virginia they committed to the vice president coming to northern Virginia on Saturday the ...\nBP and the president committed to the final weekend do you\nOf course not plus we got two and a half million dollars for advertising socialized all lives\nLet's go to the phone lines for you know John ... sounds like you're on the air\n\nAnd John and you know did you watch the debates between the story and [noise]\n\nUm I did not know\nOkay a reason why I saw it on things but uh they got a little\nBlip on the store it's a Facebook page I assume that he said you know want to release the names of of\nOf the senators and congressmen who paid off their shoes ers hush money yeah and and so he says that and then they cut it off our response to that\nAnd I wish there were kept it is that that would tell you a lot\nQuieter hunted off it's dumb it's a dumb question because uh you can't do that to legal so\nThat can only be that can that that can't get done that can only be done by the that committee\nSo that can't be done like like teen can't release those right there that are actually in only by law right that can only be released by the full congressional committee so they wouldn't have to vote onto Gina's if anything is doing this but that's a that's a dumb question\nCouldn't even say that he ... he writes that released\nSure but he's not on the committee I can say I want to really also but that's about all the way I Want to watch that video camera\nOn the air and said that that would put some pressure on the\nRoad I guess so you know so then maybe Cory gets thirty nine percent instead of thirty six percent I mean [laughter] who cares\nYou know I and I just I don't care about the response\nAnd that's good to know that you know\nThat he couldn't do that often but I still think that if it's if we started putting some pressure on me that if if it started getting out and everybody started coming in and I think there will be forced to do it and let the chips fall where they you know there's certainly some Republicans in there too but just let the chips\nFall where they may what's what's bringing out the hope that was our morning\nI agree I agree\nWith the growing up in her father too where are you single now\nWhat do you think about the terminal here are worried about like\nA man who doesn't you know they got some garbage on that guy [noise]\n\nThink and the one beer and no one beer turned me off to that came out of nowhere she only had one beer it's like hey look I've watched so many talk shows where where they pulled the guy out a pulley guy over and say how many beers yes because I don't want and it's on the stump hundred bark never say one beer 'cause when you say one beer\nYou and I were the only

was\nThere and how how hard it was okay to be that\nWind who you're up there like did you take it out of a cooler or did somebody handed to you I mean if you give if he can remember that you only had one beer\nI Would think you could remember all the details about beer was a beer warm or cold weather or back then thirty seven years ago I don't even think they had a light beer\nSo what what type of deal with it I mean\nAll of the shower to drink it out of the class exactly or or did die I can\nRemember Thirty years both going to a party where I didn't have any [noise] I\nI mean if you ask anybody in America go back thirty seven years to a party tell me how many beers you track like one one guy I mean there's nobody can do that\nI don't know how many ... why I didn't know if I had a

remember\nYou're in Connecticut but you kind of federal Ritchie place but they don't work place it was so maybe the kids got it and they probably what the cheap here so it could be\nAny of these five
