Barbara gets none of that uh because the Republicans get away with their constitutional obligation or on a do or you know to to designate projects\nSo this makes it even more difficult race it it's a single digit race at this point and ah I've seen ... she's\nIn terms of their operate search or marketing what it is so I think this race quotas and so I've seen races close a lot more at this point but this was this was a tough\nRace it's a tough atmosphere and as they tough district then remember\nThe last five delegates in that seat in in right in the house last time in some of them like money and money and did everything right you bring in a very good campaign and he wants to double digits or a dead grief in honor of her campaign went but lost badly so right now this is where the anger is at this point and they're using her as a messenger\nEnsure that what was that ... thing you said again just so he wants to be as I'll be makes the ... [laughter]\nI just I got to treat that out at eight thirty are driven Tom Davis a chapter you to send in your guts of the truth you John just rhetoric let's get to the other races um\nLet's get to the seven I just had Barbara I just said Abigail Spanberger on my show yesterday she's a very complex candidate no doubt but ah I see a little momentum going for Dave I didn't think it was going to win and we should do now I I think he is going to win a\nHow do you see that race so I I had that one at ... Republican up until the Kavanaugh hearings at this point I think it's a toss up and be done with the Kavanaugh hearing stand was really re energized and fire up the one voter block\nThat's the problem for Dave Brat in some district which is suburban women\nUm and I think that the seven districts historically Republican should be a Republican voter Republican Fred left me um so I did my ship 'em but I'm the one path or a Democrat there isn't an right go in Chesterfield with the suburban women\nUm and I think Abigail the match for them and I think that the Republicans are doing everything they can to lose that block naturally right now um and so I have and it's a tough one\nI think many crew late August Kavanaugh's nomination in terms of I mean I enter let me just say yeah in in terms of what this is doing politically and I think we all live\nOur own echo chambers and we all have our own perceptions of how it's done but what this was done in the nearest polling and some other polling demonstrate this is the Republican base is now activated enthusiasm gap which is favored the Democrats for the last year and a half is now closed substantially\nAnd I think that works to prop secret ... David Wright has two two issues though outside the demographics district in the DNA that district is Republican\nNumber one he is not close the deal with some of cancers people and they were just as soon thrown under the boss and rent that she'd out for two years\nAnd bring back or ... you know somebody it's more in line with their thinking and and even some scores and secondly Tim Kaine is going to be exceptionally strong in that district he was mayor of Richmond if he has a political he's widely ... he's gonna say my wife ... but he's well regarded enrichment where he was mayor he run I make that happen\nSo you've got a factor that into this thing I still think at the end of the day that the DNA of that district establishes itself and bright wins but the but this was a close race in Democrats have nominated ... she's\nVery and whatever happens you're talking about uh somebody that's got to be involved in democratic politics for some time I think I think Abigail Spanberger is going to happen is gonna be somebody's got to be reckoned with a and a democratic circles for some time shop\nDot die you know I don't I don't know a ton about the district or I you know I Will say I was driving down the south side Virginia's Hugo current events last weekend and going through some of the rural counties and it seems like you're Brad can pull Marjah data those counties are but obviously the critical mass of the the district is in Chesterfield man right go so\nYou know I I Would probably say you know robotically it's a Republican district but obviously if it's a wave your than it could be one that the Democrats deal than would have to defend the twenty twenty\nOr let's get to the second district Taylor Maria whatever happened with a tale of the other day I had him on my radio show or the a campaign put my [noise] my name and their team TV ads so I appreciate the PR for that what's going on in that race but\nThis is my first chance to respond to Scott right after he had his meltdown on your show on that went viral yet I'm Upset about our analysis last time um and now this has not changed he's still dinners um and\nUm I don't think I don't believe in New York Times poll I think it was you know I I up to this point I thought you know kind of shows were pretty good at the last week they've they've not been um I think there's some noise going on\nI'm ... I think what is going to win and she's going to win going away [noise] um so I think she's been a wind going away I think it's going to be a [noise] a secular up until two months ago I was doing everything like um and he's really blown it\nAnd he's not going to win re election then from are you saying because of the whole the ballot issue as soon as she was this year in a way he's handled it and remember that this district is one of the few in the country\nThat not only sits in the ... side a media market but it in a media market\nThat doesn't really stretch too many other districts so the media has been all over the years on the evening news every night you know if Barbara Comstock has had a petition scandal and attempt district it would have made the CD for forty five seconds one night\nOr maybe a week later they quickly re mentioned that you know it goes way you you cannot get away\nWith something like the tide water it's been on hand to roast here so let me let me make I look I think are the New York transport\nProperty rights taken is fixed that district very well um you know at the navy seal all that kind of stuff is is the issue matrix is chosen I think you're in line with that district is not a far right kind of guy he understands a suburban Virginia Beach in those areas\nSo we have all that going for him now this petition scandal has a little bit of a margin on him or Democrats\nRepublican what scares me about this is the fact that if you look nationally Democrats just a ton of cash\nAnd dropping a couple of million dollars on that race in the last week that megaphone just can overwhelm at this point in exaggerate these things I think I think New York times pulls correcting papers up today a again if I were betting I I I think he wins\nBut in this environment with the kind of money Democrats put down a you've got to be nervous about this here to Washington certain election night if the Democrats win this seat\nIt tells me it's going to be a pretty good year for farm in terms of we're talking thirty five forty yeah\nI think about [noise] that are the thing about this district is different than Comstock and it's definitely different than a brat\nIs the turnout model is totally different and I think it's hard for Democrats to win the seat and are not presidential year I'd just based on who vote democratic and Virginia Beach Norfolk it's you know that the typical democratic voters going to be a minority down there and let you get an outsized performance it's not\nI think it's tough for the Democrats to win that seat I mean Glenn I wanted two thousand and he got washed down the drain and twenty ten\nAnd the reason was democratic book came out in the presidential year for Brock Obama it wasn't there the next cycle for Glenn Nye 'cause nobody knew when I was [noise]\nUm I think Scott Scott advantage is that the turnout I remember back when I was in the house carcass we'd look at the turnout bottles and the numbers and\nYou know Virginia Beach in Norfolk the numbers are just forty percent of what they are in other parts of the state so it's just it's it's you got a lot of people that live there that are you know enlisted men or women that are registered to vote elsewhere so it's just it's hard you know to to bring people out in that type of environment even though it's bench correct your one media market and\nYou know they could publish Scott from now till the end of the time but there's going to be a conservative there's going to be a conservative vote is going to come out\nAnd whether uh uh Maria I don't know how to pronounce it ... whether or not she can get people out based on her name as opposed to you know Tim Kaine is not as big a magnet there as he is enrichment um so I I still think it's a pill for the Democrats even though I agree that looks like Scott's kind of watch this one issue\nNinety six and tell me this one member this well I'm ... we had a we had a scandal um statewide where John Warner put a television ad up against Mark Warner who is John Warner was far ahead and um he photo shop Mark Warner and your picture\nOr who's in the ... I Can't remember who he told us about what he thought it was up at ... I think yeah he's sociable with Clinton but was it was while her son and he's glad there was a racial aspect to it too I Can't remember what they did but they sort of shut my corner to a picture he wasn't in\nAnd um Internet TV ad and it was a huge went national scandal for John Warner who had a moderate brands and was a\nGuy that you know everyone looked she likes either what you're trying to say Scott Taylor is there like had a friend okay and and and that people you know like respected John Warner much higher than Scott Taylor though [noise] and and his numbers collapsed and Mark Warner was going to win that race because of scandal and I will say this which I'm Wondering did was he walked out\nShip and I'm responsible for what happened and I apologize and it's got telling her done that he would want to\nAugust I was worse campaign chairman that year and it was a it was a close race Merck worse than fourteen million dollars at his own money that year that may just really a much closer race than it might have been otherwise good strong when it was used on ... to ... or ... or the map the kind of heard it after running a close race there but I remember it out and I mean they fired\nThe people that were involved in the ad and everything else and you broke it and it it was an issue for a week or two then jumps accountability you took accountability [noise] said or has mishandled this thing I think it's just kind of destruction in having his people take the Fifth Amendment doesn't help it just keeps it in the news\nIs that enough to bring down somebody with a good reputation has done a good job in their first term or not\nUm and also I think the the wave turnout are they talking about a new wave I think you're really talking about ... [noise] that's really what's happening with the Democrats is the is the suburban female voters have swung radically or to the Democratic\nParty that we're going to take up we'll get our predictions rolling it back the next segment we got to get to the Redskins yeah I\nUm and to not only in Thirteen were there but not that popular when they're running and libertarian broke five percent and libertarians the automatic ballot access to the next five years in Virginia which ... which are the Republican that was going to expire this year 'cause no pertains had not crack five percent again\nAnother Cory ... there'll be another five years the libertarian automatic ballot access loud they're\nGreat and why that is a good point and the water is going to get over five no question probably seven partners here to excel last year which I think you think is going to win or lose\nUh [noise] uh what what uh what about\nTaylor Maria\n[noise] going on [noise]\nAnd I see you alert [noise]\n\n\nAnd [noise] uh stand a\nTerrorist gotten nothing but negative publicity from a over the last several months and I don't see 'em climbing out of that old could be wrong but I don't see that and I also don't\nI mean you know [noise] Comstock can talk about her internal so she wants that's not what people are picking up going door to door [noise]\nSo what have you heard of that risk [noise] I'm just I mean you know when when the Democrats have gone to independent doors I'm not talking about\n[noise] that those people are telling her there whether\nAnd when on occasion they've asked what's the main complaint [noise] uh if and this is for counting all 'cause I talk to anybody since then [noise] uh it it was the ads have been effective but this capping off thing\nI mean that's all the door to door and that's all I get\nI mean you think as far\nBut just got to go we've we've we've got to get to the rest yup we've got to get the beginning Monday Night ride Carolina right start with where the earliest [noise] right you have to be happy so far\nYeah generally happy I think the defence like I said a month ago young fast a good ... and they're going to get better I think there'd be Pence will get better\nUm I I think they need to give a couple of guys more snaps a couple of guys less naps but by and large I liked their defense to be a top ten defense this year and for the next few years going forward make the players\nI think they do they have one issue that need to solve [noise] and I can solve it if they listen to me they all week on the ends they don't have any big play receivers that could go down catch the ball you know catch eight ball for a hundred yards\nAnd you need to have that too when consistently in the NFL you can't just keep throwing too you're tied into your backs especially with a\nTight and like Jordan read the genetically going to get insurance if something does is on the street [noise] he's bet on the streets I in you know Bruce was my firm Booz Allen I emailed him literally within twelve hours if they're being taught by Dallas [noise] begging begging them to pick up and as I have repeated it every time I said um [noise]\nThe day he sets foot on Redskins park you'll be their number one receiver they could get rid of Josh dachshund yes I said that\nThey could keep Jamieson and crowd around the slot they can get that keep that keep records in a number to receiver cruise fast\nBut then you need a big receiver who can pull down eight non temples again for a hundred yards desk and do it and so if they put him on the team they will be the best team the NFC East and will make the playoffs while you were [noise]\nDallas like losing um I think it's [laughter] you know they don't like to when they like to lose a why did you know why do they do what they do what do they keep Jason geared its head coach you know I mean\nWhy did they get rid of Tony Romo and it's just I I think somewhere Jerry Jones just decided he was tired of winning the waters start losing for a while and so that's that's why does what he does\nThat what do you think that I mean is that the answers that the parents [noise]\nI I'm I'm favorable and dance and I can't believe we're talking about the Redskins not referring to him as the first place yeah that's true first place and a phrase for it or like the first place [noise] type yeah that's right I I'm going to say at this point a lot better than I thought there'd be this year still very\nVery tough schedule the next five weeks I'm going to say nine and seven\nAnd that may be enough to make a profit because the eagles are struggling and the cowboys and the giants are not good at all this year so\nOver ... you're going to [noise] you know James since Ninety four\nAnd one of the things that the Redskins of lack for some time to speak Damon and\nI Can't remember the last time I'm sure I'll probably miss something but I cannot remember the last time I've seen the Redskins a

on the way to know whether to clap season [noise] no not\nAll right I'm going to go in the middle I think they're going to win ... games I think you gotta make playoff and here's your here's the thing about Alex [noise] I'm not a fan of it because you can't win big games in the playoffs and so we've got an exciting quarterback but you know I've watched them now three weeks I'm not a fan one way or the other but they're on TV [noise]\nBut I mean he managed gangs and he's never going to be you're never going to feed himself and\nHe kind of ...

Ninety four he's going to make a serious run up being the number one goal swore an inch on history and the capture of an incredibly bright future um and\nI'll just end with saying this my dilemma right now I put a thousand dollars in the capital last year when the Stanley Cup in Las Vegas Fifteen the one we want to in Vegas that the cash for tickets Fifteen thousand dollars when I catch the ticket the person at the counter told me the biggest payout she's ever paid at the sports book\nOr when people will take about like that and rolled over for two or three seasons and she said you know if the caps three feet and you wrote us money over it'll be two million dollars by the time they have to repeat so I'm Still having this dilemma for the rest of the season I have not\nDone anything with the money yet because it may be that like you know it was just a thousand dollar initial investment I might need to roll it over a couple of times because I think the caps are legitimate threat not only to repeat the sheer potentially be a three peat I'm only after all that every year so that's my dilemma\nBut I'm leaning towards the right now I actually think this team is a special team\nAnd one that um is going to have a lot of success going forward [noise]\nI get what you're saying ah I bet the Astros last year to win the world series of tech and one as you know because you put to better for you and I in fact the ticket we did we didn't get to take it as\n[noise] but uh that are concentration will be in a high concentration to district but also in\nA several others I mean you know we're not going to spread it all out all over the state [noise] um ... you have to know you know you gotta play where your\nWhere your to your strength\nAnd it would be there I think a Ralph one uh [noise]\nI think we're out [noise]\nBlacks district in even more like a in Stuart events district\nAnd uh you know the dynamics are changing in this and it's not just so much a matter of fact of Trump or anything the demographics in the state or changing and they're changing almost daily and\nAh it's obvious which way you know they're moving are we going to be like Maryland no we're not going to be like Maryland but we um northern Virginia is beginning to look more and more in northern Virginia suburbs more and more not totally but more and more like the Maryland suburbs\nNational it's not just reached want me right happening nationally and nice guy various\nRight at least in New Jersey suburb send things going on everywhere you know rather sites every but you're seeing this you're seeing this an awful lot and um [noise] I think we have an excellent chance and no question we're getting help from the guy in the White House\nWhether he'll be there or not you know a a ... I was joking with Mark Warner and I said you know we well we we need them they're just one more election [laughter] you know but I mean it's you know\nI'm a generally speaking we've done better [noise] generally speaking when there's been a Republican and the White House have there been exceptions yes\nGenerally speaking the Republicans have done better when the Democrats been in the White House have there been exceptions yes but the trend is there and it was a mistake of all time yeah understand and I\nI Would be surprised if we didn't know you know get to Twenty one in the in the election at a minimum\nYeah I think I I I tend to ... you know you still have to defend a couple of states like you got a couple of comments he got one over on the eastern shore that that is in play I think Republicans can hold with the black needs if they don't have the black I\nI think you're far weaker today a competent probably anybody else in the air just some personal proclivities and\nAnd and things that I think that hurts him among some of those voters we have some stronger candidates don't or black or you know I don't know what happens there he's got a hundred and fifty thousand in the bank so I didn't sound like he's ready to go away very quickly but\nI Will do my advice him and he got no when ... when the phone and you want to go out to undefeated not indicted if you could do that and I think last before in ... when he and house belly gets any moves up over the first district to run for Congress and then he comes back but I don't think you want to end your career because I I think you beat him\nA dream it's a very attractive candidate a you've but you've got some issue ... after the initial matrix theory has not really too early voting record [noise]\nUm [noise] ah to that district and you've got the state house at fifty one forty nine into redistricting that's critical happened that made many I mean we have to wait and see but may work and the Democrats favor [noise]\nUm [noise]\nI mean it would appear that the judges are going to wind up drawing that house district as health eleven house districts\nThat's going to also be what the Senate's going to have to abide by twenty Twenty one and uh it could change or you know or it could change an awful lot [noise]\nUm you know a pause the districts are unpacked not totally but below the numbers I mean look what Bobby Scott\nI mean his district one from what fifty some fifty six percent down to you know low forties and I'm a [noise] you know produced another democratic district\nSo you're gonna have to see how that plays out but it seems to me\nThat uh the judges drawing that district is by far and away their\nTheir best bet and if they do you know the Supreme Court I think it ruled before that gerrymandering is is has been constitutionally permissible until spills over in racial discrimination\nAnd therein lies the problem and that's what the Republicans are facing there and it's going to change its going to change the way you know a whole makeup of legislatures\nAround the country we're going to court for a five to\nFour court will do this differently from each other when they go back if I may be wrong but I think when they send it back to that lower court it was like seven to two and actually well I I just think one of the thing is you can understand the Republican\nBase for better for worse is migrated from your country club at the country instead of doing they've taken out of some competitive districts were these were economic issues will be very level\nSo it's not just the demographic steak arrives factor things have changed the emphasis on issues in ways that help them in South West Virginia but but it hurts them in the growing parts of the state\nCan we talk about the ... and also with a very popular governor with very low negative and you look at ... numbers ... support amongst Democrats\nWas not popular among Republicans was more polarizing in numbers Ralph Northam has incredibly low negative ads for somebody in this environment you look nationally um he has very high positive very low negatives um and in going into these competitive seats [noise]\nUm I remember in ... eleven and Democrats drew the state Senate lines and they lost the majority and who was that the person who was in every Republican ... splitting the seats with Bob McDonnell a in a popular governor can play a big role now and that's a big um item that timetable here\nAnd these are still nationalize races I don't care how you slice of the national environment plays Baltimore that you have to have a messenger more into\nHealth breakthrough spectrometer turning out the Thomas writes the the I mean it that that national same ways very heavily you know which is why you've had you know the the patterns that you've had\nUntil McCarthy Cuccinelli I mean you know what happened for almost fifty\nI mean I I mean I just want other surveys like let's take for example that started in the [noise] that started in seat was not driven by national politics and twenty Fifteen it was driven by ...\nUm and I think that we and we don't know if we have more aggressive Canada but we don't have we ended up in campaigns don't matter you know I don't think we had to I don't think made a great and I sort of there I think if you rerun that Tim racing twenty Nineteen and you had Ralph Northam on TV\nI'm In that district Ralph with what they're not going to be as they are they going to vote the votes stardom and it's chaos is going to create problems for them\nI think that's a greater problem is that he's he's he's not harmonious with their district on some of those hot button issue or just say that like Rob workers that are good governor I think it's a wonderful man but he gives a fireside chat and the fire goes down you put him on TV it it it's not the same kind of rally the tape\nBut he's an asset to them and make it it didn't even have to use that I don't I you know he's not it is that's the kind of governor you actually need this and he picked up not a fiery he picked up Fifteen feet I mean I think\nIn terms of color things it's fiery and I'm at a carnival Barker one and and he doesn't he doesn't pick up seats Labour up north I'm dead\nWell north of didn't pick 'em up Trump picked\nHim up for him yet if Trump would have been president and twenty Fifteen we'd be in All right let's\nLook I I mean I I decided I don't want to do on Ralph Northam disagree however I think he's been let's just\nSay the chemical upon my three points and rapper with them on by eight and ... picked up zero seats north and pick up fifty five point difference was not fifteenth ... are either but it was also a hotel different let\nMe tell you there in the White House break about Trump okay I was a driving factor check uh last November on top of that\nUm [noise] you had a ... and spilled over into everything [noise]\nAnd keep in mind Gillespie was not true but you know\nI mean he was very polarized [noise] but um I just think people keep underestimating as governor oh oh I don't think anybody underestimate [noise] I don't think anybody underestimate same but they noticed I mean you know what's driving politics in Virginia right now is not a Ralph\n[noise] ah it's it's what's going on across the Potomac River\nIt's negativity is driving politics on both sides right now and the one thing about Robert when he doesn't that many negative [noise] doesn't have any either very likely to or not\nI'm not you know I've now go you know been knocking on doors since may I have not gotten one negative comment about ground non and that's you know it's ... I mean people like him he's just a likeable person\nIs not a not a politician you know I I agree with that is an asset but he's not a fire reader that gets me vote out for\nI I think Tom Davis is not a fire eater they've got to put up for the Republicans but for Twenty years every single Republican repeats you would have thought the person was married to Tom Davis because the Republican candidate had his picture bigger than their own picture where the corporate I'm saying like here's why they'd be great for your time sometimes with rich and um so I mean having a messenger\nIs important and Democrats are not had good letters letter that Len Ralph Northam in the first time in a [noise]\nYour arteries right I agree I agree but now he's taking our income that we are not entirely different that\nI don't know I tell you what man I I'm all\nRight Joe Joe is kind of Peter ... you can't underestimate Morsi and I'm telling you what he had a disastrous press conference I wasn't there and it was a\nDisaster of all time so he had a disastrous press conference that really hurt him to all kinds of underhanded things going on but you know after that\n... and you know the the thing about Joe is an independent sector he's got to go is the only way\nTo you know he's not\nA he's not a whole bunch of any of the establishment caucuses or anything like that\nI think he's got to play very well in that district and I think a lot of his uh friends there that I don't think that he got screwed by what they did to him and and\nGet a job more seeded the smartest thing I've ever seen anyone doing politics when he when the when I think it was the mceachin see one Mickey chintzy on each and moved up I think and in that primary people and think he was gonna win that primary crowded field\nAny more than a landslide networks people are asking what do you run around and after he knocked on doors at you know and I wrote a handwritten note to every voter he spoke to but David it for a week and a half before the election in the context of as if he had remembered the conversation\n... kept these postcards for six months and send them all out ten days before the election with a handwritten note from him talking about how their conversation and you know and that your dog Sam or you're a teacher here and I remember that conversation and do you know hope I can count on your support next Tuesday and people\nCame out in droves that mean for him to go do that though and I I I've seen people read postcards but I've never seen one posting them to make it appear as a month later okay what companies that I'm Tom Davis has everything better than anyone in politics later but [noise]\nBut he did that for anyone in a landslide and like\nIt's been done before it ... I don't underestimate Joe I'm just saying\nTake on incumbent district like I did it it's I feel I'm not I mean there's not going to be poor five people in that race either gonna just to I'm not an expert on that's the big difference you know if we had you know there's a whole lot of people have gotten to the general assembly because we don't have run off\nIn the state a whole and and you won't have that you'll just have to people in there and she's well why [noise]\nI don't think I if I had the gas and I I can be totally wrong with us live in that district and I guess that Ross dance has extremely low name id pardon I Would guess that route the answer that\nPol Pot [noise] I'm just [noise] but like in terms of I'd name id Richard Nixon had our name on it\n[laughter] I mean like I don't think rises like real superstar the Senate\nJak hung up you know Joe and I know Joe\nAnswer it got to get out how we're stumped think like Fifteen or twenty to one okay Joe was out there knocking on doors and making phone calls now\nBetween the fastball primary too in that primary like Dick was in the ... district for Twenty years before you got drawn to say the price basically has a concept of campaigning and knocking on doors and doing the things that you do and you're in a competitive political rate for Seventy percent of the vote in my district Mondale yeah rock this has never been in their lifetime\nPresumably Confederate says she's never been\nOut of and you got to ask you before and she's got to get out of work I'm a joke that at work or he's fighting Joe he's gotta he's gotta worker and\nThe other thing there is a human do they get I'm telling you he was going to get a sense of clear the sympathy vote out there for the fact that the power banks enrichment screwed this guy out of his livelihood\nAnd that that's real I mean he got screwed I mean what he pulled his long life\nIt looks senator Stanley told me the whole thing is I ... it was blown [laughter] what happened there was a total bologna\nAnd it was because uh it was it was the cause you challenged the Richmond system that's what happened and that's why they told him and so I just I'll come November that\nLike you know there are a lot of people in that area that have and and this is a loyalty to Joe ...\nThe reason he does well there's a lot of people there that is represented and when families have had a time of need you know the attorney they went through the criminal defense attorney to help out someone in their family and there was Joe Morsi and that created a level of loyalty he has a ... I\nI'm not ready to call this went one way or the other yet\nBut um he has a real ... [noise] it's it's across that district the from being an attorney I'm In the same way that Donald McEachin you know when he when he ran rubber on his running\nYou know him as a primary challenge of what three times two incumbents are twice twice as the challenger didn't come a delegate to the one to the challenger doing I'm senator\nAnd mceachin was the guy who everyone news on TV it was a lawyer um he had to help so many people in the community it didn't matter that he was a challenger to an incumbent\nI'm not telling him how much they thought he was going right and ... I mean he has helped a lot of people in those in those communities where they don't know who to turn to joy Morsi has been the guy who's defending their nephew their son um you know against major charges that area is one of the top defense attorneys there so I just\nI I I think that it's an interesting race than in ... we got to see you know we'll round even run again\nRamona let me look ahead to twenty Twenty one the governorship or where to come come through and a lot of um determine who's in the White House is using that dynamic and so on but when it goes well the attorney general within a governor clash at that who else is looking at this at this point in the Democratic party\nPerry Ellen was not out of the picture either either [noise] now I Would imagine that you're running you know of course but [noise] I Would I Would hope that herring in Fairfax thanks for delta or not to see a contestant nomination so when you've got a lot of people in the back looking for upward mobility\nYou're the mayor of Richmond stoning knocked a mother wanted him getting her yellow sitting there on you'll have a primary and\nYou'll just have to see if it's a [noise]\nExcess ... can be dangerous if only I think you only a [noise]\nLong as you don't have a two way right [noise] uh\nBetween Fairfax [noise] and uh I think that if a if it's if it's one of them against the whole batch of other people they win [noise] uh you know Fairfax\nYou're carrying on with the outside I like you guys are talking about herring and a Fairfax you're not talking about before stony who was absolutely going to do something he was the other person you're not talking about\nWho can pull the upset in a two or three person race and that's ...

I like Chinese is good friend but they're going to either line up behind the ear herring for Fairfax whereabouts stony and I don't even know now I don't I don't I didn't know that are the same thing with all of our record got people like him but they're either going to go with one of those\nToo [laughter] [laughter] well how ... going to be a Republican anyway to Trump's going to be gone and Twenty one now is going to win again [noise] ...
