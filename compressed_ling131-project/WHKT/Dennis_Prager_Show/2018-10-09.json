starts out by apologizing to the American people for the debacle offer the clown show the Democrats put on which was a great opening in their lives and I was only four rows back in the media so it's right there front and center and\nI was shocked by it but I thought it was great and then he also apologized to judge Kavanaugh and his family for having gone through the nonsense and\nA lot of polls showing Cory now that the Democrats overplay their hand backfiring that Trump voters are fired up what are you seeing on the ground\nOr young when she was actually right or this president to apologize to judge Kavanaugh family\nFor white doors and windows or main street will never apologize the accusations the attacker character and went after his reputation was unprecedented apologies the main street you know these people doubled down and\nIt's such a crushing when it's a concern it's one thing when it's going to know that we see [noise] times now no matter what the wedding cakes liberals will say well we thought it was the truth when they're using language that conservatives couldn't say well you know that was when the person was young we stick by them or whatever it is is always\nA double standard to what the president outlined yesterday\nWhen he was saying a judge Kavanaugh as Justice Kennedy was\nVery different sentiment older he has to do which is to bring attention to what could be which was the appropriate tactic judge Kavanaugh family received from not just the ... but also from the mainstream and has the\nBiggest microphone world and what he did yesterday [noise] the right thing to do and I can tell you and I said to me\nParty in search of one of the party for Trump one of the party everybody right now it's illegal for four weeks from today because I have seen now what the wrath of wants to do what they're capable of doing and what they will do if they took back the house of representatives which is\nTalking about impeachment both of our president and moreover job just Kavanaugh already so the Republicans are you there fired up and you're seeing that in the polling data and too much closer elections than the mainstream media wants to give us credit for\nThat's what these guys want to do your kids book comes out in early December McCain who is deputy director the FBI who was fired for among other reasons you know running a lying to the FBI under oath on three occasions he was fired for that book is coming up because they all profit off of\nDonald Trump and wants to sell in the book world it's delicious stories about Donald Trump we've seen it now with fire and fury in Woodward and all the other you know tabloids that have been out there and published but my guess is what Rod Rosenstein is going to do he will use his\nPerch and number two person at the department of justice took when he finally leads whether he's firing quits juggling write a book and just you know be gaining against this president because that's how these guys stay alive and how these guys you know in the public arena and it really is a terrible terrible thing to be honest with you\nAgree with the new allegations out now\nThe rock scene\nComments that he was going to attempt to wired wired to the president and they're going to send them off and then go to the cabinet to invoke between them and get them out and get us to be a senior official saying they believe them and they thought he was dead serious\nThey reported that to their\nHouse or James Baker he thought it was seriously thought it was the way that would just do it for me that's awful me why doesn't the wind just\nLike I I think I think you're an actor I think the president wants to get through this election cycle doesn't want anything to distract the Republicans have momentum on their side but I Do think you have to work long term the building of Rod Rosenstein to stay in that position what it wants to leave the position he can do that anytime\nHe can resign if he wants to but I think you have to call into question does he have the ability to continue in his capacity as a deputy attorney general based on the information that we're hearing from other members\nOther senior members that served with him which will capacity in the department of justice or the FBI they're saying that their accounting for\nWhat McCain said to be true that shouldn't be very troubling to everybody and we do know on a quickly that Rod Rosenstein who signed one of the fires application renewable which\nFor application has never been made available to the president's not redacted that we need that we need to\nSee that we need to see the three to choose which are the FBI's notes after they talk to Bruce or at the department of justice to see what's in there and we have to understand what the insurance policy\nWas to keep Donald Trump from being elected that the FBI was talking about what role if any road missing in that because as the deputy attorney general he had the right to sign\nThat fight application and from what I understand and what is becoming widely known now\nThat's my application was riddled with mistakes and and it was based on the false premise about faith in God\nAnd that last renewable actually signed when Donald Trump was the sitting president of the United states and the American people deserve the rights to see what was in that renewal applications that Rod Rosenstein\nYou recognize the Robin Jones' November\nAnd look at what I Would recommend to the president is declassified all of the documents let the American people decide and see what has actually transpired the FBI's credibility because of what gym called me and Amy McCain and now James Baker and Peter shock and Lisa Page and have done that organization\nIs just devastating it will take decades to recover from what they have done jet organization trying to use their positions people went to the party people badgers going after American citizens spying on American\nCitizens because we do like the political affiliation over their opponents were anything that our country has been against parents is instruction and I'd like to just record the head of the counterterrorism unit had more ability than anybody\nHe was the one boxer Clinton email investigation he won who led the team was called crossfire hurricane that say hey there's nothing to seeing these extra six hundred thousand ... ... email there were all part of the winners\nAnd he's the one who said hey let's go after Donald Trump he's only learned that investigation we've\nSeen it now with the text messages between the page and Peter Struck and they worked at least minimum complicit with what Jim Comey and McCain and Jim Baker and potentially Robert\nSteam worn down and the question is John and this is a very very big question how did this go in the U.S government we know that the director of the CIA and the ... and director of national intelligence and others were aware of this spying going on\nOn domestic soil against us citizens but actually how I get to go\nTo the biggest untold story of the last two years because this could lead right up to the very top of the government\nWhich leads to Jeff Sessions what is your what what happened to just [noise] doing launching\nThe United states history ever um why people for political gain all the way up to see and everything else where Jeff Sessions\nWill look Nicole investigation has been by and large turned over to uh the id the inspector general of the department of justice to find out if there's been any wrongdoing and we've seen some of that report already because there's been released publically to report that recommended\nThe number two person at the FBI normally be fired but charged criminally\nWe're waiting for that to occur uh we're waiting to see what happens to a pianist rock and Lisa Page and and and Jim Baker the general counsel from the FBI we're waiting to find out what happened\nTo the gym combing because it is very possible that Jim Comey was brought up on charges of potentially perjury in front of Congress leaking of classified information even though Jim said he didn't think it was classified that's not an excuse\nWouldn't do that he gave his notes his work product which was he was not allowed to do to the law professor to make sure that that could lead to the media there's been no accountability anybody at any level of the government for what they've done which was try to\nTry to influence the outcome of the U.S election because of what Clinton supporters by and large and they did not want to see today Trump become President Trump and I don't understand where the accountability is and why they haven't come out yet\nNovember's are we going to say\nBoy I Hope so John I really hope so and I and I and I hope for the president sake on that he has a team focused on helping him achieve all of the result which he's been able to do by and large almost singlehandedly if you look at what the president's been able to accomplish\nWhat three point seven percent unemployment the lowest unemployment rate\nFor African Americans and Hispanics he's done some of this ah when I went to help others in lieu of his staff quite candidly and we've seen in the Woodward book or the staff tried on multiple occasions to stop them from doing things and stopping trying to stop him from being successful but he's persevering he's\nGone on and Duncan historic levels just think for a second\nIf you had a staff that surrounded him that actually wanted him to be successful thinking how much more he could accomplish he's done so much already but\nThere are still people who don't want to see him be successful there are still people who serve in the government or whether they're bureaucrats elected officials or people who have taken positions that didn't support him in the campaign and they're still trying to stop or gender at every turn and for\nAll of this excess or he has had in the first two years with the mystery shopping I can only wonder how much more he could have had if he had the right team around him supporting him every step of the way in all these government agencies\nFor the first thing you need to do November Corey brings down the street and my goodness you're right you think if you look at all this president of the topics and twenty months\nTaking things off of the residents of just targeting things from a checking your cell phone could go to websites or not divulging information I mean it's almost criminal what they've done on this was his own staff just the people that are there to serve the president's agenda and\nThey were nothing but an obstacle trying to stop and he's doing and he still got all this accomplish it's an amazing what you can only imagine in the next two years when he could do if he has a house and he has the Senate and he's got people in there actually are\nAdvocating for his agenda rather than doing everything to stop it or stall it unbelievable corn without you thank you for being with us rejoice book like Trump the Trump got another great book coming out Trump's enemies that's due out in November I Believe that
