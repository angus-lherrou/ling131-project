like guys in the for you send your district oh no I'm Sorry rent you moved to the second I forgot whatever okay I\nDidn't know you put that on the air [laughter] Ryan uh\nRyan I'm not a fan of that Ryan let me just ask you this straight out so you're going to I'm Republican I'm Sorry\nAn American churches and other things obviously you have to get Democrats crowds to consider voting for you in order to win\nAs you're talking to Democrats Ryan what did they say well\nWe have a program on his back up a little bit one of the things I think that makes me unique is that I'm a pastor must have been a social worker I care about a lot of things that I Believe the African American typically the urban area's really care about like we've already talked about welfare public housing I care about criminal justice reform I've seen that close and\nSo those are things we're talking about the economy is just as you believe and I believe is just\nGoing through the roof because booming and that's a good for all Americans really been good for African Americans actually the unemployment is you know the lowest it's ever been\nSo we talk about the economy and as you know a lot of African Americans particularly the the conservative African Americans in the church are very conservative socially so we talk about her life and and he'll do it or they stand ... what's the other hand when you have\nWho are telling them but when you go to a Democrat who voted for McCain voted for Clinton there a democratic voter and you're going to Richmond her Petersburg and you say I'm Ryan McAdams I'm a Republican running for Congress blah blah blah what did they say\nWhat are they what they said to me is you're right because I'll tell them you know what the Democratic Party has done anything for you they made a lot of promises but they really haven't produced anything and they say you're right and then I say you know what and Republicans haven't come and talk to you and message to you and ask for your vote and they've taken for granted in that sense\nAnd they say you're right and I say well I'm here and I started I to me I'm not about Republican or Democrat about solutions last solutions for you I have conservative solutions for you I'm not different solutions in the Democratic party has\nBut I've got solutions for you and I believe that the work I Believe that's going to give you the jobs that you need in this community I Believe it's going to give you the redevelopment that you need opportunity don't and we talk about that I Believe it's going to give you the portable housing\nThat you need I mean we get we're not going to solve all their problems but I Believe that hey compared to what the Democrats have given you which is nothing I mean we are a huge step up and I'm actually here I'm president\nYou know that's the one thing that they said you know what you're here and I appreciate that\nAnd then when I tell them I'm a pastor when I tell them in a social worker\nTheir eyebrows go up you know they're like oh really and they want to know more they want to know they want to know why I'm In this race they want to know well how do you feel about the president and I tell them I said you know what I Love the president I Love his policies but I'm not the president on my own person I have a different tone or you don't have a more moderate tone I'm One that wants to be a bridge builder\nI Want to reach out I Want to bring us together I'm not a device a voice\nAnd say whatever you think about the Democratic party or your current congressman is easy to devise a voice all he has to do is tear down tear down the president\nAnd said I'm here to build up I'm not here to to talk even to tear down the Democratic party for the most part I'm here to tell you the solutions that I have for your community and you know what it resonates with people because you know what people's steep in me and then I'm often it just like the president and all these you love that about the president I Love that about the president\nThat he's an authentic guy and what he says is really what he believes the weather\nTell you straight I'm not going to try to paint in you know just to tell you what you want to hear a but I I Am solution I really believe that we and I believe the public can party should be going into these areas with solution\nAnd that's what we haven't done the past and that's what I'm doing I Need to do it but you know what I'm a unique candidate because I have a hard to do it and um I mean if you're qualified to do it as a pastor I've worked with the African American community\nReally my whole career and a social worker I worked in public housing I worked a without risk youth mentor to African American kids we we rented taekwondo program with the police department so I've credibility is not like I've just come lately you know I've been there I've done it\nAnd they see that and they know that and we're going in African American church at the same thing and I'm\nStill it resonates because you know what I think African Americans are very sensitive they they can they can read people and uh I think they they I think most of them can read where I'm coming from and my heart and so uh to me we're getting traction what's your website Ryan McAdams for Congress\nDot com primary jobs for Congress comedy the Mike Pence coming in for a rally seven forty five PM or at sun trust the building in Richmond on Saturday October twenty and Saturday October twenty that will be on his website one of the bank rhyme McDonald's for being with us Denver Riggleman coming up he's right here\nFor an authorized by America First policies in corporate is joining us now Denver Riggleman [noise] you know just when you started when get worse after big foot\nLeslie Coburn his Democratic opponent in the fifth district when it crazy campaign this has been because uh I guess when you're down so that you gotta like pro\nHell marriage or something but\nWas recovering under debate Monday Night a week ago she went after Denver's military service on the grounds he was three thousand miles away from Afghanistan\nAt NATO support somebody Diego Garcia\nWhile he works on plans as you know for bombing missions [noise] um apparently applying that they didn't play a big role which of course we know we did and I'm Mr ... an Leslie's coauthor\nHusband are dangerous liaison said that he was snorkeling I mean this is a really crazy campaign Nicole burns or running [laughter]\nI mean that we're going to like say Denver like didn't serve okay uh what else are they going to make up joining us now do that again is the truth in Denver Riggleman he is\nThe Republican candidate for the fifth district in Virginia that's the Lynchburg area through Rowan Oak and Denver\nGreat to have you got to hey good morning John how are you\nOK so a Leslie conference has been said no you didn't put any bombing missions or after the nine eleven attack in Afghanistan that you were snorkeling and Diego Garcia\nYeah I mean I'm you know maybe I think um I think the co burns have a problem with tweeting and they seem to they seem to to get angry and lash out\nOn Twitter but that's how they run their whole campaign as they they say disparaging things they make up things whether it's big foot erotica or white supremacy and you're making fun of military service or saying I don't care about women are taking things out of context and then they rushed to Twitter to the Hollywood friends\nAnd I try to make it national news because you know they have such extreme policies um and I think they're true believers but they're just so out of touch and for a Andrew co burn to get involved to talk about my military service for somebody who's biggest service\nHas been you know making a fantasy books I tell you almost get to the point you just start shaking\nYour head to charge you take them seriously I'll tell you that in and you know they they just to spare a lot of veterans to and by the way John Diego's not the only place I've down and that's the other thing I just I don't have to defend my military service to the likes of them\nWell uh it was throwing a desperate attempt I mean you've got a very very well documented military service and you were the one who was head of the group that was the other one I mean yeah the\nThirty fourth ask expeditionary bomb squad during the amount of Diego which you know what I mean you've talked about many times before and you know like I always told you you know there are situations el harm's way there you know I wasn't I was supporting a bunch of just um awesome individuals\nI'm never going to bad on when you talked to some of the other guys who objected over the Indian Ocean or I was trying to keep them safe but the threats in Afghanistan and\nThey're going after the caves and also all kinds of other things that I Can't talk about honestly and yet um\nYou know it's just funny because they don't understand anything about military service everything they've always done is going about themselves and now they don't understand they enjoying war against the war fighter and they thought this would be a walk over when I came as a new candidate and they're finding out right now that I'm an army fighter and um plus\nYou know I mean I I've had a gun stuck in my chest so you know what the Coburn sorry I don't think they understand the gravity of what they've done and they made this person on a level I never thought somebody would\nWell they're desperate or do you what are some of her you you mentioned in the beginning of the segment Denver Riggleman you mentioned that some of their positions were extreme liberal or can you just name several several of them for\nSure I mean I mean everything they are extremely now with the Medicare for all you know I'm forgiving spouse to them you know there's one point for a trillion and student loan debt debt debt free community college um the fact that day she called 'em\nI stick to stop 'em there's things that we have that we're going to roll out I'm open borders um my goodness um you just go down the line everything that will cause you get\nAbout ... says that she can't come across as modern now she's trying to run to the middle ah she knows her positions are extreme so that's why she stays in Charlottesville she doesn't really go outside the district\nMuch anymore she likes to stay in her ... her ... and I think it really comes down to she's a true believer and I and I know what I got to respect that I mean she's a true believer in these causes but I'm I'm a true believer unconstitutional you know policies but also an individual liberty so it is truly a war of ideas now and uh\nI just hope that the Republicans get out and vote because she is dangerous for the fifth district\nWhere were the Denver Riggleman Republican candidate for Congress in the fifth district he's running against his Democratic opponent Leslie Coburn uh she's an author and has a lot of friends in Hollywood\nAnd a Denver running for the seat and if they retire of retiring\nTom Garrick Denver let's get to uh some of the pressing issues on the world scene today and then I Want to get your opinion on a let's start with ... ... the a so called a\nJournalist if you were living in the United states living\nIn Virginia doing a column for the Washington Post very critical of the Saudi Government goes to the consulate in this day in both for routine paperwork to get married and it's like the old Roach Motel he went in but he never came out a hurricane or\nNever came out so it's like the Saudi Roach Motel\nNow the stakes get elevated because President Trump said over the weekend um if he gets clear evidence that the Saudis were involved in this cold blooded murder within their conflict and he's in this than ball\nHe said there would be severe punishment than a prince Mohammed bin Salman that'd be a thirty three years old turns around on Sunday fires back\nAnd standards if there's any\nAh sanctions against us or any retaliation ah we're going to double down and we're going to affect the economy's in world markets and pull our sovereign fond and raise the price of oil\nAnd a ... cetera I we bought this arms deal with them a hundred and ten billion dollars when they've only spent Fifteen billion\nWe've also were backing their war their civil war I'm with the Emirates in Yemen where are we going to\nWell number one I think I'm Shelley used to have in Saudi Arabia to have a lot more leverage but now that the United states is the number one oil and gas producer in the world\nUm it's very difficult for them to I think it\n... you know sort of exert that kind of leverage on us as far as President Trump's concern I think he's very serious I mean if it's found out that the Saudi Government sanctioned um this type of behavior\nI don't I don't think he I don't think you're just to spend hours payments I think you're talking about going any type of support I'm against that Haiti's in Yemen and I you know and that is that's that is something because you know we [noise]\nReally interested to see because it is a\nTo try to extract Iran from what they're doing a state sponsor terrorism is a very important goal the United states government but on the other hand\nUm if the Saudis are doing this type of behavior now you're talking about things that we just can't get done and I think President Trump would go all the way I think he would\nNot only sanction them in and take away their arms sales I think you would ignore this red on oil and I think he would start to extract support for any kind of military stuff that they're doing over in the middle eastern each other military\nYou know exercises or or any type of operation so it's it is serious\nDenver the other side of it is that uh some people are saying well look or the president and the Trump Administration has invested a lot in the Saudi\nRelationship in the Nineteen months he's been there and do we do have this hundred and ten million dollar arm Silvio I I Want to keep pointing out that it's on paper it's a memorandum of understanding for a hundred and ten billion dollars but the only ... yeah yeah it's an ammo you were only spent Fifteen thing\nSo it's it's not I mean there's there's no sign deals or anything it's just and understanding right right so it's not really want it\nSo uh so somebody was saying you know well maybe we just we just started under the rug and move on\nBusiness as usual but a Marco Rubio the other day said that whatever action we took could not be symbolic what is your take on that\nIf he is he's right I mean is again if the Saudi Government participated in killing somebody and it was sanctioned\nAnd we have the truth is my guest that are just going to be much more than symbolic um I guess there's probably removal support on multiple Bronx and I would say that that is going to happen is if we if we find that's been proven and\nYou know I don't actually on that line I don't have all the classified information All right and I couldn't answer to it any way but if something were found out my guest says there would be much more symbolic I think I think we're ever years right and I think that's why President Trump to announce everybody set\n[noise]\nUsing this hour from

for the day ... campaign is in the biggest blue wave in the history of all blue waves nominees ever in Virginia\nIn two thousand Seventeen Gillespie carried that district by three that's the saving grace and um of course there's a big debate tonight on TV that's\nTelevised that basically right now the only debate scheduled day or two more tentative debate one with me that has not been confirmed nobody's going to make a decision until after tonight but it's a very close race I still get have the advantage\nOr because of what I said in two thousand Seventeen that because I Know for a fact that there are going to come late but we'll see what happens also the other thing is got on the side is any of pie in Virginia has put all of their resources in the seventh district that's a lot of people banging out\nYou're just so to see in the Christopher Newport university poll out it out earlier Scottsdale is now up by having he's going to win that as we predicted\nAnd of course I'm the only one in the United states predicting a Barbara Comstock I'm Upset victory over Jennifer Wexton and in fact I'm going to probably do my show from her headquarters we're going to order a chaser\nRolling rock beer and when Comstock big waxed and you're going to have to pick me up off the floor to make me stop laughing\n[laughter] All right thank you for your time John Hope I've answered that interest\nDo very well thank you\nGet the Sam Nunberg Sam Nunberg on the line Sam a long time political associate an operative of Donald J Trump these now with the uh growing Steve Bannon political action committees citizens of for the republic\nAnd a ban it's got like twenty twenty five people in this things got a polling going all over the place he's involved in districts and Sam is joining us now Sam great to have you\nKnow you're very optimistic Republican seats in Virginia\nYeah I think I think Scott is going to win I I think he's any any doubt the Christmas Newport university poll that came out that they had them up by seven in that poll always a is biased the other way and I think David gonna win by ... by tiny a mouse\nAnd uh I Know barbers going to win so\nYeah I'm pretty optimistic I also wanted to thank Sam Nunberg for sending me a text last night talking me off the ledge after the after I got to say hey go bad they're going to win a series so I thank you for that Sammy oh it's been a while\nEurope's tactic they what they had to do the first of all they do is get one [noise] one all they wouldn't want in Boston I suspect that one [noise] but what do I know I think we're going to [noise] me too\n[noise] but I think a great team like the issue is what comes out of their natural lake I [noise] back Milwaukee [noise] I don't I don't really know but I think no walking the dog\nI well I think they are also so a winning ... agreement with that but you know what I see that the problem with the natural man is you're paranoid right because we were losers for so long that even though we didn't win the championship last season is just my whole family is paranoid so\nLook to impeach President Trump but um but then in their narrative they're not they hated it older they don't want to they need the older pollsters they don't understand is demographic\nOr worse when you were talking about John it's because they're basing it on a Monday of they're basing it on a voting model\nOr let's say the ABC Washington Post on typically the worst of the worst case like that it's like I mean even the working in the sea crumbling of let's say the worst political you could think of it just stinks you know Democrats are always writing and Republicans are always wrong by [noise]\nUm [noise] they base it on the model when they're looking at people that typically do vote\nFrankly are even registered some car in voting this time and they base it on the fact of a woman's marks on TALK not only pay something millennials are coming out to vote the way they these democratic pollsters are putting millennials are not coming out and vote for democratic candidates\nThat's one issue the second issue is a less you show me a poll on them that don't tell you if you're too real polls\nOn John I Will she be as you go Paul\nWhat's that poll strength forget his name he released a bomb in his book I'm giving it to three ways to their parents case scenario right now for the Democrats undermined polling he had the Democrats the potential seat majority worst case scenario undermined polling\nHe only had two Democrats were against the Republican House by one seat I still think that under national circumstances\nThe reason he says it's because what they do is they do they're generic that way I remember doing these congressional race in\nThe way they do it for congressional as opposed to the Senate races they it's just not fair for accurate way to do it because of the gerrymandering the way these shirts or\nThe way they polled people let's say you're a state of California the state of New York for even the state of Virginia and then they started to their whole it's a composite\nIt's just not accurate it doesn't represent the way they don't waiting accurately for what it has to come out to be a little slick Republican seats the Democrats part\nOf it took one on one of those who say it's part of it is just simple laziness by them laziness or unsophisticated in a way of doing their part of it is that it's very expensive looking expensive if you wanted to do what we did\nCitizens and the American republic see parents group we spent two hundred thousand dollars I'm polling and what we did was we saw in the region the polling in the state as well we didn't even do state we said we want to see like\nSay oh why New York right we want to see the southwest California we want to see me we want to see 'em we looked at the state of Washington right where we were we walk we said we want to see the\nUm northern and western column of Washington right that's\nA lot more expensive to do with the right way to do with the Kobe Brian is David these networks they don't spend the money they spend Fifteen\nPeople doing jobs that one person can do right right some of the things like that you would think they actually would want to spend money on we'll pull it off\nAnd let me shift over I got a couple of minutes it got to two minutes them look let's shift over to some policy and I want to get your thoughts Mike Pompeo justice match the Saudi Arabia\nOr to a ... by the president who spoke to who spoke with a ...\nMohammed bin Salman king Solomon today king Salman denying it anything to do with the show he that's hard to believe for the average person but he is denying it kept the guest said that [noise] then turning around and telling company or to go there\nOr the president saying on Saturday was that if it was proven that because she was murdered in the conflict there would be severe punishment for the Saudis Saudi and turned around under and the MPs and said\nWe will retaliate and what do you make this whole thing so\nWhile I think we're Colleen that's ridiculous on the retaliating comment coming from Saudi Arabia was talking to a state run TV [noise] it was probably someone the equivalent of life\nYou know the equivalent of a radio host taking something for you know so let's take [noise] and there's no way that Saudi they think that will retaliate and they'll go there and they'll sort of lying themselves are rushing oil on yourselves or Russia [noise] do you want to lawyers told the rock so you'll end up in the Shia\nIranian crashed and so that's not realistic when I came to is the following this reporter was killed by the Saudi Arabians not only was he killed a terribly uh killed any barbaric\nBarbaric manner it was something that went wrong I don't know why this gentleman went into that consulate was\nObviously he's not responsible for what happened but considering what could possibly can to keep the series writing it not only about ... anything he Donald Trump is correct about M. B. S. for the following reason remember George W. Bush took us into Iraq\nNot only find you want to remove Saddam but then he said we're going to vote in a human selected democracy it is going to end up having a Starbucks stare movie theater okay that's the way it worked out ... I had no problem\nWith our names regions\nSupporting monsters there are monsters\nBut they are hard monasteries they need to realize that they can act like monsters in their own peaks done [noise] we're not going to judge them on but you can't do that to American\nRight management American citizen that American residents there I don't think that's even nations should go to Saudi Arabia agrees\nHas to be some kind of consequences for that and and and\nYou know there are number two we kind of what the speaker Democrats October surprise I'm going to be on the election may not be nice to say that it is what it is I think a lot of politically correct so [noise] I just think we need to handle it\nI also agree though um we need that there is there is no reason why we cannot spell the farms that can be used against Iranian or Iranian proxies\nOr otherwise so the Chinese will solve all too so that's what I think that's where we are and I think the president seems to handle this um I ... I mean the I I Would\nStop issuing denial [noise] because I didn't even another piece of news to me was the kind of everything from parents apple wash right now\nOr the apple watch that we know even when you are you're apple watches [noise] get on the government are talking about turkey\nCan get all your audio so\nHe clearly MBNA clearly from all public reporting murdered the sky I ... I don't carry this journalist or Muslim Brotherhood I don't care who is ally before I don't care what he didn't eat with bin Laden irrelevant [noise] right [noise]\nThe cannot conduct himself but he wants to be a western society wants Saudi Arabia modernizing frankly NBS one Saudi Arabia to modernize economically you ought to stay in power in the same way that Trump is trying to make a deal with Kim Kim Jong il gave up new ... can you stay in power right now\nI think that there has to be some consequences for [noise] or the president I think were laid out for them to\nSam we're in complete

Atlantic I'll tell you that meantime the ah to showcase that you're wasting gets even worse\n[noise] um [noise]\nThe ah the kingdom of Saudi Arabia kingdom now threatening western countries but particularly of the United states and saying if you take any action than there's gonna be a reaction that's going to be severe because the president said it would be severe punishment if indeed uh\nHe can tell beyond or the U.S and tell can tell beyond a shadow of a doubt that a judge a mile a show he was murdered\nEntering the Saudi Arabian conflict I don't know what exactly this empty threat is like Saudi Arabia running around and acting like this in some kind of a world economic power threatening their sovereign from they're going to pull him out\nOf the president saying look this is going to effect the arms deals because of SARS or just buy it from someone else but that's not really the point Congress is going to act on this if indeed the evidence is there there's no question about it and Rand Paul is going to introduce legislation in the U.S Senate\nIn order to get the United states out of the Yemeni war this is kind of make senators during an election um go on record in supporting this or not\nThis is a political relations disaster for the Saudi kingdom and four MB yes that is a chain Mohammed bin Salman no matter\nHow it turns out or they were very brazen in in in this um move very brazen and I think they again they underestimated Trump the Trump Administration the president himself for us just underestimated them they some guy can go into a conflict not come out\nUm\nCan't be found again don't have cameras up him leaving have cameras of him entering but not leaving and somehow this was going to get swept under the carpet the day of reckoning for Saudi Arabia is coming and it's coming very quickly if once we get to the bottom of this\nUm it is a proven that something happens in him that is I'm not good however you want to say that alleged\nNow there's media reports going around that took his show he was an operative of intel for the Saudis that he was involved with the um [noise] uh with uh al ... when they were fighting the Russians wise you dean but none of that\nIt it just doesn't matter what matters is the guy was living in the United states and he was working for a U.S company and he went into the consulate in Istanbul in Turkey to simply get paperwork to get married any any never came out I mean this is a problem\nRegardless of how you want to spin this as a political disaster of for the kingdom and these empty threats that they're making is absolute nonsense [noise]\nLook picking them stock market went down a seven percent of it last seven percent of its entire ... billions of dollars not what's [noise] rebounded a little bit to only I think a three point nine percent or maybe three point eight percent the last time I checked but uh I\nI when are these international leaders kind of understand that if the president says somebody's gonna follow through on it and he said there's gonna be severe punishment and I would think there is but the president said yesterday he wants to wait until all the evidence is in\nSeoul sale that um we'll see how that goes but uh I Would expect that the U.S is going to act now Saudi Arabia has just given turkey\nPermission to a church it [noise] it stand bolt tops and went on Monday afternoon nearly two weeks after your mouth could show you went missing\nA the news comes as international pressure is mounting on um Riyadh to explain this guy's disappearance now remember he disappeared on October second it's Thirteen Days later\nNow finally the Saudi kingdom is reacting because of the pressure being put on by western countries and here's the bottom\nLine we are supplying the Saudi air force in Yemen with complete logistics\nAnd his Rand Paul set up my show I Believe on friday or Thursday I forget what he was on one of those days he came on and he said here's the bottom line if we pull out of supporting the Saudis and the Yemeni civil war they can't fly an airplane I mean we provide them with total ... he said that\nAir forces grounded so they're really playing with fire here and ah\nI Know that uh it seems that MBBS which is the uh acronym for chicken Mohammed bin Salman of Saudi Arabia thirty three years old\nIt seems that he wants to be the strong man in the middle east or something something to um as far as the image is concerned\nBut ah you're not going to be able to do that with the United states so he is gonna have to figure this out and this president is not going to mess around with this so we'll see what happens and I don't\nOn a on Saturday and Sunday and I think it was on Sunday\nThey made threats about a disrupting the world economy and pulling their sovereign funds out and uh they were laughable I mean they're not\nAn economic world power there a country that makes some investments it will have zero impact on the United states\nAnd that'd be able to go around saying well your gas prices will go up\nI mean there's certain things in international politics you have to do what you have to do I mean that's like saying we're not going to fight certain elements because our gas prices are going to go up or something I don't know if that's true or not but I don't think it matters\nIt if if I got to pay three extra cents a gallon for a short period of time because we have to do the right thing and the international stage and show global leadership then so be it for two weeks I'll deal with it and so when everybody else Jon triggers radio network truck ma truth\nAcross America phone lines open for eight oh John eight eight eight for eight out five six for six meantime singers declares bankruptcy they
