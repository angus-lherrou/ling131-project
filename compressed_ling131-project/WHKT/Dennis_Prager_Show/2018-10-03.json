also currently serves as spokesperson and chief communications strategist for the Atlantic coast pipeline a six billion dollar six hundred mile interesting natural gas transmission pipeline\nThat is owned by a number of energy companies and\nWe're going to get an update on where we are because I Want my pipeline Aaron great to have you been [noise]\nMorning John how you doing [noise]\nFired up today Aaron I'm very excited because I was getting out to get to talk about energy\nSalary Ninety five thousand dollars these are great jobs man and they last a long time but then after pipelines up you get manufacturing and you get more jobs that's what the whole thing is about now we had to stop for a while give us enough\nRight so just to remind folks this is the Atlantic coast pipeline as you describe that some new or natural gas transmission pipeline that's going to bring new supplies of cheaper natural gas into Virginia North Carolina this is all about\nAs you talked about this was all about growing the economy bringing manufacturing back to eastern Virginia Hampton Roads\nLowering our energy costs the businesses can grow family is going to have more money in their pockets and it's also about making our electricity cleaner so obviously we've been\nCutting down a lot of coal plants over the last several years because of tighter environmental controls and regulations and we'll replacing that with Clinton burning natural gas solar wind all the things that you talked about before so this this project is all about growing the economy\nCreating thousands of new jobs rebuilding the manufacturing sector um we started construction earlier in the summer and we made a lot of progress in West Virginia North Carolina uh haven't started yet and Virginia we're still waiting on one final approval from the state environmental agency\nBut we expect to get underway in Virginia here I'm pretty short like\nAh you're right that for about six weeks or we have to stop work uh before circuit court of appeals are ordered a couple of agencies the fish and Wildlife Service the national Park Service to revise some of their products\nThe agencies were able to do that relatively quickly and suddenly got back to work once the permits were reissued a few weeks ago and we're going full steam ahead and in West Virginia North Carolina and I'm hopefully starting in January of pretty soon\nSo the six week holed up what is the barriers and now they're just getting this John in Virginia just put it in layman's terms for listeners\nHer so we need we we we've got all of the state and federal permits we need\nFor West Virginia and North Carolina this is a free state project a we have one more permit that still outstanding and Virginia and it's the it's a permit for erosion and sediment control basically Virginia Department of environmental quality they regulate construction projects so that you don't create erosion\nAnd sediment patients so that you get much\nWater into streams and rivers um the agency has done an incredibly thorough job of reviewing every single one\nOf the pipeline's path through Virginia all of our roads and in fact my control plans\nUm tape and review in our plans for for more than a year now [noise] um but we expect\nTo get final approval on those plants here I'm In the early fall so we'll we'll be able to get underway and Virginia and then we'll be working continuously through the end of next year so it's about a ... to ... year and a half to two year construction projects\nAnd up next year and John this is all that you know once this project is built [noise] people are going to see a significant improvement in the economy particularly in the eastern uh area in Hampton Roads um they're gonna see lower energy costs you know the problem with God and Virginia and we haven't read the whole car or\nNatural gas infrastructure for decades and so the infrastructure that we have been keeping up with consumer demand so we're using more and more natural gas to generate cleaner electricity keep her lose power the economy\nBut we haven't built more infrastructure to bring in the additional supplies of natural gas but we need\nSo what's happening is three of laughs for winners the pipelines were so over strained to serve our region that businesses have their service shut off for several days hundreds of major industrial companies had their their natural gas sort of a\nCut off and consumers pay hundreds of millions of dollars for an energy costs\nThan they would have if we had the Atlanta Chris pipe on it's it's simple laws and supply\nAnd demand you have more demand and supply your your prices are going to sky rocket so until we get the Atlantic coast pipeline bill consumers and businesses are going to pay hundreds of millions more energy costs than they should\nUm and businesses are going to continue to have their their service shut off during the winter and so that that makes it hard to get in business for our for existing companies\nBut it makes it impossible to attract new industries like manufacturing to help grow the economy so this this infrastructure is really critical to our economy it's important for the environment we're making progress and I'm going to get it done [noise]\nI Want you Aaron\nAaron is that she smokes person and communication strategic communications manager for dominion energy for the Atlantic coast pipeline I Want you to address the concerns of those people that are opposed to the pipeline\nOn fire middle ground [noise] um and\nI don't I don't mean to the

that there's a lot to be concerned about [noise] but I I watched as much of her testimony as I could I found her very credible you have to ask yourself why would anybody\nPut themselves through them if they did not believe that they had important information or to convey to the Senate\nShe basically said that she thought it was her civic duty I told I found I found her presentation I found\nA willingness to say I don't remember that but I remember there\nAre to be a very convincing [noise]\nI'm mad as you say this what about both are women that your husband allegedly abuse [noise] what

T. S. you a couple of weeks ago that the fifty two hundred fifty game Western Carolina last week Mercer or they were in until the final minutes and\nThey put a lot of football up for you a lot on the score boarding they're never out of the game and\nCoach walk and I was with us now he's got this off at just ... I mean look if you're in your life that you've never seen a day with is a very young team\nWhere they're putting up fifty and thirty eight points again and these are not at the end of the game right this is very into the final minutes\nAnd although there I Want to find a good start to uh get some of these W is coming up maybe this week at Sanford the er Sanford dogs one and four ... four in the contract joining us now coach Scott\nIt's good to be on John okay look\nThese games man there is so exciting I Can't wait until a Saturday\nTo put my me and my T that San and\nI'm just amazed and I\nTo give credit where do I know your own five so you you know when you're going to give me the speech about winning and all that stuff and I get all that but look this coach this exciting football and you're starting all these other class men I mean you've got something going on man [noise]\nWell I think we've done a really good job recruiting we just had a big recruiting a meeting yesterday code grow we're in a pie week and you know recruiting to me and my very unique and it takes a little bit of time to learn it and I think the staff and I you know kinda figured out the best way to go about our business on the road recruiting and we've got some\nReally good young players that are contributing you know at\nA high level I Do think we're a plane and exciting level up often so football or it was definitely my goal to do so um [noise] I don't know if you follow Mike Lee trunk quarter you know he had a great quote on balance you know balance is not fifty percent Ron it's about fifty percent pass\nIt it's getting your skill players all five of them all in a in a balanced manner and I think we do that and then he acquainted it to the ... of doing that and it's true you know in the ... often quarterback hold back the half\nBags and old receivers have a chance to touch the ball and then in ... off and running back and forth receivers and of course quarterback all get a chance to touch the ball and we got a lot of guys catch the ball making plays and they know the ball you come to them in any way so they're playing at a faster level and we'd like to play fast\nAnd map the ball a bunch because we felt the advantage we have in your mind as we can be mentally talker and it's basically better condition than our own and so on the hundred played the game is contagious lost all that\n[noise] okay so in last week's gay and that was another great game and in another pretty gritty our sense of performance fire team you're young quarterback you didn't ski\nThrows for another four hundred plus yours four hundred and thirty yards and yet twenty first first towns in this game Nineteen them coming on\nPast but you got you got nine first I was on the ground so that I mean you can't see the team's not balance you can get tough yards one you need them but um [noise]\nThe level of sophistication in this offsets um\nAs you as you you run your various games is pretty impressive in and or the other thing is you did skiing is throwing everybody right I mean you've got like six or seven receivers in involved in this involved is often [noise]\nYep that's the design is to take the defense gives us again it's very similar to trick lodged in football it's just it's\nMore exciting for the fans because they see the ball the whole time and it definitely helps us in recording because uh we can find a lot of guys that like the running catching a lot of guys that like to throw the ball biting running quarterbacks that can also grow enough to keep the defense honest as it was very difficult\nNowadays because everybody's looking for that guy with you know all the R P o teams in his own reaching so the guys that are kind of get left out or the guys like Reese that you know maybe you're a little bit of light maybe there's one or two deep facts\nThat Clemson or somebody doesn't want them but they're ... and we can find those guys and the I think it's playing the evidence that season off at school [noise]\nAnd there's no question a let's let's get to the game coming coming up this week\nAnd this is a winnable game no question I mean Sanford's having their good team that they're having some struggles also are there are always pretty tough at home though going out of Alabama I'm how are you preparing your team for this came anything different\nBut we got an open week this week John So we're not we're not playing Saturday and now we got Sanford and then we've got the citadel the following week so\nEverywhere else I'd been on an open weak you you take the next two opponents which you're going to play and you kind of divided up the practice time so we gave the young men on Monday off other than dome study and lifting weights was very impressed one of our receivers gig on Laura after playing Ninety five place having a hundred and fifty yards and the touchdown on\nTen catches a went in there and set a new PR for squad max on Monday by ten pounds [noise]\nGeorge More didn't as well Austin brats\nOr did we had three guys that we are as you know there are in season on on squash which is a testament to the job day form in doing it in our weight room but we're taking this week working on being the best you're getting better have what we need to improve in putting an initial schemes against Stanford\nAnd spending bill especially defense against it at all because there are trip watching attack which I think having played in that haven't been in office will coordinator in it\nIt's very difficult to defend your like ethnic are often it's difficult for the fans\nAre the big game at home you've got Sanford next when it's a Saturday and silver searching then you'd come home against the citadel under twenty that's always the big game for you chatter chatter Chattanooga then you go on the road right\nRight after that a lot to talk about your decent I mean a little tough on the last couple of weeks if you look at the\nMercer game Mercer gain I think I'm doing this my memory about seven and a half yard to play 'em that's just unacceptable I mean you can't you can't win that way how are you a dressing that [noise]\nOh deep in supporting years where are you most shows all you know we lost a writer Francis in Allen crash and burn your graduation both of them are working great jobs making over sixty thousand dollars a year a balanced\nCan see both young men are very impressed with them but we got to replace them and ah [noise] you know replace them with Eliot Brewster who's you know why we read for sophomore and\nHe gets better each and every week I thought he played in his best game against the Mercer and then you know ... ... the older guys have been starting and then we had been backing them up with Liam cough Lynn
