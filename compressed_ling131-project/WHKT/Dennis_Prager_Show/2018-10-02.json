good applicants to going to have to pay them\nSo I'm\nOf the Fifteen dollar minimum wage as you know\nBut here's what's even better when you don't even have to have it mandated by the federal government when the market driven by Trump's economic is so vibrant\nThat companies have to make decisions in their best interest to raise wages to keep the people that is a great thing to think of all the entry level people that went to work for Amazon or are going to work for Amazon if that could cause a\nCouple of good things to grow that just got a race because of the Trump la county

atomic centers and that's how the rising tide lifts all boats so wages continue to derive\nThis is this is great news is an amazing thing today and we finally got rid of NAFTA [noise] oh my God I just uh\nThirty you don't want when that was first going down Curtis Ellis is with us so we're we're going to bring him in that Curtis Ellis a senior policy adviser with America First policy\nAnd you could go back to the nap today I mean I remember the severely it was like Nineteen was Clinton that got elected\nAnd then getting rich came up like Ninety five and speaking NAFTA thing was going on and it was going to be like the panacea in all these jobs are going to be creative and and you know we were going to be the service economy whatever not since they were selling it\nBack then you know how many Republicans were fighting the after like three like many Trump and pap you can and that's it and if you're against NAFTA\nNAFTA in the nineties you looked at as like some kind of an economic Neanderthal\nLike dumber than a box of rocks like you couldn't see the future your bio we're mired in the Eighteen hundreds and you wanted to bring back a black students or something the horse and buggy like you just couldn't get with that you could understand it's a global world economy and\nAnd then with the help of the wall Street Journal editorial page and the wall Street Journal is of course the the the mouthpiece of the global corporations who I Believe in open borders no countries at all just let us rape and pillage anywhere on earth without\nUh any any people like a national legislature or national board or getting\nIn the way of our ability to just exploit the cheapest labor anywhere and rape and pillage all over all over the world as as we wish the wall Street Journal editorial page\nInvented the lie that the Smoot Hawley that the terrorist act of Nineteen thirty created the great depression\n[laughter] and and now has become accepted gospel wisdom everywhere and it's still pops up\nAnd you find Republicans saying it you find Democrats saying that you find better work saying it in Texas you find every moron idiots who doesn't even understand\nEconomics but they you know for sure\nThat the the the the Great Depression was caused by terrorists right that's what caused it the Smoot Hawley tariff act\nAnd that's what caused the great depression and it's a complete lie complete fabrication no basis in truth whatsoever but that is now the accepted wisdom and anytime anybody attacks\nDonald Trump's standing up to China\nAnd putting terrorists in place for defending American industry to say well don't you know that terrorists cause the great depression and how do you know that well I read somewhere you know where you're reading well everybody knows that\nCase closed and so that all happened as a result that all came out of the debate over NAFTA in Nineteen Ninety four thank you Al Gore\nAnother lie from the Democrats and well made by the Republican at the wall Street Journal editorial page all the Republicans\nI mean I mean back then Curtis that Republicans were totally complicit in this this was driven by Newt Gingrich I mean Bill Clinton basically came along for the ride Gingrich Republican majority John taste they all drove it people forget that I remember and you remember the Republicans drove this\nAnd they really believe that you know this was open trade open borders everything that'd be fine\nAnd look at Wall Street driven right they got they got big donations by Wall Street lower than\nYou are an owner things will be good for you because you make more money and they you know workers as simply take commodity the first thing you learn in economics one ... one is going to a junior in high school and they they talk to you about\nDiminishing resources and supply and demand and they say the number one big it costs to businesses why\nLabor labor labor right\nI mean you learn that as a sophomore in high school\nSo it never stops now or were with Curtis Ellis who just senior policy adviser for America first policies he's also the chairman of images of the American jobs alliance Curtis or worked in the Trump Administration and the department of labor he was also on the campaign\nCurtis so way out for us this is a great victory for American workers American farmers laying out like the top three or four changes\nAnd housing positively affect the Americans going from and then you have to be able to United States Mexico candidate or us and say hey\nThe top ah some of the top change it increases\nThe amount of a car or that must be made in North America it increases it up to Seventy five percent three quarters of a car to enter the United states duty free three quarters of an automobile\nMust be made in the United states it increases the amount of dairy products\nThat the United states can sell in Canada so that our dairy farmers in upstate New York Wisconsin and the northern tier in

her [noise] and ah it it it increases protections for digital traded intellectual property rights in the digital trade which of course did not exist at all and the previous now after ... there was no digital trade\nThere was no Internet uh there was a and and what's happened over the last twenty five years\nIs Canada put in all these crazy ah protections in requirements and regulations so that Americans couldn't even sell stuffed Canadians on E. bay it it became virtually impossible so\nA e commerce is now increased we can now actually sell stuff to Canadians over the Internet and um that that we couldn't do before\nFreeman there is a stipulation in their ... us MCA that if Canada or Mexico in terms of trade agreement with a non market economy and that means China right there the biggest non market economy out there\nIf they do all bets are off we can withdraw from NAFTA we can withdraw from our trade agreement with that country so basically what they say you can't set\nUp or Mexico or Canada can't enter into a trade deal with China and then trying to be ... and then used NAFTA as a way to get there's\nThese subsidized goods into the United states\nRight and that's that's what that's what was happening on NAFTA\nAnd that was also what was going to happen on steroids if we if we can see the thing exactly the Chinese a cheap bike rather than shipping to a stranger to you you you you us they go to Mexico or they go to Canada becomes part of that\nAnd we only have a great deal right yeah they just like yeah you\nKnow the ... the other huge thing about this since it's on a step back for a minute and look at the big picture NAFTA was supposed to be the first step in the free trade area of the Americas Frank first we bring together North American countries\nThen we get kept or Central America free trade agreement and the next step was going to be the free trade area of the Americas from\nFrom tierra del sway you go to the north pole one big happy free trade zone and then we saw was with ti ti ti Trans Pacific partnership we were going to bring in the other side of the Pacific as well and see all of these things are part of the\nOf the things in the grand vision of creating a border was world and I am not exaggerating misses not some John birth society conspiracy taught us this\nIs the fact the wall Street Journal again they have said on the record there should be a law or they want to amend the constitution to add a this\nPhrase there shall be no borders that is the dream of the global is of the global is corporations the porch and fifty the fortune five corporations\nThey want no borders no nations they don't want pesky things like Congress or the president a ... making it difficult for them to do their thing\nAnywhere on earth find cheap labor over here find cheap minerals over their combined them into third place and sell them into fourth place that's their vision it's been laid out before\nIn front of Congress this is not a conspiracy [noise]\nThis new deal recognizes that we have a country and we are entitled to have a country and didn't say privilege for people in other countries to sell their goods in America\nLaws [noise] labor laws environmental laws whatever laws that are good for the American people can decide what are the conditions in situations for making stuff in this country treat everybody right treat the workers' rights treat private property rights respect it all\nAnd you can make things and do well and have a good living in this country if you're from another country\nAnd your company is from another country\nThe privilege to be allowed to sell stuff in this country not a right\nAbsolutely Curtis something better than anyone who would kind of had a thank you for being with us I've only got twenty

afternoon\nEverybody is predicting a western victory except me are predicting a Barbara Comstock victory and um I could start by this and we're going to bring Iran but uh I think it was a week ago or two weeks ago right two weeks ago I covered that yeah two weeks ago or ... I don't I remember I\nCovered the a lot of um county debate between uh Jennifer Wexton\nBarbara ... and we ran\nOut live on the radio and\nHave to tell you that was [noise]\nThat was the biggest debate crushing I've ever seen in my life partner is that the top of her getting all all property was rattle off solution after solution after solution success after success after success plan after plan after plan\nMean I was embarrassed for actually uh I was embarrassed for Jennifer it was so bad it was like she was in ... and\nThere was a lot of talk after that debate like who prepared or and what the deal was but um you know what is what it is [noise] so okay trick shooting joining us now we declared her the huge debate Victor Barbara Comstock the bar for good good to have you with us\nGreat them anyway John yeah morning [noise]\nUm what was the deal in that debate\nI really expected Jennifer to do better than that I went to Paris for her [noise]\nWell what can we focused on rebel versus read that have died in detail [noise] every now and I hurt my God that I worked on a pardon to promote our prosperity the tax cuts and and the economic growth me out for\nPercent economic growth a booming economy\nFunding for things like Alzheimer's research and I have cancer\nResearch support for veterans the largest military pay raise some things are good things that she can't say anything about of course these are all things that she resisted the agenda that I'm getting attacked the ad that they have up right now attacking me\nIs an eighty two percent bipartisan agenda that included things like you know record funding for opioid addiction treatment and education and the ... [noise] and so all she's doing is resisting and when you actually look on her legislative record\nIt has been cruel she doesn't have any job accomplishments nothing on our website about anything she's done jobs ... jobs because they're not as focused and so when she was there with the chamber is is never something she focused on you know that they do a job she is they read this same left wing number one liberal\nCandidate who's opposed things that it's reasonable as that's just too soon for victims\nVictims of domestic and sexual abuse chip\nPose that a justice near she's oppose she opposes the bill one of the first things here coded when she was elected in the state Senate was a bell I had\nTo help victims of domestic a bill that Scott ... told me it was a great bill and um and he voted for\nIt so this is how far out of touch she is\nAnd she doesn't have a record I mean a bunch of her ... she started\nHer bills she always says I vote I have a bunch of bill passed for things like moving the\nBorders of her engine and all of these little you know changing papers that even file in court you know there's nothing in nature that she's passed she's a follower NATO leader\nBut thanks very toxic she has not been able to get Twenty one vote to understand that because I think we need to get to pass the major pal and this is somebody who cannot go out work across the aisle to get anything major with Twenty one people now when you go\nTo Congress unique two hundred and Eighteen and I got that and I've gotten my bills and things like my two thousand dollar child tax credit scattered\nInto the tax bill got my colleagues report that my project steak neighborhood which is providing\nMore funny thing right for a crime and put a gun to fight crime drug crime and I and the thirteenth daring crime strip her it's not that's in the score card that they're attacking\nSo she just doesn't have a record to run on towards all resent spending cuts on negative and it's going to fail because people are just as much as someone focused on their priority and getting resolved and prosperity public safety and national security not resist target sets out fighting you know saying no to everything\nWell look I think it was obvious in the debate and\nIt's fun to go your party reception Trump socks and all that you know but then when you go into the debate\nAnd uh we just want to read this the other guy and\nI think that's where she fell down in this debate or she really didn't have anything and that her closing statements she attacked I'm your record on women which I thought was laughable to be honest so I don't think she did her\nAnd this is somebody Jennifer Wexton has been campaigning with\nFormer representative Jim Moran now this is the man who had not one but two I call the police telling them for abusive behavior for by one and this is somebody she hypocritical campaign is seen as not called out its single Democrat Bill Clinton\nNot John Conyers not Ellison who

is in the air invite only and you know they're they're trying to keep her head and and I think he thought that debate why\nThat that was pretty bad I mean I mean I've seen\nI've seen senator less than a lot of other Venus I Know she was the prosecutor\nScopes attorney and um you know she did run a pretty aggressive campaign in a special election so I mean I've seen her speech and she's\nReally not that bad it was just that day that morning I Would say she was shot at the top of her game and you were and that's why we're such a\nNever see representing dairy Democrat just pray that wind fixing

[noise]\nOne of those conversations just five minutes ago\nOr to make sure that\n[noise] any credible allegation that has been made in so many [noise] it does no good to have an investigation that just gives us more covering for example we actually need to find out what we can find out [noise]\nAnd we have to realize that we may not be able to find out everything\nFood it's not something that

really good about it when I talk about it according to eleven o'clock Rose Garden a back seat also been reading about it but yeah I think the top line takeaway is that the open Canada up to the farmers\nYeah hey even MSNBC as a liberal\nAnd I don't get the phone lines to I've in Woodbridge I've been here on the air\nJohn good morning sing I haven't talked to you in a while and I'm Sorry I missed dialed I I I Do have you on my on my rug\nI hear your text number to call it so quick I don't know I don't think you mentioned this warning something that senator um [noise] oh now I'm In South Carolina senator or what's his name a little grill Lindsey Graham just\nWears on the last night and humor just dropping rather interesting and I thought I get your feedback on it\nAnd it's really simple it's turned out to get enough votes to get tired servants [laughter]\nCloser layers that President Trump moved around Rio pointer as a candidate for the Supreme Court position to become a little extreme issue for the nation to vote on\nAnd I thought that was rather interesting and I'm actually pretty smart way to deal with this and we don't get enough votes to your plate becomes more click and clack cetera so I thought I'd throw a bit of that you wonder if your opinion [noise]\nIt's a gamble that I wouldn't take because that's just me don't get the vote in the Senate\nRight right because you have to think if he doesn't get the votes in the Senate there was something in the FBI\nReport that disturb somebody and then the actually Irene tort become like the campaign is I don't want to talk about this hour to talk about the economy I mean anything\nTo me that takes away from the economy is bad I think it'd be goes down or if I was the president I Would nominate Coney Barrett the next day like if the vote is Saturday and he goes down\nRight right right on Monday\nI Would nominate company beret\nI Would make her the campaign issue I Would make the whole travesty of the Senate to campaign issue\nBut I Would get Kavanaugh off the table because now we're going to be related gaining all these are the people that are going to come out of the wood works they told somebody's pig tails and doing school or something he got in a fight with ... when he got off the basketball but who knows what they're going to come up with\nThat is just distractions so I I think that's a horrible idea\nMaybe they'll do it I Would not advisor I Would dominate morally it was\nLindsey Graham's advising a dictator on their last Saturday just wondering what your your thoughts on it and uh [noise] I'm not sure what it was just not a good one I don't know but I just spent some time they've written about in fact what why not because I think the American people are there\nAre short something big was true and in half the time you a background investigation that would get exposed short of that or they get written maybe generate more people to vote for Republicans\nToday so I I don't like\nI don't like anything about it because I think it it would take all the focus all the time to me and I think you've already motivated the Republican base and I just don't like hanging out there for six for thirty five days I Would go with any ... any\nOnly beret and you know I Would push that I Would I Would make that the campaign issue and you know good luck feeding her she's got nine ... ... I mean good ... good good luck with that one\nIn supporter of your position actually kind of wondering matter what it would there be cabinet or Amy Barrett\nWe reached would still be mid west and action will be to a guy who's going to get on to the Supreme Court cabinet can't make it so rice really actually your point is is a valid one um [noise]\nCertainly stay with us [noise]\nLosing sour from Tom hold off on by Washington\nTrump says he wants to see what happens with\nThe FBI investigation into his battles springboard dominate Brett capital\nI rarely thinks that judge Kavanaugh showing it to be voted on and possibly voted I have to see what the FBI they just got back with a report\nIncome or London some reports the FBI's wrapped up in the interview with one of the key witness for\nThe FBI has finished its new interview with mark judge prep school friend Brett Kavanaugh's Christine Blasey Ford the California college professor accuses the Supreme Court nominee\nOf sexually assaulting her when they were teenagers in the Nineteen eighties says judge was in the room when it happened and that she saw him later that summer at a supermarket where he was working Kevin uno denies the assault took place as has judge\nLawyer would say only that the new interview had been completed knot ... was asked to other people's forge says attended the party where the assaulted place have also been interviewed by the FBI I'm what I loved him some\nAmazon is boosting its minimum wage for all us workers to Fifteen dollars per hour starting next month the company says the wage hike will benefit more than three hundred and fifty thousand workers and fulltime part-time temporary and even seasonal positions\nThe British Government service at the new post a branch of the immigration rules where people were needed skills priority over low skilled at migrants and there won't be preferential treatment any longer citizens of the European Union British prime minister Theresa May\nWhat this does he now able to leaving the European Union enables us to be able to make decisions about who can count on the numbers you can come from the European Union which goes from things that we haven't been able to do\nAll your national skin currently live and work in Britain that will change after the cat relieves ... nation bloc next year on Wall street\nA mixed bag the Dow was up by close to one hundred and sixty points a couple of hours away from the closing bell NASDAQ down by a lot more on these stories that town home dot com\nThree hundred or even five hundred dollars or more what if I said you could spend less than twenty five dollars a year even less for prime I kind of radio twenty and listen I get I I'm Scott from plugging pastry and yes it is possible to read your home or business of I don't want to pass\nFor less than twenty five dollars per year\nThe answer is plug in past spray\nA best seller to plug it in Pittsburgh pro will cover up to four thousand square feet now that's bad income for just a one time cost of I only two hundred and forty nine dollars even less for prime I kind of radio twenty year will be passed sprayed for years to come\nLog on to get it passed spray dot com today use prime iconic radio twenty and start driving those past so why\nScience praying regret plug it in and get go past free dot com that's got past free dot com primary card radio twenty\n[noise]\nDo you think your children or would they be better off today actually than you are correspond to read a fully reports on what most parents make\nA pie in the center poll finds down half of young Americans expect to be financially better off than their parents twenty first than expected the worst time off and about twenty nine person can expect to get ... ... ... ...\nThese young Americans are Fifteen to twenty six years old what are their parents think they're a little more hopeful for the children sixty percent think they can do better than they did only twelve percent of children might do worse return ...

against judge Kavanaugh\nBy Julie sweating and this is really reaching the theater the absurd Mike that's a clip I Want you to get in a couple of minutes for us a judge a judge I'm Sorry that judge Senator Kennedy from Louisiana\nAbsolutely blasting the Senate yesterday calling it a a grotesque a side show 'em a grotesque charade you can find that a Kennedy really unloading at a Senate colleagues yesterday was kind of a fun trip that'd be fine that\nWe'd appreciate it anyway during an interview with NBC your favorite network of all time because you know NBC right fake news wires liberal left wing whole bit lied about the Trump team but I Will never forget NBC for what they did to the Trump campaign and Virginia and which which is fake news ally\nAnd they did it for one reason to disappear in our troops in Virginia and it's really sad anyway it is what it is\nSo this one Julie sweating seemed to walk back and offer conflicting accounts of some of the accusations she and her attorney Michael lab and daddy watched against stretch cabin up on the NBC's Kate Snow\nNoted that the network has not been able to verify sweating he's playing some of which differ from a written statement here's a little snippet here snow says what we want it to years of laying out all that she said\nAbout her story are reporting we want to be transparent because he's a very serious allegations of course they could get sued for a billion dollars that's why they did Kavanaugh has called Julie sweating story now\nI've been living in NBC News for the record it's not been able to independently verify her claim [noise] these are things that she told us on camera\nThat different from a written statement last week we've been trying independently to reach out to anyone who remembers attending parties what's sweating and Kevin ... we've been asking her journey for names so far we've not found anyone who remembers that she's also unclear about\nWhen she first decided to come forward [noise]\nSo here's what's now ask Julie sweat [noise]\nLive TV [noise]\nYou know what\nHere sweating censor I cannot specifically say that he was one of the ones who assaulted me\nThis is a witness I cannot specifically saying he was one of the ones who assaulted me [noise]\nSweating basically says she doesn't know if Kavanaugh spike punch at parties like she earlier claimed her statement so she doesn't know if he was there she doesn't know if it was him she doesn't know if he's like the punch she doesn't even though he was in the same\nState [noise] but it must be him because he's evil [noise]\nIt's just it's just unbelievable I mean it's like we we\nAre living through\nAny Broadway a Broadway circus play [noise]\nMean every day this gets more and more bizarre and Kennedy's right it's totally grotesque [noise]\nWhat is going on here [noise]\nDoes this man is just getting is getting tarnished it's crazy [noise]\nI mean she has no information [noise] hey\nWas that was a good part it gets worse [noise]\nInterviewer snow from NBC went out to say are\nExperiencing sweaty there are some differences between your one statement uh\nShe said she became aware of efforts by Kavanaugh and mark judge despite punching parties in our interview she said she saw them near the punch but did not specifically thinks she saw either man spike it\nThis is unbelievable [noise]\nThis is like saying hey bank was robbed and you live in the neighborhood therefore you robbed the bank spike was touched I never saw the spike it but they were [noise]\nWere wandering around [noise] ah it was a party [noise]\nSweating says well I sort of given red tops to quite a few girls during that time frame and there was great punch those parties I Would not take one of those classes from bar Cavanaugh\nA Brett Kavanaugh excuse me I saw him in and\nAround the punch containers I don't know what he did when I saw by them yet or maybe he was serving ... because he was a gentleman I mean when you have got to be kidding me this is the evidence that he ...\nHe served parts [noise]\n\nAnd Kevin on others waiting in line\nTo participate in a gang rape but she she she says she came to this conclusion because it high side it was in hindsight it was too coincidental that he was standing by a judge or what the other boys [noise]\nSo you know said standing in line outside of rooms sweat next not lines but by the doors and I didn't understand what it could be snow and you describe Brett Kavanaugh and a thread\nMark judge standing by a door yes with other boys [noise] so you're suggesting that in hindsight sweating yes you think he was involved [noise]\nI Would say yes I didn't see him but it was too coincidental okay so they're at a party they serve punch and they stood around\nI mean this is really unbelievable [noise] this is unbelievable that we're even talking about this [noise]\nThen she goes out to say well I'm quite a shy person [noise]\nAnd quite a private person and it wouldn't be here today except for about six weeks ago I happen to learn about Brett Kavanaugh becoming one of the people who was short list or to go to the Supreme Court so snow says this is in July summer\nA sweat like I don't really know\nIt was some time [noise]\nSweating provided for names to NBC who she claims attended a party of that was for once said he does not remember sweat next one is dead and the other two I have not responded [noise]\nSnow wedded by saying this morning sweating provided for names of friends she says once the parties with him one of them just not really call a Julie sweating it doesn't know who she is\nAnother is deceased [noise] the other two we haven't heard back from that the evidence if you don't think this is a circus cloud showing like Senator Kennedy says\nIt's grotesque what they're doing it is man with no evidence that you're living under a rock you're on the John ... radio network ...\nBut tonight NBC News has not been able to independently corroborate sweating explains and when we asked to have an oddity for any witnesses who could backup her account\nHe provided for names of friends sweat expense went to parties with her one of them says he does not recall anyone named Julie sweat Nick another of the French you named is deceased NBC News just reached out to the other two and has not heard back should Brett Kavanaugh be interviewed by the FBI\nI think so I think it's fine if they do I do I I happen to know some United States\nAggressive I've seen that person in very very bad situation somewhat compromising and you know [noise]\nI think it's very unfair to to bring up things like this\nThe president refusing to elaborate on that charge tonight no word whether capital has been interviewed so far Ford has knocked
