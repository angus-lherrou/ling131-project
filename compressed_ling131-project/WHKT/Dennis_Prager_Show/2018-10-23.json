Arabia or other parts of the world but unfortunately happens all too often but there has to be accountability what that accountability is I don't know you get all the facts um but I you know the ... part of this story\nIs that uh they had a body double wearing could choke his clothes walking around with like the guy was still alive they've now admitted he's dead they said it was a result of a fistfight I called into question about that\nA national security expert and a half million nation that the American people don't have a very basic perspective it seems very difficult to imagine a matter of getting into a fist fight with just one other professionals and I'm\nThinking that that's going to result in outcome and and it clearly didn't want to make sure we know what an appropriate response is we have to get all the facts and it's something that I happen very quickly because you're strictly account of what we believe transpired would transpire\nWell I think the president is going to actually\nSaid he was going to get with Congress and find a a a bi partisan way to respond to this but we're going to wait for all the facts\nCome out Korea when it gets to the election the

at stake here but you know we talk about this last week I was just going to start\nThen the Republicans hold and they charge by a couple of [noise] I I Am more optimistic today based on the work at the top ten senior doing or around the country to get people fired up but I'll tell ya I ah I was with a series of individuals' last night talking race by race and\nWe believe they're going to be more opportunity kept the Democrats have not even thought about it let me just tell you one of them I think we've got a chance to win a U.S Senate race now in Wisconsin I couldn't believe that three weeks ago the race right now is about a two and a half to three point race um nobody\nPeople thought he was going to that's all moving in the right direction and positive for the Republicans if you start winning and stealing races and get in a positive sense in a place like Wisconsin what the Democrats were focused on it could be a very good night two weeks from today\nWell I think it is I'm predicting right now the Republican gonna picked up five seats in the U.S Senate and nobody's going over there is a I don't share you enthusiasm for Bob Hogan in New Jersey but I think they hold serve in Nevada\nArizona Tennessee Texas I think that's done and then they uh flip flipped five seats Montana North Dakota Missouri Florida and Indiana so there's plus five if you win Wisconsin that can be plus six\nQuite the rally last night the president does a rally in Houston, Texas at the Toyota Center been there many time I'm a rock and span\nIf they got a hundred and ten thousand chicken request

the base is in Texas\nTo support Donald Trump and Ted Cruz\nClick bait or Rourke is outrage Santa Cruz by forty million dollars in shows that election or by eight to ten points but that goes to show a little more narrative when you hurry for the last ten years is that the Democrats now think Texas is simply not come to fruition if not\nElected statewide with a Democrat in that state in two decades and the bottom line is\nWhen Donald Trump shows up ground where people are excited happy they want to [noise] and they had a record number of you know\nIt had to move the venue for the larger arena

Trump sentiments\nCorey a lot of people talking about your upcoming book when are we going to see an excerpt of it\nYou know I like I like to build the suspense is you know now it's all going to get through the metro elections and then I think you'll start seeing and fiction grabs right after the election you know the book has not been so bad for about four weeks\nAnd so I've made some predictions that I Hope comes through in the election I think they will a pretty good at this stuff and then you'll see it shortly right right after you'll see some extra credit for that\nAnd we are anticipating that\nIt's going to clean house and get people in there that are\nActually helping drives his agenda for telling me I'm right\nA year a hundred percent correct look I think every president after mid term election regardless of the success or failure so their party shuffle the deck a little bit I think you'll see some changes in the cabinet or some of those at the end our discussion of whether they come to fruition or not I couldn't speak to but I think it's very typical\nTo see a change is take place in the near term elections regardless of the outcome of the election\nCorey I Want to thank you for your time let Trump be Trump got to buy it got to buy it now let Trump\nThe Trump more information go to great America committee dot com quarterly went down the

mind\nWhen you got me to use John [noise] but then as I was listening to you or I don't know if that was a commercial about that was exactly about telling Congress to safer or to build the yeah\nI was just going to say if all those people that are still\nIn Mexico we should be fine right because Mexico don't belong\nRight or so we shouldn't have to worry about them I'm going to cross the border right\nYeah sure so what's your point\nMy point is do we really need to believe anything that the president tells us because he told us it was going to do so now what do I need to believe what\nThe Mexico he didn't say that he didn't say that Mexico\nWould build the wall he said that he would build a wall and Mexico would pay for it and the way they were paying for it is by the terrorists\n... which is exactly what he's not like he just can't get Congress to give them the funding you need the money is there and being ... by renegotiating the disastrous NAFTA deal which has hammered us ... workers manufacturers and makers of things for forty years in the United states were thirty whatever it's been\nA bite by renegotiating that when everybody said he wouldn't be able to do what he's

investigating the businesses now and those taxes will start to get paid biting growing tax base in two thousand Nineteen there's about a one year lack so I'm not worried at all about it\nUh-huh okay\nWell I mean I guess if you ever take your time I guess you're probably not worried about it I Am because I don't believe\nWell I'm certainly worried about what about the the thing that is a matter of fact\nThat's a mess that that that is an absolute mess that was a slap in the face a bike NBS to President Trump and to the administration now they're shown him tremendous good will they look the other way around them a lot of the shenanigans that he's done a ... and\nJohn yes we're going to the president somebody yes I don't worry about what the impact is on the stupid plus I have talked about I have talked about how do we care about insulted I really [noise]\nIt's not it's not the person it's state it's the relationship with the United states but I I Would hold a back seat or

any anybody on that I have covered that in depth every day for two weeks in India\nAnd called and he told them out\nHere yet and that's what I what I hold out\nIs what I've called out is banking so

come\nIs that didn't Congress involved is that how they should be involved in this or do you see it in a different way cover\nCongress certainly has a role to play in American foreign policy we we'll talk about a lot so commentators you say that they they really don't do that it's all up to the president of the executive branch I don't think that's the way the constitution works\nI think our foreign policy is conducted by the by the president but certainly broadly major influence through Congress also [noise] so ah the point is is a legitimate to go to the Congress and have that conversation but they have limited power\nTo do that so many things but frankly the they can set a standard that Congress can set a standard if they choose to\nOne more secondary Yemen kitchen for everybody that's listening ... take a look at where I Am really is and it said the southern part of the Arabian Peninsula so if you have Iran to the north and they are so many English a revolution under civil war down in Yemen\nYou get is Saudi Arabia flanked on Moore's north and south [noise]\nUh they can't put up with that and that's why they try to defend themselves but war is always horrible particularly third world country\nThe humanitarian impact is awful\nBut they make the decision about how they think that they have to protect the\nCountry and that that's really what's going on so the point is they give me a lot of conflict is more complicated and the first appears on the fresh\nI Want to get to in order to go there you had written just the other day and one of the things that you said in the peace or you talked about the relationship we have with the Chinese and of course a lot of people and not have a lot of people were predicting that\nChina will eventually overcome the United states has an economic power will be indebted to them or you have a little bit of a different take on that you want to share that with their audience governor\nYeah yeah I'm just not pessimistic everybody the conventional wisdom in America these days it was a bad goes on in China is on the couch\nAnd I just reject that I just don't agree with that at all I think the\nUnited States has the absolute advantage for the future we're the ones at least so far they have a free economy where the winds are still have a free country that everybody looks to watch uh we're the ones that actually bring material benefits there are system\nThe Chinese have got a real problem on their hands\nAnd their problem is a modern society and the twenty first century they cannot continue to run an authoritarian government and yet that's their vision for the world that's their vision for China that they're going to control the east in the western Pacific in eastern East Asia I got to control it\nAnd they're going to be it'll start carrying methods to do that and in fact you see concentration camps now in western China shut up against minorities this kind of brutality cannot last in the twenty first century with the Internet modern media modern communication and ah and frankly are rising middle class in China\nThey their problem is they're building their middle class which is a good thing but the middle class was not going to stay under communist dictatorship\nDo they have all the advantages going forward the twenty first century not going to be a Chinese Century each going to be an American century or get\nA what about our debt a lot of people now getting concerned about the\nThe tax cuts of the president which I Know both you and I are very much in favor of it I think they feel this economy I've tried to tell\nOur listeners if you look historically a tax cuts and the effect of having the economy and growing right in growth\nThen the main thing is is there's a lag between when the tax cuts take effect and when the revenue increases to actually out things\nWhy that was prior to the tax cuts so there's a lag the president ALSO Holding in his cabinet under the blue and saying time to get out\nYour green I said I Want to five percent cut from everybody across the board you can find it have a good day ... what do you think of that\nWell first of all what you're listening to that from time to time go on my Web page about my nonprofit policy organization called American opportunity dot org American opportunity dot org and you'll see that over the years we've written about economic growth than we've written about foreign policy you're limited to\nA recent article that I wrote on foreign policy of actually rich six and we also have some people writing all some Chinese issues about other issues like that there are a Web\nPage American opportunity or\nBut one of our oldest physicians that we've done in our organization the gross code which is decided at the time that to the left was in charge of the country and the wages were not growing if people were not working on a wire it was gross\nAnd we propose that there'd be a policy of tax cuts for economic growth well that should have been done and\nUh and you know the whole point is this how you're going to get rid of the debt you're either going to have to raise taxes in order to finance the dead or you're going to have to grow in order to create more revenue to build a bigger pot\nBut at the end of the day ... good increased revenues and she just stand the same revenue it again if you if you're a is a gross by ... billion dollars he's been spending a billion and a half you're still on the\nShow at the end of the day we have some major to share this Tucker about how we're going to spend our money\nRight now we're basically a moving the leftist trying to move us in the direction of socialism which is a transfer of money for one pockets of the other but at the end of the day there's no limit to that and that increases the debt and furthermore dries out money that's going to be absolutely\nEssential for the coming conflicts of the twenty first century and our military spending that's got to be absolutely necessary I research are\nAre developed but science\nThese things are also have to be pushed for all of it so we have a lot of priorities and good governance and good executive leadership got to be just a good irrational leadership is going to be necessary to help define that spending\nSo um we can't touch a ton of them is because the president has made that promise on multiple times that was part of his economic ...\nSocial Security your PIN in these different things the money's going to be there I'm not going to cut that that represents what over fifty percent of the budget right right right there ah he's not going to cut military spending you know now so when you when you look at a five percent cut across everything else discretionary spending\nYou know you're not talking about trillions of dollars are you\nWilling Joel desire lady American conservatives which they actually do an inventory of\nAnalysis where we are spending money and then have a policy discussion are real political discussion commit during campaigns are get elections or otherwise what we're spending our money on and what we have to spend their money [noise] but one thing it real short and that is if you increase taxes you reduce economic activity\nEach year increase taxes you reduce economic activity\nIt me and that's the approach to the left their goal is to simply go for the bucks and grab the money from anybody they can get it off and they didn't make it quote or they're rich unquote but I can promise\nYou John based upon all the numbers I've ever seen\nIn order to pay for this dead end\nUp paying for this government if it's going to be a socialist you're gotta go into the middle class and get gotten buddy ... just after and a conservative don't believe in that we believe and people keep the get much of their own money as they can that's why I ran for governor I pushed the car tax cut\nAnd that's what the goal is the goal is to give people more control over the last one to keep their own money tax the Republican conservative my truck and that's where we have to try to do for the future [noise]\nGovernor Jim Gilmore that is a great analysis of where we are today that's why I Love having gone\nSo refreshing thanks for your time sir he for more information you can go to the governor's website American opportunity dot org American opportunity dot

next on sexual radical stuff\n[laughter] Jim thanks for being with us on the job he's written a number and\nWe're on the same things on the show ... you got to do something at the\nThe fact that this was done in a conflict ... an embassy look you either have international world order or you don't\nAnd for all mine Trump listeners out there we all screaming about sovereignty right you want to celebrate you know what a one world government you know one one world order you want sovereignty well if their sovereignty that means is countries and if this country's\nThere has to be an international order otherwise there's world chaos and one of the international lawyers are if you walk into an ever see it's supposed to be safe and sacrosanct not you get your head chopped off and put in a barrel\nThat'd be essence got it there's a day of reckoning coming governor of the day of reckoning it happens it happens when you behaving this way and it's coming quicker rather than later in my judgment surround the same page on that thank you governor\nCountry and this would have been between countries but now he has tarnished reputation as a president is family simply guilt by association and I personally believe the time has come to deliver a very strong in [noise]\nAnd ah not a slap on the rich this was the kinds of messing with the Saudis have to basically learn\nThat what they're doing it harms not only their reputation harms harms their own country and also harm the interest of the United states of America or I Would start very much by making it clear the Saudi you sit there with the war is over\nThey have to wrap it up\nSo I Would certainly a crime to take whatever actually put it against the people directly involved\nAll the way up to invest so much of the real world we're not going to take personal actually against Mohammed bin Laden I Believe but certainly not for people in his inner circle that this or that hurts\nThe\nCommentary that are read by somebody from us that we needed them terribly act is not a good way to the real narrative is the Saudis are much more than we\nUsed to have a it's not any um\nThe word I'm looking for it it's not a one way street and the Saudis dependence on the United states is really quite considerable\nThey can't go to somebody else to buy weapons because I can but it means that they may break with their own military comes to a screeching halt within a within days because we provide all the spare parts we provide\nAmerican companies in American technicians or provide most of the maintenance or a supervision\nAnd the maintenance skills in time as I said I don't believe the certainly military could stay functional company owns a few weeks maybe a month or two without a direct American support\nSo we have you ever had there's no doubt in my line we have the upper hand it also looks like the Europeans are going to start selling um most or equipment to solve these so that leaves them with the Russians are the only other viable place to go and I'll tell you\nIt will take five years old basically stands out the American equipment and by by [noise] no I haven't been so much reaction

Ambassador\nIncompetent or you're the first one that said that and ah I've got it written down because I think that really sum this up\nYou know a lot of the things that MPs has gotten involved in um have not been successful whether the the way he's conducting the Yemeni civil war which I think ah even supporters of that would say it's been a disaster on every possible level\nThe um the plucking he did with Egypt Bahrain and the Emirates against the guitar has been a total colossal failure it's almost a comedy show\nBecause uh the country of cutting the stadiums\nQuarter is much better off economically and otherwise and they were before the blockade and all the men is that the Saudis aren't getting any of their business I mean it was really a complete the doctor for me\nI mean if you if you went to Harvard Mr bathroom toilet a business class and international relations how to do a blockade inhabit blow up in your face and that would be your classmates a disaster\nSo every day the guy gets involved in a blows up at what point does students fathers saying you know maybe he's just not equipped\nI well I think there may not be in a situation where you actually calling the shots\nWhen

the Iranians are going to let this one play out personally further undermining the er physician of Saudi Arabia\n\nThere are these are the Iranians position now are they able to say you shouldn't have done away with the nuclear agreement the Jaycee Pilates and you know what he's doing favoring somebody was much worse than thing we've done\nI mean that's an arguable question but right now the Saudis have made the headlines not that was [noise]\nIt made all the negative headlines\nOr so for them to read you a question of [noise] a sitting\nIt out I think they should be able to play the propaganda part of the war with ah [noise] I began to work really well and the amount of residual support there might have been\nOn for the Saudis in Yemen War or is just going through the uh\nYou're gonna just go away or the other one Ron this or the church is now in a position of saying you know it comes to was the salaries for ah what's the word I'm looking for a for [noise]\nA mastery of that part of the world than they are not going to the physician\nOr just to add up to him so on all ends\nIt is a lose lose for the salaries all around and it's unless we actually reading forcefully and it's a lose lose for us as well we do need to put the Saudis and their place to make sure the Saudis understand who they really are they are not the country the culture shock for the United states of America\nOr\nIf you're either either were calling the shots or none of calling the shots but they're not the ones calling for us [noise] so I I feel very strongly\nThat to\nKnow there's some stand up and say this is not you know this is simply in Colorado\nIt's brand or no matter how you slice it I think now embarrassed him and his family down there all the time [noise] so\nHow did you get to this

fifty percent now well above ... migrants are coming from Central America fifty percent there was a time when almost a hundred percent were single males coming from Mexico looking for jobs like everybody got that\nIn two thousand one\nLess than one percent of illegal aliens claimed asylum now thirty percent claim asylum\nAnd we have a law\nThat was passed in two thousand Fifteen called the

days if you can't get your paperwork process the twenty days the federal government the border patrol has to release them this is all was the Democrats like the law\nBecause once they're released it's over [noise]\nThey get a piece of paper that say show up on this day which is not a week's out years out years [noise]\nSo then they just disappear into the interior of the country they only have twenty\nDays and now obviously you can't separate the children from the parents so the parents and the children or whatever the children are the guardian wherever they are they can be detained together but only for twenty days at the end of that twenty they have to be released they get a piece of paper\nAnd then they just go wherever they go in\n\nAnd they say they're coming blink persecution I'm I'm certainly that some are countries they're playing or not doing that well but four billion people would like to migrate to the United states\nOn the back seat it just doesn't affect the elites for the rich they they it has no impact on them they send their kids to private school and who has no impact on\nThis is a burden on middle and lower income Americans because schools get over\nRound the welfare system explodes and I told you the story of my own so when I moved to just speak Virginia we put them in school I guess it was what third third grade and or the gift card fourth I don't I\nI don't remember third or fourth grade first day of school\nTwenty five kids in the ... I get I get that\nTwelve them don't speak a word of English just forget was in the school that I was in twelve or Thirteen kids don't speak a word of English all migrants now what are you going to do how can that be satisfactory learning environment\nYou can't\nSo the teacher was going to go down to the lowest common denominator we pulled them out and some of the St Matthew Catholic school I didn't have the money for that so we have to give up a lot of different stuff\nSo you pay your taxes for an education that is worthless in some areas of your living in a mansion in northern Virginia in orbit that's that's you know as a five million dollar lobbyist for the federal government you don't care\nThey're going to private school but if you have to send your child to a public school because that's\nWhere your economic meat to land and half the kids in there can't speak a word of English you tell me what kind of\nA learning environment that for your child well it's not it's no fault of the children but it's a form of the system through lounging it I mean this is an invasion that and they're they're burning they're burning tires in front of the U.S embassy there flying around\nThe Honduras Guatemala flying\nAnd their boss basically taught thing the president to stop them because they know that as soon as they get in the United states there say they won't get really into ...\nBecause their cases are years away so they simply disappear in the interior of the country\n\nAnd all they have to do in the first asylum hearing is meet the basic threshold see their stream thresholds of asylum\nThe first one is just claiming it eighty percent of people me the first asylum requirements so they're released anyway and the other twenty percent get released also because they can't get processed in twenty days so they all get released this is the problem these are the loopholes\n\nOf the people that are detained that actually show up in court when they're supposed to Fifteen Percent so eighty percent of people are not apprehended\nCourt when they're supposed to so you do the math like Ninety five percent of the people that put one foot in the border of the country state it's an it's an incredible number and they're coming for either economics or for family reunification\n\nAnd we don't know even who's in this caravan human traffickers drug cartel malls bad people some say some say that there's even terrorists than in in there from the middle east no one knows\n\nWhat is the president to retry zero tolerance that was a public relations fiasco\n\nSo I tell you what [noise] um the images on TV Now and what the what the caravan of done is they've pushed all the women and children to the front of the line still the cameras catch only women and children on TV so you see children crying and moms\nCrying for food for their baby well they make the choice to come but it doesn't matter\nThat's the images that the fake news wants to play they don't want to go deep into the caravan of find out who these other people are and who is funny that\n\nHas anybody asked that question me this is an invasion it's like we have the laws we have no water we have no laws we have nothing\n\nSo here's why the Republicans are going to win and hold the house because suburban women\nThat the Democrats have been counting on heavily to give them victory because of whatever reason are looking at two things mobs in caravans mobs and caravan angry mobs an agri caravan\n\nI don't think that's conducive to getting votes for Democrats [noise] if you look at the early voting right now in the trends in early voting Republican turnout and Republican areas is through the roof mobs and caravans", "show_name": "Dennis Prager Show", "year": "2018", "city": "Portsmouth", "day": "23"}
