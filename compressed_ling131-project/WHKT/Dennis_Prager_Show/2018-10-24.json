own paper but it has to be a a ratified by Congress or it's just it's just it's just a piece of paper\nSo Mexico's not paying a nickel for the wall and if the Trump kept his promises\nAnd uh I got the

are not engineered their knock scientists they're not lawyers\nThat they're not your brighter and they cannot be allowed and the president has been telling these countries to stop and I think an

the U.S Senate and I think you're going to hold the house by five that's it Josh critics radio network will be back with your calls when I get back into the Trump that war dot com you know without\nThis president has been very forthright for over three years now talking about not just the people coming in illegally but the drugs that are pouring into our country Ninety percent\nOf heroin coming into this country comes or a southern border we had increasing and cocaine coming in now fentanyl folks market data learn words central responsible for thirty thousand\nDad just last year it's coming and increasingly or a southern border being manufacturing China but\nPresident's talking about the forties and coming into our communities through the southern border and it needs to stop this is a failure\nAnd that's where the president my boss last January in the cabinet room for one hour\nOn life she said he would do a deal and the dreamers he wanted to end chain migration and the visa lottery system get that wall built and he would do a deal on the dreamers and you know what the Democrats never thought he'd make good on many call their bluff yet again they walked away from the table never even heard of again [noise]\n\n\nNo radio network is jobs\nMobs in general van that's what we have right now and we know polls and here's my now my\n\nHere come look we've got twelve days to the midterm vote Republican you're voting for jobs you voted for economic prosperity you're voting for you\nJay Trump you vote for the Democrats you're voting for mob and Taliban touch it and you want to turn the clock back on the tax cuts\nAnd everything else now what you're going to have to endure through the next ... days are fake paws because now we have a new system in the United states ladies and gentlemen you know it's fake news is that we have to take polls we have big polls to\nDrive thinks news to draw the conclusion let me say it again in the next twelve days be very wary of what the legacy meaning is going to do here's what's the legacy media it's going to continue to do the New York times CNN\nThe fake news think polls driving fake news for updates narrative perfect conclusion it's all fake and you've got to get the truth right here from your Godzilla of the truth in America and\nThat to me when CNN puts a poll out showing mayor Gillum in Florida a ... point to override\nThe Santa and he's a socialist that is absurdity\nBeyond belief that sort of real poll none of these calls are real not one of them are real they did their senior two thousand six thinking that they're going to do it again and these are not holes to disseminate legitimate information these\nYour polls to drive a result so you're going to get from the legacy media fake news with fake polls to drive\nThe fake narrative to get a fake inclusion\nAnd here's what they want you to do they're going to continue to tell you and lie to you what these polls that they take would think metrics and and the false information these are pushed falls to try to get a result and\nHere's what you're going to get you going to get a constant drumbeat for the next door they just like they did in November two thousand sixteen saying there's a blue wave coming the Democrats are going to win a hundred seats the generic numbers of widened to Fifteen or the Republicans are depressed don't bother to work don't hear that\nA flyer don't knock on doors don't make phone calls don't do anything because look the polling numbers show the Republicans are cooked and so why waste your time go enjoy that we can see a football game and have\nA beer that's what they want you to do they don't want you to work they don't want you to get involved they don't want you to be enthusiastic so they're going to lie to you with state polls driving fake news to get a fake narrative\nAnd at the end of the day they want to make inclusions drawn so they can get their own fake result posed by these legacy fake news ers are no longer to disseminate legitimate information and one of the public they are done to drive a narrative\nTo buttress whenever result they want and so that's why I've been telling you ... you just take one district and that's the tempted Virginia just one and I've been telling you per week Barbara Comstock\nFinally some legit poll somewhere or the other fake news polls showed her down by Fifteen\nAnd I knew for a fact that was not true same thing now they're showing spanberger ahead in the Senate fake they're showing coal burning had recommended a regular job to win that race by double digits they want to press\nRepublican turnout and depressed her volunteers and they do that by lying to you\nOr we're beyond fake news now\nNow we have the networks of the legacy media that won't even report certain news items if they think it's going to interfere with their narrative talking points of the day which is to defeat trumpet the Republicans and look I Know there's a lot of Republicans out there\nThat drive you nuts and you don't want to vote for them and they voted this way they voted that way they did you just said they didn't do that or there was some in fight or a primary fight or a few going on\nYou got twelve day here's my thing\nLet's unite now let's keep the house Republican let's bill the Republican majority in the U.S Senate so President Trump can't continue his phenomenal America First policies and keep this country moving ahead what should we do that on November ... then\nWe can fight again let's wait now quite later\nOh I don't like this one because he but he didn't he beat cancer okay whatever go fight with Dave later oh I don't like Scott Taylor 'cause he beat Randy forks I fight with them later oh I don't like Barbara cushy voted this way or that way\n\nSo I'm going to vote no I'm going to vote for nobody or I'm going to vote libertarian or I'm going to stay home\nIt's ridiculous\nRight now what Trump if you're a Trump supporter trumped needs a Republican majority period it doesn't matter who it is and he's Republican majority\nYou want to pick your petty fight we all have them I get it do it later\nThere's a lot of people that are getting on my show that I have you did with and you know who they are not going to mention their names and they come on now every single week why because we've got to bring everybody together get everybody on the same page for twelve days when this election\nBecause we are we are we're working against\nHundred million dollars in swat money hundreds of millions of dollars from the Hollywood crazy left wing ours and the entire fake news legacy media network which has a line now behind the Democrats\nAnd so that's what you're finding so fake news is out there\nAnd I'm going to say that again you're going to get the polls which is fake news to drive a think narratives to get a fake inclusion\nAnd the end\nSo they can do what roll back the tax cuts impeached Trump\n\nGo further with investigations investigate cabinet are tired of the country up\n\nSo that's my vice you get involved do something to go to the tax cuts worked out ... I don't care what you do remember how happy you were the night Trump won those of you that\nAre Trump fans are out there remember how static you were that night and I know the never Trump or his hated it in the Clinton people and the Democrats and listen to my show I Know it all drove you nuts but for those that\nWere relievers like me in trouble never happy or federal goes away November sex that to where you have if we lose because we're not gonna be able to do anything\nAnd then it it ... it ... it comes back to twenty twenty yet\nWe're real opportunity to fix things in this country and the

Trump's\nProblem with this guy and Jared Kushner's problem with the thirty three year olds Kirk crown princes you simply incompetent so now they don't trust them I don't know about Jared I've no idea but I don't think the president ... trust them I don't think he believes them and I don't think his\nCabinet and here's the problem with Trump when he doesn't think you're confident then you're in big trouble if we can deal with the not trusting thing he can like navigators right through that but if he thinks they're not competent forget it you're done and that's I think that's the conclusion\nAnd the president is drawing eight eight eight for eight oh John ate and ate for eight oh five six or six and if you want to comment on\nState polls fake news and fake narrative coming out of the legacy media\nThat's all it's all fake uh\nMeantime a single ticket holder in South Carolina we understand one the mega millions Julian dollar jackpot\nBillions of dollars one point six billion with a one
