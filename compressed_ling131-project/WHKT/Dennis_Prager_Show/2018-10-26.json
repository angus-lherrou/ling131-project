you go to a series of executive orders that would stop the caravan from coming into the United states the problem is as soon as they stepped foot and say the word asylum we can't do anything or laws and the loop holes in them Denver are written in such a way\nThat all they have to do is get at Joanne get their\nHand grabbed and say asylum and that we can't do anything they cannot go back what you've seen the president's proposed action here if you were in Congress now what would Denver Riggleman the proposing on this survey\nOne rule of law and uh we're we're we're a nation of laws and we believe in the rule of law and the way the law as written written right now you're exactly right John I don't know how\nWe we don't honor that based on what we believe is conservatives enroll in and people who follow the robo however I think Congress needs to start fixing these immigration laws as soon as possible and I also believe once that happens\nAre vetting process for any of these people that are coming through has to\nBe extreme vetting uh we do have some of the technology in place now but we don't put time limits on this if there's that many people that are headed towards the border or we don't know is it better than those in John my biggest fear um it's easy you know it's like a Trojan Horse right listen Ninety five percent Ninety nine percent of those people could actually\nBe seeking asylum um though is that you know our hearts\nSort of go out to ... with compassion however if you have people inside there that are bad actors and they're able to hide you know within this caravan we asked a fair amount and my guess is this going to be sending some pretty healthy intelligence assets down range I think we're going to be monitoring him I guess as I can only speculate right now my guest\nIt seems that are coming out of there talking about radio emissions or any kind of into that we can glean this is not a good situation this is not good and at some point I think we have to fix or immigration laws in a way that again are\nAre much more common sense in the sort of\nSort of ridiculous since we have now are going on in the border\nUm\nThe I think the concern that everyone has Denver is that okay there's twelve or Thirteen or fourteen thousand people we have to deal with it and uh\nEverybody wants to be concerned everybody's concerned about the humanitarian aspect but a lot of my course here's what they're concerned with okay if they get in\nThe town that gets in the next one is going to be a hundred and fifty thousand and you're not going to be able to stop that either because we'll never get a wall up in time and even if you have a wall you got a hundred and fifty thousand people have been a lot of people so um are you in favor of the president taking action\nNow to stop these are this a mob caravan from bomb rushing the border and coming in are you in favor of\nStopping them from coming here now\nYes yes I mean it's it's a I mean this is a matter of national security or it is a matter of precedent um and again this comes back to that was a normal American will say hey you know we understand people want to come to the United states but there's a legal process\nUm and we're gonna have to we're going to have to follow that legal process you know we we think that legal process used to be applied all immigrants and you and you're exactly right John this would set a precedent that could really be damaging to the United states' security to our policies and to our rule of law uh you're right if the if we allow everybody in we're actually\nSort of acknowledging that open borders is what we want if we don't follow the rule of law and we don't stop these these migrants sadly we we have to stop 'em now from coming in and set a precedent\nDenver at about a in about five or ten minutes the U.S government is going to release the new economic numbers or GDP expected to grow again\nThis quarter at so over four percent that could be four point one four points to four point three a bomb autonomy was chugging along in about a half percent growth I mean this\nGrowth unprecedented where do you look for in that report in ... which can collusion you think you might throw out of it on the economy gender overcoming\nWell the thing that first I'm going to look for [laughter]\nAnd it's just because I'm a geek out on the stuff is I'm going to look at the specific whenever report that I have\nA hard look at the number of jobs are based on that are open right now and I look at Virginia but I also see where we are going as far as employment but GDP gross I'm going to look at manufacturing I'm look at agriculture I Love looking into the numbers this year that growth is and if we're\nContinuing on his mind John if we're continuing with the lowest unemployment claims and forty nine years of her continuing with Los minority unemployment for continuing which he grows four percent of every quarter which you know is amazing a it's a new normal was too I mean this is pretty incredible\nMac worse opportunities zones can be LeBron's here in the ... in the commonwealth an opportunity\nIs on investment all the things that we look at to encourage opt entrepreneurship to encourage people keeping their own money is working and that's where I'm going to look at it this report is is this just a continuation of this amazing just amazing surge or are we seeing an even more positive future\nFor the people in the fifth district but also in the United states and then the commonwealth of Virginia I think we are I think we're just seeing the beginning of this economic boom and um I I'm\nReally just really excited to see what those numbers say based on where job growth in one sector or growing right now\nWhat kind of interesting to see these are coming\nOut momentarily we expect that that we're going to get over four percent growth and it's really really tough for a Democrat right now to talk about economics the economy or any of the issues that pertain to jobs and prosperity in America so they'd rather talk about something else that's why your opponent\nLovely Coburn is talking about your Halloween costumes\n'cause she doesn't want to talk about the economy she doesn't want to talk about job she doesn't want to talk about growth should want to talk about kids moving on to the basement she doesn't want to talk about the booming small businesses she doesn't want to talk about the deregulation she doesn't want to talk about the number of investments that are going on because of the tax\nCuts especially as it relates to one hundred\nPercent deduction of capital investments you Rob doesn't even understand it and so she doesn't want to do with any any of that she'd rather talk about your Halloween costume two thousand five\nYeah and I mean which I Will not take down off the net by the way so here's what you would rather talk about she'd rather talk about forty million dollars in spending\nNot only for Medicare for all but also for forgiving student debt right which is one point for a trillion dollars right now free community college for all are free college for all everything she said and even a debate she was like I Want to give away this\nShe doesn't understand the taxpayer money is what you're using I get so limited based on what I've taught for you know in government overreach she says she loves government I fear government I think government should be limited I think government should be a fish and\nShe also said the taxpayer money for the middle class\nIs nothing more than confetti she's compared eyes to the Nazis I mean I I find it's stunning John did anybody would vote for allegedly\nHer views are great for San Francisco and maybe a three square mile area there or somewhere up in Georgetown right in DC but for the fifth district it's absolutely appalling that she thinks these values are actually a political to the people the fence about every day and work for a living and don't give a rat's\nWith the chattering class is saying on CNN or MSNBC or any of these other far left and then they are now they're just they're just propaganda machines\nAnd I think at some point ah that's going to break through that you have comments you have this coalition of common sense against progressive pander is and I think that's what's happening in the fifth district and we're going to win this John because I represent American values I represent conservative values but I represent what the fifth wants to do right now and that's why we're going to win this\nDenver Riggleman I Want to thank you for being with us what's your website\nA stepper for Congress dot com\n[noise]\n[noise] [noise]\n\nIt when for the Democrats now it's

don't know if the bombs are real are fake or they emptied out some firecrackers\nPut it in a in a in the toilet paper tube and uh uh attacks the digital watch to it to make it look like a scary thing we don't know a towel meantime it's easy to scare people what can I tell you\nWe don't know and I'm not going to go down that road what I can say is whoever did it is crazy in one way or another whether they're certifying bleed can be committed to an institution crazy or just that they've got a screw loose you don't do that kind of normal people well adjusted people don't do that\nWas assassinated Lee Harvey Oswald who defected to the Soviet Union was pro Cuba\nUh he was found to be the shooter or yet who got blamed for the John birth society and all the conservatives so\nThis is not the first time that the guilt by association or let's let's let's slammed the conservative let's blame everything on conservatives not the first time it's been done before we even know who actually sent these packages so\nIt's a everybody's got to calm down take a breath and ah I think Sarah Sanders had it right we should be coming together the president is calling for unity dialing down their rhetoric\nAnd the Democrats are going in the opposite direction they're they're they're blaming the president unequivocally no question about it take no responsibility whatsoever\nFor calling the guy look at the sky Brennan\nThe president's guilty of trees or what the what the penalty for treason that he's basically a former head of the CIA had been out they're calling for the president to be hung\nBy the neck until dead and this is not considered inflammatory rhetoric I it's\nIt it's disgusting the whole thing is just just hypocritical these people will go down as the all time greatest hypocrites\nJust ask you something a ... I I think you make a great analogy of the depression and that's of the Democrats who cried and screamed and whine about Kavanaugh\nDocumenting the FBI not investigating everything I mean why don't we just waste here I mean the FBI seems to be horn again in southern Florida that come up with a report pretty so we're we're going to find out the answer why not just wait\nExactly how about everybody say calm down let's we got we we have the FBI on the case unless this guy was a or gal or or or bought or whatever [laughter] whatever\nIt was that created these packages and less that entity was a very very very sophisticated person are able to buy it and if they were very sophisticated they were able to cover their tracks\nBut considering the number of packages delivered to these various places coming out of one place\nAnd there are a lot of clues there and I'm confident that the FBI will be able to figure something out here and find out who did it or narrow it down and the fact that they use Debbie Wasserman Schultz as a return address\nThat's kind of interesting in itself Debbie Wasserman Schultz is the one who was forced to step down from head of the\nDemocratic National committee a because she had been reading the system for Hillary against burning I don't know what that means but it sort of an interesting clue you know maybe somebody thought that was\nBut my point is that unless this was a very sophisticated operation but they knew a how to cover their tracks at every step of the way\nYou've got twelve packages now that the FBI is investigating it let's wait for the FBI to figure this out to come up with something yeah why not wait before you start\nA and and why not why are they not waiting because they want to politicize at least the Democrats are missing no opportunity to score political points on this\nWell it's uh it seems that it it just seems odd to me that that all this is happening but let's wait I mean that's where everybody's saying let's wait any time let's get to let's get the the economy will get to the Taliban invasion after the bottom of the hour or\nSo let's get to the new economic numbers that just came out the gross domestic product GDP growing another three and a half percent now let me just say what this means right this is the first time that we have had\nBack to back quarters or in a very long time of of of over three and a half percent growth back to back and do more confidence uh up at an all time I can see we're spending was that one percent another great a quarter of\nEconomic growth this is more bad news for the damage they don't want to talk about this and they don't want to talk about the economy or jobs or the growth so what did they talk about\nThey talk about all they talk about they've got this wonderful thing to talk about this horrible thing to talk about here with the with the bombs and they talk about the president again they're falling in they don't realize they're falling into a trap and and it's their own travel tropic of their own making\nPeople don't want to hear the Democrats talk about the president they want to hear the Democrats Republicans the politicians in Washington talk about what they're what the politicians are going to do for them to make their life better write what I I I go to work every day\nI got a family to support I got a job or I'd like to get a raise what are you going to do to make that happen how are you gonna make my life better easier make me rich uh make make make my kids you know healthier talking about President Trump talking about you're\nA Native American DNA doesn't do that [laughter]\nDo that talking about President Trump are causing the bomb scare doesn't do that so they're going back to the for the last two years old I've been talking about is President Trump is is a Russian agent and now they're President Trump as a Russian agent who create create bomb scares I mean\nThey're they're they're not doing themselves any favors\nAre they and and on the other side I mean it burns very clear jobs now moms or President Trump and the Trump Administration has created the best economic conditions in this country in in a generation the best we've seen\nThe way that answer people's questions for me lately [noise] you've gotten my food stamp out of the basement there on their own great thank you very much\n\nFor the last job over again I mean\nI mean I could go back and the same thing when it was all whatever was going through at the time it was\n", "show_name": "Dennis Prager Show", "year": "2018", "city": "Portsmouth", "day": "26"}
