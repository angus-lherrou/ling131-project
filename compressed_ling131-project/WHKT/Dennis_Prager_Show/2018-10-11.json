look at all of our phone calls where the government a record who we talk to how long we talk to them without a warrant and so there is a group of actually pop artists in Republican and Democrats\nAre

and the phony Pfizer warning none of that could have happened without them shaped your act that set that up\nAnd you were the ones that said you keep covering ... Jimmy government this unlimited power of surveillance and its eventual you got to come around and bite you in the bud center that's exactly what happened\nBut I had the same very strained conversation yesterday with the director of the FBI because I asked\nHim point blank argue gathering information including suppressed phone calls and of course he's butter and said oh I Can't answer that are they're setting and the parents here for answering yes there was an article about two or three years ago saying that they recorded Fifteen hundred of President Obama's\nPhone calls and then they ... him which means they sort of markets loud but is it to tell where he President Obama or President Trump was talking to a foreign leader your they're out of their voices [noise]\nEven if you're minimized or you know a marked out the names you can't tell her the voices are but we shouldn't be doing that\nThe conversation and their record it and then they're out there and then the FBI condemned search this day without jackets Warren and my point of him was and I think he didn't understand it or didn't understand it is [noise] if you're recording things on potential terrorists from overseeing the cost of government lawyer clock\nBut if they're talking to American torture random people are talking to Americans we do get constitutional protections because many of the phone call our discussions with terrorists in fact the vast majority are innocent international phone calls\nAnd so we have had this discussion down and uh it should be protected by the costume some say the Fourth Amendment John Adams says the spark that led to the revolution because when you get in like the British soldiers coming into our houses you know breaking down there to work for are strapped tax [noise]\nUh we really wanted protection and we want to say the government and never come in your house or any of your private\nConversations are belonging without talking to a judge first\nWell and that's a that's why you were so adamantly opposed to when you were a predictor of the future with this whole thing senator\nYou've also been a very strong voice on the disappearance of junk mail to show the there's a lot of talk about what should be done and we want more information\nAnd like I get that but as a member of the Foreign Relations committee you're the only senator that has proposed action which is until we get answers on his disappearance because\nSenator thing is we haven't videotape showing that he went in there is nobody will take showing that he went out and I'm a crown prince NBS Mohammed the common sense of the camera footage ones corrupted or the battery went dead\nDidn't really care only by that is like\nThe dog ate my homework or I didn't get ever ready battery and so the battery died now you have called for an immediate suspension of ah the arms sales to the Saudis until we get some kind of a satisfactory answer can you elaborate on that sir\nI think everybody should remember that Saudi Arabia is the largest state sponsor of radical Islam around the world what I mean by that or if they had been finding quarter Madrid authors in Pakistan, India needed a cello scenes even in the United states\nTeaching critical west of Christianity and teaching and radical violent and junior\nOfficers who are the Saudis are we shouldn't be telling a weapons simply because they're graphic Fifteen of the Nineteen hijackers\nWho came here were from Saudi Arabia Saudi Arabia is a big part of our terrorism problem they are they've founders of terrorism and teaching of radical Islam around the world this latest episode\nI I see no way that this could have happened without there being it's all\nToo private planes with clean guys on um [noise] some of them have been linked to Saudi security services and intelligence I'm now it doesn't pass the smell test on a you know we just wait it out to the press\nThey listen to in addition to them killing a

three weeks ago they killed a school bus full of children's school children were killed\nA year ago they killed a hundred and fifty people want to know procession and we wonder why someone in Yemen wants to drop a bomb on a killer either Saudi or killing Americans because they climbed the fragments of the bombs that same married in America and so we have to realize that for every action there's yeah and that's a blowback\nFrom us being involved in some ... gotten civil war oh here's one that we actually create more terrorists but here's the other possible thing that's going to\nHappen again or what happened in Libya when we toppled Gadhafi\nWe've got a house in more terrorism or became a breeding ground for terrorism market\nHere is that there is some remnants barely fairly strong remnants of al ... and yet but we're not fighting down that we're missing or stricter\nCivil war between the shootings in the salaries and also with Iranian influence as well the march ... cents into chaos and that you get the rise of al ... the same thing happened in Syria as that civil war that\nWe got involved in the house you got the rise of ISIS\nWell actually the network that I go on a gym near a couple of months ago was reporting that al Qaida fighters were actually given safe haven a by the by the Saudi forces in Yemen in ... in in order to fight the cookies so\nThis wouldn't you wouldn't be surprising because here that the Saudis support in Syria they support her down news round which is essentially an offshoot of al Qaeda so the Saudis are all these poor people who hate America Israel who have a western wires\nAnd yet we kinda big arms deal the president says oh wait for jobs for a job that's not something that we should get considering what we argue arms deals we need to be considering our national security not trying to have some sort of Keynesian jobs cook\nYou're on the Jon Stewart who's radio network trucking the truth across America where when Kentucky Senator Rand Paul Republicans on the Foreign Relations committee or he's been the strongest own voice in the U.S center on\nHow we react to the uh Jamal to show ... disappearance\nSo have you recommended this to the president\nCenter have you with direct conversation because remember a look didn't I wasn't an original Trump supporter everybody knows day when it came down the escalator he campaigned on getting out of these entanglements not staying in the have you had any direct conversation with the president on how we should react to this\nNonsense and killing of the journal asked um he does know not only was rather watch all about once every week or two and when we have our conversation is actually in general are by the time\nThat uh he has the same instincts but I Do that with dinner on the Afghan or too long\nThat we should mistake forever and\nYet he's surrounded by arresting forever crowded [noise] that's a real problem is I think the president's instincts are good I'm sort of in the crowd at what the president to be the president and write and\nYet the people surrounding him are I think too often you know part of the traditional foreign policy around here which is go stay forever and bankrupt America\nSen Paul the president has invested a lot of political capital in the Saudis that was the first place that he went\nIn his first foreign visit a MPs came to the United states he did as a media tour with them to Saudi spend a ton of money on media PR as you know uh in in in the swamp\nAnd so he's put a lot of uh and and you know we kind of looked the other way when NBS rounded people up jailed him in that hotel whatever they did\nThis administration has looked the other way is this you know affect our relationship with the Saudis and my ... and tying it to that is it going to change the president's position on the Saudi ... book Largo of the state of Qatar where we have or\nBiggest military base in the middle east\n[noise] yeah I'm not so sure you got
