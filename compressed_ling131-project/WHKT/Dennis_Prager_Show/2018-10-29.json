she says we shouldn't course federal law just left localities deal with caravans coming in to the country went under the Constitution's federal government has given that President that's already there and so I\nDon't think people are just ... what she's actually saying she's not over saying don't follow federal law she sang less nor the law of the land is running as a law enforcement candidate

for narrow it down and the fact that they use Debbie Wasserman Schultz as a return address\nThat kind of interesting in itself Debbie Wasserman Schultz was the one who was forced to step down\nFrom head of the Democratic National Committee a because she had been reading the system\nFor Hillary against Bernie I don't know what that means but it's sort of an interesting clue you know maybe somebody that was funny to use her name out all these bombs I\nDon't know uh but my point is that unless\nThis was a very sophisticated operations that they knew a how to cover their tracks at every step of the way you've got twelve packages now that the FBI is investigating let's wait for the FBI to figure this out to come up with something yeah why not wait before you start\nA and why not why are they not waiting because they want to politicize at least the Democrats\n[noise] well it's uh it seems like it it just seems odd to me that that all this is happening but luckily I mean that's what everybody saying let's wait anytime let's get to let's get the the economy will get to the Taliban invasion after the bottom of the hour a\nBut let's get to the new economic numbers that just came out the gross domestic product GDP growing another three and a half percent now let me just say what this means right this is the first time that we have had\nBack to back quarters or in a very long time of of of over three and a half percent growth back to back and consumer confidence uh up at an all time high consumer spending was four percent another\nGreat a quarter of economic growth and this is more bad news for the damn thing I Want to talk about that that they don't want to talk about the economy or jobs or the growth so what did they talk about\nOr are they talking well they talk about it and they've got this wonderful thing to talk about this horrible thing to talk about here with the with the bombs and they talk about\nThe president again they're falling in they don't realize they're falling into a trap and and it's their own traffic crop of their own making people don't want to hear the Democrats talk about\nThe president's they want to hear Democrats Republicans the politicians in Washington talk about what they want the politicians are going to do for them\nTo make their life better write what I I I go to work every day I got a family to support I got a job up I'd like to get a raise what are you going to do to make that happen how are we going to make my life better easier make me rich uh make make make my kids you know healthier talking\nAbout President Trump talking about you're a Native American DNA doesn't do that [laughter]\nI wouldn't do that\nTalking about President Trump are causing the bomb scare doesn't do that so they're going back to the for the last two years only been talking about as President Trump is a Russian agent and now they're President Trump as a Russian agent who Craig creates bomb scares I mean\nThey're they're they're not doing themselves any favorites\nAre they and on the other side I made it very very clear to jobs not mobs a President Trump and the Trump Administration have created the best economic conditions in this country\nIn in a generation the best we've seen in ten Twenty years and that goes along the way that that\nThe answers peoples' questions what have you done for me lately you've gotten me a job you got me a raise you've gotten my kids on food stamps gotten my kids out of the basement there on their own now great thank you very much\nAgainst or something or I'm going to pose this question and then you got to answer it when it gets back so stay with us for another segment you got to get the by the hour\n\nI mean\nIt was all going\nComing out of the towns coming out of the farms coming to vote for Trump never voted before and uh so yeah it is there is a feeling of days I moved here all of these national generic valid polls are meaningless [noise] national elections\nOther they're all like I mean it's all say calls I I've been talking all day about the Washington Post poll that came out yesterday that shows or for worse than it\nHad to Barbara Comstock Virginia's tens district by searching look whites and mice and when she should she used to play written no doubt that's a very tough for district for the Republicans could wind farms\nBut every internal poll that the Republicans have from the White House to the er ceasing to Barbara on down shows the race ... ... that's not heavy Thirteen points but this is what the Washington Post jobs they get a uh\nThey get a ridiculous methodology to get a snake holes you get a fake analysis of it to do face news to get a fake inclusion drawn so they are fake narrative and like we've already been down this path so now I'm going to start calling them on how ridiculous it isn't there it's the same house\nThat's why the way round the John ... radio network or your family your Godzilla of the truth in America where eleventh things out to\nThe biggest ... election ever Curtis Ellis is with us he's a senior policy adviser for America first policies this segment you buy the job creators network you know folks are saying is this is about turnout British just said\nThe same thing the upcoming election them they may be the most important you've ever seen a lot of their ballots besides your candidate your tax cuts are on the ballot the American economy ruined his number three and a half percent on the ballot are great\nHubs that are renaissance that's about what to do was on the ballot your jobs are on the\nBallot your sins jobs that they just moved out of the base but that's on the ballot your race your wages your case that small business\nOwners like me tax cuts uh yeah that's about it and here's the biggest issue on the ballot eleven days who's in charge of America's future politicians and got corrupted crafts and the deep state of Washington\nDC or you know if you want to preserve the victories of the past two years urging you've got to get\nInvolved this November yeah I Know you're going to vote yes or no you gotta do early voting I Know that I can count on you for that what you got to do more government drinking choice election dot com the choice elections dot com don't make it easy for you to get them well you can make calls you can send emails you can send

friday to fighting Joe ... show where with Curtis Ellis a senior advisor America First policies Chris looks into the caravan\nWith the caravan somewhere down I ...\nThe bombs that they're going to bomb rush to the border it's wrong to say one more thing about the uh about the election before\nYou just said it's about turnout and that's what this is all about you've got the polls you've got all this nonsense polls you've got this that it's about identifying voters [noise] sometimes pockets of twenty five voters here since the borders they're Seventy five voters they're a\nHundred there distinct pockets of voters that are on our\nSide in identifying them and getting them out to the polls that's what this was going to come down to that's what it's coming down to\nThe Republican National committee and others are doing a great job of that and uh that's what's going to determine this as much as old as probably more than all the ads and everything else\nSo I encourage everyone to go out and vote and bring your friends and if they're going to vote for the other side don't bring them okay\nWe'll let them out of their tires oh don't do that we don't you know what else do\nWe encourage your look if you if you have a democratic neighbor and they're going to vote see all the way down and they can't get to the polls you don't have a rise to the polls do the right thing\nNow you are so nice to get them ever\nYou know what we want every vote to everybody that as an opportunity to go get him out and get them a cup of coffee because they're still your neighbor\nThat's right the neighbors are still Americans were in this together runners together and you know what you can\nDisagree and not getting that yet so good you are in a caravan now that what the air out of the tires there that's a good idea but [laughter] by the Taliban is very different because that's an invasion okay\nHow do we stop it\nDo we stop it you don't let them in the country don't let them in the country bigger the game as they're trying to they're going to try to game the system\nTo save the words credible fear they have credible fear credible pure white credible if you're not getting a job credible fear of having to live off mangoes and bananas\nA rather than a food stamps and welfare a so once they get to the United states is set foot on American soil and say the words credible fear they didn't qualify for that triggers a whole asylum\nSeeking procedure and once they're in mash in the trial um seeking procedure\nAll of the interlocking court cases and rulings and judges by these deep state judges said you can't\nHold them you can't blame them you have to release them and give them a date to appear and they never appeared they disappear they just disappear into the woodwork they get hired by corrupt big business bosses want cheap labor\nThey get sheltered by corrupt sentimental who think oh the let's invite the entire world to live in America that's going to do everybody a great big favor and it just becomes a big mess so the way to stop there is an outlet them into the United states in the first place to stop them at the border build\nThe wall to wall literally and figuratively President Trump is sending up to a thousand troops deploying the military on the border uh\nThat's what the military is supposed to do to defend our country and we're going to defend the country in Afghanistan of the time of the country in Iraq and defend the country in Djibouti where we have troops how about we defend the country in Tijuana in Mexico the Mexican\nBorder and in Texas\nThat's right in San Diego and everything else we need to build his wall and the president determined he says I'm going to stop this because I think the president Curtis understands I'm I'm all this other time here but I think he understood understand that\nIt's Fifteen thousand today and tomorrow it's got to be a hundred and fifty thousand that one point five million because this is one thing that you said to me a while back that really are\nWas riveting and then I got to take off you said that you said your four billion people in the world that all when it comes to the United states

how'd you tied\nYours which could shake a\nStick to that they have a sixteen pointing to the yet and soon as he has a job for a\nSpanberger Seventy eight percent of Democrats are very enthusiastic about voting versus sixty two percent of Republicans well that's because they have to deal with Corey Stewart on the top of the ballot which is hurting\n\nBecause nobody is excited about Cory stores no one boy let's go ... Corey Stewart oh let's see is there are countries that are it why is it I can take to voting\nUnbelievable\nWhile forty seven percent of voters in the seventh district a crew of the job that President Trump is doing fifty one percent disapprove it's not that big of a cap it really really isn't in the Senate contest a chain is up by spot not that big of a gaffe either\n\nCertainly hurting brat now here's the good\nNews for pride in this race he's got there's two piece of good news number one is not a ... point lead among independents ... point lead that's not going away that's the only going to get bigger so there are simply if you have an eight point lead among independents\nAnd you get out the Republican base in the seventh district you win that's why a\nSpin burgers going to be excited about this whole but then when you look at the cross tabs I think this is great news reject that would have been better if it was like yeah but see any new calls from Clinton said he'll be\nNo matter what they say they over sample Democrats and you always get Republicans always outperform their poll regardless of where it is always so this is a good news for breath\nBut no race has got to be very very close and we've been saying that it's a one or two point racial beginning here's the other hand there's a there's a libertarian and the rice\nJoseph ... who has four percent\n\nIf you're voting for Walter what the hell are you doing any votes for Walton in this race is a vote for Abigail Spanberger\nPeriod that if you want to vote spanberger voters member\nIf you want to vote for ... ... votes for David right foot and vote\nFor a walk\nThe libertarian at four percent you might as well in that district to the Democrats\nIs that if that's what you want to do that's what your four percent\nVote for walks and now here's the other good news for Brett libertarians post integration those districts collapse on election day because of the other day you're going in there and you're saying why waste my vote now than\nIt is a little bit different Matt waters is the libertarian candidate\nThere are simply people they cannot vote for Cory stores they just can't do it there are Republicans that tend to not vote for Cory stores because they just don't like the guy and so you got to get a big bowl but that's a little bit different you get down to the district level\nAnd Joe ... can't win\nThat so four percent pro war is a problem for breath because it takes him out of there Ninety nine percent of those are our governor day Ninety five percent but again if you if you want to vote Robert gale have at\nLeast getting police vote for somebody in that district who could win\nThis this this makes no sense so if the woman vote collapses to the typical one percent of the libertarian gets in these races or two percent or that other to present you go to\nBrad so uh that's why there's some good news but look this is a this is a very hard fought district now\nAre we going to be doing or election night show here as Dave Brat headquarters I Will not be there I'll be calling again every so often but of course action will be running the show or people will be there but I Will not be there a\nBomb on already booked on TV that night all night so I Will not be there but we're we're going to try to do this I've made a final decision on if I were working on it speaking of ... he criticized for show coming up I W J offend radio dot com one hundred and twenty five years after that the abuse today at ten AM\nAnd Bruce ...

it would be nice for a while to see the left and the Trump painters not try to take everything into politics or we got to get rid of God oh we got to get rid of Trump or was\nTrump's fault that you know we we have crazy people it's crazy people smoke\nAnd the only thing that I heard that I made sense about what to do about this is the president said probably she should've been an armed guard there for those in there if somebody\nWas carrying they got to stop it I mean that's ... you're not going to stop the crazy people sky was nuts and he posted\nAll kinds of hate on social media\nI mean\nThese people are just I don't I don't know what happens to them but it's a sad state in the United states when it seems like we can't go sixty days without ... one of these\nIt's really sick\nIt's we're in a very sick time in our society no question about it\nPrivilege radio network truck the truth across America live in the swamp I'll be right back Dr quitting kids you're building up give it right here [noise]\n[noise]\n[noise]\n\n[noise]\n\nHe is the chairman of the Judy Washington center on politics censor Newport university now doing or something very extensive polling they hold attempt the second and now\nWith the seven at the end it Dr King's great to have you with us\n\nAre you there Dr time here\nCan you or me you know yes like OK okay we got ya I'm Dr King okay so ... you hold out it's pretty pretty interesting\nYeah I mean we have a ... as you know when we when we've been pulling his congressional races around Virginia we've been putting out two models are likely voter law when they committed voter mile and the difference between those two miles as how enthusiastic sometimes our respondents are and how\nUh how much they say they're likely to go vote and so the the likely voter model is people who have a history of voting but they um but they may be very enthusiastic it meant and they may not be not\nVery enthusiastic and then the committed voter model is that same history of voting for people who say they are very committed in their very likely to go to vote in a likely voter model we habits um impose models we have a statistical tie\nIn this race in a likely voter model we have spanberger at forty six brat at forty five and importantly the libertarian Joseph all taking four percent of the vote in a committed voter model we have a brat at forty five spanberger forty eight and ... and the libertarian taking three percent and so\nThis may be a race where a movie a third party libertarian candidate he actually plays a role as it ends up being you know within a point or two at a A R lecture nice\n\nThese four percent vote for Joe walk stunned me as I look at your whole uh when it first came out of poverty and I've seen it over the course taps Dr King I'm only had half\nHour here and I've been on the air but uh\nWhen you get a libertarian that has no money that nobody's heard of getting four percent in a district that is so hot like this which is so hotly contested knowing that all the majority of those voters are coming from James or they're not going to vote for Abigail\nUm what why is why is Joe ... ad for for ...\nThere could be there could be a number of reasons and the most likely reason could be that this is a place where disgruntled Republicans are parking their votes um because they're for whatever reason frustrated and Dave Brat um if you if you happen to be a liberal or a sort of a country club business minded Republican you might not be happy with with the brightness\nIt drops wall and drops down to three percent a year on a on a election night\nOr if it's a close race in Walton is the desire it'll be one of the rare congressional races in Virginia where a third party candidate is able to swing an election essentially um and so it'll be interesting to see a lecture night how well wall does um if he does as well as four percent and he's clearly\nGoing to have an impact on this race if he doesn't have less of an impact\nWhat normally happens as libertarians and drink rational races is that their votes collapses on election day because people that say they're going to vote for him because they're mad about something when they actually go into votes or like I don't want\nTo waste my vote because it's a low profile race it's another thing when you get to Matt waters and the U.S Senate it's higher profile and last year is no question there are people on the Republican side they're not going to vote for\nCory Stewart on November six regardless of the situation because they just can't stand the guys that's just reality check so I kind of jets that\nRussia race like that um it it's it jumps out to me I was he jumps out really well for for ...\nYeah well look I'm I think a lot of conventional norms are being turned on their heads right now during this um during the Trump era I mean one of the conventional norms are would be the incumbent\nShould be about fifty percent right now and if they're not about fifty percent they're in trouble you know we have for added at forty five percent I mean that was by conventional norms habit say that is in deep trouble but I'm not convinced that at the end of the day he couldn't pull that are really\nNarrow when I'm or you could lose by a really narrow margin I'm In a district where clearly you know there's a lot of energy but there's a lot of this a lot of disgruntlement also\nWell it's kind of it what does it come down to a doctor in when you look at these cross tabs what does this race comes down to if you're just a little deeper if you're\nThe spanberger campaign and you're looking at your home right now they do their own insurance we we all get that within your independence hall and they're looking at it now\nAs we speak what message justice spanberger campaign take from the pulse you brought up\nSome of the reason the races where it is there a couple of factors for why the races where it is Democrats have a sixteen points enthusiasm\nAdvantage over Republicans in this poll there's a\nMassive enthusiasm advantage that is overcoming what is structurally I'm a Republican district um you know Ed Gillespie wanted as you noted Donald Trump the Hillary Clinton by six points in twenty sixteen you know it's it's this is a Republican district split apart sixteen enthusiasm\nAdvantage is able to bring it to a statistical draw 'em there's massive\nGender gap advantage on the female try for spanberger bent on the males side for a Brad hey Brad has a plus Fifteen I'm male\nPoint spread on gender and then there's an age difference a stand burger has a plus nine advantage for voters on forty four and under a brat as a plus six advantage for older voters and so\nThat's I think that this side I think what's making this so close is at democratic enthusiasm advantage\nThat is being driven that is driving that females that the gender gap in the span burgers a favor on the outside\nYou're on the John triggers radio network will live today from your nation's capital of the swamp eight days before the insurance on your guts of the truth in America we're chatting with Dr Clinton she is the director of the uh\nOf Christopher Newport University in Washington Center for public policy he has a new poll out today on the seven in the San Francisco Virginia what other surprising factors or\nTo ask you about and as a tip over stored in this district only five bigger than that because the state wide lead is about what Nineteen somewhere in there\nSomewhere between Fifteen and twenty depending upon the given hole and they're given\nDay but again I'm Tim Kaine's that isn't so surprising to me I mean we we put out of all last week and the second congressional district we showed Scott Taylor up in that race and Tim Kaine\nWas leading by five almost six in that district um and in this district Tim Kaine is leading by five these are two\nDistricts by the way that are that are tough for Democrats seconds in the seventh of services really difficult for Democrats um and so it isn't surprising to me look when you can walk around the two thousand twelve he lost his district by eleventh points um and and\nThen when he you know so this isn't in historically democratic district so for him to be\nLeading at a Republican congressional district by plus five is probably\nRight given that there are other districts in the state that where he's leading by bigger and it was the margins and that sort of driving his wife totals\nYou're on the John Roberts radio network hanging\nThere was that other segments are just kind of got to get a quick word from our sponsors want to get back a pure rack reading this whole for his campaign why do they have to do in order to when I'm\nTo ask that
