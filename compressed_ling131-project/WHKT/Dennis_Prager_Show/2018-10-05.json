representatives member in leadership in Congress northern Virginia the last Republican to actually win or the chicken yet except for for for a cop structures in big trouble in this cycle also that's Jeff\nPearson a democratic state senator in leadership from Fairfax read his world\nHeadquarters in Ventura bit long time very noted democratic consultant an operative from Virginia now he's a traveling around the country helping other democratic candidates when and his most recent claim to fame as he was the only one that\nGot the two thousand seven scene Virginia election right he predicted that\nThe Democrats would pick up Fifteen seats he was the only one that any was anywhere near that so we got a stranger on the pulse no doubt guy to have you with us we've got to get to the Redskins and the caps in this segment but I've got to start with Virginia there's three seats here play\nVery very close by anybody is\nWill be there's three seats that are close well I've got three maybe you've got other than you can certainly uh bring them off without even\nAcclaimed Barbara Comstock competitive\nYes Barbara Comstock question in the tenth or Scottsdale are being challenged by a Elaine laureate and the second and\nIncome the congressman Dave Brat go against several Abigail Spanberger in the seventh so let's start with a tent that's on everybody's mind ... complex but that was that the debate in ... county and a Jeff from\nWashington was horrific I mean she was just absolutely dressed as we get our debate prep that she I mean I\nIf you try to be fair in a debate if if I dressed up as her and did that debate in my goal was to be horrible she'd get worse than I could have done it person or tried either what what's up with that\nBut there's an ounce meant that the ... district is competitive ... by Barbara Comstock for Congress\nI mean it is going to be a double digit rate she's reading from a script because he's trying not to screw up the fact that she's going to end by double digits um she obviously is capable of of doing more um than um\nThan that um you know she's been a state senator so I'm Talking on policy side I'm so she's not without shops right but at this point in this race she's being told\nWe just script don't mess up that's what happened in that debate I don't disagree with you that like you know\nDeep bushy little plane at the debate yes did she make any major errors no and that's what Barbara Comstock so upset about the debate that wants to talk about oh she did so poorly barbers limited because Jennifer didn't make any errors that allows barber to get back in ...\nIt's a landslide it's been a landslide the tenth district\nHad every single demographic group that is breaking against Trump in this country over represented in it if the Democrats do not take the tent the Republicans will hold Congress at that I agree with I don't think yeah it's it's not an end right now that's not in the realm of possibility\nBut the Republican polling you're telling me that she's tighter or slightly ahead\nBarbara is going to lose by double digits Tom\nWhen in fact she's over perform for polling every time her whole career she's over for you and your ears the problem in bend every demographic group or the Republicans are losing market share right now are collected from federal employees are high income educated voters that it was gone\nNow she's a woman and she talked\nWith the difficulties they have is the Republicans took away the one weapon Frank Wolf and I had to survive up here and that was your [noise] I was not Tom Davis was Mr guy because Gordon prison Mr Woodrow Wilson bridge Mr rail to dollars\nBarbara gets none of that uh because the Republicans get away with their constitutional obligation uh on on do you know to to designate projects\nSo this makes it more difficult race it it's a single digit rates\nJohn Rocker tell you what it is so I think this race closes I seen races close a lot more at this point but this is this is a tough race it's a tough atmosphere and it's a tough districts you remember\nTriggered that what we're [laughter] somebody thing you said again just depends on the makes a ... [laughter]\nI just I got to treat that out at eight thirty are driven Tom Davis a Japanese and you've got a lot of the truth you John his rhetoric let's get to the other races or\nLet's get to the seven I just heard Barbara I just said Abigail Spanberger on my show yesterday the very top candidate no doubt but ah I see a little momentum going for Dave I didn't think he was going to win and we should go that way I think he is going to win a Ben how do you see that race [noise]\nSo I I had that one a slightly Republican up until the Kavanaugh hearings at this point I think it's a toss up um because what the Kavanaugh hearings did was really re energized and fire up the one voter block that's the problem for Dave Brat in some district which is suburban women\nUm and I think they just haven't districts historically Republican should be Republican voter Republican ... um so my my ship 'em but I'm the one path or a Democrat there isn't an right to in Chesterfield with the suburban women\nUm and I think Abigail's at the match for them\nAnd I think that the Republicans are doing everything they can to lose that block naturally right now um and so I haven't is gossip\nThink it's been like this cabinet nominations in terms of interest let me just say yeah in in terms of what this is doing politically and I think we all live in our own echo chambers and we all have our own perceptions of how it's done but what this is done in the ... and some other polling demonstrate this is the Republican base is now\nActivated enthusiasm gap which is favored the Democrats for the last year and a half is now closed substantially\nAnd I think that works to prop secret ... David bread has two two issues though outside the demographics district in the DNA that district is Republican\nNumber one he is not close the deal with some of cancers people and they were just as soon thrown under the bus to rent that she'd out for two years\nAnd bring back or ... you know somebody it's more in line with their thinking and and even some scores and secondly Tim Kaine is going to be exceptionally strong in that district he was mayor of Richmond if he has a political he's widely ... he's the same ... but he's well regarded enrichment where he was mayor he run I think that had a Mark Warner that that that the big thing\nI still think at the end of the day that the DNA of that district establishes a cell phone and brought wins but the but this was a close race in Democrats have nominated ... she's\nVery ... or whatever happens you're talking about uh somebody that's got to be involved and democratic politics for some time I think I think Abigail Spanberger is going to have to be somebody that has to be reckoned with a in a democratic circles for some time shop\nDot die you know I don't I don't know a ton about the district or\nI Will say I was driving down the south side Virginia to go to an event last weekend and going through some of the rural counties and it seems like if Brad can pull margins out of the counties are but obviously the critical mass of the the district is in Chesterfield man right go so\nYou know I I Would probably say you know robotically it's a Republican district but obviously if it's a wave here than it could be one that the Democrats deal that would have to defend the twenty twenty\nOr let's get to the second district Taylor Maria whatever happened it was a tailor the other day I had my radio show or the a campaign put my [noise] my name and their team TV ads so I appreciate the PR for that one out of that race but\nThis is my first chance to respond to Scott right after he had his meltdown on your show on that went viral yeah I'm Upset about our analysis last time I'm announces has not changed he's still going to lose 'em and\nUm I don't think I don't believe in New York Times poll I think it was you know I I ... up to this point I'd not near trials are pretty good I had the last week they've they've not been um I think there's some noise going on\nUm but I think what is going to win and she's gonna win going way [noise] um so I think she's going to win going away I think it's going to be a [noise] a set Hillary up until two months ago I was doing everything right um and he's really blown it\nAnd he's not going to win reelection and so are you say it's because of the whole the validation ... signatures issue in the way he's handled it and remember that this district is one of the few in the country\nThat not only sits in the ... side a media market\nBut is in a media market that doesn't really stretch too many other districts so the media has been all over the fence on the evening news every night you know if Barbara Comstock at a petition scandal in Tempe district it would have made the TV for forty five seconds one night\nOr maybe a week later they quickly re mentioned that you know 'cause like\nYou you cannot get away with something\nThe tide water it's been on the road here so let me let me ... I like I think our New York times for property rights Taylor is fixed ... district very well\nOr you know it was a Navy SEAL all that kind of stuff is is the issue matrix and he has chosen I think you're in line with that district is not a far right kind of guy he understands a suburban Virginia Beach in Missouri and so we have all that going for him\nNow this petition scandal has a little bit of a smart on him or Democrats are very very good candidate and you have any pets\nThe fact that if you look nationally Democrats just a ton of cash and dropping a couple of million dollars on that race in the last week get that megaphone we just can't over Rome at this point and exaggerate these things I think I think they are trying pulls correcting papers up today a again if I were betting I I I think he wins\nBut in this environment with the kind of money Democrats he put down a you've got to be nervous about this you're going to watch this on election night if the Democrats win this seat it tells me it's going to be a pretty good year farm in terms of we're talking thirty five forty yeah I think about the [noise]\nThe thing about this district is different than Comstock and it's definitely different than a brat is the turnout model is totally different and I think it's hard for Democrats to win the seat and are not presidential year\nI'd just based on who votes democratic and Virginia Beach Norfolk it's you know that the typical democratic voters going to be a minority down there and in less you get an outsized performance it's not I think it's tough for the Democrat to win that seat of me Glen I wanted two thousand and he got flushed down the drain and twenty ten\nAnd the reason was democratic vote came out in the presidential year for Brock Obama it wasn't there the next cycle for Glenn Nye 'cause nobody knew when I was [noise] um I think God's got an advantage is that the turnout I remember back when I was in the house carcass we'd look at the turnout bottles and the numbers and\nYou know Virginia Beach in Norfolk the numbers are just forty percent of what they are in other parts of the state so it's just it's it's you got a lot of people that lived there that are you know enlisted men or women that are registered to vote elsewhere so it's just it's hard\nYou know to to bring people out in that type of environment even though with bench correct you have one media market and you know they could possible Scott from now till the end of the time but there is going to be a conservative there's going to be a conservative votes is going to come out\nAnd whether I'm a ... I don't know how to pronounce it ... whether or not she can get people out based on her name as opposed to you know Tim Kaine is not as big a magnet they're using enrichment um so I I still think it's a pill for the Democrats even though I agree that looks like Scott's kind of watch this one issue\nNineteen Ninety six and Tom Davis will remember this well um we had a we had a scandal um statewide where John Warner put a television ad up against Mark Warner who was John Warner was far ahead and um he photo shop Mark Warner and do a picture [noise]\nI don't know who's in the ... I Can't remember who he ... he thought it was up at ... I think yeah he sociable with Clinton but was it was well her during the ... there was a racial aspect to it too I Can't remember what they did but they sort of shut my corner to a picture he wasn't in and um ended a television ad\nAnd it was a huge went national scandal for John Warner who had a moderate brand and was a\nA guy that you know everyone looked she likes either what you're trying to say it's got Taylor is\nThere like had a friend okay and and and that people you know like respected John Warner much higher than Scott Taylor them [noise] and and his numbers collapsed and Mark Warner was going to win that race because of scandal and I will say this which I'm Wondering did was he walked out and he said I'm uh\nI'm responsible for what happened and I apologize and it's got telling her that he would want to\nGo I just I was worse campaign chairman that year and it was a it was a close race worse than fourteen million dollars at his own money that year that made this really a much closer race than it might have been other was good strong when it was used on beat him and that was what are the now you can earn it after running a close race there but I remember it out I mean they fired\nThe people that were involved in the ad and everything else and you broke it in it it was an issue for a week or two and then John ... accountability and he took accountability [noise] tater he's mishandled this thing I think can be just kind of destruction in having his people take the Fifth Amendment doesn't help it just keeps it in the news\nIs that enough to bring down somebody with a good reputation it's done a good job in their first term or not\nUm and also I think the the wave turnout are they talking about a ... I think you're really talking about a ... wage that's really what's happening with the Democrats is the is the suburban female voters have swung radically or to the Democratic party and that's what\nWe're going to take off will get our predictions ruin your facts segment we got to get to the reds yeah I agree with us\nAn ... billion Thirteen were there but not that popular been running and libertarian broke five percent and libertarian the automatic ballot access to the next five years in Virginia was just going which are the Republicans\nThat was going to expire this year because of the times had not crack five percent again now they're taking Corey where there'll be another five years with libertarian automatic ballot access loud\nThey're great and why is that that is a good point as a matter of fact what is going to get over five no no question probably seven Godfather's\nDeer ticks does not guarantee that you're over ... you think do you think five or it's going to win or lose\nAh [noise]\nAh what what uh what about Scott\nMaria [noise] I don't [noise] you know what's going on [noise] and ah I see you alert [noise]\n\nTwo\nAnd a stamp uh\nTerrorists got nothing but negative publicity from a over the last several months and I don't see 'em climbing out of that whole could be wrong but I don't see that and I also don't\nI mean you know [noise] Comstock can talk about her internal all she wants [noise] that's not what people are picking up going door to door [noise]\nOr what have you heard of that rich [noise] I just I mean you know where I've had one of the Democrats have gone to independent to work so I'm not talking about you know are going to try to ...\nThere with her and went on occasion they've asked what's the main complaint [noise] uh and this is for Kavanaugh 'cause I talk to anybody since then\nUh it was the ads have been effective but this capping off thing I mean that's all you know the door to door and that's all I get\nThat far art\nFor shops go we've we've we've got to get the rest yeah we've got to be getting Monday Night right Carolina\nStart with where they are early [noise] right you have to be happy so far\nYeah generally happy I think the defence like I said a month ago yawn fast a good and and they're going to get better I think there are deep Pence will get better [noise] um I I think they need to give a couple of guys more snaps a couple of guys less naps but\nBy and large I liked their defense to be a top ten defense this year and for the next few years going forward that makes it for us\nI think they do they have one issue they need to solve and I can solve it if they listen to me they all week on the ends they don't have any big play receivers that can go down catch the ball you know catch eight balls for a hundred yards\nAnd you need to have that too when consistently in the NFL you can't just keep throwing too you're tied to engineer backs especially with a\nTight I'd like Jordan read that's never gonna get injured some dance\nJazz is on the street [noise] he's been on the street I in you know Bruce has my from Brazil I emailed him literally within twelve hours if he'd been cut by Dallas begging begging them to pick up jazz I have repeated it every time I said um [noise]\nThe day he sets foot on Redskins park you'll be their number one receiver\nThey could get rid of Josh dachshund yes I said it they could keep Jamison in ... they can get they keep that kid retro Senate they're number two receivers fast but then you need a big receiver who can pull down eight nine temples a game for a hundred yards desk and do it and so if they put him on the team\nThey will be the best team the NFC East and will make the playoffs swear [noise]\nDallas lakes losing um I think it's [laughter] you know they don't like to when they like to lose a why did you know why do they do what they do while they keep fishing gear to head coach you know I mean\nWhy do they get rid of Tony Romo and it's just I I think somewhere Jerry Jones just decided he was tired of winning the waters start losing for a while and so that's that's why does what he does\nThat way what do you think that I mean is that the answers that dependency [noise]\nYeah I I'm I'm favorable and dance and I can't believe we're talking about the Redskins are not referring to them as the first place [noise]\nYeah that's true first place and so he's a very different place type\nI'm going to say at this point a lot better than I thought there'd be this year still very very tough schedule the next five weeks and nine and seven and that may be enough to make the playoffs because the eagles are struggling and the cowboys and the giants are not dinner all this year so I'm nine or ... or one of those\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Trump everything into ... well I think he gets credit for the economy and I think [noise] I think he gets credit for the economy and I think that mitigate against the law says they take just because of the ... cycle but these coalitions are basically cultural coalitions they're not economic coalitions\nAnd as I said the Democratic enthusiasm in the independents wanting to balance the government is really what hurts or sports people don't trust the Republicans to have the ... they want some kind of check on Trump's he's doing okay they may vote for him and two years\nBut in the mid term they want to put a check on [noise] I I Will say this I think the Democrats take the house is I think it's more likely than not\nAh I I don't know how they don't impeach the president when it comes out you've got the Democratic base right now which rabbit they want to impeach him now before ... ... commission and when you [noise] I I don't know how Democrats going back to their primaries in in twenty twenty can't not to impeach Trump\nI I just think that happens in rent for two minutes each or whether they have any any reasonable evidence or not because I Can't tell I don't think they have reasonable evidence now I don't know what most of the same amount of it you know what he's going to say um but I just think you look at the base and you look at the fact that the primary elections or what most of these members worry about that it's politics\nThat they're going to do it I'm not are you were there to shut down to earth and takes on Capitol Hill yeah [laughter] well I I think what happens is it changes\nThe dynamic for twenty Nineteen it was one thing that twenty Seventeen Trump's and Republicans controlled everything to put a check on him what the Democrats come in Congress like our class of Republicans in Nineteen Ninety four it kind of members you know it's the end of Clinton you know he played off against the Republican\n... yeah she did better than they would do it yeah and I have some of that\nDynamic and twenty Nineteen that the way that the Democrats had read about what they're back in twenty Seventeen

night to see the flag\nOn ... world champion Stanley Cup tell us about the experience and trying to capture ...\n[noise] it was incredible and um [noise] I don't know how to put it into work you know being a caption my entire life and [noise] the amount of um English I think that all caps fans have\nHave had over ... over that time um and the number of times that we were right on the cusp and just couldn't couldn't make it and um it was a great night and a great Germany and then seven nothing when and yet the cats can repeat I think that actually going to be better this year I think a cloud\nOf pets medicines been lifted from that team you know John one of the things that I can tell you the season ticket holder that was just so frustrating but you just couldn't break it was in the playoffs you know that being a great home ice advantage the or\nThe the entire year and the playoffs they go down one goal in life goes on in the sea\nRight living in the big game in and and the whole the whole right ... admitted jets um I've never seen an arena just goes to\nLast year game seven against Pittsburgh in ... when we when we went out the ... in in twenty sixteen and um they went down one nothing and it was like you know one nothing hockey is is nothing and and\nI mean it was like you know the funeral that we've already lost the game and they were there for a short haired against it [noise]\n[noise] right [noise] and and and and and that's and now it's like it's lifted and and and you could feel the playoffs last year once we got through Pittsburgh it didn't matter if we went down and again people could still believe in a team and the team to believe in itself I think I think the\nThat the caps in their history was Wayne on the players were they were believing when they went down a goal that the the games where you can and how they because the fans blamed for every everyone believes in and I once Pittsburgh got the last year everything changed you could feel the change their\nI'm Thomas season ticket holder on a season ticket holder we set up four sections away from each other sometimes each other in the Dunkin' Donuts minded between factions [noise]\nUm but um [noise] this is going to be a great era for the caps now I don't think this was the one thing I think that you look at who that's off is young I'm only in in his you know not in the mid mid thirties I think when you're thirty three thirty two\nUm he's gonna make a run a Gretzky for the most school scored of all time the regular season is over six hundred refudiate Ninety four he's going to make a serious run it being the number one goal for an ancient history and the caps have an incredibly bright future um [noise]\nAnd I'll just end with saying this my dilemma right now I put a thousand dollars in the capital last year when the Stanley Cup in Las Vegas Fifteen the one\nWe want to in Vegas that the cash for tickets to Fifteen thousand dollars when I catch the ticket the person at the counter told me the biggest payout she's ever paid at the sports book\nOr when people will take about like that and roll it over for two or three seasons and she said you know the caps three feet and you wrote us money over it'll be two million dollars by the time they have to repeat so I'm Still having this dilemma for the rest of the season I have not\nDone anything with the money yet because it may be that like you know it was just a thousand dollar initial investment\nI might need to roll it over a couple of times because I think we kept are legitimate threat not only to repeat the sheer potentially do you have to repeat I'm only after all that every year by year so that's my dilemma but I'm leaning towards the right now I actually think this team is a special team and one that um is going to have a lot of success going\nForward [noise] well\nI hear what you're saying I bet the Astros last year to win the world series attendant one as you know because you put

changing in this and it's not just so much a matter of of Trump\nOr anything the demographics in the state or changing and they're changing almost daily [noise]\nAnd uh it's obvious which way you know they're moving\nAre we going to be like Maryland that we're not going to be like Maryland but we um northern Virginia in ... to look more and more in northern Virginia suburbs more and more not

White House\nWhether it will be there or not you know uh I I was joking was Mark Warner and I said you know we well we we need them they're just one more election\n[laughter] you know but I mean it's you know\nI'm a generally speaking we've done better [noise] generally speaking when there's been a Republican and the White House have their print exceptions yes\nGenerally speaking the Republicans have done better when the Democrats spending the White House has there been exceptions yes but the trend is there and it was a mistake of all time yeah understand and I\nI wouldn't be surprised if we didn't know you know get to a Twenty one in the end of the election Adam minimum\nYeah I think I I tend to agree you are you still have to defend a couple of the like you got a couple of comments he got one over on the eastern shore that that\nIs in play I think Republicans could hold the blacks need if they don't have the black I I think that you [noise] far weaker today or it didn't come back then probably anybody else because he has just some personal proclivities and\nAnd and things that I think that hurts him among some of those voters we have some stronger candidates or black or and I don't know what happens there he's got a hundred and fifty\nThousand in the bank so I haven't found like he's ready to go away very quickly but I I Will do my advice to him and he got no when ... when the phone and you want to go out to undefeated not indicted if you could do that and I think last before in mountain when he and house of delegates any move over the first district run for Congress and then he comes back but I don't\nThink you want to end your career\n... ... after the initial matrix there where he has not really thinking or his voting record 'em [noise] or to that district and you've got the state house at fifty one forty nine into redistricting that's critical happened that made many I mean we have to wait and see but may work in the Democrats' favor\nThe um [noise] I don't mean it would appear that the judges are going to wind up throwing that house district was held eleven house districts [noise]\nAnd I think that's what whatever formula they come up with that is going to also be what the Senate's going to have to abide by twenty Twenty one\nAnd a hatred change or you know or it could change an awful lot [noise]\nUm you know a part of the districts are unpacked totally but below the numbers I mean look what Bobby Scott I mean his district one from what fifty some fifty six percent down to\nYou know low forties and I'm a [noise] you know produced another democratic district so you're going to have to see how that plays out\nBut it seems to me\nThat uh the judges drawing that district is by far and away their their best bet\nAnd if they do you know Supreme Court I think it ruled before the gerrymandering is is has been constitutionally permissible until it spills over and racial discrimination\nAnd therein lies the problem and that's what the Republicans are facing\nEra and it's going to change its going to change the way you know a whole makeup of legislatures around the country we're going to court for a five to four court will view this differently blocks of each other organizations headed back if I may be\nWrong but I think when they sent it back to the lower court it was like seven to ...\nWell I think one of the thing is you got to understand the Republican base for better for worse is migrated from their country club the country and in so doing they taking yourself out of some competitive districts were these were economic issues Republicans would be very viable\nSo it's not just the demographics of the fact that things have changed the emphasis on issues in ways that help them in South West Virginia but but it hurts them in the growing part of the state\nCan we talk about the ... and yet also was a very popular governor with very little negative and you look at ... number ... support amongst Democrats\nWas not popular among Republicans was more polarizing in numbers Ralph Northam has incredibly low negative ads\nFor somebody in this environment you look nationally\nUm he has very high poverty is very low negatives um and in going into these competitive seats [noise] um I remember twenty eleven and Democrats drew the state Senate lines and they lost the majority and who is that the person who was in every Republican ... that was flipping seats with Bob McDonnell a in a popular governor\nCan play a big role in there and that's a big um item that timetable here\nDid you have to have a messenger born and raised here especially when you're turning out the Thomas writes the the I mean it that that national scene where he's very heavily you know which is why you've had you know the the patterns that you've had\nUntil McAuliffe beat to Janelle with him and you know what happened for almost fifty eater I'm a I'm In I'm In just about the surveys like let's take for example the started at the start of unseat was not driven by national politics and twenty fifth and it was driven by local politics in Chesterfield versus Richmond and I'd like to be democratic\nUm and I think that we and we probably if we had a more aggressive candidate but we don't have we entered its campaigns don't matter you know I don't think we had to I don't think we had a great message or that I think if you rerun that same race in twenty Nineteen and you had Ralph Northam on TV\nI'm In that district Raul patrol that I'm not going to be as they are they going to vote the garbage and stardom and it's chaos is going to create problems for them\nYeah I think that's a greater problem is that he's he's he's not harmonious with the district on some of this hot button issue or just say that like Rob Portman been good governor I think it's a wonderful man but he gives a fireside chat in the fire goes now you put him on TV it it it's not the same kind of rally the team but he's\nAn asset to them and they didn't have to use that I don't want to know that that is that's the kind of governor you actually need them and he picked up not a fiery he picked up Fifteen states I mean I think in terms of color fitness fiery and I'm at a carnival Barker one and and he doesn't he doesn't pick up seats Labour up north I'm dead\nWell north of didn't pick 'em up ... picked him up for him yes if Trump would have been president and twenty Fifteen we'd be in the majority\nThey look I mean I yeah I don't want to date on Ralph Northam disagree however I think he's been but let's just\nSay the chemical upon by three points and rapport with him on by eight and ... pick up here as he wants to pick up the team so that five point difference was not a Fifteen slough I'm Sorry but it was also a hotel different let me tell you that\nIn the White Helmets about\nTrump okay I was a driving factor sure last November on top of that [noise] um [noise] you had a ... and spilled over into everything [noise]\nAnd keep in mind Gillespie was not groups you know\nI mean he was very polarized [noise] but um I just think people keep underestimating as governor oh oh I don't think anybody on the rest of the ...\nI don't think anybody under estimate same but make no because I mean you know what's driving politics in Virginia right now is not a Ralph uh it's it's what's going on across the Potomac River\nIt's negativity is driving politics on both sides right now on the one thing about Robert and he doesn't have any negative [noise] doesn't have any money he's a very likely to or not\nI'm not you know art now go you know been knocking on doors since may I have not gotten one negative comment about brown non and that's you know it's ... I mean people liking me just a likeable person either\nBut he's not a fire eater that gets my vote out for you know I I think Tom Davis was not a fire leader that got to build up for the Republicans that for Twenty years\nEvery single Republican my piece you would have thought the person was married to Tom Davis because the Republican candidate had his picture bigger than their own picture with a quilt for him saying like here's like it'd be great for your time sometimes we have a mission um so I mean having a messenger\nIs important and democratic not had did you understood that Len Ralph Northam is the first time in a sense Mark Warner and we've had a messenger like\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe big difference you know if we had you know there's a whole lot of people have gotten to the general assembly because we don't have run on purpose in the state a whole and and you won't have that you'll just have to people when they're [noise]\nAnd she's well why [noise] I don't think I if I had the gas and I I can be totally wrong with us going to live in that district I guess that round dance has extremely low name id pardon I Would guess that rod dancers extremely low name id and that if you test it to the gym or see it and they might have to say that the ...\nI'm just a [noise] but like in terms of I'd name id Richard Nixon had our neighborhoods\n[laughter] you know I mean I just said like I don't think rises like real superstar the\nPlanet called you know Joe and I know Joe\nThan it's got to get out out work something like Fifteen or twenty to one okay Joe was out there knocking on doors and making phone calls now well this is\nBetween the fastball primary too in that primary like Dick was independent district for Twenty years ... got drawn to safety prize basically has a concept of campaigning and knocking on doors and doing the things that you do when you're in a competitive political rates\nFor Seventy percent of the vote in my district against Mondale yeah Ross debts has never been to embrace their lights on\nFor every Confederate says she's never been\nBetter if you got to ask you before and she's got to get out of work I just got out worker despite Joe he's kind of get he got out worker and the other\nIs I don't think that I'm telling you he was going to get a sip it clear that sympathy vote out there for the fact that the power base in Richmond screwed this guy out of its livelihood\nAnd that's that's real I mean he got screwed I mean what he pulled his long life it looks senator Stanley told me the whole thing is that she Asian bowl but it was blown it okay [laughter] what happened there was a total bologna\nAnd it was because uh it was it was the cause he challenged the Richmond system that's what happened and that's why they pulled him and so I I just remember that\nLike you know there are a lot of people in that area that have and and listen to the loyalty the job or see the reason he does well there's a lot of people there is represented and when families have had a time of need\nYou know the attorney they went through the criminal defense attorney to help out someone in their family when he was ... and that created in level of loyalty he had they [noise] I\nI'm not ready to call this one one way or the other yet but um\nHe has a real base [noise] it's it's across that district the from being an attorney I'm In the same way that Donald McEachin you know when he when he ran river and his running you know him as a primary challenge of what three times to incumbent twice twice as a challenger don't come in Delhi gets been one to the challenge is going to come and senator\nAnd and mceachin was the guy who everyone news on TV it was a lawyer um he had to help so many people in the community it didn't matter that he was a challenge or two in common um that's how they knew how much they thought he was the income right and ... I mean he has helped a lot of people in those ...\nUm you know against major charges not any he's one of the top defense attorneys there so I'm just I I I think that it's an interesting race in an ... we've got to see you know will rise even run again let me do not\nLet me look ahead to twenty twenty won the governorship or would have come come through and a lot of um determine on who's in the White House as you did that\nDynamic and so on but when north and goes well the attorney general within a governor clashes that who else is looking at this at this point in the Democratic party are on I mean there is a name pops up now and then very yellow was not out of the picture here either now I Would imagine\nIf you're on the you know of course but I Would I Would hope that\nHerring in Fairfax thanks for delta or not to see a contest nomination but you've got a lot of people in the back looking for upward mobility to\nGet the mayor of Richmond stony you've got to some other or just getting her yellow sitting there and you'll have a primary and you'll just have to see if it's a\nSuccessful can be dangerous you can only I think the only a\nLong as you don't have a two way right [noise] uh in between Fairfax area and uh I think that if a if it's if it's one of them against the whole batch of other people when [noise] uh you know the Fairfax\nCounty somebody out so I like you guys are talking about herring and a fair facts wrong you're not talking about before stony who was absolutely going to do something he was the other person you're not talking about who can pull the upset and a two or three person race and\nThat's Kenny handling Alexander\nMayor of from Norfolk right now who in a three way primary against to\nProgress is trying to out liberal left wing each other Kenny Alexander comes in business guy there's a track record and the mold of who water businessman McAuliffe than Scott ridiculous why\nThat's ridiculous first of all there's allergenic as they as if there's a moderate right on the Democratic primary anyway for the first piece safety but they're ... they're attacking Iraq is on the beat your state\nThey're not going to line up behind ... I like Kenny a good friend but they're going to either line up behind your herring for Fairfax what about spelling and I don't even know no I don't I don't I didn't know that are the same thing with low bar record guy people liking but they're either going to go with one of those two well how ...\nGoing to be a Republican any Lakers Trump's going to be gone and twenty twenty I was going to win again [noise] ... I mean first years of president you know but even on the same type of campaign that\nGillespie or you're right a\nRepublican won't win that governorship you can't ... I'm telling you you know it's disgraceful\nJet Republican ever win again in Virginia\nWell how do you how do they want to explain that probably that's absurd how do they just generally going out\nFor how do you account for ...\nIn ... in Massachusetts I mean you know\nGovernorships in particular are not parliamentary rate and people make\nAnd you know you know but but let me tell you something as long as people in the Republican Party is trying to turn a political neck or the expense of somebody color\nOr somebody ethnicity or somebody's religion it ain't going anywhere I Would agree with you there and in till they get away from that you bet well that and they should be reject\nOr they gotta I gotta check the air from a senator\nBill Stanley he says never bet against fighting Joe so he'll secondly agrees with me\nAnd he was a excuse me ... that we know who was Joe Morris the lawyer huh bill Stanfield Stanley yeah yeah okay what's that going to do a little biased\n[laughter] speaking of seeking a statewide races I didn't feel family going to be a very dangerous candidate for attorney general [noise] um is he's very like you have to run 'em and if he runs for attorney general gets the Republican nomination I think he's going to be very dangerous game well if you just run he'll get the nomination but he has to run\nOr what the problem is that America [noise] why did the numbers just there is no way you can do that you can't make it up so yeah and as I used to say to their members of the things which is why are you doing this was a folk this was coming to a precinct near you
