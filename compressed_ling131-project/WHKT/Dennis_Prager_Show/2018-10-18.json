running around here's the\nThing that never go there are up right and you're driving around the or the suburbs in northern Virginia and Maryland suburbs of DC they're all two three\nFour five million dollar homes everybody enrich they've all got a ton of money they all drive rover Mercedes they've all got serious sex and they all walk around five thousand dollars\nAnd we don't we know you're going to make things we produce nothing they manufacture nothing they build nothing they invent nothing yet they're all rich thing is that one out\nOf the five Richard Cisco surround the district of

debated you know and by the way Seventy percent\nOf the farm bill his food stamps and which programs and and you know it was here to lobby and John it's Amazon at McDonald's and Walmart why because they want to be able to pay for food stamps you know on line so you get you get your Amazon Prime shit right so this is the problem why look on their headquarters here after\nAll right they they know who directs traffic in this country so if the Washington politicians and the special interest and they're going to get in on it while to get as good an and I I Can't blame him for that ah but but we we do need to a rollback\nOf this a steak or the status mentality\nSo that is a golfing any really every area of our lives and they really get I think that's a retirement security that we're we're trusting\nThe government to hang out retirement benefits\nThat it can't possibly do that we're ... and you know we didn't get the patent native reform of us just illustrate Nineteen thirty five were not driving model cars\nWhich is the best like Harlem teams thirty five cars have changed we need to change you know retirement protracted retirements today thirty forty year retirement system was never built for retirement Nineteen thirty five is two to four years I'm In the world were a victim really of our\nOwn success people are living longer healthier that's all good but that system needs to change as a you know the Supreme Court said Nineteen sixty two ah that that you know we're not even in titles\nBecause Social Security year there's no guarantee that you'll get it in the Congress can change of the day or they can allow us to go bankrupt and stuff and the shots\nWere was about ... the United States Senate libertarian candidate in Virginia the midterms November six Nineteen days away three candidates running Republican Cory stored\nMatt waters libertarian incumbent Tim Kaine the Democrat ran for vice presidents and came the overwhelming prohibitive favorite in this race the big question is can Matt waters get the temp percent if he does then the libertarians get a spot on the Virginia ballot for how long has it\nWith her and I believe it's five years five years out there like it is five years and then they basically\nAre they become a third political party in Virginia so the stakes for wars in the libertarians are very high Matt let's shift gears a minute let's go to this caravan now five\nThousand people make his way up through Guatemala if you were in the Senate or what would be your position right now and is\nWell I certainly I Would I Would you take a little differently I mean first of all there's no doubt there's a crisis in Guatemala Honduras and El Salvador right there's there's there's a there's a refugee\nA Latin American summit when you sit down to the leaders of those countries and the conversation I put Mexico that next year because they're coming right through Mexico um you know I think it starts out I Would I Would I Would rather than a you know taking the approach\nWith almost antiques dealer nice approach to this ... anniversary anger pillar pro Trump is going I Would take that much more diplomatic approach and say how it happened we solve this problem rather\nWell that's a very long term medical center and interrupted you know that's a very long term view us all sit down and I guess it ends up getting more money to uh to these countries that you just said you would cut off so\nNo money's going to get involved according to Matt waters for thousands of five thousand people are coming right now just want to ask them can't they're coming out now tomorrow or next week now they're coming now their objective is going through Mexico get the southern border five thousand of them cross\nAnd it's all going to be apprehended we ever hit about twenty percent the other eighty percent you'd never find them again and up to twenty percent we do ever hit eighty percent of them uh ended up not returning for what every piece of paper they give them\nTo go back to court or whatever and they can't separate them from their children we've already been through that kids in Cape right Kay drink before the midterms are going to happen\nSo basically they all get scot free if you don't do something what would you do\nYeah returns or ... party I mean some of us all over the border from actually I don't share that\nI Believe they hire more security we need to stop at a leaker crossed paths like so so what would you choose to engage them I mean you need to have it in the old guard I lost my plan is to pull the\nForty thousand troops you know Adam Germany but I'm On the southern border for fifty thousand average Parenthood among the southern border for twenty eight thousand out south southern border we'd have a pretty good forced to have that we spend our money defending his country\nRather than any of the countries around the globe\nNow we're talking that now we're talking see that's the plan\nLet's get or a troops out of Germany Japan and where else out Korea South Korea and get them out and let's put him on the southern border in that solves the problem and there's no increase costs now there's an argument to keep them in in South Korea for a lot of reasons\nBut why we have twenty thousand troops in Germany and all those troops to Japan makes no sense whatsoever to anybody except those that want to perpetuate the military industrial complex and make money off supplying these troops over the globe\nBecause of the other day Matt let me just follow\nThe money in Washington it's really easy to just follow the money and you find what it's all corrupt you're going to follow it and you're going to find out where does who's backing who what the owners are Wall Street smart at Goldman Sachs big donors\nThat's all you have to do it's the easiest thing if you're just thinking out loud [laughter] exactly that were on the time at borders what's your website\nNot water dot com check it out\nYeah the bottom Matt waters not combat thanks for being being a writer and good luck I'll have you on again before November sex Curtis Ellis coming up give it right here\nFor what he described as weak immigration laws that have allowed undocumented migrants to enter the U.S the Republican controlled Senate and house this year has rejected multiple immigration bills including one backed by the president that would have combined border security\nFunding with other measures sought by the Democrats as I discuss with a Senator Tim Kaine the cute cog in this chain migration the Democrats can do\nFor DACA and they can go for a wall and they can go for the funding but they absolutely want chain migration because that gives them democratic votes and the Republican donors out Wall Street back that too because that brings them cheap labor along with the illegals\nBut the president says I don't want chain migration\nBecause that puts a lock on the American economy I Want migration that is based on job skill and job needs to win the immigrant comes into the U.S they have a job and they can contribute to society just like Australia does and the man child for Joe doesn't the Canada if the man child can do it so good way\n\nTo present goes out to say today I Am watching the Democratic party led because they weren't open borders assault on our country by Guatemala doors in El Salvador\nWhose leaders are doing real to stop this large flows people which I'm calling in an invasion that's may not Trump including many criminals from entering Mexico to the U.S the president wrote in his report tweet he said in addition to stopping all\nPayments to these countries all payments which seem to have almost no control over their population\nI must in the trunk of terms ask Mexico to stop the onslaught and they've been able to do so I Will call up to you as the military and simply closer southern\nBorder close it means no one will come in and they'll be fifty thousand troops there you simply are not going to come in and there'll be a stand up for days and they're going to have to figure it out and then there'll be cameras on the other side seeing people starving I mean this is what's going on here\n\nThe president and it that the border security is far more important to him then that are done it recently concluded new North American free trade deal\n\nNow a a spending package passed by Congress a month ago put off a debate over getting the money for the for the wall and effectively pushing back fights the Republicans want to avoid before the midterms\n\nA record number of asylum seeking families from Latin America have recently overwhelmed are calling border agents and immigration authorities or having another surge\nOf illegals coming in border patrol facilities are crowded with newly arrived families bed space that family detention centers in Texas is that uh\nThey keep coming in and we simply can't process them and we can't arrest them and send them back we already tried that and went through kids in cages and you're Nineteen days from the mid term so they're gonna be no more pictures\nOf kids separated from their parents so all you have to do now\nBefore that night Nineteen days is up is grab a child if it's yours because it doesn't matter grab a child and your family and you're going to get an entry to the United states because the politicians are now on the Republican side petrified of kids in cages\nSo they're going to win again\nAnd the president knows he can't come back this politically because the PR the PR is a disaster Nineteen days before the midterms so he says well here's what I'm going to do I'm going to deploy them military is a problem with that here's the problem every solution right now Nineteen days has consequences\n\nIf it was November seventh there would be easier to easier to do you're going to get the military at the border they're going to be with guns confronting miles with babies that's going to be all over the New York times\nBecause these people in the fake news media and they want open borders open borders even though it means that it's the end of their jobs and their businesses and they'll have no money in the country will collapse they don't care because they know that there'll be the elites and there'll be fine and then they will rule over\nThe rest of us poor slobs the pro Terry it\nBut I mean I I don't even know how to even put this in in the logical terms\n\nMean what is they didn't even want to ask Tim Kaine he had to admit I'm not for open borders I'm not for these people coming over I mean but you know that the Democrats are going to defend\nIt and they are now calling them economic refugees oh we're not accepting refugees we you know where's the richest country in the world is not and that will be saying on CNN it's not who we are it's not who we are well here's who we are we're broke\nOur schools suck that's who we are we're Twenty one trillion dollars in debt\n\nAnd now we've got a growing number of people in our schools that don't speak the language\nAnd it goes on and on and on and on and on that too we our debt written wake up smell the

exciting football\n... while you're sending football and uh they have a they have it and they have a pretty solid team and their their record hasn't shown and I think they're they're better than they looked start with their quarterback stronger merged Jordan black\nAnd joined blacks for sure I'll start Aretha left handed off your quarterback extremely tough kids probably one of the better Packers they've had their through for a hundred and eighty a yard sale last week I was sixteen or twenty three so kind of opens up their traditional last option running attack with some some good play actually passing\nOut again very solid on the office wine that come off the ball lower heart very hard to simulate in practice I get it got running back\nSeats and they are balanced authentically not between running past but in who touches the ball and where they touch the ball so very difficult to expand defense plea a multi pressure unit are they bring a lot of letters from a lot of locations you have to be\nReally solid or your past protection against them and they play certainly hard and then special teams are they the extreme extreme they will be Mercer on the last uh uh play the game right kickoff return for a touchdown so very well coached like rent Tom send their kids are like our young men they place stream hard they fight for the for the\nFinal sound they never said die so heck of a ball game against the very top and talented team\nYeah in a couple of weeks ago um Palestine quarterback Tom Flaco\nBy the way is the brother a younger brother of a so called a quote unquote elite quarterback Joe ... ah [laughter] this is the elite quarterback uh well I don't know but faced on uh the last game against tendency look pretty lead to me\nBut coach I'm Flatow really carved up the citadel decent and\nYou look at you didn't ski and then the arm strength and he's got in the maturation he's gone through\nYour quarterback you didn't see your fast receivers um they they had a lot I watched some of the game actually they have a lot of uh let's say upper you've got opportunities I think in their secondaries at a fair analysis of mine\nPaul I think the central defense probably learned a whole heck of a lot from that ball game it was you know the first team they played that just threw the ball around a little bit and uh you know their yawn on defense\nLike we are and so if the game got on I thought they played a lot better defense linking confidence is the game goes on and I think there'll be much better prepared to playoffs after playing that game you know black also\nKurt um what's his legs a little bit running the ball early and\nMuch better prepared to take on our style of dolphins coming into our games\nDo you look at a young quarterback or doing a little more scrambling under the pockets maybe having some designed runs phrase to keep the defense honest\nYou know we always have to try and run plays in for the second quarter back and so that's part of our all kinds of packages to keep the defense honest uh I'd prefer not\nTo scramble from the clock is because that means we have a clean pockets by their self protection breaks down like it does you know at every level of football than you know obviously reached needs to maneuver in the pocket and do what he takes it needs to do whether it's run the ball or you know operating scramble

really wants to talk about this\n\nAnd a short text and that says the ... the Caribbean it's coming for the midterms I mean you would think you would think that if this caravan of invading illegal aliens and that's what this says this is an invasion\n\nThis is an invasion coming to the United states\n\nI don't I'm not going to call it anything but what it is an invasion\nYou would think that that would motivate\nTo get out and vote for Republican so that you have some kind of a security on the board of what other people think it's actually going to hurt the Republican because\nCNN and all the news networks are going to be showing pictures of moms were babies that that you you can't script is out mom's with babies and they're going to\nCall them economic refugees seeking asylum asylum

would think that this would motivate Republicans and independents that come out and say look this isn't right and I send my child to third grade there's twenty five kids in the class Nineteen them don't speak English what the hell kind\nOf an education is my child going to get my public school which are not paying for\nThey're not paying anything well you know you're a racist\nWhy because I

peanut butter sandwich for breakfast I put marmalade on at the airport is racist\nOnly white people eat marmalade\nI mean it is this thing is going to go on and on and on and so it's all these mobs and what is going on is intimidating regular people from just looking at something reasonable\n\nTo be called a racist because you don't want your country invaded by four thousand illegal immigrants on the southern border\nAnd that was just like you want to obey the law\nI guess we have two sets a lost cause for people that the Democrats won in and that was very wary of I don't really understand it\nThis is a real issue\nAnd there is no answer to this and we're really you would think that our ally Mexico wouldn't let them come into Mexico\n\nI mean think about think about\nThink about what what would happen in the U.S if these five thousand\nCaravan of invaders said well we really want to go to Canada so as we can you let us in the United states and give us just a a\nA sixty they a status here so that we can go up the highway and ah get to Canada and we can invade them I mean what what what were the Canadian say well sure you know I just I understand it's our problem now they'd be like why are you doing this\nThis is just a logic\nI mean the open borders crowd is relentless and they have Wall Street Republicans behind them you would think that this would be the major issue of the day and\nBecause of Goldman Sachs says salivating and looking over their chops at the prospect of more cheap labor nothing is going to be done at the end of the day they're all going to stay because the Republicans hands are tied\nWill overturn whatever their\n\nAnd you can't separate anybody now from their children especially before the midterms that's a disaster even though if somebody today in the Bronx or in Norfolk or Richmond\nOr Lynchburg or anywhere in America\nShoplifting a seven eleven on camera and his apprehended by the police and they have a child in the back seat of the car they will get separated from the child the child doesn't go to jail with them that's the laws that we have in America you want to change it I guess change it but that's the current law but laws don't matter now\n\nI mean if you ever had more evidence why there shouldn't be a wall visit\n\nSo the Republicans are attempting to make this a\nUm election issue where they're putting a built together for thirty two billion dollars to fund the wall but they're not getting their message out as far as I'm concerned\nI mean you you really think about you what do you think about how any other country would handle an organized caravan of illegal immigrants coming into your country and expecting a fully expecting that they will be\nAllowed in and taking care of its crazy\nAnd uh you would think that this one issue alone would sink the Democrats in the election but many people think it's going to have the opposite effect\nSo you know you just start scratching your head\nI mean I think the debate over this issue in this country should be whether or not you want to border or you don't\nAnd you know there is an argument for not having one and the argument is cheap labor and we have a big heart and we'll take care of anybody that comes in\nAnd eventually when the country collapses than it is what it is I mean that's one argument you in the meantime the elites will continue to profit off it and then obscene fashion\nAnd the gangster benches and make more money and Wall Street executives will get more wealthy than they are and if you worked at Goldman Sachs you'll be able to buy an island\nI mean I guess that's the plan and you'll continue to fund the Democrats who will then have on unlimited power in perpetuity and remember it was President Obama who said er my goal was to transform it\nAmerica transforming you transform it by changing its make up\nIts demographic makeup you change it by allowing 'em unfettered illegals to come in and change the culture whatever the American culture is those who want to change it want it to be something else I'm really don't know what they want it to be or\nUnholy alliance of Democrats at once she votes Wall Street Republicans at one cheap labor and the third and they open a open borders one world government that wants to change and wipe\nOut cultures they want to wipe them out so they don't exist they just want land mass and the free\nMovement of people and goods between land masses that's it John Frederick radio network in your heart you know I'm right there's no argument to oppose what I'm saying but it ... it doesn't
