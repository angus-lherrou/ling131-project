comes on last night in colpepper at the chamber of commerce\nAnd uh I have to tell you unequivocal eating I thought it was rigged sounding victory for congressman or Dave Brat over spanberger in that debate I'd really no idea what spanberger was doing other than trying to ride somewhere even to Congress by saying nothing\nAnd either that or she didn't have anything to say but it was almost like yeah Dave I'm kind of for that but not a hundred percent for that I'm not really sure what I really couldn't figure anything other than I Am now absolutely convinced that she did work for the CIA after she got it a hundred and twenty times\nJoining us now the debate champ from last evening congressman Dr David Brat he's Republican represents the seventh district of Virginia He's running for a

the feedback from your debate understand for the people I've talked to in some of the media said that you had a very very still her performance last night congressman what are some things that stood

you can memorize millions of dollars\nFrom the ... thanks you call them [noise] and all that\nBut when you hear on the stage for an hour [noise]\nWe tried to show that she\nFound a record and people can go look it up and I hope everybody goes in watching the debate right the you're the voters go watch cricket they weren't you could because I think it was very stark and so we just went through the issues by issue by issue on the economic the economy is booming\nAnd a reporter was fired for probably doing news stories on a in a balanced way and so why is that\nThat's problematic so we're we're working on the details and it won't work through them I I don't know anything yet and I I did want to draw people's attention today to a political article it's on it's on political right now\nAt that frames the Nancy Pelosi liberal agenda as well as you can do right that's what I was talking about last night or look at that political\nPolitical article on line everybody and actors to pray about

number three is is that still in play\n\nYeah yeah everything's still in play and I can't lay down my next interview John\nBut just just one quick answer sure one thing you learned about Abigail Spanberger last night that you really liked one thing\nYou're sure where her dedication to the country working at the CIA [noise] in dire she's she's a mom in my neighborhood area that you know plus or kids who wants to start the country and that's a huge commitment anyone that's willing to follow that calling I commend her service\nAll right we're at a time more information Dave Brat dot com

that dial you found your home was the truth\n[laughter] with\nThe best analysis in America\nAnd now back to the John fresher\nIt's great to have you back during the Johnson who's radio networks so you heard from David\nBrock thing that's a nice thought he did very well last night's debate I think the one thing that he laid out is really spanberger Achilles' heel here\nWhich is a as I watched the debate she didn't really put together a connector coherent message and it's a lot of soundbites and you know she's in a very as I said she's a walking a tightrope here is she's in\nA Republican leaning district that went against last year's two thousand Seventeen\nDemographic Democrat crap in Virginia blue wave of all time oh it's still went for the last three by three David got enough money to be competitive she's raised the\nSo to speak to her campaign is going to be able to spend the hands of money on whatever they need they have a ton of money\nAnd that's an advantage is not be a it's it's not the um the final answer but\nWhen you've got to cornucopia of resources at your disposal in the last Twenty one days in the campaign you you've got a lot of options so\nShe has a lot of options but it seemed like she was playing last night's debate not to lose like don't say anything dumb\nOr just ride the wave and she was okay you know um but she's going more on\nHey I'm a CIA person I've served my country I'm a mom I'm great I'm smart I'm cool and a little lighter on the issues I mean ... all about the issues and I think you know when you have this kind of an economy that you're back he's got the advantage\nSo I'm only ... doing anything to help herself last night but I don't think she did anything to hurt herself so I think if you went into this debate\nAnd you are not going to vote for the Republican candidate you are not going to vote for Dave\nI think you came out of it and you're not going to vote for me I don't think like David changed any minds of his anti\nUh of the the the blue waivers and the liberal moms are Chesterfield all that stuff I don't think you changed anything [noise] and I don't think Abigail hurt herself with her ...\nNow\nA here's where I thought they did very very well anybody wavering like if you could really make a decision if you're a true independent and had an open mind last night uh spanberger did nothing to get your vote\n\nSo again she she had just counting on two nominees sweeping or into power\n\nIf you're an independent or a moderate Republican or a moderate Democrat and your truly had major mind up\nAnd you saw this debate or you're more likely to vote for Dave after it then when it started you are not more likely to vote for spanberger and that's what we have to look into base or you're more likely ended either\nEither neither candidate did anything to depressed their base both candidates I mean I\nThink they fired his up a little bit more Abigail's got a different style she's a little more long when did\nShe doesn't have a quick retort for the day that it was so her communication style is different not worse or better just different and doesn't really up against brat\nAh he just it it gives them an advantage because of span burgers more low key\nMore of a post communication style\n\nAll of these things were playing into Dave's favor last night and I asked the question point blank well why don't you have other debates I mean I I for the life of me after last night's debate I Would think that they would call her up and say look what scheduled debate every three days I mean you don't care what the venue is [noise]\nBut um you know consult joined control these campaigns and\nThey have their own way of doing things but hopefully there'll be other debates and\nYou know he said something about somebody got fired and so they couldn't have this other debate but I didn't get fired and I still don't have a day and I can tell you for the radio debate that I propose the boat camps agreed to uh the holdup is not spammer the spanberger camp is basically given a bunch of dates for this\nAnd hold up in the ... campaign so let's just get that out there and I don't think I don't see how we're going to have it now because it's what October sixteenth I mean we got three weeks Twenty one days but I'll keep following up and we'll see what happens\nCortland out to be coming up eight

to win or five points it's not just people think\n[noise] I think we're going to do that and John I'm going to sleep for some of the country right now nobody's talking about we got\nIt run its course right now John James\nSo I was born here and it's going to Michigan you mark my words\nSo you think that John James in Michigan has actually is shown to be standing about\nI think so too long ago but the more the more I learned about in the campaign [noise] storing can't [noise] of what America should be part\nOf that [noise] family still up in Detroit [noise] work [noise] and now she quit jobs the family business three times as I was when he took over when he came back from his military service [noise] catching on fire [noise] right [noise]\nWell I tell you what that is on nobody's radar screen Corey let's go over these races because I'm predicting right now that\nThe Republicans are going to pick up five or six seats everybody says I'm Crazy thing is for some time or the tendency race black burn bread and saying\nI'm Marcia pulling way ahead now in that race she is going to win that's going to be a whole remember tendency Corey Lewandowski was was one of those seats that the Republicans were that the Democrats were tournament you about that they thought they could pick up that is now not gonna happen Blackburn way way ahead what do you see their\n[noise] Democrats [noise] germ moderate Democrat from Tennessee's Marsha Blackburn who's gonna win walking away\nRight she's up late ten now so that's going to be that that's\nThat's that's that's going to be a whole no question or let's get to and we we both believe that the Republicans are going to hold a\nArizona with Sally I don't even think that's going to be close when it's all said and done and I think we're going to we're going to win the bottom\nAs I've been saying for some some time or let's get to Montana Jon Tester are being challenged by Matt Rosendale or re public the real clear politics has this about two or three within the margin of error I'm predicting Rosendale wins what do you see their\nRosen the polling has actually two points before President Trump goes out the Montana there's ways to do a campaign rally [noise] you know the\nPresident's doing a west coast when he's going to [noise] Arizona and Montana to put an exclamation point on that Jon Tester become the former U.S senator from Montana and we've got a new Republican pickup in Montana come three weeks from\nJosh Hawley are probably the biggest surprise for Republican some people not sure that he was going to be the best candidate use turn out to be a very good candidate remember Claire McCaskill who won in a two thousand two\nJohn look this was the vice president's home state he was out campaigning there this weekend\nHe was there Saturday or friday and Saturday or as you know his brother is on the ballot in Indiana and\nDoing so well they're not helping like wrong for that Senate race this is a big focus of the mystery and because of the vice president home state the administration knows or they can beat Donald nasty and so I think you've got to see Brian come away\nAnd the next two weeks and start to open up his lead over sleepy Joe Donnelly\nOkay so um let's let's let's get the New Jersey I Know a couple about a month ago you said that might come into play I don't see it ended up like ten Fifteen you're young\nYou know I I I saw some internal numbers yesterday or don't want to reveal but I'll tell you want to find a spot in the end and I saw the numbers that I saw yesterday I'd be scared to death you've got this Republican candidate whose putting his own money into this race is giving a scanner\nAnd if I had to flip a coin today I Would\nSay yes and that is going to win\nThe resources the Democrats have to put him to keep going in there and they just keep on is going to drop resources away from elsewhere and I'm not convinced that he that he made sure I Would argue look this four to five point race right now it's causing quickly\nSo I don't think he's going to win\nSo we can just click on that only because I'm from New Jersey and I just can't see them beating them and then this but let me ask you this in West Virginia I'm I'm I'm really shocked at this I thought Morsi would be much better position against Joe mansion many years now but in most\nDoes and part of the reason he does is because\nThe Trump Pence ticket won that state by forty two points if any state that is Trump country I think it's fair to say that's West Virginia [noise] and you have seen the amount of time to hold the president the vice President Ben in that state campaigning I Believe they're going to be back in that stage and helpful third congressional district\nIn that Senate race now every time the president of the vice president goes in that state mentions numbers drop in about a month ago Mitch was sitting at fifty four percent the president's been in a few times the vice president for that and now he's offering under fifty what are you still have the lead that if the people of West\nVirginia and they know Joe Manchin well\nThey they have to understand Joe mansion and

your how they act\nAround the world that was going on a very very close with a point there is not what we expect from a nation that subject recording itself so\nIt might come players top guys talk on the cover of all these clocks Westport former director he will get to the bottom of it is the record turnout to recruit about what happened to\nThat will be consequences for Saudi Arabia definitely in the field or or or um\nUnited States backing of the Saudi Emirates coalition and the Yemeni civil war\nYet ... says the big big muscle movement right now in the region is when we were in the beginning

and she has all the raw egg recall we won't we cannot have negative consequences from this a grand making Iran stronger\nSo you were vice president Trump right now if you just turn the clock back and you're in the oval office what would be any advice you would give to the president as this new information comes out of their peers\nThat appears at this guy was murdered allegedly in constantly begins and\nMarco Rubio just said on Fox and friends he came in he didn't come out so he is still there already dead there's only two really outcome to this what would your advice me to a Trump\nThat well I'm not going to speculate what happened what happened right on the garbage that's been written will read the story a what a what I what I by the president is that we we have to do my onto the we have to have supplied absolute full disclosure\nThat by the Saudi regime as to what happened and then once we have full disclosure we will make the requisite decision which was not the Obama administration because you're walking ... right but we have to have full disclosure and then the president will will decide whether to arms trade thing whether it's\nThe support we give economically to ah to Saudi Arabia that that will suffer whether it was something else\nWhat did you think when the president went to the un ah this this parrot two weeks ago at the annual meeting any and he said to king Salman he's looking a you know is this all fine and we're friends and all but like\nYou got to start paying up for the defense were given your protection you're you're you're only paying three percent\nI Want that double your your your oil prices are too high a lot of people were outraged by that but then she said well gee nobody ever asked me that and he said well I'm not going to do that how does that all play out that\nThe president is a pragmatist and he's caught somebody else that question this isn't just about Saudi Arabia is about a part of the friends and I swear to you but in Europe\nUs to sort of to subsidize the fence so it's a very reasonable question that we're going to keep on asking because if you're one of the richest countries in the world and you don't need off the subsidy subsidized you're going to fences and a lot of ... any part of the world not the Saudi Arabia\n[noise] tell us ... about a new book that you have out why we fight why should people by that\nWell look it's it's a great read it's about all the threat through space that you want to understand all of the dangers out there and how the president's going to treat them whether it's Russia China you know whether it's ah North Korea whether it's which Iran than the book gives you that strategic\nAnalysis but more importantly I I've been to split the\nBig picture stuff with the stories of

uh he used to be used to pay me to read to hug she bring them home and\nI'm ... yeah this is a true story give me five or ten dollars to read it and that was one of the first one he brought home and that was the ten dollar book and it was pretty big\nAnd then I Would read them I say I'm done and it would give me ten dollars but then like three days you'd asked me a question and I have the answer that question could I could turn out but I'll never get the big think looking at his goal witness\nAnd I was a sophomore and he said a high school yet you've you've got to read this is about what what

well go to Afghanistan\nAnd Iraq\nThese guys and gals over there are keeping terrorists from coming here I Am trying to make sure that conservative judges getting on the court when we when I voted for Sotomayor and kicking when when they when they get to choose we want the best person on the list Brett Kavanaugh and they tried to destroy his life\nAnd I hope it blows up in their face Saudi Arabia the secretary of state heading over there now to try to get some answers about what happened to the Saudi embassy inside turkey\nYou know what happened who's to blame well I Know there's nothing happens in Saudi Arabia with that in the U.S knowing it who's going to be he's the thirty three year old crown prince who jumped him over other people he's the son of existing team\nAnd I think he's on a on a bad track\nI can never do business with Saudi Arabia again until we get this behind the spring\nAnd what does that mean that means I'm not going back to Saudi Arabia is longest this guy's been charged you're selling the crown prince has to leave their stuff to them but I'm not going to I've been their biggest offender on the floor of the United States Senate\nDisguised their wrecking

what was that might like seven five or six or seven minutes that was really one of the best interviews I've ever seen in Yemen\nA and since that forced me jihad at the hearings of the cabinet or a debacle a worthy basically ... the Democrats um\n\nUh he was really good I mean basically I mean he said\nHe said look MPs has got to go this guy has got to go you'll never be a leader on the world stage uh where's your show did he disappeared we're not going to sweep it under the carpet and he's got to go\nAnd you need to get another leader in there you need to get somebody else but it can't be him and he made a good point said you know we have defended defending you and you put us in a box and embarrass us and we need we need a new leader\nAnd it's not him I mean that's a pretty that's a pretty bold statement\nFor a U.S senator make right on fighting for any stared at the camera and he said Saudi Arabia if you're listening to me this guy's NBS forgot to go he's thirty three years old he's brazen he's reckless and it's conceivable to me that anything would go on like this without knowing about it may be the king did no but he's certainly no\nConjecture and so he's got to go otherwise he says well Graham says I'm never going there again and I'm going to introduce sanctions in the Senate once we get to the bottom of it if it did we find out that they were behind as murder in the in the constantly\n\n[noise] so um\n\n[noise] that is pretty I mean that that that that is that is pretty bold what a brand sat\n\nIn front page was there now and the president's not going to

counting CBS is sixty minutes\nThat is not what we have in D.C my opponent has floods of special interest money millions and millions of dollars coming in the last thing we want to do is have the government running pharmaceuticals the best thing\nTo produce competition and to produce patents which makes sense and will eventually to generics and low prices is a lot of firms competing against each other to produce low cost outcomes\nAnd so the contrast between me and my opponent could not be clear tonight my opponent for example on the tax cuts wants to return the money from the tax cuts back up to the federal government\nMy philosophy is to take the government and the federal dollars and bring them back down to the state at every opportunity and back down to our local officials who know how to deal with them better and it was when it comes to drugs the opioid crisis is exactly this problem\nWe passed a ton of right build up at the federal level but the problem is the money is trapped at a community service sports at the state level and it's not making its way down\nTo our uh our local sheriffs in Chesterfield in Waco and all of our counties and those drugs are vitally needed and we need low cost drugs and so the basic idea is to return power back to states and localities\nThank you congressman brat I'm Sorry I Wonder minor audience that we do have reception penalty seven seconds for Mr branch Dave sorry I\nMissed the spammer Abigail if you would um would you like the question again\nWe're talking about the rising cost of prescription drug medicines and the cost of health care across the board is number one thing that people are talking about and how it is that we can actually addressed the prescription drug price\nIssue is we need more competition in the marketplace currently it is possible for pharmaceutical companies to do what's called patents ticketing where they are Longate the titans and they they depressed competition\nMedicare for example needs to be able to negotiate his prescription drug prices the Veterans Administration is able to do so and some drugs are up to eighty percent cheaper on the Veterans Administration side than they are on the Medicare side\nIn terms of what we need to do overall with health care and I think we'll probably be talking about this quite a lot we need to strengthen or current healthcare system\nAnd we need a public option you will hear my opponents very frequently if some expensive program that I Do in fact not support I support a public option while we're talking about the costs and special interest money\nI Would note that in our tax bill the twenty Seventeen tax bill that added to the deficit to the tune of one point nine trillion dollars\nPharmaceutical companies the top five pharmaceutical companies got forty two billion dollars in tax\nAnd so when we're looking about at the reason we cannot find a we cannot lower the price of prescription drugs and Medicare cannot negotiate his prescription drug pricing and it is because of the pharmaceutical ... it's so great it is so great that when we had a congressman right congressman brat\nWho said he would not add to the deficit who voted against spending bills because they would add to the deficit is willing to add one point nine trillion dollars to the deficit in order to get tax cuts to the tune of forty two billion dollars to pharmaceutical companies\nTaking the spammer will return to you for next question which tries to deal with immigration wouldn't you know if any has the current administration's immigration policy\nOn Virginia's workforce\n\nAs a country need comprehensive immigration reform\nIs something that has been talked about for years we have not achieved bipartisan comprehensive immigration reform and right here in colpepper\nHave heard stories from people in the agricultural business who are concerned about whether long term they will have the employees that they need\nPeople threw out or district are concerned about the way immigration has become such a politically divisive issue the truth of the matter is we need immigration reform comprehensive bipartisan immigration reform that it's changed a number of things first that secures our borders and our points of entry I worked at CIA as a former\nAs a former CIA officer I worked undercover I worked counterterrorism I worked in narco trafficking traffic\nUnderstanding the drug cartels working throughout Mexico I Am well aware\nOf the threats that present themselves at the southern border and it's for that reason that we need comprehensive immigration reform that is strong on border security and strengthening our points adventurous but we also need immigration reform that\nVirginia and we need comprehensive immigration reform that gets to teach and trailers children who were brought here through no fault of their own by\nAnd that white bipartisanship could look like different the pressing issues that is impacting communities and economies across central Virginia and prosperous country and we need bipartisanship to actually drive\nA change on this issue but when we look at what my opponent has been\nAdvocating for it is not a bipartisan solution me the bill of a compromise bill that he frequently talked about it was a compromise between the far right and the more moderate Democrats and the more moderate Republicans there was a compromise though there was a bipartisan bill that was put forth in Congress they didn't get out of committee this time around\nBut it was put forth by a Republican and Democrat there are people who are willing who were working to try and find ... bipartisan solutions but there are currently not enough of an in Congress\nThank you David\nYeah thank you for the question I think it had to do can you repeat the question is labor force\nCharles what if what impact if any has the current administration's immigration policies pattern Virginia's workforce\nYeah as I say we achieved here's result by first of all avoiding a huge amnesty bill which would have had a devastating impact on wages for the nation as labor supply goes up with a huge amnesty American wages go down American Jobs go down and so our efforts on that front had been very positive\nAnd so my opponent just brought up comprehensive immigration reform we had the good last ... this year and she says that's not bipartisan Obama was for that the Clintons were ... or e verify in the major components in that bill every one to tell the last couple of years the left has gone off the rails\nAnd so every major Democrat including Barbara Jordan the great civil rights leader was\nIn favor of all the components in that good let built it is bipartisan we compromise we took care of seven hundred thousand DACA kids gave them a legal status that is a compromise no Democrat would vote for it\nThen President Trump upped at one point eight million Dr kids the Democrats said no to that compromise than I did a bill that United parents and kids at the border with Senator Ted Cruz and Chuck Schumer the Democrat said no to that bill\nSo if you look at the facts of the matter and the actual legislation that came up and the vote it's very clear that my opponent falls to the very far left\nOn this issue of immigration she's been on the record in favor of sanctuary cities she said the states and localities can deal with these issues we don't need to cooperate with federal government that's what makes where cities are you don't cooperate with the law of the land we have plenty of great laws on the books if we would only follow the law\nAnd so it's just a matter of civil law enforcement\nAnd of course we need our federal ice agents working with us at the state and local\nHer her objection there is very radical if you think about it she said don't follow the law the land we should not cooperate with federal law enforcement and that's stunning\nThe ice agents are the ones who are protecting us from the three hundred\nThese are real and talk to the sheriff's up here in coal pepper talk to the sheriff in in Waco it down in Chesterfield if you don't think it's a serious problem we have a hundred and fifty badge and hit like all alone for them and it's on the on oh start thank you very much say All right I'm a\nAbigail is chosen to use one of a red card so you have\nOne minute to ... ...\nThank you so much and congressman brat I appreciate you explain it in the role of federal law enforcement agents because in heat I used to be one I used to work jointly with ice I worked joint drug cases in fact in the DC area with the high intensity drug trafficking area taskforce often and it's ...\nWell aware of the role of federal agents I Do not support safe haven for criminals or gangs I Do not support anything that would make our community at me or hurt our enemies in fact I used to work every single day to keep the community I live in states\nTo keep our communities free of drugs on the street so for me to let anything else is it's frankly comical\nUm but in fact I Would like to state for the record\nThat I support law enforcement in all its for him because I used to be among them and I and the daughter of a career law enforcement officer [noise]\n\nYou're listening to the show friends your share common sense\nDream radio stations or Virginia and\nAny time at the French or [noise]\n[noise]\n\nAnd we paid for the entire liberal order that has brought us all together for when when we made friends with our arch enemy the Germans and the Japanese and now we all our friends and play when when together on trade and economic growth and it's been great for our country\nAnd so that is the result that we've achieved with this executive and our Congress this year the economy is now booming we still have work to do with China\nUh but when it comes to our agriculture it's the largest sector in Virginia and so we work very hard with our foreign bureaus across all my ten counties to protect them and to ensure that any chair for negotiations are short lived in a matter of months\nNot years but we have to do that it's basically more a matter of geopolitics and not a matter of trade policy I trade we all want zero tariffs\nHow about you can push thank you\nUpdated trade deal it's been updated version of NAFTA\nSome positive benefits particularly for Gary's which is impactful here called pepper and across\nOur communities in the seventh district the notion that we would move toward zero terrorists\nA trade war is not something that I understand and in fact we had antagonize\nAnd our trade partners by creating and starting a trade war when we look at the fact\nAs congressman brat just said China is a big threat is China it's such a big threat why are we comfortable with the fact that they hold the most amount of our debt debt that we have now just chosen thanks to the tax bill is twenty Seventeen to increase by one point nine trillion dollars\nAnd these parents and the changes that they've made haven't been great and if you don't believe me after\nTwenty thousand for workers who just lost their jobs\nBecause for that they couldn't handle the steel and aluminum tariffs\nThat depleted their income by one billion dollars and then we can talk about the soybean farmers right here\nThe seventh district soybean farmers right here who because of these terrorists\nHave decreased prices for Bush will it costs about ten dollars and five cents per bushel for soybean farmers to break even prices since the terrorists went into place having been above nine\nDollars we're creating challenges in our community and to answer them the president's desire the president's choice whereas in fact to put a twelve billion dollar bailout on the American\nBack at twelve billion dollar bailout farmers don't want bailout they wants to sell their crops\nAnd so the notion that we would start a trade war to begin to get ourselves to the point where we're\nDoesn't make any sense to me it is reckless foreign policy it creates detrimental relationships with our friends our allies\nLong term it's tremendously detrimental to our stability in the world\nBank robber do I do think you very much room to move to our next question\nI'm when I'm Sorry I Apologize this question is for you so many in Second Amendment ... said there continues to be a growing public concern regarding gun violence and school safety what measures would you put in place to provide a safe environment for students\n\nAs I mentioned I Am a former law enforcement officer I get to carry a gun every single day I Am well aware of the responsibility of gun ownership I grew up in a house with guns I grew up in a family of sportsmen\nBut we can have conversations in our community about how it is that we can balance or Second Amendment right which I firmly support with the rights of our school children to go to school and feel safe in our county ... county I say our because the Congress and lived there as well one of our schools had\nThe days that I put my children on the bus\nWhen there was a threat of gun violence in our county which is a hard\nThree out of four do is paying and are a number believed that background\nShouldn't be in place background checks on all firearms purchases and it's simply a find the same standard that exists if you go to a federally licensed placed a\nPoint of sound like that was our diction by at a gun show that is a first step forward that we can take the other thing that we should be doing when looking at and gun violence is ensuring that our schools have the resources to deal with students who might be facing trauma or who might be facing strap\nMight be at risk for violent behavior this is a comprehensive issue is not one that we can solve in a day but it's certainly not one that we will be able to solve it we do not had readers in Washington who are willing to have a\nConversations but the good news is there are already members of Congress who are willing to have that conversation there is a bipartisan\nBackground checks bill in Congress couldn't get out of committee because there was not a critical mass of people willing to have cars conversations and so I Want to go to Congress will be a part of these discussions again I understand gun ownership I understand the responsibility of gun ownership\nAnd these are congregations we can have about ensuring that people who are origin themselves their community or others are not able to do harm in our schools\nYou Abigail Dave ... thank you very much this is a tough conversation to have and we've had plenty of them in the seventh district I have a daughter in the audience that goes to public school as well and of course we all work hard every day on this issue to keep our kids very safe\nSo I can be a major group of all the folks across all ten county school resource officers school councilors mental health experts sheriff's police first responders\nEveryone who was in a room with school councilors so that we had all voices dance and they came up with three solutions are then I'll share with you tonight at first and this was after the Parkland, Florida incident and a lot of this was in response to the failure in Parkland and we don't want to repeat that\nIn our counties here and so the first ones to harden the schools with school resource officers the second was enhanced significantly mental health\nEveryone was agreement that that was probably the major peace we need to work on and that's connected to the third piece which is to connect the dots between the federal government and the state government the FBI the local the localities and law enforcement and then the schools themselves\nAnd that was a total tragedy in Parkland, Florida case they connected note that the FBI did not talk to the state to state didn't talk to them all the ... still look at the local police force visited that young boys home twenty times\nAnd no dots were connected the school resource officer was not in the school in our districts and across our counties we have outstanding law law enforcement you see them with us today the FBI isn't constant communication with our state leaders\nAnd I'm very proud of the work our law enforcement does on these issues and so those are the primary solutions that I received by listening to my constituents those are the experts in our community and that's what they came up with a when it comes to gun\nBlue states\nCan I finish the question I have a few more seconds that when if you want to look at the liberal Nancy Pelosi agenda and my opponent will be a vote for that entire agenda all you have to do is look at the blue states and blue town they say let's just work on this issue in this issue in this issue and have conversations about it\nBut up in those blue states they want to take away your gun and they have taken away guns and crime

trade but we have huge uh moved we can still making sure man is part of that solution\nAnd so last year our results we improve the K. to twelve education bill by taking away federal mandates and so
