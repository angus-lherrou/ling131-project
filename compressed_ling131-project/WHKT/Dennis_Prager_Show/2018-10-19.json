you're always just like ... ... are you able to maintain that\nYes you know I I Am you know I'm blessed to represent great folks and the and the first district you know I I get my energy from that they are they're very individual that they work hard every day in\nAnd do do great work so it's hard not to be motivated by that but it it's hard not to be motivated to buy the\nThat and I'm having been in that position and walk them off and going back and getting re energized but are you a worn down by Washington at all\nBut you know criticizing me that I think at certain times it it it does it does give you pause as to you know where we are at the country and the divisions that are out there but\nA awful but they also have I I Love the single object rule in places where you where do you deal with one subject and that's it you don't have this big mash up coming back from the other from the Senate or vice versa that just blows up the whole deal\nNo I agree and and trying to be a good good good thing is that in the in the U.S house we are not with the same rules that you operate their general ... on you and I\nBoth know that is still figure out the rules about how things are happening around the sun has different rules so many states kind of get combined together and you look at how to August is\nRelated in any way shape or form in the ... the the most highlighted example is we're here for about ... past the title of the bill was that the care that they they they took\nThey took a Senate bill ... all the language you out of it kept bumper and the title of the survey of the house version\nOf the Affordable CARE Act so it it it's that kind of procedural stuff it's just shakes her head why how could that happen\nBut I Would argue that\nYou know sticking with the logic of sister ... was the way to make sure that your keep debate are tracking made sure we don't have a lot of you know Don related to a piece of legislation people go how did that get\nIn there it's kinda like you know throwing everything on the last train leaving the ... it's like you know that stuff doesn't doesn't belong there are a spot related or should\nBe used you know as as as a vehicle to pass things that are unrelated so I I agree that that's one of the I think the problems up here is that it doesn't it doesn't require the necessary debate insurance policy when you're using\nThat mechanism when you have unrelated on aspects of legislation or language right their way to build a people just you know look at it and go how how could that happen\nWell I Hope you all will take a look at some of the rules and get more to wherever upper junior way of governing up in DC because I I one of the things that uh when you pull back from politics and watch sports people get upset when they see rules violations because they know the rules\nAre you in Enron darling he was a pitcher for the Mets and the agents mother team said that is a pitch you when you are warming up to you put your mic down and say grab Patel I'm done that's a perfect pitch and it was and it was called the ball and the next pitch the Boston Red Sox guy hit it for a home run\nAnd as far as I'm saying you go that's outrageous only because the the the teleprompter had on there the strike zone so you knew you could see that that was the rules violation right you saw that that was wrong and then what happens when people in in politics people that they don't know the rules to get upset about\nThat's just not cricket you're not doing it the right way guys you know we deserve better and so they pulled back in your eyes just the ... they they shrugged their shoulders and throw their hands and\nYou know it's just it's just not working on on on my that might be half you know I I don't get it right in the distance and or anything you can do to to to change that up would be the end of my rent let's get back to the absolute let's get back to the national district what what are your voters telling you\nBut you know we're here to stay well I think ... that they're very interested in how do we ... a a continual\nUm increase at our economy people are very positive about where the hottest just bomb I think they appreciate what's meant by Congress lessening regulatory burden and changing the tax code or something and keep your heart but I was going to say if the political\nBut the things that they want to see going forward what I call a sustaining parts of an economy and first of all as soon as how much case system that\nAssures that our children students get the officers educational experience to be able to\nFulfill the jobs are there are seven point one billion jobs so Chris and Seventy five percent of those jobs will not require a four year degree\nAnd that means we have to emphasize career and technical education as much as we do college truck education because that's where the jobs are those costs today are skilled jobs that awkward as far as her career when you go from an apprenticeship journey to a pastor and have a career there\nLooks well any instances better than you\nWant a job that requires a college degree so I think people look at that and say that's where we have to answer looking on going how it's going to make sure the child is ...\nLike how to make sure the education system give them their knowledge ability to compete for the jobs that are available today about the future and I think businesses say hey the other things when the economy going really well\nOf course when I talk to us all sorts of cost the district I can tell you the top three things they talk to me about our workforce workforce in the workforce or you know they said we could grow up business today we can just\nHiring workers to do the job and it's you know there are jobs are going to go there are people fail to job openings show where am I going to have the cost of ... in one other element you know particle\nIt's important not just a part of education so that a lot of families children scope of tablet computers they bring them home and they can't connect it's hard for them to do the assignments that they've been given\nOr the mom and I'm like a political equal take a part of the library or bottles to walk five\nBusinesses Thompson areas that don't have high speed can't do the business they need to be successful and her one of the ways to print out\nHealthcare costs to provide access is the use of medicine specialist doctors can connect with patients without going\nTo go to an office building ... miles and miles away and can get that clear and quality of one of those things are gaining changed right so we are growing more broad than that we have to make sure we have education such a size\nCrew in talking legislation as much as a test college truck education\nAnd these are these are these are the tough issues because people don't go broadband workforce development those those don't get the people out to the to the polls\nI mean they're just like you know that makes sense I like that you know because when people get down into the\nThe granular already talked about what the other callers today in politics and the government's complex and people don't like complex they're like five were bumper stickers because they're pretty busy trying to make their lives working in putting that into the context that they're doing and I come out and vote whichever way is a tall order for a lot of politicians right\nSure policy\nIn in this is complicated it takes town hall her off\nFor anybody anybody in a in a leadership position whether elected or thought has to have those conversations and you know those things that I'm a project or are really distilled hangs out here also something that I come up with some people say hey let's go\nAnd I guess it could be soundbites are way to help our economy but drill down is okay we've done anything to help the economy and you can always say\nBoy just does things and that is great Chuck about but I think a lot of really want\nTo own intellect that officer asking people start to say one of the things I've done that is quite so close that I've done ... eat that's great but what people want to hear to work if I'm going to play sports and you're working on what are we going to do in the future how do you understand things get to eat on what what are you going to do to accomplish that\nWhat do you what you want to come back to us if you are ... ... s just you know the next term and\nSort of things I said that I was able to accomplish and and I think people want that they want you to understand which according to them and they want you to project edition and for the future about how they're still going to be addressed so it's not just\nA laundry list to get you ... what are you going to connect with armor stolen people's concerns and that challenge you face a choice you\nTell people audiences only talking politics in the future not that bad it is and you can like look what happened\nAnd they just threw out the government pretty much there's some there's some there's some undertow currents that you just have to go out there and pound doors\nAnd understand and listen to people\nBecause the elections are about tomorrow night yesterday that she Rob I really appreciate your calling in today we wish you the best out there on the campaign trail you got what Eighteen days left Eighteen [laughter] everybody 'cause hey we've only got four hundred and Seventy two days to the Iowa caucuses\nAnd isn't that fun [laughter] [noise]\n\nWell there was already out there already out there getting their campaign strategist and consultants lined up for the for the caucuses and people are starting packs and all that kind of stuff that never ends Virginia is always a test case and now we're blessed for people who who offer themselves up for public service and regardless of party\nOr we thank you Rob thanks for calling in and we'll be joined in the next segment by Dr Robyn McDougal Virginia Commonwealth university Wilder school will join us\nWhat do you think your future Republican Party is what is a statewide race nominating convention [noise] but\nIn this hypothetical would have done some people I certainly did America last primary does that make him going forward because people will say well he's got a built in base of support in the party after Iraq and\nWhat people say you've had your chance on the stage and you know several times a time to a\nGreat question Joe and thanks for calling and I would suggest that it is dependent upon how\nWell he actually does relative to the national spread and the Virginia I'm nor I mean does I think that the the north um race last year was a point and that's a big number\nIf you're a Republican especially because three years before that\nThat Gillespie got within a here's breath and beating Mark Warner I think if he's in double digit losses it's very difficult for him to\nTo ah to run again a state wide but who knows I Do think the Republican Party is going to be going through some changes are gonna be like a soul searching after this election you know um and there'll be looking at new directions new candidates or to to go forward I don't know how much staying power Corey would hang\nOut with a double digit loss and I'll just after three statewide offices but thanks for calling it\nGot any other questions no sir have a good match\nHey uh NBA when you when you do you like they're the warriors are you not my condition it's anybody about the war [laughter] the throne Golden State in the in the finals\nWho else in the west in\nBoston most people will see what happens with the rockets that they can integrate their new pieces including Carmelo Anthony ... a lot of people are down on 'em\nThere's a reason for that I'm not very good what you've ever pet\nLess than I think Karl Carmelo shortcomings but I think the\nSort of move in a recent the finance overlooks a pretty pretty impressive tenure in the league despite some of his\nResearch to sort of downgrade in his in his game so we'll see you know I'm you know I got some Philadelphia connection so I've always got a soft spot in my heart for the Sixers I'm not sure if they're quite ready to make the leap but we'll see anybody by the warriors\n'cause I I I like the Sixers we used to have a song in a in in college hey Philadelphia five six seven Philadelphia Seventy six or something like that we all see the dancing Jonah shoulders\nSo sort of ingrained in the Seventy Sixers culture back in the day but a proceed Conan joins you start taking you took thanks okay as a doctor McDougal patiently waiting for us\nYeah there she is now Ari Robin yet I think there's a lady that wind\nStores are still open by the way\nI exactly I I Will make sure that I make my you know purchased and get it you know drop your doorstep the fat\nYou know Amazon is pretty much a daily stop at our house so I just don't want any order for either in a perfect\nAnd we look folks if you're listening to take stock in cardboard boxes whatever the company is publicly traded that makes cardboard boxes that Amazon by by that stock because we have so much cardboard box in our garage stacked up after the ... oh my God\nWe're we're right there yet are I'm sure so a doctor Robin ... is with the Virginia Commonwealth University Wilder school tell us briefly about the wider school what youre doing\nYet where we're at school of government in public and rain and you can report called the public affairs undergraduate and graduate programs based on criminal jak their family and security and emergency preparedness\nPublic administration and the programs in the\nUrban and regional planning and public policy and then we have our Center for public policy what you're actually going to sell the community engagement arm\nThat weren't even allowed her school say you will see a lot of things around economic leadership training look like state government outreach and things like public policy polling that we were for public policy in the ...\n... what can we come to that point real quick but you guys actually go out and work with uh other local governments and businesses and you helped him just not just I think people don't understand that about higher education the value that you bring to the community and the state yeah\nProviding incentives for a certain business to come into their community and doing a return on investment\nOf work that economic impact would look like on the proposal stage with regards to incentive then come back and provided them that actual economic impact if they went forward with a business and the impact that it had on the community with everything from reading your job creation\nOther aspects in our way out we've done evaluations of um you know criminal justice programs to the implementation of a mental health program or a drug treatment program on reducing recidivism for local jail or a community partner we work with a non\nProfit from everything from their valuations of the programs in projects that they can do to coordinating and combining the\nActual help that they need with regards to our students and our staff or with their community program and then we've done some work with the public sector and private sector as well on the business community\nLooking at a third party evaluations of programs in projects for the private sector looking to get to the general assembly and need an actual third party non biased evaluation of that work being able to provide that report for\nThat company for the general assembly to look at legislative impacts so we do we are any\nContinual partner every single day with our local and state governments around the commonwealth um and\nIt it really is what we live and breathe in the wild her school specifically um we do it at a much more um Costa second rate then our private sector counterparts if you will\nBecause it really is our mission and our vision and it allows us to bring to bear are academic experts he says well within the Wilder school you know we have every thirty academic faculty they're expertise you want to talk about the economic impact on that for a common myth in\nUrban and regional planning program or you want to talk about the impact of an opiate program\nA treatment program I've got to criminal justice or academic see that's their area of expertise and they get asked all around the country to look you know present their research and were able to bring that expertise to be here for our localities in the commonwealth in Virginia\nSo that when you're when you're a whole service higher education schools let me\nWhen they are we are you know we we provide at all give us your students they will education from freshman in college through graduate school in PHD program give us your workers that we will train them in executive leadership and management preparation [laughter]\nGive us your legislators and you're a lobbyist and we will change in policy analysis on the impact of a variety of\nLegislation and give us your community that will help you come up with solutions and then you need evaluation impact on this list you know what do we really are I'm not one stop all income\nFor the education and consulting academic arm\nFor work when state government and our our citizens and students around the commonwealth\nAnd that's why I brought it up and they will go the polling you're with your operations on there because\nA lot of things and governments especially Howard insurance which has a bull's eye on his back around the country but in Virginia we've got a great higher education system we really need to be proud of it\nUh even though it's you know it's it's appropriate\nTo hold them accountable and ask questions but\nA lot of things you're talking about our three they are exclusive of of usual operations and they are a complementary to what you are doing and actually facilitate when you were doing it\nIn higher education I think it's wonderful I think it's misunderstood not understood at all but let's jump into some polling a that while the school has done what are you sitting out there or what have you seen what direction are we going\nTo talk about anything that Clinton on earlier so let's talk about policy in in calling in public policy that we did this summer we were out in July will have another call right here after the election in November but in our in our public ... theory and you talked about how to talk about that for a second\nWhen we look at that we surveyed over eight hundred for unions around the entire commonwealth\nA true representative sample of all five of our\nCommonwealth and when we look at and ask people what they think about the value of higher education and for union over eighty percent of our respondents believed that the community colleges that we had it for or work their costs over sixty five percent\nBelieve that our public four year institutions are worth the car\nAnd then right under fifty percent believe that our private schools in the commonwealth of work in the car so it's really important that you said that question around down in Virginia we value higher education and not only can we value but we're putting out a product that comes around the commonwealth\n[noise]\nBusiness hours from town hall dot com I buy new in Washington during the campaign rally last night in Montana\nPresident Trump praised a congressman who body slammed a reporter

leaders on a part of that is our next guest\nWho is joining us from the Hawkeye State I think it's called the Hawkeye State Jesse Harris\nCreating something new you know [laughter]\nSomebody did yeah\nYeah I get I got a I have way too much coffee in the morning\nYou and me both me and I go through about a pot I'm I'm Down here and I'm no I'm just ... ready to go to Mike what's going on New Hampshire these days\nWell I'll tell you what we had we had a couple of presidential candidates running for twenty funny already here in the last week so things are wrapping up\nSo this is only for the Democratic side no Republicans have gone up there right\nNow [noise] you know\nDonald Trump for the Republican nomination I actually wrote an op ed for the statewide paper here in New Hampshire just last week and it's pretty silly to take on Donald Trump\nI'm a ... you know two years or any time a in a Republican primary where a sitting president has been challenged it's been on the right job and these guys will be running on the left they really wouldn't have a prayer feeding the president and the Republican primary\nRight now right now that's that's right now anything can happen goodness knows who have\nCan happen any thing of course and especially you know God Forbid the economy collapses\nRight right that's one of my you know when something like that but if but if your mother drops a big one things can change All right let's let's shift to the Democratic nomination credit primary graphic were four hundred and Seventy nine days away something like that from the Democratic primary hamster [laughter]\nThat's why I think it's I think it's smart Chris for you to to be talking about just stop and because the the the presidential I stopped you well know there's there's all kinds of things happening behind the scenes right now\nThis is where it happens right the person that I broke pros\nAnd cons of the day after November's election candidates\nStart killing things in a more public way but like I said senator or job ran from New York was up here yesterday campaigning with the Democrats can't pay a candidate for governor in New Hampshire and show she's laying the groundwork she's ... and you know she's doing that all across the country\nAnd um [noise] ah so she's starting to put things together\nI'm Alec Baldwin I Know it seems silly I'm sure you've heard about it to the guys he he's making around here I think he made his second trip to New Hampshire just this past weekend\nReal twice in the last six months Alec Baldwin Alec Baldwin and he said he has not ruled out running for president wow\nThank you Mike we're back in the news this morning it was my comment and by the producer of the show looking at we're making news this morning Steve ball like this one Eli\nEli Alec Baldwin has um a spoke at the largest fundraiser for the Democratic party in New Hampshire I just last week\nYeah wow see if he ran his old out Goldman is Jack Ryan you know it's kinda my God yeah but [laughter] that was back in the Cold War you know a hundred ... that's right yeah\nSo who else do you see in up in in New Hampshire and who would you guess to be the front runners in the New Hampshire primary today likely to win the twenty twenty primary in February of next year Europe\nIt's Bernie Sanders run for president he will be the honor okay that's no doubt about it no answer no doubt about it right it seems a little bit Warren will likely be the front runner\nOkay so how 'bout what recently happened with\nBumbling of the DNA ancestry ball this week the disaster\nYou know and democratic circles I actually don't think it down as much a liberal Democrats are going to be looking for a liberal Democrat rent cars list of facts\n[laughter] you know\nThey say they their their choices in and says Russian primarily on emotion\nAnd Jesse Harris from ... Iowa just dumped you heard that\nVery a veteran democratic operative in in Iowa was describing a I'm a ... scene but in reality in the in the Democratic voter in the primary butter that they also want to win and they might go you know I don't think Sanders can win nationally I think you\nKnow I'm a Republican I think the lives of vets Warren would have a similar problem I don't think she's electable in the in the general election nationally nationally okay\nYeah I I Would you open that you've got to be an issue as an example I ... and so I don't want to think I Will say though it is I I don't think it affected her here in New Hampshire I Do think it affected them again the behind the operation\nAnd and you know the all the maneuvering going on behind the scenes among potential democratic candidates for her to actually take over a news cycle before the election the way she did was outrageously self serving\nAnd literally ... who does that why why would I mean if you knew the results of the DNA test and it was counter to your narrative that you're trying to laughter you put that thing at midday on Christmas [laughter] have you been married right [laughter] you\nKnow I don't understand that [noise] so how do you think okay so you got Sanders worn just because it's New Hampshire\nBut the other guys have got to go up there and compete or do they have to they might say just study you\nKnow I think they do I do because there's always going to the opportunities and as you probably know that I'm Joe Clinton made a name for himself by doing well in in coming back\nTo to win at a time when she was losing so you don't have to weigh in New Hampshire primary to make to make all the way across the country so especially as Elizabeth Warren is the primary she's from Massachusetts from Massachusetts the candidate who comes in second and third\nI can get on that to them as a result\nYeah 'cause I think Clinton finished third right yeah that's right yeah so\nSo I bet you have to win points for show in New Hampshire to advance do you have\nTo yeah that's right that is correct and I ended up just ... I don't think people understand about the the democratic nomination process this cycle is that California has moved up yeah and they're going to happen that's expensive state and Kamala Harris comical Harris is going to have a big lead there\nAnd that's the I think that's going to be against\nConversation but what she does in the early primary states will be interesting given the California moved up will she tried will ... will she try and ... and pick a state that you should try and do well in all of them and um you know 'cause they're so different that their early primary states compared to California\nWell again I think you have to at least try to compete in some of these because\nThe reality is even though you might not win New Hampshire you won't matter in the the uh\nThe nomination legitimately so\nYou still have to win in the in the electoral college that try to do what you can't you can't just blow past Iowa New Hampshire because those are those who have gone in either direction especially with Trump winning Iowa last time that's right no doubt about it what issues are dry and New Hampshire voters these days what's going on up there\nAnd get stacked or the economy is there's still the number one issue um\nThe governor here a is a Republican Christian new a new ingenious\nAnd uh uh with what Donald Trump's been doing any and governor Sununu the economy is booming we have the second lowest unemployment rate\nIn the country and I'm On the Democrats don't want to talk about that they're trying to talk about anything but the economy with a family you know pays lose issue ... they're just trying to make up an issue that might connect with voters other than the economy\nSo that's going to continue to be number one the second issue here Chris I I don't know how it\nWorks in other states you've heard Donald Trump even talk about this is the opioid epidemic to a which is pretty ... pretty severe in New Hampshire so that's the second biggest issue\nReally that's that's yeah you have to say the number it's affected our number here we've had we've had we've had that disease in our family as well and it's a it's a ... member of people dying as a result of that is the doors or anything else that country and it happens it's going to handle mental apart as\nYou said it's not a partisan issue Mike a final predictions what do you think coming out we've got thirty seconds punch it when he got for the Democratic nominee the Democratic finishers in New Hampshire twenty twenty\nI say it's going to go Elizabeth Warren will wind up actually run she's going to win the\nThe New Hampshire primary um there's going to I I think there's going to be some kind of dark horse like a um a Cory Booker I expect will be somewhere in the top three on\nIran and then you know what I I I Would not be surprised if someone like Michael\nBloomberg longer days as well because I think the Democratic state we need we need to thank all of a businessman\nAll right Mike then he's joining us from the Granite State of New Hampshire four hundred and eighty days plus or minus out of the New Hampshire primary thanks for joining us we'll be back on the John Frederick sure this is Chris ... billion and ... [noise]\nLet up on the intensity of the enthusiasm uh it's just it's great it's great out there on the trail\nHow how about you know we're not going to let a thousand hungry line I\nMean she nor nor should you knew or should the anyone in in both but how do you how do you compare the intensity this year to last year when he was the name similar not as intense when he said well\nSimilar but I think we we're we're very proud particularly in Virginia last year when we send a message to the country into the world you know hate and bigotry have no place here and that we were open and welcoming for business when the election of governor north Bundy and his team and then you know that that first set\nOf how can I go to a guy across the finish line\nThat just being for capital tree house um I was out of our our candidates that women and a diverse women and I just it just eat eat up so that was that was really great but I think what has happened is people's reliance we we can do this we can do this and it's just\nHealth doubled down and we see for example the\nSearch and the absentee ballots seeing 'em in Fairfax County in Prince William county which our number one and two right now in the state\nOn requests for absentee ballots you know that's good for us\nThat that's really I remember when I think\nWe're just added you know adding more excitement and enthusiasm\nRight like quitting kid was on earlier to seven o'clock hour he said he's he thinks the turnout was going to be forty to forty five percent and it's a large large a range and there but where do you all projecting turn out right now\nWe're just going out there looking for every single day I\nGet the message [laughter] I Know where do you think the terminals gotta get your average\nMid term elections which normally a hard but we have a reason to get out there is a lot at stake and um and a sandwich going to be better than your average and it turned out you know I'm not into debt for\nAll of that and we're just going to ... weeks just which we can you're describing ... yeah we're in that\nShe had a team the now famous and we are just trying to get our violent and bring over anybody else that wants to ...\nI've been impressed with your with your cropper Kansas this year and last year they they definitely worked hard when when that struck me as a sort of an obvious one is that the predominant of the meal Kansas nominees\nRight it just is definitely the year the women are like to talk about our winner candidates and then I got Shani Anthony lack of anti\nMan not [laughter] I mean Jennifer Wexton is is I mean and they're all they have a different kind of experience diversity but it is all good and it will\nBe a good refreshing brown I'm for Congress and across some crops at the time in some states are general for waxed and up there on the ... congressional district that we're really excited about what we see up there um the volunteers are just showing up on non stop\nAnd the Washington Post indoor stroke which is something that on a you know I Am Barbara Comstock got endorsed every other time when they were very\nHer Comstock Jeff ... going to be on a congresswoman and that's down in front of a real quick itchy runner you asked me something about him but we were struggling a lawyer and the second district a retired navy commander in a small

mean that's you know that on her and I'll stop that's pretty St Louis or not I think I've ever seen on a reject that\nBut even that we you know without that we still have a sign of a credible candidate\nWell what I found out when I've seen in your in your tennis yeah the ... obviously a female when I think it sends regardless of the outcomes\nAnd we can talk about polling and outcomes in November and you know Clinton kids got a tailor up and he's got ... up and co burn and in in the in the Williams and Louis in the\nIn the six uh when I think it's sending a signal though is that you're going to see even more women in the future running for office regardless of party and I think that's a very unhealthy dynamic yeah\nYeah and I want to I Want to say two things on that real quick we're really excited that Leslie cover just got me into the record label um programs for the D triple C H I think I think you're exactly right about women women have always um [noise]\nUm [noise] women have always and studies show yes but you know then the ones that would not know your mom would agree with me on asked would admit\nThey don't go over my heart somehow from a horse can you don't go [laughter]\nGo the way that raise my kids I got to get my third grade I pay off my lines you know I mean you can do it better and I think really want I don't know\nI guess if you have to say good outcomes twenty sixteen who's winning decided well not waiting anymore we step mom yeah something to offer and I I think ... you wait what you're seeing more and more of that\nScene because someone Saturday saying otherwise you know if you're not to table you're on the menu and you can look at what is that state this year which women's health care\nWith Stanley ... with health care in general you know women have to add to that and they're like I just don't think we're going to step back anymore\nNo no no I don't I don't think you should and I think having the frankly it's not just that they're women but they're but they're in a certain age range to relatively speaking to me a couple of them you know a bit older a little bit younger but for the most part\nYou're you're center kind of moms right the suburban mom is is it is a strong voting I won't say block but a marketing that I I think your party is obviously intentionally trying to attract\n... correct correct and on dirt suburban moms some advantages for Donald Trump\nI think you have seen the ramifications for that matter and we are reaching out and talking to them and particularly when you take something like the Kavanaugh's nomination where you know soccer fact of whether you're getting they're getting the late Dr ...\nNot to be in charge and then add on to the fact of you know her very compelling tester testimony and on and they you know Republicans decided not to believe possibly for that's going to be some ramifications from\nOkay um let's talk about allegedly Coburn moving from into the tree the

the end they finally you know solve the value in investing more in her\nWell it also says hey they have the resources to do it right\nWell that's a good point too I think that is and if you've seen articles yet you know our candidates are actually out raising our candidates not even the committees are actually out raising a Republican incumbents like you look at Dave Brat versus Abigail Spanberger\nI think she outraged channel three to one maybe on this last um [noise]\nI guess this this recent filing report on it and you know that's that's just what we're seeing all across\nThe

underlined nonpartisan boldly non partisan or a pro business out of the advocacy organization here in the comic around for Thirty years I'm not only are pro business we're also very much\nA working towards responsible pro business government 'cause as we heard in the in the news updates like we heard that the China's economy is slowing down it's gross and that's a problem we have a significant debt burden and their economy is slowing its growth down there\nYou know you're trying to like be be that guy and that has that has devolved to where we are today largely as a result of several factors I'm One that the Iraq War or to the collapse of the economy in two thousand and eight\nAnd a and that has led to this massive worldwide suspicion of government or what's going on today this unsettled place that we are in this world is not just manifesting itself in the United states we are not alone in this in this in this cultural shift is manifesting itself in politics\nIt's showing up in Hungary in Poland and\nIn Germany over the weekend in Bavaria which is actually I ran into a [laughter]\nGerman political days are over the weekend\nFancy that right you're going to exchange

successful economically it is the richest region of Germany for full employment\nSchool system is set up to get people to work straight away um if if you're like a tenth grade and you're not you don't really want to go to university you don't have to fake it to make it you can go right into a a a trade school and apprentice program and you're gonna get a job and you get a diploma so they get um really meant so it's a very work intensive area they they pride themselves culturally\nOn work and productivity an organization and good government right there it was like a it's not like a shining example of how you would want to have\nA state where a region actually be everyone's employed and one has a job you have any functions ah and\nIt works well they had this major upset but very intellectual and you go what are you upset about what what could you possibly be that concerned about\nThat you basically blow up this I don't know if they blow it up but how does major upset and the ruling party that had been has been in control for decades last probably the ... the ruling majority\nIn Bavaria and it was stunning to me to realize that we're not immune from that here here in America so people say you know the economy Republicans are on the economy is going so great vote for us\nPeople don't vote on yesterday's news they don't vote on today's news they vote on the future where are we going where what is going to be happening that's my fear that's my concern because well things are going well you know\nWhat Donald Trump got elected gasoline was about two twenty five a gallon now it's around two eighty ah two thousand eight was four dollars a gallon or better but are we getting better are we getting worse\nYou know you hear that China news today about their economy

skills and bears my dad says there are about this guy's off all she's horrible there ... there but there is no big overriding issue like\nHere's what we're going to do in the future it's just that the other person is really bad therefore they're not going to be good for you\nUm and therefore because we found was gonna say well they're gonna hurt the economy I guess is what they strap elation isn't the subconscious\nBut I'm going what is the big driving issue other than obviously Donald Trump and it's a fascinating time in American politics but it's one of reasons why I Do what I Do because it's so interesting but also to teach people\nAnd they used to tell my my students I really don't care I'm really don't care [laughter] what you think I hear that you think if I can encourage people to be more interested about what they're talking about to read another article to dig deeper to challenge themselves\nThey will in turn create a better outcome for the rest of us and I tell my students I don't care who you vote for I just care that you vote but if you don't vote understand that's also a vote in itself because you are saying I'm not I'm not doing that I I vote none of the above and it's\nAnd that's and that's tabulate in aggregate itself just like a boat will and that people do that doesn't make any sense\nActually it does if you don't show up for something the two political parties going to try to get you to show up next time\nTo a of a family I was at a baseball game with and they were so upset or I just can't stand voting and I've been talking about\nIf they had an earned your vote don't vote and tell them that you don't\nPut it on social media like he would anyone else anything else so I'm not voting you haven't earned my though you haven't got me off my couch off my dogs\nTo go down and say I'm voting for this person you don't register it'll aggregate data and that raw data collection and is dissected by the political class to determine what they want to do and there and that in every election that swings on the undecided voter right the independent voter in October is like oh we're going to\nStop talking about these issues that motivate our base to a degree are going to focus on these oh I'm really happy to work with the other side received this now and in certain cats I work with the president why it shows up at the polling independence\nAnd they

noticed there was in for for decades and so we have we have a great friendship and I am looking forward to having all these costs calling today stir up the conversation on big go a little deeper going deeper today in politics we're going to go deeper dive in not just you know the public polling the top on numbers but\nHow those posters got to those numbers who are they listening to who are they calling and why are they calling because it's a very different\nWhen a university does a polling like CRISPR Newport you'll hear ... talking about this they start with a very broad universe um and it keeps coming down to a smaller University of actual likely voters\nTwo minutes\nWe'll get to that will get into the nitty gritty we'll we'll get you take you do a deeper dive so when you look at the polls when you go to Chris\nBut I guess it's healthier than other websites right [laughter]\nThis is a healthy Internet ah it's it's a\nA ... you look at these different polls and and you got like let's just take a look at the uh\nThe the polls on um the generic ballot it's insane but what the what we're looking at here called up its it's fascinating like generic ballot all this track plus Democrats plus a Democrat suppose five Democrats plus eleven\nDemocrats possible having Democrats plus one what how do you get there\nSo you say the polling is wrong well pollens always right it's just data you're collecting other people call what the differences in the methodologies who you're going\nI talked to one leading I'm democratic source and I said okay what's your polling showing me and he said Democrats are around mid low thirties thirty four thirty three percent for that range Republicans\nWe'd never seen self identification for Republicans is while it's around twenty four percent and what used to be you know thirty four thirty four is now thirty four twenty four and independents are up around the lower mid forties\nHe goes Republicans have never been lower on self identification but we haven't picked up any of those voters they're all self identifying now and independence that is huge and when you get down to it with people when they understand what's really going on\nThat's when they get more excited and more engaged this is Chris X. men something for John Frederick it eight for you know five six or six stay tuned come on back [noise]\nAnd I'm a black how blessed I watch that happen in my life but also a what a what a blessing and it's just to be alive right to be able to uh just to experience at all and I'm Wondering I enjoy coming in during his radio show as I get to\nHopefully get people excited about politics I'm a good to govern their lives it is important you know we can't\nBreak down we have to work with each other to get good things that we should have the debate though we should have a vibrant vigorous debate that threaten moves the country forward um and we shouldn't be afraid to have that debate but we should have in a in a civil manner and I think today we see a a a lack of civility and more and more and that's difficult in my professional life I\nAm the executive director Virginia freed the foundation for research and economic education and uh uh were five or six racy sex and\nWere nonpartisan which is a great lane to be in these days because everyone is oh you know red or blue and I'm like okay good for you well you know aren't you might not really I don't have to be\nActually I'm paid macho [laughter] he'd been right oh yeah they get healthcare so [laughter]\nBut what we did was we represent businesses and uh we have a membership and what we tried to do is educate them on politics and as a former teacher and if I'm a business person to my family at the bottom\nYou know I I like getting people excited about learning about politics seeing it differently and what's that makes me there was aren't even deeper like you know when you when you go to teach the subject of better with other subjects you have to really get engaged in the subject so it's an every day I get to learn more and more about politics it's it's a it's an interesting topic\nBecause it brings in culture and a economics and history that was a history major and so I I get to bring out altogether because it manifest itself as Andrew Breitbart said in the last that last segment culture is down to the politics of downstream of culture so if you want to impact culture or their politics impact\nCulture first and foremost suffer your cultural legal leader you'll be you'll be a political year give us a call an eight four five six for six we got some great just calling into like a it's not just constant Rob Wittman but also the leaders of the two major parties here Virginia posters Clinton kid and Robin McDougal and then\nTwo operatives one from Iowa and one from New Hampshire we're only I hate to say this because you're probably sick and tired Iraq's has already in the midterms we are four hundred and Seventy two days away from the Iowa caucuses\nFour hundred and Seventy two now it seems like a long time but let's be honest as soon as this election is over you're going to\nStart hearing reports back from Iowa and New Hampshire and we're going to be at the forefront of that we're going to get calls here we're going to shoot up there with us of operatives that Republicans and Democrats to see what's going on the ground I think\nTrump's got the lock on the nomination you never know\nYou never know you never know goodness knows you never know with Donald Trump because um that that that's that's that's who knows what actually does what he says it says you can do what you never know what's gonna happen around him and I think that's one of the more interesting parts about politics today is because\nHe's brought that dynamic up ... or whatnot and that sort of with if you remember from your days in school or or at work you know when\nThe leader changes and it's like a substitute teacher wasn't going to be like your you know you get you get a new boss oh what's it it's a it's there's just the newness pen from since June fifteenth of twenty sixteen this has been a very different political dynamics are\nNot necessarily unhealthy because it has made us think and react differently and respond differently and I don't think that's necessarily on healthy ah but we do have to be ever vigilant to make sure it does not become too unhealthy and I think people are recognizing that we have uh some some discourse in this country\nOr they can be improved we can get better at that as a people and how we do that is every day one on one with each other you want to impact politics if you want better representation the better people comes down to um they represent us and if you want a that'd be better it's up to us to get better so it was called an eight\nFour five six or six we'll talk about polls goodness knows was more calls and I don't know what to do with these days the generic ballot what I pay attention\nTo first and foremost is what I check every guy I'm On the real clear politics they give you the um average of all the different polls and they break down to the individual polls I'm now call should be looking at what are called LPs likely voters\nHolding company should have an understanding of who they imagine are going to be showing\nSo that we should know who's actually voting I'm In Virginia in or you can always tell the Arlington because they're the tabulation their uh their absentee ballots some friends of mine that are tracking that to see what kind of um who's voting relative to the last round of elections to see what the intensity is what we look at the er the averages\nOf the generic ballot them or this is why I Do this is why I Do that in twenty Seventeen when governor Ralph Northam defeated at the last ... he won by eight point nine\nThree percent a point nine three points the generic ballot on that day was nine point one hit bottom trying to instruct the class what do you want to follow Fox News writer as Ross marching CNBC\nEmerson Maris Quinnipiac Wilder Paul Paul a critter Newport which one you will follow follow generic ballot right now because of that it that is fairly proximity\nTo what happened last year and the year before and twenty sixteen you're looking generic ballot in twenty sixteen it was very close it was like the\nTide and Republicans over performed on election day by about a point and they want and the generic congressional ballot I'm obviously Trump lost by about three points a nationally three million votes um\nSo that's something to consider when you're saying okay we're just going to go I think I think the the objective view here is look at the generic ballot look at the average and you can pretty much extrapolate\nWhere it is right now if election they were held today and because it's on that basis it it takes away the the partisan lines you might have or a would be inclined to nine point one percent\nThe dams one fight point nine nine point one eight or nine that's very close and they are at seven point six\nRight now it is safe to assume\nThat they will not perform as well as they did in twenty Seventeen but still will win unlikely when the house of representatives given the\nThe dynamics in the Senate very different because the individual races likely that Republicans are just hold on to the Senate what's the dynamic that if the Democrats have the house and Senate Republicans have the Senate what's gonna happen the next two years and that's how you can sort of figure out where this thing is going\nSo you can understand what you need to do or not\nTo like myself I don't watch cable news I don't watch broadcast Missouri papers in the mornings Washington Post ... times Wall Street journal and I get my information what's going on in the economy in politics and culture and whatnot and Mary lumps don't listen to you know the of the national\nTalk radio shows I go to work right you know I I Do with my eyes I see what's going on and I think most voters\nDo that if you look at the numbers of you know the Fox news or the world and the MSNBC is it's a very small subset of the American population but they're the they're the most active\nVoters they are the their the activists so those shows are pretty much you're broadcasting to the activists about what they want to hear about the next few points that they're they they they're supposed to pay someone you're white\nGraham or whatever they're very different social media platforms you see directly repetition of\nThe message and you're like wow I I go to a town\nHall after I got like a congressional panel was from my friends you know if there was no Congress and we're sitting next to mine and I watch them and take questions from the audience and like we're getting information it's fundamentally wrong but they're really upset I mean angry not pleasant not understanding\nBut what\nDo they show up for this show up because they're angry they are concerned but more important than like anyone else in the world who just wanted to hurt right how important\nIs that in a conversation to hear what the other person is is really feeling it gets down to okay what is what what is what is making your data ... oh 'cause there's no no no no that's\nThat's the operative subject matter what is triggering this fear and when you get down into the nuts and bolts you you really can understand why people do what they do and hopefully get them to a better place than station watching is not easy to do but it's a\nIt's just what we do it in a democracy and the Republican form a democracy which we have in America thank God I'm\nSo we can just\nLive more peacefully amongst each other governors self self governance extremely important historical and concepts and I think we've lost\nSight of that a little bit it's easy to 'em but more importantly it's tougher for folks to point out to be what we can do better you can do better call down we got this I mean are are you have too many TV channels and I do you have too many options are they are too\nMany restaurants and grocery stores around you is it too good are you afraid you're gonna lose all this to me it's it's crazy", "show_name": "Dennis Prager Show", "year": "2018", "city":
