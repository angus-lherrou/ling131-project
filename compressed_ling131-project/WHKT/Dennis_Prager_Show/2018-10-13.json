I was a vehemently opposed to Patriot Act one\nSon of the Patriot act when it's sunset it you were a lonely voice in the U.S Senate I remember you did the filibuster for some time in opposing in questioning\nOr the ... the Patriot act you were right uh then you are right now I was right then I'm right now we're just so my audience knows\nThis whole Pfizer thing a with Carter Page and a easy dropping on the Trump campaign and the phone he finds that warning none of that could have happened without the Patriot act that set up\nAnd you were the ones that said you keep covering giving government this unlimited power\nUp surveillance and its eventually going to come around and bite you in the bud center that's exactly what happened\nBut I had the same very strained conversation yesterday\nWith the record the FBI because I asked him point blank\nArgued gathering information including the president's phone calls and of course he fired and said oh I Can't answer that they're setting and the answer for my answer yes there was an article about two or three years ago saying they're recording Fifteen hungry to President Obama's\nDon't call and then they minimize ham which means takes over to mark his name now but is it to tell when President Obama or President Trump was talking to a foreign leader here their\nTheir voices [noise] even if you're minimize or in a parked outside and you can't tell her the voices are but we shouldn't be doing now we're listening to members of Congress is conversations were listening to journalists conversations businessmen and women conversation\nWithout a jacket is Warren and my point to him was in I think he didn't understand it didn't used to understand it is [noise] if you're recording things on potential terrorists from overseas to how it goes really apply it\nThere but if they're talking to Americans or just random people are talking to American when you do get constitutional protections because many phone calls art discussions with terrorists in fact the vast majority of innocent international phone calls\nAnd so we have had this discussion with them and uh it should be protected by the constant back some say the Fourth Amendment John Adams says the spark that led to the revolution when you're like the British soldiers coming into our houses you know breaking down there to work for the stamp tax [noise]\nAh we really wanted protection that we wanted to say the government and never come to your house or take any progress\nConversations are belonging without talking to a judge first\nWell and that's a that's why you were so adamantly opposed to when you were a predictor of the future when this whole thing\nSenator uh you've also been a very strong voice on the disappearance of juvenile to show the there's a lot of talk about what should be done and we want more information\nAnd like I get that but as a member of the Foreign Relations committee you're the only senator that has proposed action which is until we get answers on his disappearance because\nSenator thing is we haven't videotape showing that he went in there is nobody will take joined the he went out and I'm a crown prince NBS Mohammed the common sense the camera footage was corrupt or the battery went dead\n[laughter] can't really Kennedy by that is like\nThe dog ate my homework or I didn't get ever ready battery and so the battery died now you have more immediate suspension of ah the arms sales to the Saudis until we get some kind of a satisfactory answer can you elaborate on that sir\nI think everybody should remember that Saudi Arabia is the largest state sponsor of radical Islam around the world what I mean by that or if they had been funding for\nMcGraw authors in Pakistan in the Philippines even in the United states teaching critical west hatred of Christianity and teaching radical violent jihad this is here to stay out of your car we shouldn't be selling a weapon simply because of drought\nFifteen of the Nineteen hijackers who came here were from Saudi Arabia Saudi Arabia is a big part of our terrorism problem they funders of terrorism and teaching of radical Islam around the world this latest episode\nI I Know that this could have happened without there being an thought to private planes were team guys on\nOn some of them have been linked to Saudi services in intelligence I'm now it

crime the\nFragments of the bomb if you're saying you know America and so we have to realize that reaction there's certain and that's a blowback\nFrom us being involved in some ... gotten civil war a is one that we actually create more terrorists there is there other possible thing that's going to happen\nAgain or what happened in Libya when we talk will cut off\nWe got a house and more terrorism it became a breeding ground for terrorism my\nFear is that there is some remnants are fairly fairly strong record of al ... and yet we're not fighting down that we're a mixture stricter civil war between the who the salaries and also with Iranian influence as well but my fear is that the chaos\nAnd that you get the rise of al ... the same thing happened in Syria is that civil war that we got involved in centered in the house you got the rise of ISIS\nWill actually uh the network that I go on June near a couple about a month ago was reporting that al Qaida fighters were actually given safe haven a by the by the Saudi forces in Yemen in ... in in order to find out who these so\nCalled this wouldn't it wouldn't be surprised if it goes through to the Saudis support in Syria they support her down and use round which is essentially an offshoot of al carrier so the Saudis are all these\nPoor people who hate America who have years ago who had a western ways and yet we found a big arms to

people surrounding him are acting job to offer and you know part of the traditional foreign policy around here which is go stay forever and bankrupt America\nSenator pull the president has invested a lot of political capital in the Saudis and it was the first place that he went in his first foreign visit a NBS came the United states he did his media\nTour within the Saudis spend a ton of money on media ... as you know uh in in in the swamp\nAnd so he's put a lot of uh and and you know we kind of look the other way when NBS rounded people up jailed them in that hotel whatever they did\nThis the
