know me John I have a good time so if they it's just it's amazing that last week she pretty much apologizes for marginalizing veterans says she's going to stick to issues then she puts out a commercial or calling me an extremist and trying to make fabricated things up again this is what the left does\nTheir own hands it's desperate poised by desperate candidates and that's why common sense is back that's why conservatism is back and that's why I'm going to win the fifth\nCommonsense backing I'm your commander of commonsense Dennis ... without running for Congress step district Virginia let's get to the caravan I'm the president with my later today saying he's going to deploy\nA thousand troops he's got to do with series of executive orders that would stop the caravan from coming into the United states the problem is as soon as they step forward and say the word asylum we can't do anything or who all of the loop holes in them Denver are written in such a way\nThat all they have to do was get a toe in get their\nHand grab and say asylum and\nThen we can't do anything they cannot go back what are you seeing the president's proposed action here if you're in Congress now what would Denver Riggleman the proposing on the terror that\nWell you know we're a rule of law and uh we're we're we're a nation of laws and we believe in the rule of law and the way the laws were written right now you're exactly right John I don't know\nYou know how we we don't honor that based on what we believe as conservatives enroll in and people who follow the rule of law however I think Congress needs to start fixing these immigration laws as soon as possible and I also believe once that happens are vetting process for any of these people that are coming through has to be extreme vetting\nUh we do have some of the technology in place now but we don't put time limits on this if there's that many people that are headed towards the border\nUh we don't know what's in better than those in John my biggest fear um it's easy you know it's like a Trojan Horse right listen Ninety five percent Ninety nine percent of those people could actually be seeking asylum um does that you know our hearts sort of go out to ... with compassion however\nIf you have people inside there that are bad actors and they're able to hide you know within this caravan we have to\nDown range I think we're going to be monitoring him I guess as I can only speculate right now my guess is we'll have joint operations\nWith Mexico on monitoring this caravan of seeing any type of missions that are coming out of there talking about radio emissions or any kind of been told that we can glean this is not a good situation this is not good and at some point I think we have to fix or immigration laws in a way that again are\nAre much more common sense than the sort of\nAs sort of ridiculous since we have now are going on on the border\nUm uh\nThe I think the concern that everyone has Denver is that okay there's twelve or Thirteen or fourteen thousand people we have to deal with it and uh everybody wants to be concerned everybody's concerned about the humanitarian aspect but a lot of my course here's what their concern with okay if they get in\nIf it's Fifteen thousand get then the next one is going to be a hundred and fifty thousand and you're not going to be able to stop that either because we'll never get a wall up in time and even if you have a while you got a hundred and fifty thousand people and this is a lot of people so um are you in favor of the\nPresident taking action now to stop these er visits a mob caravan from palm rushing\nThe border and coming in are you in favor of stopping them from coming in now\nYes yes I mean it's this is the mean this is a matter of national security\nOr it is a matter of precedent\nUm and again this comes back to that was a normal American will say hey you know we understand people want to come to the United states but there's a legal process [noise] um and we're gonna have to we're going to have to follow that legal process you know we we think that legal process used to be applied all immigrants and you and you're exactly right John\nThis would set a precedent that\nCould really be damaging to the United states' security\nTo our policies into our roller ball or you're right if the if we allow everybody in we're actually sort of acknowledging that open borders is what we want if we don't follow the rule of law and we don't stop these these migrants sadly we we have to stop all now from coming in and set a precedent\nDenver at about a in about five or ten minutes the U.S government is going to release the new economic numbers or GDP expected to grow again this quarter at\nSo over four percent that could be four point one four points to four points off a bomb was telling me was choking along in about a half a percent growth I mean this growth unprecedented where do you look for in that report\nAnd ... what's your clothes and you think you might draw out of it on the economy gender recommend\nWell the thing of first I'm going to look for [laughter] it's just because I'm\nI geek out on the stuff is I'm going to look at the specific whatever report that I have I Want to look at the number of jobs\nAre based on that are open right now and I look at Virginia but I also see where we are going as far as employment but GDP Growth I'm going to look at manufacturing I'm looking agriculture\nI Love looking into the numbers that grows dinners and continuing on this line John if we're continuing with the lowest unemployment claims and forty nine years of her continuing with us\nDo you know is amazing ah it's a new normal was too I mean this is pretty incredible\nOr if you're looking at all these numbers I think right now what you're saying is that the tax cuts were all the jobs report Mac worse opportunities zones can be lovers here in the in the commonwealth a ... and opportunities on investment\nAll the things that we look at to encourage opt entrepreneurship to encourage people keeping their own money is working and that's what I'm going to look at it this report is is this just a continuation\nOf this amazing amazing surge or\nWe seeing an even more positive future for the people in that district but also in the United states and in the commonwealth of Virginia I think we are I think we're just seeing the beginning of this economic boom and um I I'm really just really excited to see what those numbers say based on more job growth on what sectors are growing right now\nWhat kind of interesting to see these are coming out momentarily we expect that oh we're going to get over four percent growth and it's really really tough for a Democrat right now to talk about economics the economy or any of the issues that pertain to jobs and prosperity in America so they'd rather talk about something else that's why your opponent\nLovely Coburn is talking about your Halloween talk\nTo him because he doesn't want to talk about the economy she doesn't want to talk about job she doesn't want to talk about growth didn't want to talk about kids moving out of the basement doesn't want to talk about the boom and small businesses\nYou want to talk about the deregulation she doesn't want to talk\nAbout the number of investments that are going on because of the tax\nCut especially as it relates to one hundred percent deduction of\nCapital investment you didn't even understand it and so she doesn't want to do with any any of that she'd rather talk about your Halloween costume in two thousand five\nYeah and I mean which I Will not take down off and that by the way so here's what she would rather talk about she'd rather talk about ... trillion dollars in spending not only for Medicare for all but also for forgetting student debt right which is one point for a trillion dollars right now free community college for all are free college for all\nEverything she said and even in debate she was like I Want to give away this she doesn't understand the taxpayer money is what you're using I get so limited based on what I fought for you know in government overreach she says she loves government I fear government I think government should be limited I think government should be efficient she's also said that taxpayer money for the middle class\nIs nothing more than confetti she's comparing eyes to the Nazis I mean I I find it's stunning John get anybody would vote for Leslie\nHer views are great for San Francisco and maybe a three square mile area there or somewhere up in Georgetown right in DC but for the fifth district it's absolutely appalling\nThat she thinks he's values are actually applicable to the people to death if not every day and work for a living\nAnd don't give a rat's with the chattering class is saying on CNN or MSNBC or any of these other far left and they are now they're just they're just propaganda machines and I think at some point ah that's going to break through that you have comments you have this coalition of commonsense\nAgainst progress of candor is and I think that's what's happening in the fifth district and we're going to win this John because I represent American values I represent conservative values but I represent what the\n\n[noise] [noise]\n[noise]\n[noise]\n[laughter]\nShore positive no doubt absolutely don't worry\nIt when for the Democrats [noise] now it's slipping away by the very our it's slipping away Republicans in swing districts in Congress\nThose that were tied are moving ahead those that were slightly behind are moving the tide everything is moving in the ... direction or the Republicans were going to get the jobs report I jobs and economic report out today momentarily\nOut giving as\nSoon as I get it off the wire more economic growth studying more records in this great economy the Democrats can't run against the economy they can't run against Kavanaugh they can't run on caravans\nThey can't run on mobs they can't run against Trump's phenomenal economic agenda they can't run on foreign policy\nThey basically can't run on anything except Trump socks and you know what maybe you don't like his tweets but you love the new job you got and the love your new car you got one of the best lines\nEver is our neighbor or neighbor was great really nice lady

that happen [noise]\nThey're not even waiting for the FBI to investigate where the bombs are coming from before they start blaming President Trump declared President Trump guilty responsible for the whole thing they're not waiting for the FBI to investigate these are the same people that three weeks ago\nSaid we cannot do anything until the FBI finishes its investigation\nSo I mean they were total hypocrites it it is absolutely here responsible or beyond counterproductive it's it's absolutely you're responsible for them to be saying this is all about because of the President Trump or they're they're trying they're trying to score political points office which\nYou have to ask who benefits from these bombs that's all I'm not saying who did it and it's obviously some crazy person

everybody's got to calm down take a breath and ah I think Sarah Sanders had it right\nWe should be coming together the president is calling for unity dialing down the rhetoric\nA and the Democrats are going in the opposite direction they're they're they're blaming the president unequivocally no question about it taking no responsibility whatsoever\nFor calling the guy look at this guy Brennan said

down let's we got we we have the FBI on the case unless this guy was a ... or ... or ... bought or whatever you know what ever\nEntered the it was they created these packages and less that entity was a very very very sophisticated person\nOr a boat and by the end if they were very sophisticated they were able to cover their tracks but considering the number of packages delivered to these various places coming out of one place\nIs there a lot of clues there and I'm confident that the FBI will be able to figure something out here and find out who did it more narrow it down and the fact that they use Debbie Wasserman Schultz as a return address\nThat's kind of interesting in itself Debbie Wasserman Schultz is the one who was forced to step down\nFrom head of the Democratic National Committee\nA because she had been reading the system for Hillary against Bernie I don't know what that means but it's sort of an interesting clue you know maybe somebody thought that was funny to use her name out all the bombs [noise] I don't know\nUh but my corners this unless this was a very sophisticated operation that they knew a how to cover their tracks at every step of the way you've got twelve packages now\nThat the FBI is investigating let's wait for the FBI to figure this out to come up with something yeah why not wait before you start and why not why are they not waiting because they want to politicize it\nThe Democrats are missing no opportunity to score political points on this\nWell it's uh it seems it just seems odd to me that that all this is happening\nBut luckily I mean that's where everybody's saying let's wait meantime let's get to let's get the the economy will get to the Taliban invasion after the bottom of the hour a\nBut let's get to the new economic numbers that just came out the gross domestic product GDP growing another three and a half percent now let me just say what this means right that's the first time that we have had back to back quarter a in\nLong time a hold of over three and a half percent growth back to back and consumer confidence uh up at an all time I can do or spending was four percent another great a quarter of economic growth this\nOr the growth so what are they talking about\nAre they talking about they talk about they've got this wonderful thing to talk about this horrible thing to talk about here with the with the bombs and they talk about the permanent teeth again they're falling in they don't realize they're falling into a trap and and it's their own tropic crop of their own making\nPeople don't want to hear the Democrats talk about the president they want to hear Democrats Republicans the politicians in Washington talk about what they're what the politicians are going to do for them to make their life better write\nWhat I I I go to work every day I got a family to support\nI got a job I'd like to get a wave what are you going to do to make that happen how are we going to make my life better easier make me rich uh make make make my kids you know healthier\nTalking about President Trump talking about you're a Native American DNA doesn't do that [laughter]\nDo that\nTalking about President Trump are causing the bomb scare doesn't do that so they're going back to the for the last two years all they've been talking about as President Trump is a Russian agent and now they're President Trump as a Russian agent who Craig creates bomb scares I mean\nThey're they're they're not doing themselves any favors\nA date and on the other side I mean it very very clear jobs now mobs a President Trump and the Trump Administration have created the best economic conditions in this country in in a generation it's the best we've seen in ten Twenty years\nAnd that is goes along the way that that answers peoples' questions what have you done for me lately you've gotten me a job you've gotten me a raise you've gotten my kids on food stamps gotten my kids out of the basement\nThere on their own now great thank you very much\nLet me ask you something I'm going to pose this question and then you're going to answer it when it gets back so stay with us for another segment got to get the by the hour but I'm here\nTo ask you when you get back you know you and I were Trump Tower for the last two weeks in the campaign don't you feel the same it's almost like deja vu all over again I mean [laughter] I mean\nI could shut my eyes and go back to two thousand sixteen and it's the same thing we always think told everybody telling us Trump couldn't when it was all it was all you know whatever it was that he was going through at the time with the Access Hollywood they were doctors radio network I'll be right back I'll go way\nPeople coming out of the woodwork coming out of the hills coming out of the bally's coming out of the towns coming out of the farmers come into focus\nYeah there is a feeling of danger here all of these national generic ballot polls are meaningless play a lot of national elections\nOther they're all like I mean it's all the polls\nI've been talking all day about the Washington Post poll that came out yesterday that\nShows Jennifer ... than it had a Barbara Comstock urging his tend to just replace Thirteen look white person might when she should choose the favorite no doubt that's a very tough for district for the Republicans are when barb it's tough\nBut every internal poll that the Republicans have from the White House to the end or the scene to Barbara on down\nShows the race ... why does not have any Thirteen point link but this is what the Washington Post jobs they get a uh\nThey get a ridiculous methodology to get a fake told to get a fake analysis of it did you fake news to get a fake conclusion drawn so they can continue on with their fake narrative and like we've already been down this path so now I'm going to start calling them on how ridiculous it isn't they're doubling down let's just say no\nThat's why the way

the kingdom a he's a regular I hate the Sherlock Holmes man this guy he didn't expect or cholesterol virus\nAll one wow I mean what great investigation that is this your mouth to show he thing for the kingdom of such an absolute joke it is and it's just a a bumbling it's bumbling and here's the deal and I said this on\nAlgeria yesterday I don't know what the president's going to do about this we're going to do something that's number one number two whatever he does he's got to consult the secretary of state Mike Pompeo he tried to console Gina Haspel but they're going to do something they have to do something you have to react to this now\nI don't think he's going to cancel the arms deal because he said look I got to deal with that it's economically benefiting the country and if I can see what they're simply going to buy the weapons from China or Russia so why would I Do that here's the other people said oh the president's position\nHad a position [noise] other than he discovered the idea of scrapping the arms deal everything\nElse is on the table including withdrawing our support from the Saudi Emirates coalition and again and he said well war so everything else on the table so to say that well his position keeps changing he hasn't had a position he started commentary what'd you devolve\nBased on new facts to come out and the Saudis have changed their story temp jobs did they change it again yesterday and no change it again tomorrow as more facts to come out so I\nDon't understand what they're saying the president has changes ... doesn't have a position he's waiting for the facts to commit perjury trap it's not a politician he's a businessman here's our businessmen make decisions back numbers spreadsheets and Matt\nSo as the facts come in and the mathematical equation gets put together his commentary evolved as information changes that is what are you supposed to do\n\nThe end of the day I don't know what the final outcome of the U.S reactions you got to be but I've been saying this all week in the middle middle Middle East on TV this president does it take well to being lied to and I don't think there's any doubt\nCrown prince Mohammed bin Solomon like ...\nI don't think that goes over well with President Trump he doesn't like being lied to here's the other thing doesn't like dealing with an incompetent people he doesn't have a lot of patience\n\nAnd I'm telling you crown prince\nMohammed bin Salman is incompetent everything the guy at thirty three years old has gotten involved in has been a complete undone mitigated disaster for the Saudi kingdom so eventually the father just\nHave to say you know what my son has been a top rated bumbling fool and I got to put somebody else in\nThe country to delete because it's capable of being king because he does stupid stuff including this assassination allegedly\n\nThe Saudis have now ... that'll just on a final story they're saying but that's going to change again\n\nSo who knows what the uh to showcase has here's what it's tough it is really brought renewed focus\nThe Saudi Emirates tactics and they support that we're giving them and getting involved in the Yemen's civil war which is causing a horrific very disturbing very growing humanitarian\nCrisis where I just got to tell you this um on algebra zero every day I see the pictures you do see because uh the fake news networks today they don't want to show your real news they want to talk about you know president\nSee the pictures on TV and I'm and it'll really tear out your stomach you've got children just starving I mean they can eat that they they got mother's stripping park from trees bark and boiling it just matching it up so there's\nSomething in there and it's and there's some in the grass\nOr there's no food\nI mean just think about how to get your child you're sitting there and they starve to death I mean think about how that feels then make this thing is is a horror show it is worst in the area it's worse than anything I've seen and our involvement in it\nIs shameful and it's absolutely shameful\nAnd if there's anything that's got to come out of the show ... fair uh\nWe're going to get the hell out of there as well should it just it it's\nHorrific that the United states is involved in something of this nature all because you know we've got the Iranian bogeyman with their Nineteen speed boats or whatever they have I don't know if you get the phone lines Mike in Oakland Europe you're on the\nHey good morning John yep I agree with you on the other thing I think you're exactly right about that so um I I Do know that comes out with this anything good can come out of this\nThing I think that'd be good but [noise] I have to point out though the irony or something you said just a few minutes ago I'm sure you didn't\nPick up on it 'cause you don't agree but um you know you said the president or the the two things he doesn't like he doesn't like to be lied to and he doesn't like incompetent\nAnd I I Can't help but think he must be he just wants to all that to him so\n[laughter] I'm sure he likes to lie to us and I feel that he's in competing for the job so [laughter] just doesn't want to share those two things with others [noise]\nWell I guess uh I guess you think this tremendous economic renaissance and there's forming tremendous economy we have an all these jobs I guess you think that's the old work governed confidence I guess you'd think the fact that we haven't heard from ISIS from that\nThey've been kicked kicked out of the majority of their caliphate and they they now only can throw a tiny\nPart of terror tore yet when he took over it was a master it might get you think that's on top and it's I guess you'd think that the fact that the wacko when North Korea has not done a nuclear test since she threatened that might get you think that's the top of that\nI get your take all these new jobs we have in the fact that we just keep going up in the confidence and there was a tax cut and you figure that's an\nConfident so I guess your nice definition of incompetence Mike uh it it it's just a little bit different\nI guess it is a you know some of those things could have happened whether he was in office are not\nSure that's the problem I mean I we don't want one I knew someone\nWho is competent was in that position what kind of position we would be an\nThank you for straightening yeah is your father economy Obama leaves office at this point\nMoving things everything\nFrom [noise]\n[laughter] like I got to go but thanks for
