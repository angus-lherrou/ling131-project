don't hate and we kind of have to hit I was going to happen I hate to say All right let's get to a few clips here Mike I'm Barbara Comstock\nFor for a start coming up at eight thirty five a vice president Mike Pence cut three vice president Mike Pence since it's important for the world to know the truth when it comes to finding out what happened to Saudi journalist your mouth to sharply cut three pets\nI'll be speaking to secretary failed later today [noise]\nI Know is that meaning Saudi Arabia [noise]\nAs a president said we're going to get to the bottom of [noise]\nWe need to know who was responsible for all those\nBut he was a member of a free and independent press [noise]\nOf violence plants alive [noise]\nThe president and I are stretched\nThat those responsible are held to account\n[noise] uh that is very sober response here very salient from the vice president and ah let's now go to Senator Rand Paul from Kentucky was on my show just the other day a not a fan of the Saudis as you know but um I\nTake would rent pollsters very seriously because I've been in a lonely battle for very long time\nAlong with Walter Jones and some others to get out of Afghanistan get out of the Yemen's civil war\nTo get out of these foreign entanglements that you know I'm a non intervention less than I Believe we are should be involved in any of the stuff but uh that's just me let's go to Rand Paul here might cut for from Kentucky saying that they shouldn't be chase is proof that the u._s. should not\nArm the Saudis cuts for\nWell I'm I'm Glad to hear that he's kind of around ... provide on Saudi Arabia\nFor over crowding trying to get Congress to\nSending arms to Saudi Arabia and so far it's been I either that or it's important to remember that Saudi Arabia is the largest state sponsor radical Islam they fun tens of thousands of Mr authors around the world Pakistan\nIndia Indian some opinions all peachy hatred of America they been doing this for decades there or not our friend [noise]\nAnd um they come up there doing the gambling is a catastrophe humanitarian disaster so this latest episode was killing the journalist is just you know that we do not can be arming them\n[noise] you know\nAs I said\nYou're not going to sweep this on the carpet not with Rand Paul and Lindsey Graham now you got to remember thinking about this alliance yeah and that's why you to me and you can do and my other competitors in and they can be talking about what's in\nThe local paper eating their ... with their people bringing up stuff and the ... to the typical nonsense they do one WNBA your W and I asked or whatever my other competitors are or you can be with me and you can get this kind of analysis this is why this was not going away let me just tell you watch the understand because they got a lot of text about\nYou know somebody just takes it in if he was a plumber when the matter here's why it's not going away when you have an alliance\nOf policy\nThis magnitude between Senator Rand Paul who like me\nIs a non intervention was and wants to get us out of all these foreign entanglements suspect in the military industrial complex wants to get out of Afghanistan out of Yemen out of all these wars and he is aligning himself on this issue with Senator Lindsey Graham\nFrom South Carolina who is a Neal Khan who is a military industrial complex supporter who is in favor of a muscular foreign policy around the globe as you know and you\nAs senators to agree on an issue of this magnitude it's not going away does that make sense if he had just Rand Paul and Walter Jones right that will be one thing if you had Lindsey\nGraham on the other side that will be one thing but when you have two people that as far as\nForeign muscular foreign policy Neal conservatism entanglements Paul and Graham come into alignment on an issue or like they're both coming at it from very different angles\nThis is a very powerful coalition in the Republican caucus of us that and Graham's not messing around Rand Paul's not messing around\nAnd so you just heard what Mike Pence said he's not messing around I'm telling you it doesn't matter if he was a journalist or a plumber a day of reckoning is going to come and they did this to themselves\nI got to be laughing for five hours just just just just like it didn't two thousand sixteen at a Trump Tower at the Hilton when he was he was going to be fun so I'm really looking forward to it and ah anyway joining us now Barbara Comstock hey Robert great to have you with us\nGetting marketing greatness anyway\nOkay so let me ask you this um proper the Democrats are saying that you voted for President Trump Ninety eight percent of the time and they're trying to tie in with that which I think it's a good thing I voted for him a hundred percent of the time he voted for Ninety eight I think that's pretty good but the majority of those votes were nonpartisan votes right so explain that\nYeah well you know the proud\nAnd thank you for asking that study every time we talked about this we said have you looked at the ... pretty much how you feel about the president or not\nBut you really do is look at what a good pilot for the American people and certainly for my constituents eighty two percent I'd be tells that bipartisan push that\nYour listener I haven't heard that you have a ... they're hearing for the first time to get the practice in covering that and federal\nWhat's included but first there are six pills to cut your taxes don't you think can tell that aren't bipartisan because Democrats want to raise your taxes and cut them so will make that departure that I Am going to cut your taxes my comment is already prominent to raise them\nTake away that child tax credit of two thousand dollar raise rates that everybody you know now it'd be devastating to our great economy that you know going so well right now but the other day on that score card\nLocal arriving sheriff Lebanese rebels basements red tape Fernandez eleven that was probably part of that in the bell I could keep the government open and to fully fund our military the funny thing is like the opioid crisis\nIs tiny medical research at an early age you know what we're doing that great amount of finding ... on cancer research diabetes because they are a great investment that not in the Republican Party nor the president or getting credit for and that results that we've done on a bipartisan basis\nYou know it also has things like my style you get to a criminal alien gang members out of the country\nAfter they stopped by sterile you know people want something done dealing with school violence my opponent and failed on everything else he's put forward on that issue when you've had three dealt with the president has signed it here that are caused by like you know helping get\nThe background check system updated and then my project safe neighborhood fell on and then there are things that my opponent opposes a party can enter and the press that want to report they throw out that number and they just want you\nTo death and attacking saying no to everything but the good policy making our country stronger economically or national security and it takes place to live here it policy in\nThe paper said the great thing I resent\nSo let's let's make this comparison congresswoman the Jennifer ... who was one of the most liberal state senators are in the nominee\nRated number one this year liberal and raising their taxes are Catholic out burger Jennifer ... is supporting people I have seen it all that and I can't say\nWell look at the end of the day they're all supporting your because like you know but you know spanberger has taken six hundred thousand dollars of her money\nYou're not going to take a half million dollars over that and then say oh I'm going to vote for somebody else and by the way there is nobody knows\nWhat the whole thing is a ruse if the Democrats take over and plus you said this over and over and over but they take over by one vote she has the votes in the courts to be speaker and the whole thing about not voting for her if you're a Democrat is a complete ruse\nSo let's get to let's get your record which is really what are the ... campaign is challenging now\nThey're saying look a Barbara Comstock runs around saying she votes independently\nShe voted in favor of the district a but look we look at the record she's voted Ninety seven point seven this the times for Trump but let's give a couple of examples where he went the other way let's start with salary increases for federal workers explaining\n[noise] gotten the pay raises for federal employees get wet taught in the Trade Center and it turns out the budget for federal employees which I happen to think it's a good thing\nSchumer which would hurt our federal employees are off so that nobody either written fifty million dollars for every year but also pressing for reform my opponent and it's going to be\nBipartisan leadership in the Washington area\nFor the first time in decades if I'm not there to fight a war are we going to be a Republican is going to strike and I think it's going to be how majority off but we certainly know according to be some majority so\nAt least one Republican in there fighting kind of reach for Dallas Airport as I can make sure the airport was protected\nBy the term extra money or something with our federal employees but also our whole defense industry my opponent has not had any relation\nFairly are standing on business and it's and it's just such an important part of our economy but also our national security at the national security debate the primary ... Democrats\nHe said well yeah I really don't know much about any of that [laughter] until I got certainly true but there was a vital part of our local economy and I got that kind of experience and so I think that the region and when you talk to\nSomebody who has both relationships with destruction as well as relationships with are very diverse economy and including the science technology\nAgriculture which you know or the western part of the district which has a large agriculture sector also\nWere with Barbara Comstock congresswoman construct she represents the district of Virginia that's the northern you're going from a Westerner Fairfax to Winchester she's running for third term her democratic opponent Jennifer Wexton or the most liberal state the most liberal state senator\nOr in common that well they will not come on a show it's generally free to answer any legitimate question I suppose I don't I don't really have any idea but you can't find her anyway or Barbara let me\nGet there's you know in Westchester they major political event you know for decades\nUm it's hot and not in the valley chamber she's kept out of ... and this is something that you know Democrats and Republicans alike all gone to their local Democrats city council people when they were very frustrated\nThat things are getting turning up but that sort of just\nTo stay in that even Democrats have nowadays you know she didn't show up at any of the county fairs where you really need to talk with our agricultural community and there is there you have to understand the entire district not just\nOn her part is that she spends her time with this is the resistance crowded it but you know they're the ... the rape threats report in town and you know it's getting raped threats\nDown in front yard trashed they already drive over it's fine and you know they're afraid to put up a sign that made it very well\nYeah I like them to train the crowd I don't believe God I have some ability here regardless of what Hillary Clinton by the way how\nFar along with you know they are appears to have a gym or anything like that as a part of the crowd and when you need to have\nSome artists in leadership here in our region\nWell congresswoman there's no question the angry mob mentality that are going around the country right now is very concerning to a lot of people\nAs you said in our tolerance or senator from Maine getting death threats rape threats are now we find out that ah somebody allegedly sent 'em a poison powder to her home in Maine where her family lives I mean all the stuff that's just beyond the pale it it's it's it's it's beyond the pale and that is going to stop\nBecause there's you know until until the until the Democrats are condemn this that and Bernie Sanders comments like halfway said well it's not a good idea\nBut you know you've got to Hillary Clinton coming out saying look we're fighting for the Republican so we we got to get rid of all these Republican so\nYou can be on civil I mean as long as they can do and it it's going to keep happening until they stop I mean it's ... it's I Know you're a student history it reminds me of the sixty eight campaign Humphrey Nixon and walls and you're\nProbably too young to remember like me a much older than you but but I can I Can't bring Richard Nixon had a big lead

this question here yesterday apparently according to Newsweek Mitch McConnell said that we need to cut Social Security and Medicare and he said that in spite of what\nThe government weighing on the surface you trust to point non tree and governmental\nDebt and the money that would the Medicare trust uh you know and conquer Whitman a you know more brown fat or Comstock\nOr we don't see how to get an answer out anything about paying back the money that they took out the Social Security trust and I want to point out while they're trying to on the style burger brat debate two nights ago oh da da\nDa da da da to the to the ah sixty miles that Donald Trump did during his campaign was Scott Kelly\nOr Donald Trump promised health care for all Donald Trump promised he was going to take care of everybody and a question about how you go to court explained that that interview Scott Kelly is available on YouTube crawl you want to see it\nAll along with the uh other campaign promise on you were trying to defend with [noise]\n[noise] get the money from Mexico to pay for the wall only going to cost ten to twelve billion [noise] one of the promise that people are forgetting about Republicans promised to for seven years [noise] ever going to repeal and replace Obamacare\nThings aren't fair for me to ask about the promises that Republicans are made over and over again to John [noise]\nWas the number one on the seven year Republican promise to repeal or replace Obamacare Republicans ...\nThey lived through the tea\nThat's what they did they lied they went and lied and then they got your money and they lied and they sent you a donor letters and they lied and they never had a plan they never had anything right they voted to repeal and replace it when they know they had no replacement and it would get vetoed and couldn't get through the Senate so they liked\nLiar liar pants on fire a\nPresident Trump's assumed they had a plan they had NO PLAN and\nWhen Trump tried to get a plan together itself through and John McCain voted no so he did not deliver on that promise now he's the dismantling\nThe pieces of bombing here that people don't like no question about that but I'm Republican as wide as far as the wall is concerned uh 'cause I think you brought up poor things let me get the third one uh use me but Mexico is paying for the wall\nBecause we renegotiate NAFTA deal much to our advantage and those towers and that money that is coming in has got to go to the wall\nNobody that had a brain in their head ever thought that the Mexicans were going to ship over any a truckload of gold into the into Fort Knox\nOr they were going to give us money in their treasury so the way is paying for it is by a renegotiating bad trade deals that were cost us hundreds of hundreds hundreds of billions of dollars and so they they are paying for it and the ... I think the first thing is that is entitlement\nAnd what McConnell said a\nPresident Trump and Trump's ... campaign and said he would not touching tournaments and he's not\nAnd if the if you probably can send him a bill to reform entitlements\nAnd cut back payments or eliminate people the president was detail it so the whole the whole issue of debt and uh the Social Security fund and everything else that's that's got to be addressed but as far as cutting entitlements and this president has been very clear from the day got on the campaign trail\nAnd that was a covenant between people and Social Security recipients\nAnd he would not cut that and he has it and if McConnell doesn't he'll veto it and he can't yet and overriding retail so they're going to have to come up with a comprehensive entitlement reform but cutting it is not part of the president's America First Trump ... agenda\nThe federal and put a hole in\nThe U.S and Mexico has jumped more than ten spots on the economic development where the international editor now number eleven we've made in Mexico rich with trade billions and billions of dollars millions of jobs\nAnd yet we still have twenty two million people in this country illegally the majority of the Mexican Chinese hacking Mexico or Mexican people I'm just saying we've made in Mexico way richer than it was and we still have an informed from Mexico so like we're not getting anything out of this [noise]\nJust for these radio network you're Godzilla of the truth in America great to have you with this\nKind of a lot of fun or Tucker Carlson a little clip there and he's got a good point when during the summer during live in the United states one way or the other legally are illegal wanted to hear what you give me the money or because he gets you know corruption is what the finance new instead it's the corruption stupid all these countries are corrupt\nAnd now the new buzz word for the open borders crowded economic refugees neither economic reputation well there's four billion economic refugees\nAcross the globe to do when it comes to the United states didn't housing get clothes and get free medical care get welfare again the bottom of phone\nGet a house get taken care of your blanket get food\nGet school and get an education for billion let's just let them on it and then there's no country it goes bankrupt and then you're like everybody every other bankrupt country I mean it's absurd argument their economic refugees well there's four billion economic refugees across the globe if you have a country or you don't\nThese open borders people they don't want any country this is the thing they don't want the country they don't want an America that and wanting to say\nThey just want open borders and I don't know what did they think this is what is going to come from but in the short term they'll have political power and then eventually their vision is because of that political power with all these four million people voting for them eventually that come here legally rule and vote yet be citizens\nAnd the company is bankrupt you don't have the link and then you'll have a pet that's really the society they want a handful of liberal elites wanting the territory that was once the United states\nLiving very high on the hog making all the decisions\nDrinking wine and cheese and caviar and flying around in helicopters with all kinds of guards spoke about gun control of the guards like crazy bodyguards armed guards tank trucks machine guns to all be protected\nAnd then everybody else will be fighting over food and there'll be the person I think it will rule over I mean that's what else\nCulture your government in bankruptcy the whites that out\nSo what other what other objective couldn't be then you have no country and the elites make all the decisions and they live in that matches with armed guards by the way\nThey have a hundred percent ... gun conscription except for their armed guards there they all have all against you can never need to protect them that's the liberal vision them their their legs they make the decisions average people too stupid to have a job\nAnd they'll go in a rush road there'll be food lines stand on line for an hour and you get a bowl of soup and a cracker\nAnd they'll provide it and if you're good to them you get a cracker and a half and that's their vision for you\nWould open borders I really can't think of what else to do the visual and the first thing people are going to actually making billions of dollars and they'll have their own island where the armed guards because of the cheap labor because then people work for you know a dollar a day\nThis is when this is what the open borders society is after some kind of a global order where the elites are protected and they were all over the pro military\n\n[laughter] I mean is there is there any other explanation could possibly happen this let's like Fifteen hundred people come into the United states and the caravan\nJust come in because their economic reputation who is not an economic refugee the entire African topped\nNet to come here every one of them and the economic refugees all of South America good the economic refugees four billion people that don't have\nThe luxury ... we after the economic grudges so we're just going and why is it this on the ballot\nAnd why aren't we talking about this and jobs in the economy and why are we talking about this other nonsense like the hooker I mean why are we talking about this it's unbelievable to me\nTalking about losing control of the Mets are Twenty one days out in the Republicans wanna when they should be talking about two things keeping the sovereignty of your nation\nSo that you have in America for your children because it is being absorbed in going away and the liberal don't want it they don't want an American they weren't open borders global society\n\nStormy Daniels don't care about Stormy Daniels I don't care about the porn actress I don't care that is thank God I don't care about any of this now did your mom to shock you\nThe international order of things and if you have sovereign governments you need an international or otherwise you go to open borders and they're talking about the Arnold constantly this one world government\nI mean I don't know what the liberals are trying to do here with the open borders I really don't get I get with Goldman Sachs is doing they wouldn't make as much money as it possibly can in the short period of time they can\nSo they can get all the money and buy an island and have guards and yeah\nI guess that but\nAnd I get in the short term so liberals want open borders and they get cheap cheap cheap labor but at some point\nIt breaks\nAnd then they have the power and that what do they do that while they go to\nSome other type of society I don't know a bomb and said he wanted to transform America maybe that's it maybe just transform it I Can't figure it out maybe somebody can help me eight eight eight for John ... you know John if there's no borders no country\n\nSo you got Fifteen hundred people you your your the cutter head off and then the military should go down at the border and not let them in because the consequence is the next time is fifty thousand not Fifteen hundred\nHalf of them are going to make it over on on income or\nThe other half will get apprehended and get caught and released why would the Fifteen hundred actually go back\nThe other don't show up and then they called her friends say I'm In I'm In wherever Denver here's my cell phone number oh this was from I bumped phone I guess you'd call for free and come over then the next week I got a house\nLike in the bottom of phone I got to\nFood stamps welfare kids were in

I'll do vote because of people I'm voting for will make sure that I stay here they I don't know who they are I Can't read English but I Can't read that day and that's that\nI don't know how to explain that maybe you've got a better a better answer to me I really don't know Nick in Virginia Beach because they couldn't agree more the open border crowd hates America see not all of them\nSome of them just want money\nGoldman Sachs lower Manhattan and a gangster banks jurors that support all the stuff they love America\nBut they love money more money rich money they want bigger bonuses how do they do that cheap labor higher stock prices fell off make money when America implodes\nThere are nearly and Goldman Sachs Wall Street lower Manhattan\nWashington lobbyists oh we'll have the money\nThey'll
