second I Can't wait to read it trumps enemies I Am not in that book is I'm not an enemy so I Can't I'm not going to find my name and their fact I'd be on the Trump's biggest supporters for when that comes out Cory up yesterday over the weekend the horrible shooting at a synagogue\nAnd we've got these pipe bombs that's crazy crazy people doing crazy things the fake news the Washington Post runs an editorial basically blaming Trump for all of this a number one what is your reaction to this\nTo me is you know I I Want to give a little credit to some of the media outlets over this weekend to call out the Washington Post on there disgusting not only their editorial but their head language appeared on Saturday mornings blamed little Trump or for the pipe bomb issues and Chris\nWallace from Fox News held up the newspaper it was it was the lead story on Saturday mornings and Chris showed it on Sunday and it said you know Trump supporter you know it's it's farming whatever it was it's amazing to me\nThe trail of some of the members of the mainstream media who want to blame the president for things that he has nothing to do with I don't ever recall John I'm not trying to pass the bunker or diverge here but I don't ever recall them saying you know Bernie Sanders supporter mowers down tries to kill two hundred\nMembers of Congress at a congressional baseball practice or you know you don't see that you didn't see\nAnd I'm disgusted by this but the individual who committed these heinous crimes at the synagogue already said let's shift commit these crimes what the Trump here you don't see Democrats supporter permits atrocity at Senate dog as the headlines for the media wants to go after this president\nFor all the wrong reasons they don't want to give them credit and then there are at some level forty possible for the headlines and in editorials that date prince\nOf driving a narrative which has of Israel against the president\nAnd and it's shameful and they need to be held accountable to and I hope that the American people do that\nWell I'm not sure if they will but look I go to those press conferences as you know I'm a White House correspondent I was there yesterday and the questions you get from some of the media\nThe fake news media in the front row especially CNN is just it's just ridiculous as um that's just part of the problem is out of ten questions you're going to get three that are legitimate all the others are just to embarrass the president or something out\nOr some other such nonsense um now you have the bombings a pipe bomb a\nCrazy guy that got arrested you had a horrible shooting in the synagogue is you know the president and the first lady going in Pittsburgh today this is the right thing to do a lot of people telling me look it's a slow the Republicans I met them down before now scared about what's going on\nThe Republicans have had stopped short\nYou know like ... it's false as a matter of\nOur country is going to become stronger after a national tragedy it\nAlways does everyone have called for and it says this last week said again they we need to be able to disagree with each other but not be disagreeable the president is the console er and chief he and the first lady as well as his daughter and son in law who happened\nTo both the Jewish are going to Pittsburgh today to be part of the the comforting process for those families who were impacted by this innovation as a whole we can never\nTolerate this but this is where the president is his strongest when he sees something that is wrong he doesn't look at Republican or Democrats and independents black white yellow green it doesn't matter he just wants to fix it and what took place in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania was horrific display of atrocity\nIs anti Semitism which will never be tolerated by anyone in this country should never be tolerated by anyone this country and the president's going to go there and remind the world\nOf why we're the greatest country we are going to be nice when tragedy happened he was going to be a he is the president of everybody in this country and toning down their rhetoric is important we have a very important are watching\nAnd seven days but no election is worth what is taking place in issues like that synagogue or attempting to half\nPipe bombs killed elected a former elected officials where the greatest country in the world or not a banana republic we need to understand that we are better when we are stronger and we are the the other and that's the president's gonna talk about um Pittsburgh\nWhere it was horrible and now she's senior advisor for the vice president for the Washington many now great America committee you get more information or just go to great America committee dot com Corey I've got about a minute and a half\nOr the president in an interview with actually as we understand last night said that he is ready to do an executive order to stop birthright citizenship anchor baby idea about a lot of us have been saying that's one of the biggest problems we have an immigration what do you\nAt it is an issue with immigration unfortunately I don't think the president has the legal authority um to to amend the constitution at the United states and what will happen\nIs my guess invoke which is that what took place when he issued other executive orders as they used to a court is going to step into going to put a stay on it immediately and I'm sure the White House has already thought through what the legal challenges are going to be to this and ultimately this is going to end up\nBeing litigated at the Supreme Court at the highest levels of the land and they're going to make a decision but that decision will not be reached in the next seven days it probably won't be return the next three months but the president and his team\nA White House counsel et cetera believe that there is a cork in the amendments that says that\nIs a the individual was born here are subjected to the laws of a country that they're in and there was a cork there that says these people here illegally so they're not\nGiving citizenship through birthright and that's what I think they're going to live in the court system but this executive order\n\nAll right I think that's exactly it we've got seven days I Want to thank you for being with us thank you so much warmer campaign\nManager John professor campaign chopping trucks coming up she'd been right here on your Godzilla of the troops out of the rights\nAt your ... folks get your church for a vote beyond that\nCould have big choice the

great new film called Trump's\nOut war by Steve Bannon you see that the Trump that war dot com stage it's great to have you with us man\nThanks a John By the way that is the most perfect the summary of where you are or what has happened you know actually I don't want to go rent a seat for when the sea Ford ground is focused on exactly what you're talking about it's motivating his giving ideas\nOrganizing and communications to Trump supporters to go out\nAnd also the author though and to start getting engaged in driving the proper gender will get that from you summed it up you know and I painted years when you look at those supporting all actually most important election but I think it's great for his his ... the concept of what the terms are\nI think in the future we're going to be looking at potentially two year presidents in the mid term\nIs the first real like this is Donald Trump's first reelect any body that's supportive recon programming to girls will fix pools or people\nThat life what they see as far as the results of the program and I love your ... your based on the ballots hurt you got your basements back was your son now has a terrific job was living in an apartment with a couple of buddies is able to start his life because\nOf the crop autonomy it's all over the south that's why we're in a\nI think part of right now which says sure of that last night for uh to to basically put forward\nTo the Trump supporters the importance of supporting people that supports ... in parties and these other guys were after Congress 'cause you know we're in a real fight for ah for Congress right now and uh in the whole house of representatives\nIt's it's all on the line and the Thirteen and hearty seats are going to be real love or jumping in central for us to hold in order to hold a host Congress\nSteve how do the Republicans when what do they have to do in the next seven day seven days especially because of math not bring them or there's about thirty\nTen twelve so Republicans have to have a series you're trying what are they have to do in order to keep the house\nI'd look for a while to America takes a look we started in the spring or certainly in the fall of Seventeen are left the White House has said that was over there so they were anticipating that time potentially eighty one hundred seats in the end\nLike Fifteen thousand ten with the progress as just wiped out Congress then we went to sixty they don't want to see a similar for forty journals on insurance next three or four weeks ago we talked about thirty five forty we now down to twenty car\nIt's a very narrow very narrow case size that has to be a good Republicans and Trump have to go through but it's tough winter ... is that\nHouse represents deaf result in Virginia at your audience has raised the middle of it\nYou know he's got Barbara Comstock she's got Taylor\nIs that threat need those three and\nWe're going to know psychologically you earned overly because I think the polls Virginia close at seven o'clock right so we're going to do very early in the evenings to strictly some cell whether it's which are really construct grass and Taylor we're going to know if I Can't have a real feel for this is going to go by seeing those results styles from those congressional districts you know all of them are tight and\nThat's why every vote for the camera and what's your heritage\nIs to do support the program\nAnd we just had the job creators network which is a terrific organization I'm very well has it has to say goodbye to the center they run a but do you get involved and you know Dave Brat Taylor cops that all of these congressmen\nHave encountered censure groups around the world around caring for people run a small banks here people are putting out hangers your people driving people to the polls\nAre it's all ground game that was not about TV commercials this was all about getting people motivated by these guys are not the early vote you know the orange seems darn good job investing in the early ... I think look straw and uh and you can see that it's a ... you know this will get cut our ways of John it's going to be very very tough buddy ...\nListen or if it's his job all that means it can be done and I'm kinda with you on that we're with Steve Bannon or he is now the head of a new shoes for organizations citizens for the American Republic of which are\nSam Nunberg is a senior advisor could call their he's also the producer and director of a must see film called Trump that\nWar you're going to drop out more dot com it's All right there oh Stephen you mentioned a couple of races in Virginia obviously we're following those uh do you plan Kenny rallies or campaigns in Virginia and the next week\nYeah in fact we'll we'll come back on the show and in a couple of days we're having some nobody's a day if Kansas and then from Kansas where it's going to go to Iowa incident and the independence of saying it and there were comes this weekend are folks will be Virginia North Carolina Virginia North Carolina a will ... coming up we'll have\nA screen so the selling by the way the film was freed destruct all your friends I think we've got over it and they use use right now I can go to Trump or towards our economy but I think we're in a trial and strong richer and the and the reason is John ah discuss comes down to come up with a genius it comes down to a couple of congressional seat there has to be safe and I think\nIs is is that a tough one here in the Senate races and outspent teams you know I think five or six of one or it's you know without a lot of top of the tickets are poor and social swimming and I really got to grind it out in this grinding it out as the people that get get engaged Tom Scott's a brat and Taylor are real real tough like\nThey're they are I mean those are the three a district senior the seventh same rafters the second Scott's Taylor although we do believe that had now when Barbara Comstock in the tent that everybody is predicting show gets the fight for whites than except me I'm the only person that America for fixing that\nShe hangs on and pulls out the upset a I've got a one person who texted in and said I'd like to know specifically um from Steve Bannon\nIf he has urged a seven to district Republican to help save rat when I get out the vote geo TV or in or any other way\nHas never in crowd look I'm encouraged everybody there's a sense of for prosperity is actually down there are already running a an outside group or\nGet us closer I encourage everybody ... helping the state of the guys on the hit it out to vote for Trump voters so our focus is on said Trump's safe who who often times may not think that you know coming in and in the mid term as a sport is is that you write summarizes Gianforte simply that the entire\nTrump's agenda is on the line is we lose the house of representatives\nBecause they're not shy and don't they don't like saying it's\nTeach them because they know what drives us the Trump safe but\nThey're you know cherry Nablus he's already said he's going to take over the Judiciary Committee and he's got sixty two investigations too so if you want to see the Trump agenda grind to a halt in the house representative and a flurry of still seen as an investigation since don't take your friends don't take your neighbors don't take your colleagues are out the vote\nOn the on the six but if you like the Trump programs\nLike what you see a then you've got to do it and so I think you'd have to voters everything right now like I said I'm not a steak lever CBS in the last couple of weeks every campaign as he keeps up the narrative now it's just really taught comes through the\nScratch you got to get the people out to vote no question so it sounds so Steve Bannon it sounds to me like

in a few moments we're going to get a quick word from our sponsors on the judge records or radio network when I get back rabbi Spiro we're going to get his take these Americans rabbi\nA love having

through these uh every one is thirty forty fifty years ago it was a very public expressions\nIs real debates and we have two different views of this country\nChevy runs and we don't need to you know we just have to right now have to have the battle of ideas and what the people on the left are trying to do is to silence or whatever we say it was called hate speech or whatever we're saying is er is is forbidden speech and that's a tactic\nThat's a strategy to silence are sometimes people only hear one side of the American story so\nI don't want hailing I just don't want people on the extreme right and left empty for black lives matters male not just I don't want them to have the ability to harm\nPeople but as far as what's going on out there has to be this debate there's there's the Hillary Clinton bronco bomb away\nThe goal for America and then there's the way that I Believe it and then you believe that and so we're forget the healing let's have a real battle of ideas and are such a weird Russia just like they're scientists in terms of ideas and um it will work itself just as always does every fifty years in this country\nAbsolutely I think that is a threat is spot on

counting on anything they can show gift here we've been we've been telling me that in ... and I'm\nRight now with the president I don't think you're going to see any action between now and after each

tell people when doctors with sauce flew there on without authorization so I think it's I just think that he was not a part of it but I'm just to get is it possible to catch the topic\nPlay out because the Trump Administration has put the Saudis as a centerpiece of their middle\nEastern policy they also want to leverage the Saudis and getting the Palestinians to the table with Israel um is this the start of kind of the unraveling or white here where do you think\nWell there are many people that would like to unravel\nThis money will be anti crop or is that many people that are on the Democratic side of the child because the relationship\nThat Donald Trump parents with the Saudis as has always been would always put that on our presidents but their relationship was corking his foreign policy or he wants to use them as a buffer a partner against the expansion of Iranian chair and I'm\nA very many people that would like to see that\nFail they would like to see President Trump fail and there's foreign policy as well as those domestic policy I also don't think it's smart we have a very good or a prospect those are providing weapons and other defense equipment to them which is worth millions\nAnd billions hundreds of billions of dollars in their seventies American Jobs that are dependent upon that real people will real families need real living now I have a\nWhole different take on this thing that went back to this but this was my take this was not simply the silencing of a journalist he wasn't a journalist to begin with you didn't go to journalism school you're working on a fictional columnist I Know what that is to be a columnist he was just a commentator a real sense of what I call\nThem once or twice a week come hell or high water he was a ... a commentator this is not an issue\nAbout a commentator for the Saudis didn't like it was a big nose being put to death this is your cloak and dagger stuff that's his\nSpy counters fire broke spying has nothing to do with the killing of journalists because of the soldiers didn't like what they were saying what he was saying this fellow at one\nTime was very close to the Saudis you knew the secret service or is he was part of their networks he went broke they found out that certain things that turkey and Qatar for enemies of the Saudi Arabians they were they now have certain secrets that kept wondering where did they find out this stuff this was a guy like one time\nWas close to the Saudis part of their inner circle he went rogue and what do you have here is your own fashion cloak and dagger counter strike double agents happens\nWith countries all the time when you're a rogue spark in your country finds out that you're revealing certain information to enemies you're gone I Am sure if this happens in the world holding forty times a month they discovered some will major it's not going to do with the silencing of journalists that have to deal with\nGetting rid of an agent who was providing information Saudi Arabia's and that means and coke and ...\nYeah but you have the rabbi spirit when it was done in a very stupid way to do it in in a in a conflict and the guy who lived in

Lebanon on prime minister\nTwo weeks after the guy was in the White House or the Katy did on guitar with the gang of more blow up in his face that's a total disaster now that you know\nHer up I mean that everything that guy did I mean sometimes you just have to say hey you think he's confident and a\nConfidence and and and the arrogance bad combo I mean if they wanted to get rid of this guy I
