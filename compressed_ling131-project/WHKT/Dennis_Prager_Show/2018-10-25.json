know the facts turnout in um no windows but I have full confidence that uh\nThe Federal Bureau of investigation it's been a very quickly get to the bottom of this Mike Pence saying yesterday whoever this person is it's going to be brought to justice now a new pipe bomb or potentially a is a the Associated Press the saying has potentially been delivered delivered to a New York apartment\nComplex where Robert Deniro lives\nSo all those facts are going to come out until we get to the bottom of it we don't know it's all conjecture at your gestures fine but let's let the facts about let's see what the nature of this is what all violets much the contempt whether it is chasing a people out of restaurants are chasing him down subways\nOr a fights at rallies all of this has to stop\nEleven days away and there's a lot at stake these are the biggest ever and folks you know what I Know this is the biggest mid term election ever this segment brought you buy\nCritical policies that has come out of his Republican Congress and the ministry sense and that if we if we can print those policies were going to go backwards\nYou're on the job for average radio network trucks insurance across America with Elaine Parker Olin as they can be achieved communications officer for the job creators networks she has gone\nThe country on a tax cuts plus chore for much talking to small business owners or just regular people trying to figure out what is going on and there is definitely a red ordered show going on here Elaine ah\nYou've talked to a lot of people have Republicans is there a chance that Republicans would actually hold the house or do you think\nYou know I'm I'm pretty optimistic and hunting directly to the small business owners and to their employees and people who showed up at the at the rallies that we held and I are not going to think that we turned that people are benefiting from his hearing it on you know consumer price\nOn earth in enough that we can\n\nAnd what were the other thing that we're saying is when you look at the generic ballot numbers that they favor the Democrats but there's a lot of fake pulls out there and the other thing that we're seeing internally is in the fifty or so races that are going to determine who controls the house\nRemember the Democrats really have to pick up twenty six states Elaine that twenty three twenty six because there's three\nSinks now that the Democrats hold that uh my sources are telling me are leaning very strong every Republican those are going to accept so the Democrats are going to have to pick up twenty six seats what I've heard right now\nBecause of the twenty sixth thinks they need 'em that are toss ups that all of them are now trending towards Republican now in the last\nFour forty eight hours part of it in you know people are looking at the economy and they're saying do we really want to go backwards do we really want to go back to the bottom of regimes that we really want to go back to getting rid of the tax cuts a half\nA percent growth savings are down nobody has any money family comes home father comes over mama jak them home on a friday night third they can't take their family to a movie they don't have any money there is fear of their jobs the other thing is a way that you have to look at is not\nOnly are jobs up or an unemployment is at the lowest it's been since Nineteen sixty nine you almost don't Nineteen sixty nine\nWasn't land that was one of the New York miracle Mets won the world series Nineteen sixty nine I mean I was a kid back then I was uh twelve years old or something that so far but\nSince the two thousand and one or two thousand one says the two thousand and eight recession dropped out of the job market are now coming back and let me give me some other ... the number\nFormer felons that have been released out of prison getting jobs is at a record high you know how great it is for people that made a mistake and now they're getting a second chance\nLet me give you another set the hiring of handicapped people if the Trump pecan any Elaine it's up to thirty\nFive percent user handicapped people getting jobs I mean is this is an American economic renaissance that Trump has done it is it's sunny and of course nobody wants to talk about it so how do you get the message analyze\nWell I like I said I charge every person in every single stop hearing these stories and you take us information and I'm not surprised that we're seeing that link expose of\nIncarceration and be able to find jobs and that's the way we can we can help them to acclimate back into society um the reality is we have seven point one million jobs out there and we don't want people to cell phones so I think it's fantastic\nHe get he says the training that they need and getting the job will keep them out of trouble and keep them from the humming repeat offenders that's it that's ... that's program that could ever get any job nothing now that\nHappens when you have a job and you're making money for them to society\nAnd the thing is that line or a job for a family or raise 'em a better pay raise more take home pay a job\nIs not read and it's not blow your your your you know what it is the screen and so when you get a job you're right and when uh when when men and women feel better about\nTheir ability to support and take care of their family six woke up for people and a sister who really suspicious of the jobs economy I mean it is incredible the number of people the other thing the other auto storyline Parker was this a trumpet economy and the resurgence we're having\nIs the number of people now\nThat in in uh in middle income jobs or um lower to middle of jumped jobs who now feel comfortable changing jobs because there's a better opportunity for that you know before this when you looked at the numbers nobody would leave a job they were in because they were scared\nLike the next job would be there won't walk now that's changing so people that uh have a better opportunity at another employer they're now moving to benefit themselves that's another of told stories of this economy Joan you agree\nAbsolutely and and we're seeing people do you have those kinds of choices and employers are competing for a poor leader for employees and\nThere are better opportunities that pay more and and even the tax plan that took effect this year we're going to see 'em over here and families to be able to [noise] thousand dollars more each year out of their earnings and one of the thing that gets into the story and it doesn't get a lot of [noise]\nA lot of pressure on and that's to\nSend you a deduction for small business owners parents they're small business owners partnerships sole proprietor sets as corporations they're able to actually feel twenty percent of their business or any from taxes which is what you were talking about you're a small business\nAs well and they're able to reinvest that money on that now they have to reinvest it more into\nInto higher wages because they're competing for scarce labor Alistair for jobs and still in Queens you feel good about their choices out there and and that's that's a great thing too I mean it it's good news keeps coming in more\nAnd more and more and what we keep reminding people out in the ... is that if we weren't he says this progress going is prosperity than we do you have to do for each has a policy and for the Republican Congress that his because he's ... he's in place\nI've actually never seen a party run on results her is that essentially when Democrats are

Howard first agenda and the president's policies and so as you know over seven thousand illegal immigrants are marching right now\nThrough Mexico to bump brush our southern border of the United states it's an invasion and more\nAre joining them every day it's going to be ten thousand by the time it hits the southern border now these invaders are determined to crush supporter and if they get through there are millions more behind them by the\nWay they went in front of a Jewish self esteem and burned tires that's why you're going to build a wall now look if you don't have a fourteen out of the

time here which is Fifteen ten days to go is very limited they don't go and help candidates they don't think it will because they don't have the time and he's with us now we've got some weight behind his back and something that's uh Ryan McAdams running for Congress Republican district for against incumbent\nDemocrat John McHugh gyms that will be determined on November ... sex it keeps running for a second term Brian good to have you with us Matt\nJohn good morning it's great to be with you congratulations on your your radio show being expanded into the acquisition appreciate everything that you said I I Love the elite in and um thank you so much to be getting with being with you this morning [laughter]\nBut I think you're you're trying to do with race I'm not saying that you're going to win but you're turning it into a competitive race and you're working hard also a couple of things let's start with these pipe bombs what are you are making this\nYeah well you you said well uh I was listening\nTo you and you know there's no place for some politics I think that we've gone too far maybe on all sides of even I demonizing one another and I think we need to get back to talking about ideas and solutions and and what about the American people\nAnd stop trying to paint each other you know as a year you know and then it means and you know we are competitors and races but we need to get back to our weather's American and that is or not this type of activity that we're seeing 'em right now with bombing or what the hype up rhetoric um uh that we see\nA in politics today so I'm definitely for a more moderate tone in and focusing on the things that really matter to Americans and that's pollution [noise]\nSo tell me a little bit about um your position on this caravan\nRight we've got ten thousand people that's basically going to bomb Russia border the United states and write as you know even though the president said he's got to put the military there or or um\nOr or the or the national guard it's a\nIt's not likely that he closes the border because that would close off trade and\nOur laws are such it's very odd rotted because when you step once fought over the border without your documents you've broken a U.S immigration law right you're here illegally soon as you step foot but that Ryan\nAs soon as you step the other foot in\nYou've got three large protecting you basically getting the floors law so there's nothing we can do we can't so much catch it\nBut when you have to process it and you can only what you can only detain them for twenty days and the asylum process being the backlog now Ryan two years so basically you get a\nPiece of paper and you get released into the interior of the country if you're in Congress what do you do about this ... how do you deal with it\nYeah it was two different issues there but let's talk about the care care of and first number one as we got to stop them I think the president's going to stop them there's no doubt in my mind that he's going to follow through with what he said that he's not allow them to come in I mean\nI think the continuing to put pressure on Mexico um I I Love what he's he's done with on earth and brought them all and said look if if you can't stop them and then we're going to start taking our money away and I find that we've given you\nOr whatever that looked like but I agree there's got to be consequences countries just a ... type of thing this caravan lawlessness that to happen\nAcross the borders coming up our way so I think continuing to push number one put pressure on Mexico to stop this caravan I don't know if they'll be able to do that you know if it's the Fifteen thousand strong now or whatever it is um but we're going to stop\nThem at the border and then the second issue is what you said is I think that we need to change those asylum or laws that\nThat when someone comes in and and I know you know this but eighty percent or ability to claim asylum will will get it um you know go through the process\nAnd then most of them eighty percent of them will get turned away by the court and so there's there's this you know this connection between those claiming asylum and then does actually\nGoing before the court and then then being beamed that it's completely erroneous and so uh I think but but like you said the problem is is that one thing they've gotten that that status\nPer se then they\nNever show up for court and then they're running amok in our country and so we've got to change that so that uh and I don't know exactly what the solution will be but we've got to change that to to where the you know there has to be a more stringent policy for people seeking asylum wants to cross the border\nRoy McAdams you're right we have to close loopholes and uh\nIf you just read some of the facts here in two thousand or one half of one percent of the illegals that cross the border claimed asylum now fifty percent claim asylum by two thousand Nineteen eighty percent I mean they they just they just figured it out you know how\nMany of the in the United states you get Africa look if you come in and you don't get apprehended then you don't get apprehended and only Fifteen Percent are apprehended eighty five percent just coming out of the Fifteen Percent that actually get apprehended eight fifty percent of them claim asylum and then uh\nEven though eighty percent don't qualify it doesn't matter because they're already God I mean they're ... they're handed\nA piece of paper and they have a hearing in two years they just get on a par [laughter] I mean it's I think it's Saturday what is going on there the president said that\nThe back of those that are sponsored by big wall street donors and Goldman Sachs that they don't care about it they just want cheap labor to\n... the news this hour from town hall dots how mind by they were lost to the FBI's confirming packages Russia former\nVice president Joe Biden actor Robert De Niro are similar to

your friends and family you gotta drive American\nTake them there and you get everybody out there so you want to keep this job growth going and the economy better\nWhen it's very important to get all the Trump supporters out to the polls Prescott Taylor and also I'm Corey\nStewart I remember a year ago he was that their partners for Charles or he's one of the very few politicians that were there and he said all weaker during an answer to everybody's question so I just want to put all that out there and also as far as the bombings go ... you know I Know you can't say\nYet but it looked like a set up and uh I mean come on Robert De Niro it's almost like when you hit the bottom to me so I can sit there and talk about it and you know none of these one Oscar obviously this is a set of everything that they try and has not worked they tried to cats\n... what what else are going to come up with the next few weeks John\nAgain or let me just say in response to that rich is what you just said it's not a conspiracy theory that is a reasonable conjecture based on what we know right now and I don't think you would surprise\nA lot of people if indeed uh these were never meant to go off and these were sent to a influence the election or change the narrative because we're talking about that not the caravan we're talking about that\nNot the knock the or\nThe ups of I'm Sorry I got a text that's destructive me where we're not talking about the economy\nAnd we're not talking about the Taliban issues that are killing the Democrats so that is a reasonable position to take not just music reasonable but you know we don't know and um I tell you when when when Mike Pence let's say a written statement out on Twitter\nAnd says oh we're going to find these people were going to apprehend them and we're going to get to the bottom of that we're going to bring in the justice um I don't think that like I think the FBI's on it and there's too many that have gone out there's gotta be films\nAre gonna be videos has got to be fingerprints has got to be something and I think it's going to be short order by the time they find who this person is but it's certainly to me\nSeems suspicious that's all I'm going to say it seems to ...\nThank you very thank you for that very suspect a plot against like the good lord and savior they didn't go off and no one is ... that's the

don't know yet let's let the facts let's let the facts come out but it's not it's not an unreasonable position to think that this was a set up to change the narrative done by what what\nWhat was going to come up with Trump\nI don't know how they're going to but again we don't we don't know the fact that this might be legitimate these bombs might have been better go off and it could it could be some crazy person or what we do know that uh\nWe don't have all the facts that when we do ah then I think we can go from there but your position is not unreasonable says we don't know it could be an\n...

and\nAte for eight oh five six or six that's a\nThat's a fact of potential act here of domestic terror I really want to get your thoughts on this what you make of it where do you think it came from what you do a little speculating today but uh the FBI all over this and they're saying and various news reports that they're going\nTo get to the bottom of it as a president at the same\nThing Washington's a little bit on the edge as the FBI and that was investigating a string of attempted male bombings address to top Democrats or\nWhich was very odd because here's who they pick the bomber\nClinton holder John Brennan Soros Maxine Waters Debbie Wasserman Schultz ... it's just it's just very odd to me that uh like helping these people aren't even argument involved now I find that\nOdd I just wanted I just uh\nThe whole thing is a odd to me let me leave it at that it's just odd happening or eleven days before the midterms the FBI now investigating the potentially destructive to devices because we don't know if they were actually set to go off either we have pictures of\nThem but um none of the devices\nThank God discovered this week exploded and no one was harmed so thank the lord for that the six inch long package Bob's you said a battery\nContaining powders and broken glass\nWere constructed from a PVC pipe and covered with black tape this is what we learned from a law enforcement officials who saw the bombs that the X ray images of it and told the Associated Press\nThe why\nBasically baby powder harmless\nSo the white powder was harmless they um it's not really determine right\nNow if these bombs could have actually gone off a\nThe FBI intercepted the packages for Obama Clinton in ... before they were received now anybody that does what it is what the odd that they didn't know that you can't get to bomb or Clinton or Trump or anybody in this age because uh\nThey have Secret Service protection and everything is screen before it ever reaches them so that seems to me the package forever colder was voted to a return address for the offices of Debbie Wasserman Schultz in Florida\nPackage for Brennan that were sent the CNN resulted in the evacuation of the cable Josh headquarters in New York City leading to the surreal scene of actors and journalists reporting on the breaking news event from the street\nAnd uh\nThe FBI says it's possible that other packages were mailed to other locations that are still in the mail string the makeshift bombs are going undergoing test doesn't inspection at the FBI Laboratory\nIn Quantico, Virginia the Associated Press reported\nThat the trail of clues are are eventually going to lead to that would be bomber and a course of the time and get that's not good enough speaking in east Rome yesterday President Trump condemned the axe or threats of political violence had\nCalled for unity as his audience to to applaud\n\nHe said in these times we have to unify we have to come together and said one very clear very strong unmistakable message that act of threats of political violence of any kind of no place in the United states of America that coming from President Trump\n\nThat wasn't immediately condemned by Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer who then turned around and I said it was an insufficient response [noise] let me read it again in these times we have to unify of course a Hillary Clinton said you can't unify until the Democrats went\nThat's what you said a week ago\nApparently the Democrats thought that the president's message of unification and coming together to send a very clear strong understandable masters that acts or threats of political bottles of any kind of have no place in the United states obviously they are\nThe ... statement it said it was insufficient
