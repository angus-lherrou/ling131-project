guess Halloween costumes and you know me John I have a good time so if they it's just it's amazing that last week she pretty much apologizes for marginalizing veterans\nSays she's going to stick to issues then she puts out a commercial or calling me an extremist and trying to make fabricated things up again this is what the left does their own hands it's desperate ploy by desperate candidates and that's why commonsense there's back\nThat's why conservatism is back and that's where I'm going to win the fed\nCommonsense is backing I'm your commander of common sense an Israeli woman with\nA running for Congress ... district Virginia let's get to the caravan I'm the president with my later today saying he's going to deploy a thousand troops you got to do a series of executive orders that\nWould stop the caravan from coming into the United states the problem is as soon as they step forward and say the word asylum we can't do anything or ... one of the loop\nHoles in them Denver are written in such a way that all they\nHave to do was get a toe in get their\nHand grabbed and say asylum and then we can't do anything they cannot go back what are you seeing the president's proposed action here if you were in Congress now what would Denver Riggleman be proposing on this terrible it\nWas a rule of law in uh we're we're we're a nation of laws and we believe in the rule of law and the way the laws were written right now you're exactly right John I don't know you know how we we don't honor\nThat based on what we believe is conservatives enroll in and people who follow the rule of law however\nI think Congress needs to start fixing his immigration laws as soon as possible and I also believe once that happens are vetting\nProcess for any of these people that are coming through has to be extreme vetting uh we do have some of the technology in place now but we don't put time limits on this if there's that many people that are\nHeaded towards the border uh we don't know what's invented\nIn those and John my biggest fear um it's easy you know it's like a Trojan Horse right listen Ninety five percent Ninety nine percent of those people could actually be seeking asylum um though is that you know our hearts sort of go out to and with compassion however if you have people inside there that are bad\nActors and they're able to hide you know within this caravan we have to a fair amount and my guess\nIs this going to be spending some pretty healthy intelligence assets down range I think we're going to be monitoring and my guests\nThis caravan of seeing any type of emissions that are coming out of there talking about radio emissions or any kind of been told that we can glean this is not a good situation this is not good and at some point I think we have to fix or immigration laws in a way that again are\nMuch more common sense in the sort of\nSort of ridiculous since we have now are going on in the border\nUm the\nI think the concern that everyone has ever is that okay there's twelve or Thirteen or fourteen thousand people we have to deal with it and uh\nEverybody wants to be concerned everybody's concerned about the humanitarian aspect but a lot of my color or their concern with okay if they get in\nIf it's Fifteen thousand get then the next one is going to be a hundred and fifty thousand and you're not going to be able to stop that either because we'll never get a wall up in time and even if you have a wall and get a hundred and fifty thousand people have this is a lot of people so um are you in favor of the president taking action\nNow to stop these uh that's a mob caravan from bomb rushing the border and come again argue in favor of stopping them from coming in now\nYes yes I mean it's it's I mean this is a matter of national security or it is a matter\nOf precedent um and again this comes back to was at a normal American will say hey you know we understand people want to come to the United states but there is a legal process um and we're gonna have to we're going to have to follow that legal process you know we we think that legal process used to be applied all immigrants and you and you're exactly right John\nThis would set a precedent that could really be damaging to the United states' security to our policies into our rule of law or you're right if the if we allow everybody in we're actually\nSort of acknowledging that open borders is what we want if we don't follow the rule of law we don't stop these these migrants sadly we we have to stop all now from coming in and set a precedent Denver\nAbout a in about five or ten minutes the U.S government has got to release the new economic numbers or GDP expected to grow again\nThis quarter at so over four percent that could be four point one in four point to four points rates of August timing was charging along in about a half percent growth means is gross unprecedented where do you look for in that report and ... what ...\nDo you think you might throw out of it on the economy gender of regular\nWell the thing I first I'm going to look for [laughter] and it's just because I'm a geek out on the stuff is I'm going to look at the specific whatever report that I have I'm gonna look at the number of jobs are based on that are open right now and I look at Virginia but I also see where we are going as far as employment but GDP Growth I'm going to look at manufacturing\nAnd I'm looking at agriculture I Love looking into the numbers to see where that growth and if we're continuing on this line John if we're continuing with the lowest unemployment claims in forty nine years of her continuing Los minority unemployment\nIn for continuing which he grows four percent of of every quarter which you know it was amazing a it's a new normal was too I mean is\nTax cuts were other jobs reform act worse opportunities zones can be LeBron's here in the in the commonwealth a ... and opportunities\nOn investment all the things that we looked at to encourage opt entrepreneurship to encourage people keeping their own money is working and that's where I'm going to look at it this report is is this just a continuation of this amazing amazing surge or are\nWe seeing an even more positive future for the people in the fifth district but also in the United states and then the commonwealth of Virginia I think we are I think we're just seeing the beginning of this economic boom and um\nI I'm really just really excited to see what those numbers say based on more job growth sectors are growing right now\nWhat kind of interesting to see these are coming out momentarily we expect\nThat oh we're going to get over four percent growth and it's really really tough for a Democrat right now to talk about economics the economy or any of the issues that pertain to jobs and prosperity in America so they'd rather talk about something else that's why your opponent Leslie Coburn is talking about your Halloween\nCostumes 'cause he doesn't want to talk about the economy she doesn't want to talk about jobs she doesn't want to talk about growth doesn't want to talk about kids moving on to the basement she doesn't want to talk about the boom and small businesses she doesn't want to talk about the deregulation she doesn't want to talk about the number\nOf investments that are going on because of the tax cuts especially as it relates to one hundred percent deduction of capital investments Rob doesn't even understand it and so she doesn't want to talk about any any of that she'd rather talk about your Halloween costume in two thousand five\nYeah and I mean which I Will not take down off the net by the way so here's what she would rather talk about she'd rather talk about forty million dollars in spending not only for Medicare for all but also for forgiving student debt right which is one point for a trillion dollars right now free community college for all are free college for all everything she said and even in debate she's like I Want to give away this\nShe doesn't understand the taxpayer money is what you're using I get so limited based on what I thought for you know in government overreach she says she loves government I fear government I think government should be limited I think government should be a fish and she's also said the taxpayer money for the middle class\nIs nothing more than confetti she's compared\nEyes to the Nazis I mean I I find it's stunning John did anybody would vote for Leslie\nHer views are great for San Francisco and maybe a three square mile area there or somewhere up in Georgetown right in DC but for the fifth district it's absolutely appalling that she thinks he's values are actually a political ball to the people the fence about every day and work for a living\nAnd don't give a rat's with the chattering class is saying on CNN or\nMSNBC or any of these other far left and they are now\nThey're just they're just propaganda machines and I think at some point uh that's going to break through that you have\nComments you have this coalition of common sense against progressive ... and I think that's what's happening in the fifth district and we're going to win this John because I represent American values I represent conservative values but I represent what the fifth wants to do right now and that's why we're going to win this\nDenver Riggleman I Want to thank you for being with us what's your website\n\nEleven days away Denver Denver\n\n\nIt when for the Democrats now is slipping away by the very our it's slipping away\nRepublicans in swing

I tell you we don't know and I'm not going to go down that road\nBe committed to an institution crazy or just that they've got a screw loose you don't do that kind of normal people well adjusted people don't do that okay by definition\nPat Buchanan has a column today Barry makes the point that when John Kennedy was assassinated Lee Harvey Oswald who defected to the Soviet Union was pro Cuba\nUh he was found to be the shooter or yet who got blamed for the John birth society and all the conservatives so\nThis is not the first time that the guilt by association or let's let's let's slammed the conservatives let's blame everything on conservatives not the first time it's been done before we even know who actually sent these packages so\nIt's a everybody's got to calm down take a breath and ah I think Sarah Sanders had it right we should be coming together the president is calling for unity dialing down the rhetoric\nAnd the Democrats are going in the opposite direction they're they're they're blaming the president unequivocally no question about it take you know responsibility whatsoever\nFor calling the guy look at this guy Brennan said the president's guilty of treason what's the what's the penalty for treason death he's basically a\nFormer head of the CIA had been out they're calling for the president to be hung by the neck until dad and this is not considered inflammatory rhetoric I\nIt's it it's disgusting the whole thing and it's just just hypocritical meet people will go down as the all time greatest hypocrites\nAsking something a Curtis I\nI think you make a great analogy on the depression and that's of the Democrats who cried and screens in wind about having\nOn getting the FBI not investigating everything I mean why don't we just wait here I mean the FBI seems to be home again in southern Florida the guy to come up with a report pretty soon and we're we're we're going to find out the answer why don't you just wait\nRight exactly how about everybody say calm down let's we got we we have the FBI on the case unless this guy was a or gal or or or ...\nOr whatever [laughter] whatever it was they created these packages\nUnless that entity was a very very very sophisticated person or a boat or by it and if they were very sophisticated they were able to cover their tracks but\nConsidering the number of packages delivered to these various places coming out of one place\nThere are a lot of clues there and I'm confident that the FBI will be able to figure something out here and find out who did it or narrow it down and the fact that they use Debbie Wasserman Schultz as return address\nThat's kind of interesting in itself Debbie Wasserman Schultz is the one who was forced to step down\nShe had been reading the system for Hillary against Bernie\nI don't know what that means but it sort of an interesting clue you know maybe somebody thought that was funny to use her name out all these bombs I don't know uh but my point is this unless this was a very sophisticated operations that they knew\nA how to cover their tracks at every step of the way\nYou've got twelve packages now that the FBI is investigating it let's wait for the FBI to figure this out to come up with something yeah why not wait before you start\nA and and why not why are they not waiting because they want to politicize it\nThe the Democrats are missing no opportunity to score political points on this\nWell it's uh it it seems it just seems odd to me that that all this is happening but let's wait I mean that's what everybody's saying let's wait time let's get to let's get the ... the economy will get to the Taliban invasion after the bottom of the hour a\nBut let's get to the new economic numbers that just came out the gross domestic product GDP growing another three and a half percent now let me just say what this means right this is the first time that we have had\nBack to back quarters or in a very long time of of of over three and a half percent growth back to back and consumer confidence uh up at an all time I can do with spending was ... percent another great a\nQuarter of economic growth this is more bad news for the damage they don't want to talk about this that they don't want to talk about the economy or jobs or the growth so what did they talk about\nAh they talk about all they talk about they've got this wonderful thing to talk about this horrible thing to talk about here with the with the bombs and they talk about the president said\nAgain they're falling in they don't realize they're falling into a trap and and it's their own drop a trap of their own making people don't want to hear the Democrats talk about\nThe president they want to hear Democrats Republicans the politicians in Washington talk about what they're what the politicians are going to do for them to make their life better write what I I go to work every day\nI got a family to support I got a job I'd like to get a raise what are you going to do to make that happen how are we going to make my life better easier make me rich uh may make make my kids you know healthier talking about President Trump talking about you're\nA Native American DNA doesn't do that [laughter]\nI Would do that\nAbout President Trump are causing the bomb scare doesn't do that so they are going back to the ... for the last two years old we been talking about as President Trump is is a Russian agent and now they're President Trump as a Russian agent who creates bomb scares I mean\nThey're they're they're not doing themselves any favors\nMom's a President Trump and the Trump Administration have created the best economic conditions in this country in a generation the best we've seen in ten Twenty years [noise]\nAnd that is\nGoing along the way that answers peoples' questions what have you done for me lately you've got your job you've got you've gotten my soul food stamps gotten out of the basement there on their own now great thank you very much\nI'm going to pose this question to\nAnswer when it gets back stay with us from another part of the hour what a\nTrump Tower in the last job I feel the same like H bow all over again I mean I mean\nI could go back and it's the same thing everybody telling us from cooking when it was all was all whatever it was that he was showing at the time that we're going\n\nComing out of the town is coming out of the farms\nComing to vote for Trump they've never voted before and uh so yeah it is there is a feeling that things are really hear all of these national generic ballot polls are meaningless was on a national election\nOther they're all like I mean it's all say falls I I've been talking all day about the Washington Post poll that came out yesterday that shows Jennifer Wexton had a Barbara Comstock energy is tense districts like Thirteen look\nLike that might when she said she's the favorite no doubt that's a very tough district for Republicans to win barbecue\nEvery internal poll that the Republicans have from the White House to the at our ceasing to Barbara on down shows the race does not have a Thirteen plainly but this is what the Washington Post jobs they get a uh\nThey get a ridiculous methodology to get a snake holes you get a fake analysis of it did you make news to get a fake conclusion drawn so they can continue on with their fake narrative and like we've already been down this path so now I'm going to start calling them on how ridiculous it isn't there it's the same\nBy the way round the John triggers radio network I Am your Godzilla of the

such an\nAbsolute joke it is and it's just a a bumbling it's bumbling and here's the deal and I said this on\nAl Jazeera yesterday I don't know what the president's going to do about this but you got to do something that's number one number two what every judge who's got to consult the secretary of state Mike Pompeo\nHe's got to just do Gina Haspel but they're going to do something they have to do something you have to react to this now I don't think he's going to cancel the arms deal because he said look I got to deal with that it's economically benefiting the country and\nIf I can see what they're simply going to buy the weapons from China or Russia so why would I Do that here's the other people said oh the president's position has a has keeps changing no the president hasn't had\nA position other then he discovered the idea of scrapping the arms deal everything\nElse is on the table including withdrawing or support from the Saudi average coalition and then you have any civil war so everything else was on the table so just say that well his position keeps changing he hasn't had a position based on commentary\nWhich is involved based on new facts to come out and the Saudis have changed their story ten times did they change again yesterday and no change it again tomorrow\nAs more facts to come out so\nI don't understand what they're saying the president has changes but they just have a position he's waiting for the fact that President Trump is not a politician he's a businessman here's our businessmen make decisions facts numbers\nSpreadsheets and math so as the facts come in and the mathematical equation gets\nPut together his commentary evolves as information changes that's what are you supposed\nTo do the end of the day I don't know what the final outcome of the U.S reaction is going to be but I've been saying this all week in the middle middle Middle East on TV this president does it take well to being lied to and\nI don't think there's any doubt\nCrown prince Mohammed bin Solomon lights all I don't think that goes over well with President Trump he doesn't like being lied to here's the other\nThing that the like dealing with an incompetent people you have to have a lot of patience and I'm telling you crown prince Mohammed good\nGotten involved in has been a complete Arden mitigated disaster for the Saudi kingdom was actually the father just have to say you know what my son is an competed bumbling fools and I got to put somebody else in\nThe country to only because it's guys and capable of being Jane 'cause that's stupid stuff including this assassination allegedly\n\nThe Saudis have now ... as an adult\nI guess not a final story are saying but that's kind of change again so who knows what the ah to showcase has\nHere's what it's tough it is really brought renewed focus\nTo the Saudi Emirates tactics and the support that we're giving them and getting involved in the Yemen's civil war which is causing a horrific it's very disturbing very growing humanitarian\nCrisis where I just got to pay into 'em on algebra zero every day I see the pictures you do see because uh the fake news networks today they don't want to show your real news they want to talk about\nYou know President Trump Stormy Daniels or whatever they do but I\nI see the pictures on TV and I mean it'll really tear out\nYour stomach you've got children just starving I mean they can eat ... they they got mother's stripping park from trees bark and boiling it just matching\nIt up just so there's something in there and that's in the summer reading grass I mean there's no food I'm just thinking about having a teacher child you're sitting\nThere and they started that they think about how that feels like this thing is is a horror show it is worst in the area it's worse than anything I've seen and our\nInvolvement in it is shameful and it's absolutely shameful and if there's anything that's got to come out of this show fair or\nWe're going to get the hell out of there as well should and it's just it's horrific that the United states is involved in something of this nature all because you know we've got the Iranian Boogie Man\nWith their nineteenth street post or whatever they have like let's get the phone lines Mike in Oakland Europe you're on the air Mike\nGo ahead John ...\nI I agree with you on the other thing I think that's you're exactly right about that so um I I give up that comes out of this for anything good could come out of this thing I think that'd be good but [noise]\nI have to point out though the irony or something you said just a few minutes ago I'm\nSure you didn't pick up on it because you don't agree but um you know you said the president or the the two things he doesn't like he doesn't like to be lied to and he doesn't like incompetent and I I Can't help but think he must be he just wants all that to themselves\nAre the jobs just doesn't want to share those\nWell I guess uh I guess you'd say just tremendous economic renaissance and as for me tremendous economy and we have an all these jobs I\nGuess you think that's the work of incompetence I guess you think the fact that we haven't heard from ISIS in that they've been kicked kicked out of the majority of their caliphate and they they not only can throw a tiny part of her story yet when he took over was massive I get you think that's a topic I guess\nYou think that the fact that the wacko when North Korea has not done a nuclear tests and she's written that my kitchen thing that's confident I guess you take all these new jobs we have the fact that\nWe just keep going up in the confidence and there's a tax cut and your figured that confident so I guess your nights definition of incompetence Mike\n... is just a little bit different\nI guess it is a ... some of those things to the officer notch\nOr\nGod I mean I wouldn't know what I Want\nSomeone who is competent and what kind of this should we be if you were going out of that\nOut you know what I thank you for straightening yeah it's your economy Obama leaves office\nSupplies wages that Rob savings jobs there are people are moving out of the things that kids have jobs
