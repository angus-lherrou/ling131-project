this morning you tell me how are you\nI'm doing well doing well busy busy these days but uh but but doing well\nGood man I tell ya I was ... this is not an endorsement but there's a a reflection of what I saw when you're in the general assembly working again I think we're on the commuter together\nYou're always justice energetic smiling go get them kind of guy you know like the um like Mickey Rooney was put on a show you're always just like vitamin ... are you able to maintain that\nYes you know I I I'm you know I'm Glad to represent great bugs and the I the first district you know I get my energy from that they are\nVery very passionate individual that they work hard every day and uh and do do great work so it's hard not to be motivated by that but it it's hard not to be motivated to ah by the by the true honor that it is to represent them\nAnd I and I appreciate that and I'm having been there\nWashington and all\nBut you know Chris I mean I think at certain times it it it\nDoes it does give you pause as to you know where we are in the country and the divisions that are out there but but I always work every day to try to find places where we agree I think I think today it takes a little more effort to do that but you know I've been successful in finding places where we agree at work and I'll get those\nIs that you have deadlines are constitutionally\nA enacted that hold the line on these things you can't go to continuing resolution that's an awful term I'm all for it but they also have I I Love the single object rule in in legislation ... where do you deal with one subject and that's it so you don't have this big mash up coming back from the other from the Senate or vice versa\nThat just just blows up the whole deal\nThough I agree and and you know the uh the the good thing is that in the in the U.S house we operate under the same rules that you weren't there to general ... or you and I both know that as your\nSpeaker you figure out the rules about how things are happening on the site has different rules so many steps kind of get combined together and they look at how to Alice is related in any way shape or form in the the the the\nThe most highlighted example is where a Ford about Iraq passed the title of the bill was not the sort of Iraq they they they took they took custody bill stripped all the language out of it kept bumper and the title of the survey or the house version of\nThe Affordable CARE Act so it it it's that kind of procedural stuff that you just shake your head why how\nCan that happen but I Would argue that\nYou know sticking with the logic of systems where I keep seeing ... Mandy what was the way to make sure that you keep debate on track you make sure you don't have a lot of you know aren't related to the doctor a piece of legislation people go or how did that get in there and it's like you know throwing everything on the last train leaving the stage for like\nYou know that stuff doesn't doesn't walk or there are not related or what should be used you know as the as the ethical to pass things that are unrelated so I I agree that's that's one of the I think the problem is up here is that it doesn't\nIt doesn't require the necessary debate until it's porous said when you're using that mechanism when you have unrelated ah aspects of legislation or language to bill\nOr people just you know look at it and go how how could that happen\nI Hope you all will take a look at some of the rules and get more to wherever a Virginia way of governing up in DC because\nI I one of the things that when you pull back from politics and and watch sports people get upset when they see rules violations because they know the rules ... last night there was a he has just in Berlin or through as a wider was beautiful smarter\nAnd Enron darling he was a pitcher for the Mets and the A's and some other team said that is a pitch it when you are warming up to you put your mid down and say grab Patel I'm done that's a perfect pitch and it was and it was called the ball and the next pitch the Boston Red Sox guy in it for a home run and as far as what I'm\nSaying you go that's outrageous only because the the the teleprompter had on there and the strikes\nAnd what happens when people in in politics people they don't know the rules to get upset about that's just not cricket you're not doing it the right way guys you know we deserve better and so they pulled back your eyes to see see they they shrugged their shoulders and throw their hands\nYou know it's just it's just not working on on on my behalf you know I I don't get it right in the distance and or anything you can do to to to change that up would be for the benefit end of my rent let's get back to the absolute let's get back to the congressional district what what are your voters telling you\nWell you know we're hearing a lot from state I think that they're that they're very interested in how to create a a continual\nUm increase in our economy I think people are are very positive about what you talked about I think they appreciate what's been done by Congress lessening regulatory burden in changing the tax code to make it easier for businesses to host but the things that they want to see going forward or\nWhat I call the sustaining park so many economy and first of all she does have an education system that assures that our children students get the officers are educational experience to be watching them\nTo feel the jobs are there are seven point one million jobs over and Chris and Seventy five percent of those jobs will now requiring you're great and that means we have to emphasize career in technical education as much as we do common strike education because\nThat's where the jobs are in those costs today are skilled jobs that have a quick off as far as a career where you go from an apprentice your journey that\nTo a pastor and have a career they're starting to well in many instances better than you grew up in a job that requires a college degree so I think people look at that and say that's where we want to\nHear answered looking going how it's going to make sure that my child is soft on like how do we make sure the education system gives them the knowledge skills abilities to compete for\nThe jobs that are available today and the teacher and I think businesses look at it and say hey the other things in the economy are going really well of course when I taught English was across the district I can tell you the top three things they talk to me about our workforce workforce in workforce or you or they say we could grow up business today\nIf we can just find workers to do the job and it's you know their job openings today than there are people fail to job openings so we're really going to have this done was to happen in one other element to this article\nAnd that is brought in Hillary for people to connect\nIt's important on such a part of education so that way a lot of families about children to school at the job of computers and bring them home and they can't connect those costs hard for them to duty assignments that they've been given or the mom and dad have to put up with the vehicle taken one of the library Donaldson why fight\nBusinesses anytime of the areas that don't have high speed can't\nDo the business they needed to be successful\nAnd third one of the ways to bring about health care\nOf course can't connect with patients without going to go to an office building ... miles and miles away and can get that care and quality of those things are gaining changed or spring so we really want broadband and we have to make sure we have education system sizes Korean talking legislation as much as a class college truck education\nAnd these are these are these are tough issues because people don't go\nBroadband workforce\nDevelopment those those don't get the people out to the to the polls there just like man that makes sense I like that you know 'cause when when people get down into the\nThe granular already talked about with other colors today in politics and the government is complex and people don't like complex they're like five were bumper stickers because they're pretty busy trying to make their lives working in putting that into the context of their daily lives come out and vote whichever way is a tall order for a lot of politicians right\nSure policy\nAnd [noise] it's complicated it takes time last hog I'm all for anybody anybody in our leadership position whether elected are thought to have those conversations in you know those things that aren't ... aren't really destroy things I\nHear or something like that I come up with some people say\nHey this is critical and yes it could be soundbites are way to help our economy but drill down is okay we've done in the car you can always say well I'm not quite the shock\nOf all of us I don't think people are incredibly loud only want\nTo talk on the left office or asking for people to say I don't think that well that's great you know chocolate syrup that ... that's great but what people want to hear to work if I'm going to play again what are you going to do in the future how do you understand the things you have to eat on what are you going to do to accomplish that\nWhat do you what you want to come back to us or if you are ... ... s just approached the last ... last things I'll sit around and you know what I was able to accomplish and and I just don't want that they want you to understand which according\nTo what they want you to project location for the future about how this all going to be addressed so it's not just a laundry list of things done it's what are you going to connect\nWith other people's concerns about the challenges they face huge\nTell people Ortiz is all the time I talk to him politics is about the future not the past it is and you can like look what happened but very the economy's great unemployment is historically low and they just threw out the government pretty much there's yeah there's some there's some there's some\nUndertow currents that you just have to go out there and pound doors you understand and listen to people\nBecause the elections are about tomorrow night yesterday that you know I I really appreciate your calling in today we wish you the best out there in the campaign trail you got what Eighteen days left\nEighteen days left\n[laughter] everybody 'cause we've only got four hundred and Seventy two days to the Iowa caucuses that there is and isn't that fun\nOn early well there are already out there are already out there getting their campaign strategist and consultants lined up for them for the caucuses and people are starting packs and all that kind of stuff that never ends Virginia is always a test case and\nNow we're blessed for people who who offer themselves up for public service and regardless of party or we thank you Rob thanks for calling and we'll be joined in the next segment by Dr Robyn McDougal and Virginia Commonwealth university Wilder school will join us\nWhat do you think his future in Virginia Republican Party is he would have lost two statewide races and one nominating convention\nA bullet in their hypothetical wouldn't have done better than some people in terms of painted certainly did in the last ... primary does that make him viable going forward because people will say well he's got a built in base of support in the party\nAnd has to be reckoned with or what people say you had your chance on the stage and you've lost several times over a hundred times the exit\nGreat question Julian um central calling and I would suggest that it is dependent upon how\nWell he actually does relative to the national spread and the Virginia I'm nor does I think that the north some race last year was a point that's a big number\nIf you're a Republican especially because three years before that that Gillespie got within the hairs breath and beating Mark Warner I think if he's in double digit losses it's very difficult for him to\nTo ah to run again a state wide but who knows I Do think the Republican Party is going to be going through some changes are gonna be like a soul searching after this election you know um and there'll be looking at new directions new candidates or to to go forward I don't know how much staying power Korea would have\nWith a double digit boss and I'll just after three statewide offices the thanks for calling in\nAny other questions no sir\nHave a good broadcast thanks man hey uh\nNBA what do you what do you like they're the warriors ah you know my position is anybody but the war [laughter] I'm On the throne golden stays in the in the finals or the playoffs what's got to be one of a couple of got to be Boston Celtics looking pretty good who else in the west at\nA bar Boston looks at me we'll see what happens with the rockets that they can integrate their new pieces including Carmelo Anthony ... a lot of people are down on 'em\nThere's a reason for that very good what you've ever packed\nLess than I think ... Carmelo has his shortcomings but I think the sort of nobody else in a recent the bias overlooks a a pretty pretty impressive tenure in the league or despite some of his uh his recent to sort of downgrade enhanced in his game\nSo we'll see you know I you know I got from Philadelphia connection so I've always got a soft spot in my heart for the Sixers oh I'm I'm I'm not sure if they're quite ready to make the late but we'll see other than anybody\nSome lawyers and so I I I like the Sixers\nPhiladelphia Seventy six or something like that we all these advantage on the shoulders so sort of ingrained in the Seventy Sixers culture back in the very points to proceed Conan joins argue circular you took thanks okay as a doctor McDougal patiently waiting for us Yes sir I Am very she is now are you Robert yet\nI Am good happy ... birthday by one day [laughter]\nStores are still over by the way\nI I actually I I Will make sure that I make my you know purchase and get it you know drop your doorstep eight that\nYou know Amazon is pretty much a daily stop at our house so it's just one in the order for either in there you go perfect and we look folks if you're listening to stock in cardboard boxes whatever the company I work with training\nThat makes cardboard boxes that Amazon buys by that stock because we have so much cardboard box in our garage backed up after the underwear bomber\nStarted we're we're right there with you yet are I'm sure\nSo a doctor Robin McDougal is with the Virginia Commonwealth University ... Wilder school tell us briefly about the water school what youre doing\nYes sir so uh where we're at school of government and public affairs at least ... years um rains in the top fifty and your news and World Report for schools the public affairs he got the undergraduate and graduate program focused on criminal justice homeland security and emergency preparedness\nPublic administration\nAs well as programs in the master's level and urban\nAnd regional planning and a PHD program and public policy and then we also have our center\nFor public policy which I direct which is our consulting and community engagement arm of the work we do in the wild her school so you will see a lot of things around economic because that was a leadership in training local and state government outreach and things like public policy polling\nThat we deal with at the center for public policy in the wild her school\nWe're going we're coming up pulling real quick\nBut you guys actually go out and work with uh other local governments and businesses that you helped them it's not just I think people don't understand that about higher education the value that you bring to the community and the state\nYes yes we really do I mean we're done\nEverything from looking helping that localities looking at potentially providing incentives for certain business to come into their community and doing a return on investment of what that economic impact would look like on the proposal stage with regard to incentive then come back and provided down that actual economic impact\nIf they went forward with a business and the impact that it had on the community with everything from revenue to job creation other aspect and that way out we've done a valuation of um you know criminal justice programs so the implementation of a mental health program or a drug treatment program on reducing recidivism for a\nLocal jail or a a community partner we worked with a non profit from everything from their valuations on the program done projects that they do to our federal coordinating and combining the\nActual help that they need with regards to our students in our staff or which\nCommunity looking at a third party evaluations of programs in projects and the private sector looking to pitch to the general assembly and need an actual third party non biased evaluation of that\nWork being able to provide that report for that company for the general assembly to look at legislative impacts so we do we are a continual partner\nEvery single day with our local and state government uh around the commonwealth um\nAnd it it really is what we live and breathe in the wild or school specifically um we do it at a much more\nCourse that that didn't work then our private sector counterparts if you will because it really is our mission and our vision and it allows us to bring to bear are\nAcademic and he says well within the Wilder school you know we have ever thirty academic faculty who their area of expertise you want to talk about the economic impact I've got four\nEconomist in urban and regional planning program or you want to talk about the impact of an opiate program a treatment program I've got two criminals that says ah academic see that their area of expertise and they get asked\nAll around the country to look you know present their research and were able to bring expertise to bear for our localities in the commonwealth in Virginia\nSo that when you're a service higher education school because I mean we\nAre we are you know we we provide at all give us your students that we will educate them freshman in college graduates filling PHD program\nGive us your workers that we will train them and executive leadership and management preparations give us your legislators and you're a lobbyist and we've all trained in policy analysis on the impact\nOf a variety of girl on legislation and um give us your community that will help you come up with solutions and then you'd be the evaluation of being tackled isolation will say we really are I'm not one stop all encompassing education and consulting academic\nArm for local and state government and our our citizens and students around the common law\nAnd that's why I brought it up and then we'll go to the polling that your that your operations down there because I think it's so important for people to understand the totality of a lot of things and governments especially heritage which has a ... on his back around the country in Virginia we've got a great higher education system we really need to be proud of it\nUh even though it's you know it's it's appropriate to hold them accountable and ask tough questions but a lot of things you're talking about are free they are exclusive of of usual operations and they are a complementary to what you are doing and actually facilitate what you were doing in higher education I think it's wonderful I think it's misunderstood not understood at all\nBut let's jump into some polling a that while the school has gone\nWhat are you seeing out there what have you seen what direction are we going\nTo talk a little bit like Clinton on earlier so let's talk a little bit about policy and in polling in public policy that we did on this summer we were out in July we'll have another poll rolling out right here after the election in November but in our in our public policy review talked about higher ed so let's talk about that for a second\nOur commonwealth so true representative sample of all five region um\nOf our commonwealth and when we look at and ask people what they think about the value of higher education and Virginia over eighty percent of our responded believed that the community colleges that we haven't\nVirginia or work their cost over sixty\nFive percent believe that our public four year institutions are worth the cost and then right under fifty percent believe that our private\nSchools in the commonwealth and work in a car so it's really important that you said that question around down in Virginia we value higher education and not only did we value it but we're putting out a product that citizens around the commonwealth bank is age appropriate return on investment\nSay alone I read you know\n[noise]\nJust hours into all the time my parents have surfaced or three strains\nAbsolutely resolute roast the

up not the governor entire general subway all of a sudden it forty of senators forty seven districts in a hundred house districts\nAnd then we go right back into the presidential cycle but the overlay to the general assembly elections\nIs going to be the elections for the nomination of the Republican Party in the Democratic party leading those conversations are going to be Iowa New Hampshire and South Carolina and as a part of\nOur educational approach here I'm executive director Virginia free foundation research economic the economic education a is to better inform the electorate Virginia it's elected officials and business leaders in a part of that is our next guest who is joining us from\nSome of these decaf\nYeah I guess I I uh I have way too much coffee\nIn the morning you and me both go through a pot I'm I'm not here and I'm no I'm just ready to go Mike what's going on in New Hampshire these days\nWell I'll tell you what we had we had a couple of presidential candidates running for twenty twenty already here in the last week so\nAh things are wrapping up\nSo this is only from the Democratic side no Republicans are going up there right\nNo well you know this is talk of course about John Case sick and or Jeff Flake running against Donald Trump for the Republican nomination\nI actually wrote 'em and op ed for uh the statewide paper here in New Hampshire just last week I it's pretty silly to take on Donald Trump\nI'm a ... you know he is a it anytime a in that Republican primary where a sitting president has been challenged it's getting on the right job and these guys will be running on the left they really wouldn't have a prayer feeding the president and the Republican primary\nRight now right now that's that's right now anything can happen goodness knows what I\nThink can happen any thing of course and especially you know God Forbid the economy collapses\nRight right that's what I was like no one something like that but if what if what if Mueller drops a big one things can change All right let's let's shift in the Democratic nomination credit primary where I think we're four hundred and Seventy nine days away something like that from the Democratic primary hamster [laughter] it was canceling\nRight but not that I think it's I think it's smart crushed for you to to be talking about this stuff and ... because the the the presidential stuff as you well know there's there's all kinds of things happening behind the scenes right now\nThis is where it happens right the pro pro life pro frozen out [laughter]\nAnd they can come the day after November's election candidates start doing things in a more public way but like I said senator or Joe a brand new York which op here yesterday campaigning\nShow she's laying the groundwork genius and and you know she's doing that all across the country and I'm a show she's starting to to put things together I'm Alec Baldwin I Know it may seem silly I'm sure you've heard about it to the guy\nHe's making wrong he made his second trip to New Hampshire just this past weekend really twice in the last six months alec\nBaldwin our father and then he has said he has not ruled out running for president\nAh Mike we're making news this morning this was my comment in my producer the show looking at we're making news this morning Steve bullock he\nThis one that was a young talent Alec Baldwin has um a spoke at the largest fundraiser for the Democratic party in New Hampshire to um I just last week yeah\nWow see if he ran his old out Goldman is Jack Ryan you know it's kind of my guy yet but [laughter]\nThat was back in the Cold War you know hundred October [laughter] that's right yeah so so who else you've seen up in in New Hampshire and who would you get to be the front runners in the New Hampshire primary today likely to win or the twenty twenty primary in the February next year European\nBernie Sanders run for president he will be the front runner okay just no doubt about it no degree hamster no doubt about it ... if he doesn't uh down a little bit Warren will likely be the front runner\nOkay so how 'bout what recently happened was Senator Warren in New Hampshire how does that play with her I mean fumbling of the DNA ancestry ball this week the disaster\nYou know in any democratic circles I actually don't think it's gotten so much a liberal Democrats are going to be looking for a liberal Democrat regardless of facts\n[laughter] dangerous [laughter] you know they they think they serve their choices and and physicians primarily on emotion and into\nJesse Harris from ... Iowa just call it don't you heard that\nVery a veteran democratic operative in in Iowa was describing a I'm a so called scene but the reality in the in the Democratic voter in the primary motive but they also want to win and they might go you know I don't think seniors can win nationally I think\nThat's the funny\nNow I I'm a Republican I think that's why I Would have a similar problem I don't think she's electable in a in a\nGeneral election nationally nationally okay yeah I I look for free and open that using DNA issue as an example um I think so but one thing I Will say though it's a I I don't think it affected her here in New Hampshire I Do think it affected the again the behind\nThe scenes operation a and and you know the all the maneuvering going on behind the scenes among potential democratic candidate for her to actually take over a news cycle before the election the way she did was\nIs that why why [laughter] I mean if you knew the results of the DNA test and it was counter to your narrative that you're trying to go after you put that thing up midday on Christmas [laughter] have you been married right\nNow I don't understand it so how do you think uh okay so you got Sanders worn just because this New Hampshire but the other guys have got to go up there and compete or do they have to they might say just say you\nKnow I think I Do I think that you know because there's always going to the opportunities and as you probably know that um you know Clinton made a name for himself by doing well and and coming back to to win at a time when she was losing\nSo you don't have to win or New Hampshire primary to make to make them oh waves across the country so especially as Elizabeth Warren's the front runner she's from Massachusetts neighboring Massachusetts\nThe candidate who comes in second and third ah I can get momentum as a result\nYeah 'cause I think Clinton finished third right yeah that's right yeah so so but you have to win place or show in New Hampshire to advance do you have to\nYeah that's right that is correct and I just I don't think people understand about the the democratic nomination process this cycle is that California has moved up yeah and they're going to happen that's expensive state and Kamala Harris McConnell Harris was going to have a big lead there\nYes and that's the thing that's going to be an interesting thing I didn't hear that you guys talked about that she would put it on the Iowa\nA conversation but what she does in the early primary states will be interesting given the California moved up will she tried well we'll see try and uh and and pick a state to land was to try and do well in all of them and um you know because they're so different so early primary states ... compared to California\nWell again I think you have to at least try to compete in some of these because the reality is even though you might not win New Hampshire you won't matter and the the the nomination legitimately so\nYou still have to win in the in the electoral college not quite sure if you can't you can't just blow past Iowa New Hampshire because those are those who have gone in either direction like especially with Trump winning Iowa last time that's right no doubt about it what issues are dry New Hampshire voters these days what's going on up there\nWell ... ... uh uh the economy is still the number one issue um the governor here a is a Republican Christian new new and he's\nAnd uh uh with what Donald Trump's been to an end and governor Sununu the economy's booming we have the second lowest unemployment rate in the country\nAnd um or the Democrats don't want to talk about that they're trying to talk about anything but the economy with\nA family you know ... paid leave issues ... they're just trying to make up an issue that might connect with voters authors in the economy so that's going to continue to be number one the second issue here Chris I I don't know how it how it works in other states and you've heard Donald Trump even talk about this is the opioid epidemic\nThrough a which is pretty ... pretty severe in New Hampshire so that's the second\nThat number and everything we've had we've had\nWe've had that disease in our family as well and so it's a scourge has a number of people dying as a result of that is\nThe doors or anything else to go to our country and it said they will get a handle it and I don't think that's part of it as I said it's not a partisan issue Mike a final production is what do you think coming out with got thirty seconds punch it when he got further the Democratic nominee the Democratic finishers in New Hampshire twenty twenty I\nSay it's going to go a little bit Warren a well when a extreme aren't going to win a New Hampshire primary I'm going to be I I think there's going to be kind of dark horse like a\nA R Cory Booker I expect will be somewhere in the top three um and then and then you know what I Would not be surprised if someone like Michael Bloomberg is in ... as well because I got a democratic state we need we need a bank roll up a business\nThan say All right Mike that age joining us from the Granite State of New Hampshire four hundred and eighty days plus or minus out of the New Hampshire primary thanks for joining us we'll be back on the John Frederick sure this is Chris document filling in fact my\nHow how well you know we're not a lot of guys in Louisiana and I\nMean you know should you nor should anyone involved it's constant but how do you how do you compare the intensity this year to last year what do you see the same similar not as intense when he says\nWell similar but I think we we're we're very proud particularly in Virginia last year when we send\nA message to the country into the world that you know hated bigotry have no place here and that we were open and welcoming for business\nWith the election of government or something and his team and then you got that job first set of a house candidates that got across the finish line that just beautiful tapestry of um of of of our our\nCandidates that uh women and a diverse women and I just eat up so that was that was really great but I\nThink what has happened is people's realized we have we can do this we can do this and it's just helped doubled down and we said for example the surge in the absentee balloting I'm In Fairfax\nCounty and Prince William county which our number one or two right now in the state or requests for absentee ballots you know that's good for us that's that's really good I mean we I think we're just added you know adding more excitement and enthusiasm right\nLike Clinton did was on earlier in the seven o'clock hour and he said he's he thinks the turnout is going to be forty to forty five percent that's a large that's a large a range and there but we're projecting turn out right now\nWe're just going out there looking for every single vote that way and stuff [laughter] I Know where do you\nBut we have a reason to get out there is a lot at stake and um and ah so what's going to be better than your average and it turned that I'm you know I'm not in the business of of that we're just gonna we're we're just reaching out or we can\nYou're describing ground yeah we're in a G. I. T. V. now face and we are just trying to get out of our votes\nAnd bring ever anybody else that wants to come\nIn then impressed with your with your crop of Kansas this year and last year they they definitely worked hard what struck me as a sort of an obvious one is that your good for dominance of the mill Kansas nominees\nRight at it this is definitely the year the woman I like to talk about our women candidates and then I got Shani Anthony Flaccavento out at night [laughter] I mean Jennifer Wexton\nIs is I mean and they're all they have a different kind of experience and diversity but it it's all good and it all will be a good refreshing brass I'm a for Congress and across the crops up autonomy so state senator general\nFor West End up there in the camp congressional district God we are really excited about what we see up there on the volunteers are just showing up on non\nStop and the Washington Post endorsed which is something that I'm a you know at Barbara Comstock got endorsed every other time when they're very disappointed at her and she's going to stand up comic drop and that proved not\nTo be the case so a hundred times are\nJust going to be um a congresswoman and then down and I'll just run through a real quick if you want to eat and asked me something about him but we will go down the line at lower yeah\nAnd the second district a retired navy commander in a small business woman and of course Scott Taylor got he's on his own problems with da you know trying to cheat and quite frankly and on\nAnd and and having a staff or put half fraudulent a signature on the ballot I mean that's you know that's unheard of stuff that's pretty seemingly and I I think the voters are going to reject that but but even that we you know without that we still have a fine you know could credible candidate\nWell when I when I've seen in your in your kid that you have to do obviously a female when I think it's an regardless of the outcomes and we can talk about polling and outcomes in November and you know according to the guy to pick her up and\nHe's got ... up and Coburn and Benji Williams and one was in the six or what I think it's sending a signal though is that you're going to see even more women in the future running for office regardless of party\nAnd I think it's a very healthy dynamic\nYeah yeah and I want to I Want I Want to say two things on that real quick we were really excited that Leslie cover just got moved into the red to blue a program for the D triple C but\nThe thing I think you're exactly right about women women have always um um women have always and studies show this but you know then the ones that would and I know your mom would agree with me on asked would have been\nBuilt over my heart at some of my heart is not my mother [laughter]\nI'm going away that raise my kids I got to get my degree got to pay off my line and you know\nOutcomes of points exchange was limited decided well not waiting anymore we're going to step up you know a lot ... something to offer\nAnd I I think that you we will just see more and more of that yeah because someone sad is that what I'm saying and I don't know who was you know if you're not to table you're on the menu and you can look at what is it\nState this year with women's health care law with families ah with just health care in general you know women have a lot to add to that were there and we just don't think we're both said that any more\nNo no no I don't I don't think you should and I think having the frankly it's not just that they're women but they're but they're in a certain age range to relatively speaking to me a couple of you know with an older a little younger but for the most part you're you're ... moms right the suburban mom is is is a strong voting I Want to block but a market\nBut I I think your party is obviously intentionally trying to attract\n... correct correct and um those suburban moms some of them who voted for Donald Trump I think have seen the ramifications of that vote and we are reaching out and talking to them and particularly when you take something like the Kavanaugh's nomination where you know set aside the fact\nOf whether you didn't they didn't really Dr Ford this was a man who temperament we've solved by his temperament that has not fit to be a judge and then add on to it the fact\nOf you know her very compelling tested testimony and I'm In and day you know Republicans decided not to believe ... they're going to be some ramifications from that\nUm let's talk about mostly Coburn moving from into the three\nD. triple C a red to blue program\nUm then you're you're making the news here in the John Frederick radio show this morning we've had the other folks make news about ethanol in Iowa and Steve bullock is a potential outsider and how it bothered to New Hampshire wheels [laughter] you're you're ... three for three but my colors here\nSo this was news luckily Coburn is moving into this special category of funding from the deep triple C talk about that\nWell we just we just got the information ourselves and that just shows you know that's an open seat we've always thought it was very competitive and ah we we are pleased to see that on the inside the beltway group recognize that as well she's Seventy two thousand miles in our car you know the ... district has\nReally really dig it goes from up in the fall care counting all the way down to the north Carolina line it's got a lot of different you know rural but you know stop Charlottesville area and I tell you it's got\nYou know and then you got sort of the D.C suburbs with foster care so you got a little bit of everything but she is really a campaign in every part of that district and um and I think that you know here you're sharing it towards the end they finally you know solve the value in investing more in her\nWell it also says hey they have the resources to do it right\nWell that's a good point too I think that is and if you've seen the articles that you know that our candidates\nRaising 'em a Republican in combat it's like you look at gate brat versus average I'll stand her her\nI mean she out raised him three don't why maybe I guess last um [noise] I guess this gets recent foul language course on on any of that that's just what we're seeing all across the board [noise]\nYeah I think that my my small donations to which is like really gratifying to see that as small diners are the ones that really investing you show up and knock on doors and time bank and ah and ...\nWell I think that's showing up obviously in the polling generic ballot is a little behind where are you all were last year at the end of the day\nOr energy just follow the if you just follow those those numbers and the data you probably do quite well election day maybe not as large as the nominee that happened in Virginia last year but you know showing up on the ground um I I think the Democrats are going to have another a happy day here again kind of nice to stay\nIn this little plug Michigan seems on back from the thirties but a Susan ... a really appreciate your calling him best of luck down the stretch final word what's the what's

to be um the thing uh taking assigned to a baseball game well he actually his son made that was a national although it did make that he made it as a pitcher I Believe is fantastic is uh he's supposed to be starting either today or tomorrow and on Sunday and I started like two days\nJohn John where you wish you the best way is Joe Joe the best down in Florida I'm after his Astros took it on the chin last night against the Boston Red Sox I turned it off a little bit early I think a turn off in the eighth inning and that was it looked like there was a it was wrapped up there this is Chris accident\nI Am a filling in I Do this occasionally\nI'm I'm a former member of the Virginia house of delegates I surf from two thousand two the two thousand ten and currently I'm the executive director of Virginia\nFree the foundation for research and economic education Virginia free is a nonpartisan underlined nonpartisan boldly non partisan or a pro business out of the advocacy organization here in the comic they're not for Thirty years I'm not only a pro business we're also very much\nA working towards responsible pro business govern because as we heard in the\nIn the news updates Mike we heard that China's economy is slowing down its growth and that's a problem they have a significant debt burden and their economy is slowing its growth down there\nYou know you're trying to like be be that guy and that has that has devolved to where we are today largely as a result of several factors\nI'm Wondering the Iraq War to the collapse of the economy in two thousand and eight and a and that has led to this massive worldwide suspicion of government or what's going on today this unsettled place that we are in this world\nIs not just manifesting itself in the United states we are not alone in this in this in this cultural shift is manifesting itself in politics\nIt's showing up in Hungary in Poland and in Germany over the weekend in Bavaria which is actually I ran into a [laughter]\nGerman political teacher who weekend\nFancy that right he's on the exchange program I didn't want to go to the vet and like I my wife told me if I really don't want to go to someone was football I Want to chill out Sunday night was a great game on why oh go you'll have fun okay find some sort of deter German teachers\nTrying to have a conversation and thinking I don't know any German right and what are you going to do ... you know your voice [laughter] how's Hitler you know [laughter]\nYou know where do you go with that conversation well it turns\nAnd um and I and I said so how are the electricity in Bavaria because they're very has their elections on Sunday it was a very important election in Germany\nThat's the kind of guy and that's what I follow and well this one teacher was a ... a teacher of politics so then we went down a rabbit hole two hours later after dinner table we just we just were chewing up politics\nAnd when you tell me about the very was\nIs that is extremely successful economically it is the richest region of Germany for full employment like three percent unemployment youth unemployment is extremely low\nOr their school system is set up to get people to work straight away um if if you're like a tenth grade and you're not you don't really want to go to university you don't have to fake it to make it you can go right into a a a trade school with apprentice program and you're gonna get a job and you get a diploma so they get um really it's a it's a very work intensive area they\nThey pride themselves culturally\nOn work and productivity an organization and good government\nRight there it was like a it's not like a shining example of how you would want to have a state where a region actually be everyone's employed there was a job\nYou have any functions ah and it works well they had this major upset in the very intellectual and you go what are you upset about what what could you possibly be that concerned about\nThat you basically blow up this I don't know if they blow it up but how does major upset in the ruling party that had been has been in control\nFor decades last probably the ... the ruling majority in Bavaria and it was stunning to me to realize that we're not immune from that here and here in America so people say\nYou know the economy Republicans Raleigh economy's going so great both for us\nPeople don't vote on yesterday's news they don't vote on today's news they vote on the future where are we going where what is going to be happening that's my fear that's my concern because well things are going well you know with Donald Trump got elected\nGasoline was about two twenty five a gallon now it's around two eighty a two thousand eight was four dollars a gallon or better but are we getting better are we getting worse\nYou know we see here that China news today about their economy is slowing down its growth rate of growth\nAnd that has a factor on the human psyche about how how's it going to manifest itself in my life you see these commercials they're not all about you know skills and here's my dad says there about\nThis guy is awful she's horrible there ... there but there's no big overriding issue like here's what we're going to do in the future it's just that the other person's really bad therefore they're not going to be good for you um and therefore because you kind of is going to say well they're gonna hurt the economy I guess this is what they strapped relations and the subconscious\nBut I'm going what is the big driving issue other than obviously Donald Trump and it's a fascinating\nTime in American politics are what are reasons why I Do what I did because it is so interesting but also to teach people as I used to tell my my students I really don't care I really don't care [laughter]\nWhat you think I care that you think if I can encourage people to be more interested about what they're talking about too\nTurn create a better outcome for the rest of us and I tell my students I don't care who you vote for I just care that you vote but if you don't vote I understand that's also a vote in itself because you were saying I'm not I'm not doing this I vote none of the above\nAnd it's and that's and that's tabulate in it'll aggregate itself just like the vote will and that people do that doesn't make any sense\nActually it does if you don't show up for something the two political parties going to try to get you to show up next time we're trying to reach out to you in some way shape or form that data point will register\nI told her to a of a family I was at a baseball game\nAnd they were so upset or you just can't stand voting and I did not vote if they haven't earned your vote don't vote and tell them that you don't put it on social media like you would anyone else anything else say I'm not voting you haven't earned\nMy you haven't got me off my couch off my duff\nTo go down and say I'm voting for this person you don't register it'll aggregate data and that raw data that collects and is dissected by the political class to determine what they want to do 'em and they and that in every election the swings on the undecided voter right the independent voter in October is like oh we're going to\nStop talking about these issues that motivate our base to a degree we're going to focus on these oh I'm really happy to work with the other side received is now in\nIn certain cans I'll work with the president what shows up the polling independence they might not like President Trump but when they agree with something you better work with him to get cars that they just you know all politics is personal not just walk anyway this is Chris accident filling in for John credits if you tuned in to hear me droning on\nAbout politics and government was this guy a I'm a former member of the house of delegates I'm filling in for John ... as I Am wants to do a as John is on vacation with his son down in Florida in a baseball tournament a John as a baseball fan probably looking as well but he was a pitcher in college and his son Joe Joes a picture\nOf you want to call and ask me some questions love to hear from you eight eight eight four five six four six eight eight four five six four six eight eight forty eight oh five six four six four you can taxidermy straight away five four zero to nine four zero six eight zero five four zero\nTo nine four zero six zero I'm going to have some great experts on later today quaint and kick CRISPR Newport Jack was simply Republican Party every congressman Rob Wittman\nA doctor Robin McDougal from the Virginia Commonwealth University while their school and Jesse Harris from Iowa who is a political operative and uh as as on the Democratic side in from the Republican side from New Hampshire it we'll hear from identity and Susan sweater or my good friend from the Central Valley\nOf we're I'm no citizen for you know gosh early nineties I think\n[laughter] I certain aging yourself there's there isn't\nA Democrat a chair a chair of the Democratic party Virginia\nIs from highland county ... county I used to represent and they've known citizen for for decades and so we have we have a great friendship and and I'm looking forward to having all these callers calling today stir up the conversation on our big go a little deeper we're going deeper today in politics we're going to go deeper dive in not just the public polling the top one numbers but how those posters got to go\nWhen a university does\nA polling like CRISPR Newport you'll hear acquaintance you're talking about this they start with a very broad universe\nUm and it keeps coming down to a smaller University of actual likely voters minutes and we'll get to the will get into the nitty gritty well we'll get you take you do a deeper dive so when you look at the polls when you go to real clear politics which\nWhich I spend unfortunately way too much time on 'em but I guess is healthier than other websites right [laughter]\nThis is a healthy Internet\nAh it's it's a a ... you look at these different polls and and you go like we'll just to just take a look at the uh\nThe polls on the generic ballot it's insane what uh what what we're looking at here hold up its it's fascinating like generic ballot follow this truck plus Democrats plus a Democrat suppose five Democrats plus eleven\nDemocrats possible having Democrats plus one what how do you get there\nDid you say the polling is wrong well poems always right it's just data you're collecting other people call what the differences isn't the methodologies who you're going I talked to one leading I'm\nDemocratic source and I said okay\nWhat's your polling showing me he said Democrats around mid low thirties thirty four thirty three percent started to that range Republicans we've never seen self identification for Republicans is while it's around twenty four percent and what used to be you know thirty four thirty four is now\nThirty four twenty four and independents are up around the load of been forties because Republicans have never been lower on self identification but we haven't picked up any of those voters they're all self\nIdentifying now as independents that is huge and when you get down to it with people when they understand what's really going on that's when they get more excited more engaged this is Chris X. men feeling for John Frederick it eight for eight oh five six for six states to come on back\nHappy birthday to have a beer you know we put a picture of us have is her brother with this with the Budweiser may not just reminded me so much of my friendship and I'm a black how blessed I wasn't having it in my life but also\nA what a what a blessing and it's just to be alive right to be able to ah just to be experienced at all and I'm Wondering is I I enjoy coming in during his radio show where they get to hopefully get people excited about politics um it gets a does governor lives it is important you know we can't break down we have to work with each other\nTo get good things that we should have the debate though we should have a vibrant vigorous debate that right moves the country forward um and we shouldn't be afraid to have that debate but we should have in a in a civil manner and I think today we see it or a lack of civility more and more and that's difficult\nIn my professional life I Am the executive director Virginia free the foundation for research in economic education and uh uh we're fiber Wednesday three see sex and were nonpartisan which is a great lane to be in these days because everyone is oh\nI'm not really I don't have to be actually I'm paid\nNachos [laughter] even matter right oh yeah [laughter] get healthcare so [laughter]\nWhat we did was we represent businesses and uh we have a membership and we tried to do is educate them on politics and as a former teacher and a former business person my family at a bottle of water business for years old a couple of years ago\nA blessing um you know I I like getting people excited about learning about politics seeing it differently and what that makes me do it was on an even deeper like you know when you when you go to the teacher subject get better with other subjects they have to really get engaged in the subject\nSo it's an everyday I get to learn more and more about politics it's it's a it's a deep interesting topic because it brings in culture\nAnd a economics and history that was a history major so I I get to bring down altogether because it manifest itself as Andrew Breitbart said in the last that last segment you know culture is down politics is downstream of culture so if you want to impact culture of their politics impact culture first and foremost suffer your cultural evil\nLeader you'll be you'll be a political year give us a call it eight four five six for six we got some great guess calling into that are not just congressman Rob Wittman but also the leaders of the two major parties here in Virginia posters Clinton kid and Robin McDougal and then two operatives one from Iowa\nAnd one from New Hampshire we're only I hate to say this because you're probably second tier election is already in the midterms we are four hundred and Seventy two days away from the Iowa caucuses\n[noise]\nHundred and Seventy to his now it seems like a long time but let's be honest as soon as this election is over you're going to start hearing reports back from Iowa and New Hampshire\nAnd we're going to be at the forefront of that we're going to get calls here we're going to chewed up there with us from operatives Republican and Democrats\nTo see what's going on the ground I think Trump Scott the lock on the nomination you never know you never know you never know goodness knows you never know with Donald Trump because um that that that that's that's who knows it actually does what he says it says you can do but you never know what's gonna happen around it\nAnd I think that's one of the more interesting parts about politics today is because\nHe's brought that dynamic of ... or what next and that sort of it was if you remember from your days in the school or or at work you know when the leader changes and it's like a substitute teacher what's this going to be like your\nYou know you get you get a new boss or whether it's a\nIt's there's just the newness and from\nSince June fifteenth of twenty Fifteen this has been a very different political dynamic are not necessarily unhealthy because it has made us think and react\nDifferently and respond differently and I don't think that's necessarily on healthy ah but we do have you ever vigilant to make sure it does not become too unhealthy and I think people are recognizing that we have\nAh some some discourse in this country that can be improved we can get better at that as a people and how we do that is every day one on one with each other you want to impact politics if you want better representation be better people\nSort of comes down to um they represent us and if you want them to be better it's up to us to be better\nSo it was called an eight four five six for six we'll talk about post\nAttention to first and foremost is what I check every day I'm On the real clear politics they give you the um average of all the different polls and then they break down the individual polls\nAre now poll should be looking at what are called Elvie likely voters polling companies should have an understanding of who they imagine are going to be showing up on election they should have a pretty good handle on that may battling began in Virginia about a month ago so that we should know who's actually voting\nI'm In Virginia in or you can always tell my Arlington because they're the tabulate in their uh their absentee ballots as friends of mine who are tracking that to see what kind of\nA who's voting relative to the last round of elections to see what the intensity is\nBut when you look at the at the averages of the generic ballot them or this is why I Do this is why I Do that in twenty Seventeen when governor Ralph Northam defeated at Gillespie he won by eight point\nNine three percent a point nine three points the generic ballot on that day was nine point one if I'm trying to instruct the class what do you want to follow Fox News Reuters Rasmussen CNBC Emerson Maris Quinnipiac\nWilder pool poll a CRISPR Newport which one do you follow follow generic ballot right now because that is that is fairly proximate to what happened last year and the year before and twenty sixteen\nIf you look the generic ballot in twenty six team it was very close it was like the tide and Republicans over performed on election day by about a point and they want an a generic congressional ballot\nI'm obviously Trump lost by about three points a nationally three million votes um so that's something to consider when you're saying okay we're just going to go I think\nI think the the objective view here is look at the generic ballot look at the average and you can pretty much extrapolate where it is right now\nIf the election they were held today and because it's on that basis it it takes away the the partisan lens you might have or a would be inclined to\nIf at nine point one percent the dams won by a point nine nine point one point nine that's very close\nAnd they are at seven point six right now it is safe to assume that they will not perform as well as they did in twenty Seventeen but still will win and likely when the house of representatives given the the dynamics in the Senate very different because you have individual races\nLikely that Republicans a hold on to the Senate what's the dynamic that if the Democrats have the house and Senate Republicans have the Senate what's going to have the next two years and that's how you can sort of figure out\nWhere this thing is going so that you can understand what you need to do or not to like myself I don't watch cable news I don't watch broadcast news every papers in the morning ... times Wall Street journal and I get mine on information what's going on in the economy in politics and culture and whatnot\nAnd then leave it alone don't listen to you know the the uh the national talk radio shows I go to work\nAnd I think most voters do that if you look at the the aggregate numbers of you know the Fox news of the world and the MSNBC it's a very small subset of the American population but they're the they're the most active\nVoters they are the ... they're the activists so those shows are pretty much you're broadcasting to the activists\nAbout what they want to hear about the messaging points that they're\nThey they they're supposed to repeat so when you watch when you go to Facebook or Twitter or Snapchat or Instagram or whatever they're very different social media platforms\nYou see the replica repetition of the message and you're like wow I I go to a town hall after I got like a congressional town all my friends you know if there is now in Congress there were ...\nI watch them and take the questions from the audience is like where did she get this information it's fundamentally wrong but they're really upset I mean angry not pleasant not understanding but what do they show up for\nToday show up because they're angry they are concerned but more importantly like anyone else in the world who just wanted to hurt right how important\nIs that in a conversation to hear what the other person is is really feeling it gets down to okay what is that what what is what is making you that upset oh 'cause there's no no no\nThat's that's the operative subject matter [noise] what is triggering this fear and when you get down into the into the nuts and bolts you you really can't understand why people do what they do and hopefully get them to a better place in station life and it's not easy to do\nBut it's a it's it's what we do it in a democracy in the public and form a democracy which we have\nIn America thank God I'm so we can just live more peacefully amongst each other governors self self governance I think it's really important historical concept and I think we've lost sight of that a little bit it's easy to\nUh but more importantly it's tougher for folks to point out that he was like what we can do better you can do better calm down we got this I mean are are you have too many TV channels at night do you have too many options are they are too many restaurants and grocery stores around you\nIs it too good are you afraid you're gonna lose all this mean it's it's crazy how good life isn't suburban America um rural America has a lot of challenges growing challenges urban America has a lot of challenges growing challenges", "show_name":
