mansion in a tremendous Fox polls are showing in their states there is overwhelming support for judge Kavanaugh especially now that\nSomehow be down on western supporters to the point that they don't vote 'em and then can simultaneously encourage Comstock I'm I'm supporters to vote so it's a real up he'll challenge [noise]\nOkay so let me ask you a few questions I\nLooked at the cross tabs and I just have a couple of questions if I may sure um I didn't see him break down for a range obviously Tom stocks much stronger in western part of the reason I didn't see a regional breakdown\nHere because we didn't wait on it um [laughter] we we we we try to wait as minimal as possible um you know serving in the intro we wait on race and sex and I'm an age\nAnd um we don't wait on\nRegion I I'm simply uncertain about ... you know how comfortable I Am waiting on returning a congressional district survey I'm with a smaller sample size if I had\nFifteen hundred respond and I'd feel more comfortable doing it but we have seven hundred and Ninety correspondence here which is larger than some of the other polling that's come out um you know it's a respectable sample size but when you start breaking a congressional district down into regions\nYou're talking about moving um or waiting I'm you know thirty and forty voters at a time and I'm simply uncomfortable methodological doing that and so we didn't wait a sub regionally which which is how you would characterize sub originally within the congressional district [noise]\nSo just a kid having said that since you know breakdown of region and I understand your reasoning um\nThe way I looked at you told [noise] forty six percent\nOf your correspondents were making over a hundred and fifty thousand dollars [noise] obviously if you live in that area that's about what you make so I get that\nA sixty four percent were making over a hundred thousand but what that says to me it's really didn't sample\nThe western part of the district at all which is Barbara stronghold because I'm her voters they're make well under a hundred thousand dollars going out into the Winchester area\nSo sure but I think for a\nOf respondents are making under a hundred thousand dollars and um the the the the larger part of the population in that district is\nWhat you're saying is the voters are there's more voters in the east and they make more money\nAbout twenty five percent you know you told us not enough to put a Barbara in a I'm In a competitive position is that the way to understand that\nYeah well I mean you generally that's what I'm saying I'm the income breakdown looks very similar to what the district looks like so if you look at age if you look\nAt education if you look at all the basic demographics I think we're accurately reflecting the district pretty well I'm recognizing their uh Barbara Comstock stronger on the western side of this reporting on the eastern side of the district it also is the fact that the west side of the district is\nPopulation is much smaller much lower than the more urban and suburban eyes the eastern part of the district\nSo what other question I have is um and I appreciate your coming out because I'm sure this is fun normally you know you just say what you're told as I really tried to spend some time to figure it out [noise] um\nSo according to your poll Barbara Comstock is leading latch standing by one where a\nJudge for forty five plus right correct farmers winning that group forty five an older is it possible you may have over sampled a younger vote in the ... district\nUm now if you look at our cross ... if you look at our demographic breakdown our our age [noise] you know here's the deal we know what the age distribution of the district is because we know what the voting population is with census data and so\nUm you know we're talking to about twenty five percent of voters who are thirty five an under um Seventy five percent of voters or [noise]\nOr a thirty five an older in uh actually eighty percent of voters or thirty five an older so we're not over sampling young voters in disproportionate to their share of the voting age population in the district um you know the district looks\nThe demographics of the survey look look pretty much like what the district looks like um [noise] and we have we have access to all this sort of data so we we know what the district's gonna look like [noise]\nSo you've also um have low approval ratings and the district by President Trump I'm just approved fifty nine percent approved thirty eight percent and along with that\nAlthough you didn't told a Senate race you said that you did ask the question within the district and the change was meeting store or\nIn the ... district by Twenty one fifty five\nTo thirty four which basically is doomsday for stored I mean you can't I mean what if it I mean I've said this over and over and over having run the Trump campaigned in Virginia in two thousand sixteen I mean we carried south West Virginia is five big numbers\nBut when you lose Fairfax I think we lost Fairfax Alexandria in Arlington\nYou just can't make up stuff I mean there's there's not enough people in Radford to make that up you simply can't make it up it's just too many yeah and and I\nAnd I think you know you pointed out Trump's approval and you pointed out\nUm the Senate race numbers and we did those uh because we wanted the test really what we think are the two ... two of the big things that are shaping this election in the ... um what kind of headwinds are coming out of Washington\nI'm a related to Donald Trump and are\nThere coat tails or lack of ... or negative coattails when it relates to the Senate race and in both of those situations\nAnd then Comstock is facing strong headwinds I'm Out of Washington a lot of her constituents aren't happy with the president and what he's doing and what Republicans are doing and Corey Stewart isn't helping in any way in fact he's probably hurting because\nPeople who aren't excited about coming out to\nVote for a Senate race or a half to get excited about their local race\nAnd if they're not excited about their local racer likely not to turn out to vote and you know so that means Republicans who would otherwise be excited about Corey Stewart and aren't a Barbara Comstock has to work extra hard to attract their attention to say look you need to come out and vote in this congressional race even if you're not happy about Cory steward\nOr something\nJust a kid that you can glean from the polling in the day she spent an incentive strict what if if you could give a figure or I'm a ballpark to what degree is Corey Corey Stewart on the ballot as\nTo what degree is hurting barber ability to get reelected like if you were put it on a scale of one or two in one day much Ted being a yeah big time what would it be based on your readers Paul\nWell probably somewhere below five I'm probably somewhere between two and five or three and five I mean I think to some extent he's been baked into the to the calculation for ... to ... you know for some voters but I Do think there is it is\nThe case that turnout is typically higher in the U.S Senate race than it is in a local congressional race\nAnd so if you happen to have a U.S Senate race going on in the same year that your local congressional races going on and you're or Senate candidate is way ahead\nAnd you need those coat tails that's good for you and Barbara Comstock doesn't have that this year\nShe's got um a than a candidate who's running behind 'em by anywhere from ... we have I'm Twenty one points behind in this district state why he's running behind anywhere Fifteen or twenty points that's not helpful to Comstock it's hurtful to her because she has to work her campaign has to work extra hard\nTo reach out to those voters who would otherwise be engaged because they were engaged by the Senate race she's gotta work extra hard to reach out to them and say look I Need you to still be engaged for me and I think that's part of the problems he's having\nSo I think it would be fair to say listen you have to have the\nSeventh district and the second the other two competitive was\nA I Would say so I Would think you're probably gonna gonna see that Stewart thing a drag on all the Republicans in Virginia ... who are in competitive races because of the toxicity of of some of the things he's said and done All right I've only got\nA minute are we going to get you back on or you got to do a poll on a second and the seventh also\nWe are in the field we went into the field last night on the second I'm surrounded after we took this went out we went into the field on a second will come out and about eight days with that and then we're going into the field and the seven um and will come out um later October on the seven so we're spending our\nSeason doing congressional point because the Senate race doesn't look very competitive [noise]\nAll right well we should have a lot of fun that means we'll have you went back at least two more times of that and then we'll keep our tradition and have you on the day of the election to make your final Tony predictions Dr Clinton said thanks for being with us Abigail burger how many\nAnd you know from a teaching perspective it was a really interesting place to teach 'em some of the kids were as local American from northern Virginia but you know it was it was a very interesting place to teach and and and be the American teacher that all of these diplomatic children had as they're kind of point of reference\nAnd someone who later went overseas and my colleagues had their kids in\nAmerican schools are broad you know part of the cultural learning is having the teachers who are local area to teach their language teach their culture and so it was actually a really interesting experience\nFor me to be kind of American English teacher for a bunch of young kids who many of whom were returning to their countries of origin when their parents diplomatic time in the U.S whatever\n[noise] so it sounds like what you're saying it's the jobs that your\nYour personal and professional situation and you simply thought it would be interesting\nRight now pretty much yeah okay\nLet's get to this for you um you claim that your staff did uphold research on yourself it's settled for your request never got a response back from the government\nYet when CNN did afford that on your own for yeah they said oh forty was never submitted so there's a discrepancy there how do you reconcile that up and go\nFor starters I Would say that ... so we hired an outside investigator to do a background investigation on me in and basically determine what once the information that someone politically aligned with my opponent would gather around me and then try to use against me um\nWhen the U.S postal inspection service which notably that was the entity for which where I actually worked on the differences which what America Rising did on behalf of the congressional leadership fund or if they filed a poor with national personal record center which is a different entity\nRight on the personal inspection service on their website um requires that all four years I've requested operators be submitted the amount\nWhich is what our individual Dan um and yeah and the response was never received back from us or we've never received anything back over all that didn't look particularly kids are alerting or problems with problematic to me because our only goal is to\nUnderstand what would be the experience of someone else who was forty minute drive up\nBut then that's even though you did before you get a response CNN said they could afford on your Florida and\nIt was no record of it so yeah there's also\nThe same entertaining that release my underrated actor personal national security questionnaire um so I mean at this point\nI had a little I have a little bit less face and the fact that they are following the steps that they should be following I mean they're the real the real issue here is the U.S postal service in violation of federal law depriving react ... released\nMy national security questionnaire which is a\nFully protected document in providing and I'm practicing background background investigations and providing clearances and I of course your secret secret\nClearance for my time in law enforcement and top secret clearance with special compartment in a capacity as for my time with with CIA and so the violation was when the U.S postal service violated the law by releasing that and then of course later\nIt was distributed and then it fully unproductive swarmed by another entity [noise] so are you saying\nThat the spanberger seem absolutely you're saying that you absolutely set the for your request now you're claiming that based on the top of that serve them releasing all of your unprotected information it's not\nOut of reason to think that they were on top of that and not being able to find the for you that you also but\nI'm actually saying that it's a distraction from the real violation of law and the violation of law Kirkland the postal service broke the law by providing my information and one of the pieces of the story and it's also not reported on is that the national\nPersonnel records center actually initially denied the forty a request when we ... the way that America Rising city and um and so there's so\nMany more question for the situation but really what it boils down to you and there is a violation of federal law my national security questionnaire which is the document that anyone who's speaking of security security\nClearance filled out and those are not members of our military members of law enforcement numbers are the intelligence community chilling out they provide their detailed personal information not just about themselves but about other people in their lives on very detailed information\nAnd in the law and raining outside organization received that document they proceeded to pass it on two members of the media without taking steps to protect my Social Security number my medical history any of that [noise]\nWell that was irresponsible no question about it\nSo as far as the information generally do you think it was just in toppling by somebody that just didn't know what they were doing or you think there was some kind of a conspiracy\nThere's currently an ongoing investigation and so I I Can't necessarily comment on that topic\nArt fair and square and now let's get to a debate\nEurope Conan brat has said when we talk with campaign about the debate he said that you had not officially committed to any debates beyond the first one in October Fifteen which is going forward on your team put out a very strongly worded statement blasting day for backing out\nA saying that they were supposed to be three debates of course the third debate was with me which hasn't been set so that date has not been said even though I've I've asked about a hundred times a\nOut from the schedule debates I mean were they scheduled for ...\nYeah so you know he's he's talked on your show about the fact that we've agreed to multiple debate we had identified location we identified a place uh our teams independent walk through\nA they've done to\nWalk through other location we had told media partners we had the media lined up a local TV station that was going to [noise]\nTo Aaron everything was set up the only thing we had done without\nA press release um and that was something that we had been I'm pushing for and certainly the host and the media partners had been pushing for\nUltimately then after a couple of weeks in and you know John I'm not the one taking the primarily down there but I think about two weeks has our team the host and the television station trying to get\n'em you know trying to get approval on how to put out the the wording on us we were told that he would no longer be committed to doing that second debate that we had already detailed\nAnd that he would in fact or his team would in fact confirm it on the day of the sixteenth of October whether or not we would in fact to move forward with the with the debate\nScheduled for the ... okay so\nAs far as now the debate on the twenty third which is which was the second televised debate is not a done deal even though other team to walk through they want to wait and see how the debate on the fifteenth and I know\nI mean I I'm not going to sign their their reasoning for wanting to wait until the sixteenth it it\nIt seems like a plausible reason but they they did not provide us with the reason why they want to wait until the sixteenth denouncing farm I you know there's been staffing changes soccer team that might have been a contributing factor but overall when we set up the parameters of the debate one of the things that were important to arts\nUm and certainly from North to south stretches quite a quite a long distance that it was important to have the ability to have to\nYou know throughout the district north center of the district middle district in southern portion that district said vigils would be able to attend on and and that was something that was a priority because now are the first and as of right now the only debate isn't\nVery northern part of the district which is a pretty place has a pretty significant burden on anyone coming from the southern portion district or even in the center of the district to get through the colpepper particularly\nGiven the time of the debate will might have noticed that the tickets for that one they sold out within less right on and there's many many individuals have reached out to our campaign saying that they try to get tickets but were unable to do so\nWell and uh my debate which was the third debate\nGotten a date from David team\nThe standard of shame I just want to mention that said that um they ah said that they they have they've given me a bunch of day to go back to date team\nWith we've not been able to get that done either hopefully we'll get that done to the next week or so okay let's get the judge Kavanaugh you're on the John

off year elections are about one thing you know what it is\nThe number of Trump surrogate son every single one that gets blasted somebody do a story on object something else they did this and they just didn't the Paris for the other day did this\nI mean eventually CNN and it's not going to have a single person to come on to represent tropics [laughter] they just take them they just take them out one by one\nAnd so I mean this\nIs literally need the opposition party they the the the opposition party I mean the media part of the Democratic party era when was the Democratic party there aren't interested\nIn telling the truth then this whole New York times story on this whole taxes saying that we saw some unremarkable within the demonstrators that President Trump called the ...\nIt's like it or he didn't come up with some crazy thing to break the law on taxes or anything like that they demonstrated they didn't follow the law\nThis whole thing that the media the ... it's just another one thing after another after another after another it's nonstop when are they going to report this stuff about what President Trump is\nActually on the economy and everything\nAnd I I don't think they're going to do that where they report stuff on the successes edition insurance she's happy they are interested in doing that and the reason being is is that they're using their\nPower their media platforms to push their agenda the difference between them and us though is is that we seem to be brave part by the way it regulates Israel's point of view we are very open about it though that's the difference between\nRussia and CNN or us in the New York times or the Washington Post then we'll Whitey the claim that their objective they're not\nThey push for a certain point of view and that's fine they have every right to do that okay they're private companies just like we ... we on but we are honest with our audience we tell our audience were would point of view are coming from they know what they're getting more and more talk and I think the fact that these media companies are\nLying to the people on to their audience is is disgusting and despicable and I ... I I think it's the biggest why in the last forty years and in the American media or that they claim to be objective because no person\nIn this country can be addressed you you just can't every decision that you may hear from what had mine to use to who you interviewed a what stories in your coverage so which ones you don't and so on and so forth all play into\nA all play into a ... a ... everything has the opportunity for the insertion of buy spray like instead of a everything every decision you make is informed by your beliefs\nAnd so I think you're making these decisions on a used to be honest with your audience about what you believe as soon as they know what they're getting when they get there and then you can still tell the truth you still have\nThe opposite accuracy rate but the plan is is that the\nAll of these media outlets claimed to be objective reclaiming either the sole truth but they're now they're coming from a perspective\nAt that point of view as much as we don't want to know that their their company like CNN fine your mission is to take out President Trump just tell the people that just be honest with\nHonesty is the best policy twins you can see on the John ... radio network where when Matt boy at least a political editor of Breitbart News don't want to miss Breitbart News just download the app Breitbart News and then you get to go So Matt\nThese midterms coming up if Kavanaugh gets confirmed on ... on a Saturday and I and I think you will uh we've just got a new generic poll coming out by quarter pack and it shows that the enthusiasm gap\nThat the Democrats enjoy plus sixteen has been cut to plus for\nWeakening that the generic ballot a\nCongressional house ballot was Democrats plus fourteen three weeks ago that's cut in half plus seven is there a comeback in the making for Republicans I think\nThey're at and by the way there is a mirror is Paul I'm from NPR's new PBS out yesterday that I think it was something like back in the summer it was the Democrats had a ... point\nA I'm a enthusiasm gap a manager now\nThen now it's it's good statistically tied it's only a to point advantage to the point is that we're seeing lots of evidence uh and and we're also seeing in particular races right like so in North Dakota\nIt looked like Heidi Heitkamp isn't coming back to Washington okay there's been now to polls there was one poll the other day or that had are down ten points there's a poll I came out last night that are down ... points to Republican Kevin Cramer were seen in my in Tennessee Marsha Blackburn is now pulling\nAway the latest poll last night from Fox News\nHad Marsha Blackburn pulling five points ahead or we're seeing Senate race Senate race the Republicans are gainfully Josh salaries tied up with Claire McCaskill in Missouri were seen Mike Braun tied with a Joe Donnelly in Indiana we're seeing Matt Rosendale hybrid Jon Tester in Montana\nSo it is it I think what will happen is and there's plenty of other ones across the country as well the printing is is that\nWhen judge Kavanaugh is confirmed for the United States Supreme court it's going to\nA in a way that we haven't seen even in these this latest energy on the Republican side it's going to electrify the nation so much so that all of these guys are going to start turning into five point Republican late right like I think you're going to start seeing\nA the energy on the geo piece died a a um [noise] just electrified after a after\n... a judge Kavanaugh gets confirmed people it's going to fire people up and it's going to deflate the Democratic base\nI don't think to get the Trump base fired up which I Am very familiar because that's the case of my list or not\nThere's nothing in his campaign team could have done to light a match under Trump voters like this Kavanaugh saying that\nI mean so many people just watch this an absolute horror and disbelieve the shenanigans in the clowns show that went on in the Democratic judicial many I think as far as people up and\nYou're right you know there's there's one poll before this started high campers what your saying that she was like tied down by one and it was like it was\nActually was only down by like a couple of points now is right now it seems is down ten to twelve\nYes every poll she's down by twelve she's done or she is going to get reelected mansion was way ahead ride was up by twelve Fifteen now is if I pray and more she's going to be with them I don't care what match dust because Trump voters have been fired up so they're going to win that they're going to win North Carolina\nThey're going to be Donnelly and they're going to be dominated the Indiana to going to beat me ... majority [noise] she's going to lose a the astronaut in Florida he's gonna lose\nI could see the Republicans have Kevin ... wins Matt I can see the pick it up five seats or even six in the Senate five or ...\nThe way to map works right now Republicans could come out the other hand with anywhere from I think your keep order if stabbing he couldn't the arrest and God depending on how things go they've got a whole force so they've got to hold Nevada Arizona Tennessee in ... and I think they're going to do that\nYou are and then I think and then they have\nThen there's a bunch of others that are by like a sack Indiana or a Missouri Montana\nA West Virginia or Florida or North Dakota a and several others on the on the map as well in fact even in New Jersey is why are we number of all of a sudden the Senate race in the week in fact there was one yesterday\nThat had our Menendez the Democrat only up one point I so the fact is is that there's an Ohio is on the map or Michigan or Wisconsin\nThere's plenty of opportunities for Republicans I can do I mean conceivably together into the hiker if they if they play their cards right here\nIf a if Kevin against your from Saturday the Republicans can pick up six seats and run the table I'm never can say well I'm from New Jersey I I don't believe any of the folks there and that that's going to win the Democrats are always went there\nBut you know maybe I'll be shocked but I think I think they're going to run the table and everything else and it's got to be a fun night but he's got to get tougher because if he's not the opposite happened if he's not for\nEverybody that I have talked to

C. great to have you with us as always\nAt the courtroom and down the miraculous nuclear linked electric headquarters phone lines are open this where America comes to talk in the morning they for you know John eighty eight four five six ... six if you're in Richmond and we just ended a new effort that necessarily a check it out Ninety two points out an ad that\nNumerous well and also coming you a brand new talks nation W.

F. and launching October twenty fifth entered a brand new tossed they real news real people real talk WG a fan I always get the phone lines\nFor a no John let's get the John in Hampton John you're on the air\nGo to John down first of all it's just want to congratulate you on the deal was I guess you are now on a show media mogul [noise]\nWell I'm not sure about that but um you know we're\nWe're very we're very frustrated with the coverage of some of the talk stations around the area and we were certainly disappointed that we lost or affiliate\nAnti war which I was on for eight years since I started so we decided to go to a new strategy and just start to buy them and then when you do what we want and so that's a that's kind of what the goal is and and uh we're looking forward to it we'll see how it works out\nCongratulations on the show so I Know I Know it's like I just wanted to comment on\nA little girl was just ... ... talk about my comment on what what caused him to grow up here I'm going to call for culture and so on\nAnd you know John I think really just two things struck me about that the one thing that measures study on all the way through and really pretty supportive of the president has been the whole issue is on the on the lower courts and [noise] um when there's a great job there so I think\nAlso John [noise] for the first time all share the protesters get in his face\nThe one who was confronted by some more ... and I\nThink that that was probably about the dumbest thing they could have done and I brought it home personally to him and I don't think that uh I don't think that that hurt any encouraging him to do now to continue to have the\nThe steps bond somebody other Republicans have not had and I'm I'm not a big fan of CSPAN I'm also a lot walk a lot of time watching it but it was wonderful last night I watch much of a call ... speech on the floor of the Senate [noise]\nAnd it was just wonderful hearing his summing up\nHis summation of the whole you know how it got here where we are where we are going\nOn here just in just a beautiful job by his kind of put down to ... it's kinda tough to listen to some times but he just to the\nBill is point by point sharp and to me I Know left and right irreconcilable right now but it just seems like anybody who was willing to listen to reason [noise] um he just did a terrific job of land and out here's where we are and here's why we're here\nAt uh I Wish everybody in the country could hear what he you know about the ten minutes to talk about CSPAN yesterday [noise]\nJohn you make some very good point [noise] uh as I understand what you said number one you said than that right now\nLeft and right has\nUm I have um\nDifferences that you can't be solved right now when\nThe I I I also think you're right the confrontation with McConnell and his wife at trying to go to the air port a backfired on the left because I think like you said I'm not you're not going to a gym and Amy I'm Seventy years old like I'm done with all this stuff and\nThink the third thing is I think they have them under the they they look at these Trump rallies and they looked at the Trump victory and they look at the level of support the president is able to generate because he does it back\nAnd the Republicans have\nDown for so long it's almost second nature because they don't really stand for anything except getting themselves reelected and\nI think the Lindsey Graham's in the world and the McConnell are seeing that Trump voters want something else and they will abandon them in a heartbeat if they don't stand for something and so I think that's part of it also but\nYou know look there's this is just out John You're welcome to stay on we uh you you you want but this just now the White House\nHas released a report that they have found no corroboration of the allegations of sexual misconduct against\nSupreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh this after examining interview reports from the FBI's latest probe into the judges background [noise] now it's unclear whether the White House [noise] which\nIf its review of the FBI report spot on the White House is telling us they're linking that\nThe conclusions from the report aren't definitive at this point so there's no new information Chuck Grassley the Senate Judiciary chairman said on Twitter just a few moments ago that the the the committee had received the report and\nEverybody will have a chance to look at a Raj Shah the spokesperson for the White House on this con from Mason fiasco [noise] put a statement out a few moments ago instead the White House has received the FBI investigation supplemental background investigation\nAnd it's being transmitted to the Senate but they have a link that there's nothing new in it there's no bombshell there is no cooperation\nI don't know what you have to like it's going to do now or the Democrats are going to do that simply nothing there there was never anything they're sort of had an investigation they had to wait they stole they have the hearings they had judge for Ford they had the delaying they have the obstruction they had\nThey had every now and now they're going to have to vote and let me tell you something [noise] you've got at least two Democrats right now that if they vote no they can make plans for vacation in January\nBecause Heidi Heitkamp a Joe mansion if they vote no both of them will go down in flames\nBecause the polling numbers in their states in favor of Kavanaugh is like in twenty I mean it's it's not even within the scope of reason it's like ... I think\nThe north Dakota Pulitzer was able to Eighteen or know eight to nine when nine percent undecided eighty two percent in favor capital so high camps in a box mansions in a box and dirt\nThis thing has backfired on them\nBy doing what they've done in this cloud show the Democrats are on the verge of snatching defeat from the jaws of short victory I sent this under terms or they have to do is go on vacation\nFor three months they when they can't do it John thanks for being with us Fisher\nPhone lines open for a though John editing for you know five six for six [noise] the White House has found no cooperation\nOf the allegations of sexual misconduct\nAgainst Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh\nExamining interview reports from the FBI's latest probe into the judges background [noise]\nDon't know what what else they need now [noise]\nThis has been such a stain\nThe American soul what they have put", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Dennis Prager Show", "city": "Portsmouth", "day": "04"}
