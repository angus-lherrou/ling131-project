hang on in the majority of the house\nAnd get to that place and they got fifty five fifty six they're going to be able to roll the Senate Democrats in in it 'cause that's where the problem right we can't get legislation through the Senate only sixty one Republicans the Senate right now\nAnd there's only and there's a hand for those that are insects solid on the issues right the point is is that if we can get to a place where you have sixty six five fifty six it's going to be very easy to roll the Senate Democrats were going to be able to gym that with so many major piece of legislation\nI fair Chuck Schumer to try to shut the government down or something on Wall funding at that point right like we saw while that went from last year or earlier this year is not going to go so well for

very close although I think I was going to win that I'm\nBarbara Comstock Jennifer watched intense everybody or predicting who watches than the Democrats have already filed it in their picked up box a\nI think ... gonna pull the upset but that's just me and I'm Dave Brat\nA Abigail Spanberger that's just a dead heat that's no one can predict that race because it's all about the turnout if Trump's\nIf the Trump vote turns out and they can Republicans vote for debut wins if they don't or Abigail Spanberger is ... ... it's going to defeat him and a good luck just watching her I mean she's probably the best candidate\nI'm told you this spanberger is likely the best candidate now if you're not a at the Democratic ... doesn't matter to you they're all bad if you're not a Democrat but as far as the Democrats are concerned try to win a Republican district like the seventh spanberger is likely the best candidate they've ever put up and\nCertainly the best candidate on the Democratic side of that district and likely will be the best ever so here's the good news if you're a brat\nIf you just feeding her and uh you hold on by five hundred votes you're likely not going to be defeated again when you leave it will be by your own choice because they'll never field the better candidate that will raise more money and that time where um\nThe Democrats are as motivated as they are Johns
