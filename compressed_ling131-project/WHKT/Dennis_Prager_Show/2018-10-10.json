they poll voters anybody\nIt's until they get to read until they get the result they want so they can drive a narrative that says Democrats are surging Republicans are going to lose so stay home don't

look good and many people are worried that he is he's been killed [noise]\nUm but even if he's just being held in captivity interrogators that's still great concern and we need to know that he's still

camera\nFootage of going and we have no camera footage of them coming out so if he did leave give us your internal camera footage showing him leave and then you know we'll go from there and\nThey're like uh the cameras didn't work that day that we find the good and they so they they've already said uh well how would the Solomon who the Trump Administration has you know was given a lot of leeway to has already said well he's not here he did leave\nAnd you you coming in inspector embassy or consulate but that doesn't mean anything if he's not there\nSo I I don't know how they turn around and say oh we have arrested him when they've already said that he left Mr what what'd you say put pressure\nA diplomatic pressure economic pressure what type of pressure do you do do you mean Congress\nWell then you start with diplomatic pressure I I don't think you you jumped immediately economic pressure but I think you start with a diplomatic pressure and then if you get no answers then you start working out I Would actually work on some of it yeah I\nKind of me but but more importantly a the munitions the weapons that we need help them with and that they need our help with ah they're worried about the Iran just as we are\nThey can't afford not to have an air force that can flat 'cause they get these spare parts so that's where I Would probably goes to the to the munitions Saudi [noise] [noise]\nSenator Rand Paul from Kentucky says he said last night said he's going to\nPress the government by making the Senate vote on pending us arms sales all kinds of yours arm sales as you just mentioned to Saudi Arabia as a way to put more leverage\nOn uh Mohammed than solving in order to figure out what happened to basically what Paul is saying is I\nHave a vote in the Senate

other Persians versus Arabs goes way back\nWay back in history let's get back to domestic policy congressman Horgan Griffith on healthcare Senate Democrats to they want to force a vote on a measure that would overturn the Trump administration's expansion of non violent care plans\nI Would assume the attempt to put their Republicans on record\nAgainst protections for people with preexisting conditions\nDemocrats are saying that even if they don't vote could become a potential political weapon against Republican senators in the fall in the final uh twenty seven days here\nAnd all polling shows that a majority of Americans the one thing about the ... they really like is the fact that you can't be rejected for pre existing conditions nor can your prices get jacked up\nHow did the Republicans responder\nOn him and I haven't seen the Senate bill but I Will tell you that the bill that we had in the house that we pass this is what House members could say hey protection for pre existing conditions go right into the one that we sent over to the Senate\nThe language is very clear Democrats have been you know trying to mislead people by saying that you know\nIf you stood on one foot lean to the left in the heavy when might not ... I mean it's just not accurate the pre existing\nConditions were there I was in Johnson City when the president gave his speech last week and he said we're going to protect preexisting conditions and I think that's what you respond within you know a lot of it is smoke and mirrors that the Democrats are just playing politics with just like they did with the Gavin I'll situation 'cause that's president voters' minds\nAnd we're not going to do anything to pre existing conditions had one player of the Republicans prior\nTo Obama and the Democrats take control as they never dealt adequately with fat and we're not going to make that mistake again we're going to make sure I Would marry then but we are going to make sure that people with preexisting conditions are taken care of in the house bill created\nThese invisible risk pools so the government picked up\nRegular costs you never know it if you were out in you know a doctor getting the insurance card but the government picks up that cost and that lowers everybody's costs because now the insurance companies aren't haven't put it into somebody's family who doesn't have a pre existing condition doesn't have to put those rates in are spread it around to everybody so\nThe people with a condition or taking care of and it's better for the people who don't have a pre existing condition because they're not paying that additional risk in a pool\nOr the Democrats line about this [noise]\n[noise] well there certainly per barricade and trying to you know make it appear that it's something that it isn't a they're playing a lot of clever word games and\nPut the you know there Ninety nine percent wrong there is under one scenario like I said if you stand on your left leg and then there was a heavy wind blowing that somehow a state if they could get a waiver couldn't figure out a way to get around that uh but\nYou know I just don't see it to do that very clear and I think they lose in court but that would be the Democrats attacking\nThe very issue that they think are that they are claiming that they are the champions of and you know is there a legal case that maybe\nSomebody could challenge it under certain circumstances yeah maybe but I think it was so he's pretty close to a lot but not a hundred percent they do have one little threat but they can hang on for some legal case somewhere in the future\nUm that nobody believes will actually ever happening\n\nUN ambassador Nikki Haley resigning yesterday kind of shocked the world that didn't leak she said she told the president six months ago she was going to be out after two years and the idea of what happened there\nNow you know sometimes it is just what it is you do a job you got you know you you enjoy it she said it's an honor\nBut you realize it's not something you want to do are there forever or that you're a pigeon holed in [noise] and you say okay I'm gonna give it a two years and I'm I'm On the steps that you tell the president that he says well I Hope to change your mind she doesn't and looks like it was all very friendly and [noise]\nYou know there weren't any tweets back and forth about this that or the other and you know sometimes people just move on\nReplacement idea you\nKnow I heard some names this morning but um you know we have a lot of talented people in the United states and I'm sure the president will find somebody who can do the job is as well as a former Governor Haley\nAll right congressman Morgan Griffith I've got thirty seconds tell me about the state of your campaign in district not every day\nWell it's interesting now folks are are ripped up on the Democrats dot in that race lots of money so we're we're raising lots of money to at least stay close I think they're going to outspend me I'm ...\nTo expect somebody who's one twenty seven congressional candidates at four hundred and thirty five races endorsed by the Bernie Sanders socialist leaning our revolution grew up on a tried and

policies dot org America First policies dot org this message paid for authorized by\nAmerica First policies in corporate joining us now bad boy he's a political editor and writer for Breitbart News you can follow that go to Breitbart News get their\nAct and he broke a story yesterday or\nThe majority leader\nThe house of representatives congressman McCarthy who is from California and\nA wouldn't be the leading candidate for speaker provided the Republicans hold the house wants to make Trump's wall any campaign referendum this story broke yesterday by Matt boiling is with us\nKevin McCarthy is going to be introducing a bill or later this week he's at he's actually go on a ... at the border day so he was a he flew down on the border last night he sees\nHe and his team are getting a threatening assessment briefings from our border patrol agents and law enforcement officials down there\nBut then when he gets back to Washington DC later this week he's getting a bill that fully funds to the border wall so all the rest of the money go for the border wall in addition to that has a number\nOf other enforcement measures rats Kate swap\nWhich has already passed the house that has an ending century city which is already passed the house\nOr is it as well as going out for a criminal gang members are contained in the bill I'm so all those things and a few more or other things like standing up for anything going out fairly good only in voting would all be in this bell\nAnd the important thing here is is that there's been no does have the votes to pass the\nHouse of representatives I with Republican support\nAt this stage now with only fifty one senator as it doesn't look like it would pass the Senate and this has been the reason why we don't have the\nThe wall money yet right like in this has been the whole thing right as Senate Democrats have been holding it up because that you need sixty votes in the Senate so looks like based off of these midterm elections are Republicans\nAre going to get a few pickups in the Senate seats right like so it looks like based off the latest polling and everything Republicans may get to work sixty\nFive fifty six senators\nThe question is whether or not they're going to hold the house so if Republicans do hold the house majority them this kind of a bill that fully funds the border wall can pass both the house and the Senate and we get we get into the president's desk and actually fun to walk\n[noise] so what is the amount of money that McCarthy is advocating in this bill for the wall\nA twenty four billion dollars approximately one in four billion dollars that's that's what they say they need\nAnd so we get the whole time gotten so he's got the right funding at a twenty four billion dollars now the way [noise] I read your piece McCarthy wants to make this a campaign issue a referendum if you will a wall referendum for the mid term shortfall\nYeah that's exactly right and so again if Republicans hold the majority in the house and they add a number of seats in the Senate then they're going to be able to get the wall funding the full wall funding to President Trump next year if they don't know\nIf they lose the house and the Democrats take it the the the Democrats are going to be able to block the wall and from the house just like they've been doing from the ... so the point is is that what McCarthy's build dies\nIs it make the entire election uh mid term referendum uh this this entire mid term election a referendum on the wall\nSo for open borders is voting for illegal alien crime it's a vote for M. S. Thirteen\nRight like it's ... I mean that the Democrats are the party of illegal alien crime and MS Thirteen the Republicans are the party of law and order and president\nTrump made that case over and over again so if you want the wall and the water you have to show up and vote for Republicans it's that simple and that's what this whole fight lays out but it's really it's become a referendum\nOn and many other things you don't get me wrong I don't think this election is just about immigration but it is very much about immigration\n... it's very much about immigration and many other things as well including the economy including a the ... you know what kind of country that we want to be including do you do you support the craziness\nOf the resistance that we've seen all these people that have gone off the rails with this whole time in our situation right like when the Democrats have gone nuts but the point is is that\nA ... it's very much a referendum about immigration as well\nAnd so again I if you want a border wall you got to vote for the Republicans if you don't want to ... if you want a\nLawlessness if you want illegal aliens committing murder if you want a MS Thirteen running around if you want drugs are spreading through your community or they're brought here by drug cartels vote for the Democrats by all means spray like that's what you want but I don't think the vast majority of Americans\nSupport the opioid crisis I don't think the vast majority of Americans support a MS Thirteen committing crimes in their neighborhoods I don't think the vast majority of Americans want MS Thirteen that their kids' schools by so fast the fact of the matter is is the way to stop that both public and get the war\nSo this is gonna be a national referendum on the wall McCarthy going down there today when it's going to lead us out and and by the way many great job in breaking the story and if you don't know I met boil for many of our listeners out there he is the political writer and editor

the two issues\nSo aside from that you didn't on the other recording issue which is the writer of the when John nickel voter so a lot of these countries most of them I I in fact I I'm I'm hard pressed to think of one another in Cuba or are made me very Catholic but now we're seeing something else which is a little bit more evangelical it's a form of Catholicism\nA but it's very much about spreading the word of God it's quite public [noise] it's it's even John ... um you know\nAdults being baptized in rivers and all of that\nAnd that's a new dynamic that we're seeing in Latin America you'll always kind of harm box and it has been in the sort of smaller local villagers um\nAny and seen it and you're even seeing them parts of the U.S if you go into the you know they know how the French are local churches and they called themselves can scandals as opposed to going to cost right so they they tend to Christian Catholic [noise]\nUm but it's kind of next door to consolidate his um [noise] we're seeing that in in Brazil was the biggest example because it's the biggest countries to it stands out the most and if they said we had a hundred and forty seven million voters\nIn Colombia out in an even do it as a\nPresidential remind you just you know the summer so they're changing around my tail and they're viewing and that's part of what's driving\nThe shift to the right is the rise of evangelical practice is also driving the anti left an end to end the returns from very conservative values but it's also another way of spreading the same type of\nPolitical ideology sort of getting very intertwined the politics and religion and these new themselves as\nBeing on a mission you know a on a mission trip purify the political system by bucking the system they're going they're becoming a force to themselves and um and it's it it it it's going to be interesting to watch um I'm not sure exactly how this you know how this plays out for the\nLatin America I think she just anything

swimming so in a couple of weeks so we will now where I quickly\nSo every country when you're on the first round in the second round election the second round is about like three weeks later right shape because we want to bring it to a resolution that gives them comes at parties enough time to do a better you know a messaging and a bit of I support\nThis or not that one and to form their coalition but it you know you want it resolved quickly so I think that by the end of October where we're going to have a boat so now the run off and he was going to take a hard line now he's also going to take a hard line against Cuba against going to swallow\nUm they also have a problem with it it's sort of migration coming across a you know and and that got refugee camps in the jungles in the Amazon jungle there\nUm and most when I was getting out\nYou just kinda wanna crushed that problem\nUm I mean that's that's the terms of what she speaks so\nIf you know the U.S is going to have an

out and\nHe will do exactly what Jim Comey exactly what McCain did exactly what all these guys do\nThey go out and they write these books that these massive answer and then they say about their time in the White House of their time in the department of justice and you know how to save America from this president that's what they're going to do that's my prediction I'm certain that will happen certain\nThere are other people who were inside the administration will have served in the ministry in court going to do the same thing and this is this the game plan now John when she went for two years when people go in there they serve a capacity and then they go they write a book but\nI Want to do a book comes out in early December between who is the deputy director of the FBI who was fired for among other reasons you know when they're lying to the FBI under oath on three occasions he was fired for that his book is coming out because they all profit off of Donald Trump\nCells in the book world but it's so late stories about Donald Trump we've seen that now with fire and fury in Woodward and all the other you know tabloids that have been out there and published but my guess what Rod Rosenstein who's going to do he will use his perch and number two person at the department of justice\nTook when he finally leaves one he's firing quits going write a book and just you know be skating against this president because that's how these guys stay alive and how these guys ... you know in the public arena and it really it's a terrible terrible thing to be honest with you\nAgree with the new allegations out now that the rocks and seen\nComments that he was going to attempt to wired wired to the president\nAnd then do with the tape for Santa and then go to the cabinet to invoke the twenty cents and then get them out and get us to be\nA senior officials saying they believe them and they thought he was dead serious they reported that to their shelter James Baker he thought it was serious McCain started with the origins of your way now to information\nThat's off I mean why doesn't the smartest guy now\nLook I think I think you're exactly right I think the president wants to get through this election cycle doesn't want anything to distract the Republicans have momentum on their side but I Do think you have to look long term the ability of Rod Rosenstein to stay in that position what it wants to leave the position he can do that anytime\nHe can resigned if he wants to but I think you have to call into question do you have the ability to continue in his capacity as a deputy attorney general based\nOn the information that we're hearing from other members others she remembers that served with him we shall capacity in the department of justice or the FBI we're saying that their accounting for what McCain said to be true\nThat is very troubling to everybody and we do know quickly that Rod Rosenstein who signed one of the fires that application renewables which allowed them to continue to spy on American\nCitizens on us soil that's all I have a kitchen has never been made available to the president's not on redacted that we need that when you see that we need to\nSee the three all choose which are the FBI's notes\nAfter they talked to Bruce or at the department of justice to see what's in there and we have to understand what the insurance policy wise to keep Donald Trump from being elected the FBI was talking about and what role if any Rod Rosenstein how to enact because at the deputy attorney general he had the right to sign\nThat fire the application and from what I understand and what is becoming widely known now by application was riddled with mistakes\nThat last renewable was actually signed when Donald Trump was the sitting president of the United states and the American people deserve the right to see what was then that renewal application that Rod Rosenstein\nSo you recommend to the president's Robin Jones' November seventh\nAnd look at what I Would recommend to the president is declassify all of the documents let the American people decide and see what has actually transpired\nThe FBI's credibility because the boy Jim combing McCain and now James Baker and Peter Struck and lead the patient has done that organization is just devastating it will take\nDecades to recover from what they have done that organization trying to use their positions people which was already people badgers going after American citizens spying on American citizens because\nWe didn't like the political affiliation their opponents everything that our country has been against censorship inception and guys like Peter Straub\nCooler the head of the counterterrorism unit had more ability than anybody he was the one box the Clinton email investigation he's the one team that it was called crushed by hurricane that\nSaid there's nothing to seeing these hundred thousand emails that we're all part of the winners laptop and he's the one who said hey let's go after Donald Trump he's only let that investigation we've seen\nIt now with the text messages between leads a page and Peter Struck and they worked at least minimum complicit with what Jim Comey and McCain and Jim Baker and potentially Robert was interesting one and done and the question is John and this is a very very big question\nHow did this girl in the U.S government we know that the director of the CIA and the DNI director of national intelligence and others were aware of this spying going on on domestic soil against us\nSince but exactly how high did it go on this this is the biggest untold story of the last two years you get this could lead right up to the very top of the government\nTo be which leads to Jeff Sessions what happened to I mean he's not doing anything you certainly not launching the special counsel to investigate what you alleged to be the biggest scandal in the United states history ever spying\nOn people for political gain all the way up to and everything else where\nWe'll look this whole investigation has been buying large turned over to uh the I mean the inspector general of the department of justice to find out if there's been any wrongdoing and we've seen some of that report already because it's been released publically the report that recommended\nThe number two person at the FBI and they're only be fired but charged criminally we're waiting for that to occur uh we're waiting to see what happens to a pianist rock and Lisa Page and and and Jim Baker the general counsel from the FBI we're waiting to find out what happened to the gym combing\nIn front of Congress leaking of classified information he didn't think it was classified that's not an excuse\nWhen he gets his notes his work product which was he was not allowed to do is a law professor to make sure that leaked out to the media there's been no accountability [noise] buddy [noise] level and government for what they've done which was try to\nTry to influence the outcome of the election because [noise] or Clinton supported by and large do not want to [noise] to Trump becomes President Trump and I don't understand when you're kind of there and why it hasn't come out yet\nNovember seventh are we going to clean house or not\nBut I Hope so John I really hope so and I and I hope for the president's take on that that is focused on helping him all over the result\nWhich he's been able to do by and large singlehandedly if you look at what the president's been able to accomplish what three point seven percent unemployment the unemployment\nRate for African American and Hispanic [noise] down a little staff quite candidly and we've seen in the Woodward book toward the staff cried on multiple occasions to stop him from doing things in stopping trying to stop them from being successful but each person\nHas gone down to historic levels\nJust for a second if that's surrounded him that actually wanted him to be successful\nTo how much more he could accomplish so much already but there are people who don't want to see him be successful there are still people who serve in the government or whether they're bureaucrats elected officials or people who have taken positions support him campaign and I still try and get\nStopped as agenda at every turn and all of the success that he has had\nIn the first two years of history and I can only wonder how much more he could have had had the right to around in supporting him every bit of weight\nAnd various positions who's goal is to undermine\nOther presidents agenda and if if if you think this is not real\nThank you get this has got to be the blockbuster book is one of\nBooks when the when the excerpt modest it's got to be absolutely starting Washington because all the other stuff was here say this is gonna be here's a list of the people that are undermining the president who put on a badge everyday and going to the west wing\nAnd they're basically erodes the guy's a spy if you will and they're working for the opposition and they're never truckers and they were put there by treatment that's what's going to happen if the if the Republicans\nThis president's going to clean house and he's got to bring people in there that actually believe that it's America first agenda that will work tirelessly in order to preserve pursuing goals and you don't see nothing yet if you look at the ... if you if you look at President Trump's accomplishments in the last twenty months it is stunning\nEspecially in the face of opposition within his own staff I mean forget the other party forget policy and Schumer forget the Democrats forget the never Trump present Congress forget them\nI'm Talking about people in the government and people in his own staff\nHis team that come in their everyday in counseling that enter taking things on his desk\nAnd manipulating information\nAnd fighting him and a slow walking things installing things\nIncluding his treasury secretary my notion is another one\nFrom Goldman Sachs who tried to undermine every single trade deal that the president made by a free trader and his friends on Wall street and Goldman Sachs they want they want cheap goods and higher profits they don't care if you have a job or not what\nLay care they haven't cared about you and thirty or forty years old they care about is how big your bonuses and how much profit can they drive in the business school now teach that they teach equity for ownership workers are commodity\n\nYeah Gary Cohn in there fighting them I mean it goes on and\nSo I look forward to this and I look forward to finally the president being able to get in a position where we can actually get some things done\nEven though we have gotten things done but imagine how much more effectively ... if we can get to a point where the people surrounding him\nActually believe that his agenda and I for one hope that a court goes in there and some senior capacity because I think it'd be great John triggers radio network truck the truth across America [noise]\nSo we have a a resignation UN ambassador\nResides Nikki Haley now I'm not a Nikki Haley fan I don't like her I never did sorry she was the never Trump or we for running campaigns embarrass yourself by\nA joint or any of those um [noise] uh ... what do you call it respond speeches to Obama and trashing Trump instead of using it to respond\nTo the president's used for half a speech trashing Trump She was the never Trump or from the beginning okay Trump is unique ability of being able to pick enemies that he thinks are confident she has been a top of that\nA U.S ambassador and she's had to embrace Trump's policies but she's also publicly different with the president\nOn a number of issues and deep down she doesn't believe any of that stuff and so I don't know why she left I mean she said uh she's tired or she needs to make more money I Know her family's in debt I mean you think\nShe lives in New York City you don't get a stipend for that you get a hundred and Seventy nine thousand dollars as a UN ambassador and you've got to live in New York City oh good ... good luck with that\nYou have to find all that I mean it's a lot of money and so she's been governor\nAnd so she broke and I I\nI gather leaving to make more money in the private sector and why\nNot leave now where you can make millions
