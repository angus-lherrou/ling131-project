with minors they can't be sent back in Ninety nine percent of them ended up staying in the U.S so they break one while but then other wants to protect them the president has said he might deploy the military why Steve Negron so Lucian\nWell absolutely you know you don't you're not that you want to get a great character right this has been in Beijing but when you have that many people are coming into our borders you know we have a fundamental responsibility in the president's national security strategy right the four pillars of it the first one is to protect the American people\nAnd that's what he's going to do and if we have to the point in the military down there to provide that sort of protection I'm all for it you know there are people that I Want to come here um and all of the laws of the land and and do it right way then I'm all for it you know but we know that that that group of ten thousand you know you think that they all have masks on their own undecided on one day to start march in Guatemala I\nDon't think so so I Believe that what the president's doing and what he's saying I'm all for it of course I'm a representative Custer says you know just open the oil at everybody and end up all sorted out afterwards is not\nIn the right way of protecting the American people and people are resonating want that and I think you know what this sort of high pressure showed the differences between us and Democrats or do we want to fundamentally eight let those people and that\nThat are allowed to come in the right way and all those people that aren't you know you've got to wait until we figure out who you are\nWell the reality of this says is if you let ten thousand and the next wave is going to be a hundred thousand because certainly becomes a magnet now but I Want to get the specifics what specifically do you recommend the president does interviewer in Congress what action what you want to specifically\nTakes it\nAbsolutely will I Do and you know first of all you're going to put this is unbelievable pressure on on a U.S border and crossed the border patrol agents that are down there right now I'm sure they're going to need some assistance or they're not going to be able to say it's actually process to do what they need to do and all those people and I would have\nThe state department I'm John getting on on the line and talking to all those countries that these people at Traverse City I'm starting with Mexico and working my way back all the way to go walk them all up and say you know what it says it it's just that\nThat they're they're coming from so I Would absolutely deploy military down there to augment on the border the border patrol they're the ones that are they lead agent on this they're the ones that have responsibility but we cannot let them I'm hanging\nOut there and waiting on the vine to do those kinds of things to what the president is doing right now is absolutely on the right thing and you know what it will show you that we have to put up a temporary barrier to provide to protect it that we need to this country and we have to we have to be\nUm understanding of those situations that are there but we cannot be this this

determined to come in and Mexico doesn't do anything it's just not much you can do because as soon as they step foot that say the word asylum they get twenty days\nAnd then they're released and they
