Bush sent to his father went to me I'm con\nHave tried to play a part of the rat moments of a set of communication between the two ah Bush said two are there other kind of depending upon\nCotton Bush said a shooting that says come out the question what they're calling the father says do you want names are description and the president says I'll take a description and he says I'll give it to one word Israel which is interesting on all sorts of levels including the confirmation without president doesn't run in you read the newspapers\nExplain what you mean like you said that and how do you know this conversation ... ... you know\nWhat I called really say who told me but I happened to someone who was I have absolute confidence in both in that I'm a type of telling the truth and also in that position to be aware of this conversation\nDenver a\nThat was was ... husband a doubt that he has injected himself and his campaign made fun of your military service and things of that nature so he's now open fodder I'm and he's also the author of the book or dangerously liaisons with his wife your porn and running for Congress or\nDoes that sound a bit and say some I think or is it just me\nI mean you know for for for this um it seems like since I wrote the book for one thing that I noticed when I when I listen to something read something when I Do any type of analysis you consider the source\nAnd it's the same thing that they get in their book also they had some sources that would say it's not like you to he just said there at the end that I'm any he had somebody can say the name of it was but it was somebody right and that's what they did in their book like they had anonymous letter from Nineteen eighty four and it just seems like there's this there's this willingness to go in\nThis whole thing that always comes back to the anti Israel just it just always sort of swings back around this way and I'm and I sort of scratch my head that this is even taken seriously by anyone\nAbout what's been said either on C SPAN the books that they've road or even the fact that they have real issues with with Twitter like with me but also with things like you just heard I mean it just sounds it just sounds crazy and uh you know and I've been so careful in the last couple of weeks\nWe've been trying to move back you know just make sure its policy because we'd been personally attacked so much a but it just seems to me that they have a real issue with Israel and only a real issue with Israel they have a real issue with sourcing and they have a real\nA real love of conspiracy theories and it just seems like this is sort of the ... of of since dangerous liaison or even before that because you know their history really use them for markets either so it's just a very interesting thing to hear you know this lack of sourcing it always goes back to anti Israel and this\nSort of bizarre thing of destroying everybody personally by you know by implying that George W. Bush and stupid or that somebody actually would tell him what's going on between the conversation between Bush Bush senior it's ludicrous ... and I think that's where I Want to it's just ludicrous\nThat it is and whether it it seems to me whenever you pick something up on these people it gets back to anti Israel anti Semite Nancy uh anti\nShoot always assumed that it only got to the fact that you know that always\nAlways get it always it always rolls back around that wherever you did it was really the question you know about you know what's in it that's what he wanted to go back to was Israel and and to me that that was the whole basis of what he wanted to get to not just that George W. Bush you know had a issues with what it knowing what a neo toddlers or not the fact that they had a source\nThat he can't obviously talked about which seems to be what happens when all the way back to this anti Israel thing and and just you get to the point you're just you shake your head and you had enough and I think most people\nMost people realize what's going on there aren't a\nI'm going to run a couple of other clubs here from Culver and I want to get your reaction to here's one she did a radio show obviously they will not do mine [laughter] but they did a radio show and the er which for Gary Bryant in Murray where\nAh they they after Brian asked her about her negative comments on making fun of your military service let's run that I Want to get your reaction to this like a military service cuts to\nThe to your husband Andrew boosted on Twitter and somebody might be talking about Mr ... risking my house snorkeling all Hugo Garcia a cheap shot at his service in the air force I mean do you do not come in\nYeah I I got there I think that that you know I was back in any surveying that's country I think I served as well as internalize style and having spent like south a lot of time in Afghanistan\nHobby I think it's important to recognize that too so that I think you know for your loss merit hockey white people actually part about in the district\nSo\nYour military service and I mean I don't think being a journalist is the same thing is trying to plan invasions of what is up for this lady\n[laughter] it's so funny you ask the question is gonna hurt idiotic or commercial came on where I was joking about it and not job extremists hip hop each day [laughter] and has about Halloween costume on there and has marchers you know going through Charlottesville um they're just so out of touch and they're so absolutely\nHave no idea what the district's about 'cause I actually don't live here I mean this is this is\nReally what we get down to the root of this is that okay let's let's just demeans somebody like they just did with George W. Bush much demand change the subject and then say something that's completely ludicrous that that is the this is the whole progressive left game\nPlan also it's just over and over and over again that that the district doesn't care about it ever managing amount of veterans in the district they know who I Am\nThe fact that somebody would tweak something like that means or out of touch elitist has no

on a campaign led trumping Trump by it forward today or to be going to go to Amazon wherever you want it's your favorite book store online let Trump the Trump got a new one coming out\nIn November twenty second I Can't wait to read it trumps enemies I I'm not in that book is I'm not an enemy so I Can't I'm not going to fly by name and their facts icing on the Trump's biggest supporters for when that\nComes out Cory up yesterday over the weekend the horrible shooting at the synagogues and we've got these pipe bombs such crazy crazy people doing crazy things the fake news the Washington Post runs in editorial basically claiming Trump\nFor all of this a number one what is your reaction to this\nTo me and you know I I Want to give a little credit to some other media outlets over this weekend to\nCall out the Washington Post on there discussed in your editorial but they're headline which appeared on Saturday mornings blame all Trump a\nPoor the pipe bomb issues and Chris Wallace from Fox News held up the newspaper it was it was a lead story on Saturday morning and Chris filter on Sunday and it's certainly a Trump supporter you know it's it's farming\nWhatever it was nice it's amazing to me the the trail of\nSome of the members of the mainstream media who want to blame the president for things that he has nothing to do with I don't ever recall I don't I'm not trying to pass the buck up or diverge here but I don't ever recall them saying you're Bernie Sanders supporter loaders down tried to kill two\nHundred members of Congress at a congressional baseball practice or you know you don't see that you didn't\nSee and I'm disgusted by this but the individual\nWho committed these heinous crimes with a synagogue or is it lets you have to make these crimes what they Trump hater you always see Democrats support our permits atrocity at synagogue as the headlines for the media wants to go after this president for all the wrong reasons they don't want to give them credit and they are\nAt some level responsible for the headlines\nAnd the editorials estate France\nOf driving a narrative which has of Israel against the president and and it's shameful and they need to be held accountable to and I hope that the American people do that\nWell I'm not sure if they will but look I go to those press conferences as you know I'm a White House correspondent\nI was there yesterday and the questions you get from some of the media\nThe fake news media and the front row especially CNN it's just it's just ridiculous and um that's just\nPart of the problem is out of ten questions you're going to get three that are legitimate all the others are just to embarrass the president or shout something out or some other such nonsense um now you have the bombings a pipe bomb a\nCrazy guy that got arrested you had a horrible shooting in the synagogue is you know the president and the first lady going in Pittsburgh today and it's the right thing to do a lot of people telling me slug fits\nAnd maybe it's the president's rhetoric and that's a\nThem and that's and the Republicans have had to stop shortfalls\nNot like it it's false as a matter of\nOur country is going to be stronger after a national tragedy it always does and what I have called for this last\nWeek said again is we need to be able to disagree with each other but not be disagreeable the president is the console or in chief he and the first lady as well as his daughter and son in law who happened to both be Jewish are going to Pittsburgh today to be part of I think the comforting process for those families\nWho are impacted by this animation as a whole we can never tolerate this but this is where the president is his strongest when he sees something that is wrong he doesn't look at Republican or Democrat independent black white\nYellow green it doesn't matter if she just wants to fix it and what took place in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania was horrific display of atrocity in anti Semitism which will never be tolerated by anyone in this country\nShould never be tolerated finding them in this country and the president's going to go there and remind the world of why we're the greatest country we are going to be nice when tragedy happens he's going to be a he is the president of everybody in this country and toning down the rhetoric is important\nWe have a very important election in seven days but no election\nIs worth what is taking place in issues like that synagogue or attempting to half pipe bomb killed elected a former elected officials where the greatest country in the world were not a banana republic we need to understand that we are better when we are stronger and we are together and that's the presents gotta talk about um Pittsburgh\nWhere it was horrible and the senior advisor for the vice president's Martha Washington many now great America committee you get more information or just go to great America committee dot com Corey I've got\nHalf or the president in an interview with actually as we understand last night said that he is ready to do an executive order to stop a birthright citizenship her baby idea lot a lot of us have been saying and that's one of the biggest problems we have an immigration watch that you\nAt it is an issue with immigration unfortunately I don't think the president has the legal authority um to to amend the constitution of the United states and what will happen\nIs a light gas and wrote with its act which took place when he issued other executive orders is a sort of a court is going\nTo step into going to put a stay on it immediately and I'm sure the White House has already thought through what the legal challenges are going to Peter this and ultimately this is going to end up being litigated at the Supreme Court has the\nHighest levels of the land and they're going to make a decision but that decision will not be reached in the next seven days are probably won't be return the next three months but the president and his team a White House counsel et cetera believe that there is a cork in the amendments that says that\nThey the individuals born here are subjected to the laws of a country that they're in and there was a cork there that says these people here illegally so they're not\nGiven citizenship through birthright\nA lot of states but I don't like the\nEarth's resources [noise] All right I think

going to take advantage of your chime in and get to the gets in the middle east and the international scene a and I want to start if you made up because I Know you can comment on anything they could show gifts are women women coming that index and I'm\nRight now with the president I don't think you're going to see any action between now and after election day but I'm crown prince Mohammed bin Solomon um if you really look at the fact is it conceivable that he was just it just inconceivable that\nThirteen role did tell people doctors whatsoever [noise] who they're on without authorization so I think it's I just think that he was not a part of it but\nAnd he's behind this thing um how does this play out because of the Trump Administration has put the Saudis at\nThe centerpiece of their Middle Eastern policy they also want to level the Saudis and getting the Palestinians to the table with Israel um is stark I'm kind of the unraveling or why here where do you think\nWell there are many people that would like to unravel this money will be anti Trump or is it made people that are on the Democratic side of the child because the relationship that Donald Trump parents with the Saudis and\nIt has always been with the always for all of our presidents but their relationship is gorgeous foreign policy or he watched and use them as they say about for a partner against the expansion of Iranian terror and I'm I'm there are many people\nThat would like to see that failed they would like to see President Trump fail and there's foreign policy as well as his domestic policy I also don't think it's smart we have a very good prospects those are providing weapons and other defense equipment to them which is worth\nBillions and billions hundreds of billions of dollars and there are many American Jobs that are dependent upon that real people real families\n... real living now I have a whole\nDifferent take on this thing never once mentioned this but this is\nMike takes this was not simply the silencing of a journalist he wasn't a journalist to begin with you didn't go to journalism school wasn't an official columnist I Know what that is to be a columnist it was just a\nCommentator or we'll Columbus hence the column once or twice a week a metal or high\nWater he was a ... a commentator this is not an issue about a commentator who the Saudis didn't work as a fitness being put to death your cloak and dagger stuff this is by counter\nSpy broke sparring has nothing to do with the only good journalists because of the sun just didn't like what they were saying what he was saying\nThis fellow at one time was very close to the Saudis he knew all the secret service or is it was part of their networks you went broke they found out that certain things that turkey and Qatar for enemies\nOr the Saudi Arabians they were they now have certain secrets I kept wondering where did they find out this stuff this was a guy go at one time was close to the Saudis are they're going to circle eat went rogue and what you have here is your own fashion cloak and dagger spy counter strike double agents happens\nBoth countries all the time when you're a ... fine in your country finds out that you're revealing certain information to enemies\nYou're gone I'm sure if this happens in the whole forty times in the mountains they discovered some world dangerous\nIt's nothing to do with the silencing of journalists have had to deal with getting rid of an agent who was providing information Saudi Arabia's and that means and it's ...\nYeah but you have the rabbi sparrow it was done in a very stupid way to do it in in a in a conflict and the guy who lived in the United states\nThe winner there to get a marriage license I mean that's why\nI get back to this I just think NBS isn't competing I think it's our get I think he's incompetent and I think he's going to be tougher to do business with because everything that guy is touched rap like everything everything is touched since his father put\nThem in charge has blown up in his face the Yemeni civil war complete disaster he kidnapped\nThe Lebanese prime minister two weeks after the guy was in the White House a kid who did a tour with the gang of swore blow up into space that's a total disaster now the\nLover up I mean that everything that guy just I mean sometimes you just have to say hey you think he's confident and a\nConfidence and and and the arrogance bad combo I mean if they wanted to get rid of this guy I Would think that they could have been done other\nWay let me ask you this wide thing intense interest here for a president fertile Irwin what's his what's this play here rabbi\nWell here's the competition right now with Saudi Arabia he wants to be the head of the Islamic\nWorld you know at one time for turkey is at one time that was the Ottoman Empire and the Ottoman Empire um was the leader of the Arab Muslim world for a report came out and read\nAll about World War one and he'd like to restore that to to turkey is competition the Saudi Arabia in a way it's also Iran right now Iran is thank God because of President Trump economically they're waving there's still about ... terrorism or their their\nTheir powers raining so this was a competition between American\nWants to be cleaned up the hill as opposed to Saudi Arabia Saudi Arabia is a lot of the leaders\nOf the Arab world because America and Medina Israel Saudi Arabia so that's what that's about ... ever aired again to convince them Barris the Saudis worldwide whatever he can do to rupture of the relationship between Saudi Arabia the states is in his ambition\nAs emphasis ambition interest that's what's happening\n[noise] All right well turkey\nAnd Qatar versus Saudi Arabia for who's going to leave the Arab world\nWell we're we're going to see how it plays out\nI don't think crown prince Mohammed bin solving a I think eventually his father king Solomon is going to have to make a decision here I'll probably easier to be a positive one because I'm\nJust can't fix and confidence and he's a Barris the administration and he's embarrassed Jared Kushner and the wells handle this thing is just it's it's really job I mean I Can't what you're saying\nAbout this happens all the time but it doesn't happen in an embassy in there with a cover up and then it goes on for two weeks and then they change the story ten times and now it's a\nYou know it's an international crisis and they did that take themselves I\nMy ear exactly correct on that it happens we'll spies but it doesn't happen ever happened to see some of the way they did it and the way was proper size and the foolish cover up\nYou're absolutely right [noise]\nThat's a really dumb Robert Shapiro it's always an hour to have sex for being with us on the Josh Rogers radio network rates have you with us show more coming up with it right here I got the troops in America you know go away\n[noise]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the middle drowning in the swap hey is this your your tax dollars go right here don't you love it man you worked a tail off your pay your taxes why it takes it at all the people that run around DC they're swamp
