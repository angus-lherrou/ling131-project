have an air force to comply because they can't get the spare parts\nSo that's where I Would probably goes to the to the munitions Saddam Hussein\nLot of hopefully we get an ass\nHe said last night that he's going to press the government by making the Senate vote on parenting us arms sales all penniless arms sales as you just mentioned to Saudi Arabia as a way to put more leverage on uh Mohammed than solving in order to figure out what happened\nIs basically what Paul is saying is I I I\nHave a vote in the Senate they're basically spends all sales just like you mentioned until we get answers don't see how that plays out [noise] the um\nI can kind of would work I think that would work or they they need to have a strong military to because they're worried about\nThe uranium so I'm getting a control over a Gemini more influence in the middle east in the hat and letting you as as a rule have always disliked each other Persians versus Arabs goes way back\nWay back in history [noise] let's get back to domestic policy congressman Horgan grip on healthcare\nSenate Democrats today want to force a vote on a measure that would overturn the Trump administration's expansion of non of comic their plans I Would assume the attempt is to put Republicans on record against protections for people with preexisting\nConditions Democrats are saying that even if they don't float could become a potential political weapon against Republican candidates in the fall in the final uh twenty seven days here\nAnd all polling shows that a majority of Americans the one thing about a bomb and care that they really like is the fact that you can't be rejected for pre existing conditions nor can your prices get jacked up\nHow did the Republicans respond to\nRally around him and I haven't seen that Senate bill but I Will tell you that uh the the bill that we had in the house\nThat we pass this is what House members can say hey protection for pre existing conditions go right into it the one that we sent over to the sign\nLanguage is very clear Democrats have been you know trying to mislead people by saying that you know if you stood on one foot and lean to the left in the heavy when it might not ... I mean it's just not accurate the pre existing conditions were there I was in Johnson City when the president gave his speech last week and he said we're\nGoing to protect preexisting conditions and I think that's what you respond with it you know a lot of it is smoking mirrors that the Democrats are just playing politics with just like they did it with the Kevin how situation 'cause that's fresh in voters' minds\nAnd we're not going to do anything to pre existing conditions that one player of the Republicans prior to Obama and the Democrats taking control as they never dealt adequately with fat\nAnd we're not going to make that mistake again we're going to make sure I wasn't there then but we are going to make sure that people with preexisting conditions are taken care of in the house bill creating these invisible risk pools so the government picked up that cost of a difference between the the people with preexisting\nCourt but the government to accept that cost and that lowers everybody's costs because now the insurance companies aren't haven't put it into somebody's family who doesn't have a pre existing condition doesn't have to put those rates center spreading it around to everybody so\nThe people with a condition or taking care of and it's better for the people who don't have a pre existing condition because they're not paying additional risk in a pool\nOr the Democrats line about this [noise]\n[noise] well there certainly pre barricaded\nAnd trying to you know make it appear that it's something that it isn't a they're playing a lot of clever word games in all put the you know there Ninety nine percent wrong there is under one scenario\nLike I said if you stand on your left leg and then there's the wind blowing that somehow a state if they could get a waiver could figure out a way to get around at a but\nYou know I just don't see it to the bill is very clear\nAnd I think they lose in court but that would be the Democrats attacking\nThe very issue that they think are that they're claiming that they are the champions out and you know is there a legal case that maybe somebody could challenge it under certain circumstances yeah maybe but I think it was so it's pretty close to a lot but not a hundred percent\nThey do have one little threat but they can hang on for some legal case\nSomewhere in the future um that nobody believes will actually ever happening\nUN ambassador Nikki Haley resigning yesterday kind of shocked the world that didn't leak she said she told the president six months ago she was going to be out after two years any idea what happened there\nNow you know sometimes it is just what it is you do a job you've got you enjoy it and she said it's an honor\nBut you realize it's not something you want to do or do forever or that you're a pigeon holed in [noise] and you say okay I'll give it a two years and I'm I'm going to step aside and you tell the president that he says well I Hope you change your mind she doesn't and it looked like it was all very friendly and [noise]\nYou know there weren't any tweets back and forth about this that or the other and you know sometimes people just move on\nReplacement idea\n[noise] [noise] no I heard some names this morning but um you know we have a lot of talented people in the United states and I'm sure the president will find somebody who can do the job is as well as a former Governor Haley\nAll right congressman Morgan Griffith I've got thirty seconds tell me about the state of your campaign in district not every day\n[noise] well it's interesting that folks are are ripped up on the Democrats dot in the race off the money so we're we're raised lots of money to or at least stay close I think they're going to outspend me uh that can happen but but our numbers are good people in the southwest\nAnd I'm thirty five races endorsed by the Bernie\nSanders socialist leaning our revolution group not punish right in line with him he's up there with a um Alexandria

be more liberal in Arlington [laughter]\nCongressmen market driven great line and actually the shift to be more liberal than Arlington can't get much worse therefore as I Know\nWe're going to take off

information go to America First policies dot org America First policies dot org\nThis message paid for authorized by\nAmerica First policies in corporate joining us now Matt ... he's a political editor and writer for Breitbart News you can follow that go to Breitbart News get their\nAnd he broke a story yesterday or\nThe majority leader of the house of representatives congressman McCarthy who is from California and\nUh would be the leading candidate for speaker provided the Republicans hold the house wants to make Trump's wall any campaign referendum\nThis story broke yesterday by Matt ... he is with us now Matt ... great to have you back man\nKevin McCarthy is going to be introduced\nEach day so he was a he flew down on the border last night he sees\nSkiing and his team are getting a threatening assessment briefing from our border patrol\nAgents and law enforcement officials down there but then when he gets back to Washington DC later this week he's going to introduce a bill that fully funds to the border wall so all the rest of the money that would go for the border wall in addition to that has a number of other enforcement measures that Kate swap\nWhich has already passed the house that has an ... century city which is already passed the house or the ... as well as going out for a criminal gang members are contained in the bill I'm so all those things and a few more\nOr other things like standing on price agents and going out fairly go down in voting would all be in this bill and the important thing here is is that\nThere's been no does have the votes to pass the house of representatives I with Republican support at this stage though with only fifty one center as it doesn't look like it would pass the Senate and this has been the reason why we don't have the\nThe wall money yet right like in this has been the whole thing right in the Senate Democrats have been holding it up because there you need sixty votes in the Senate so looks like based off in these midterm elections\nAre Republicans are going to get a few pickups in the Senate seats right like so it looks like based off the latest polling and everything Republicans make get to work for\nFive fifty six senators the question is is whether or not they're going to hold the house\nSo if Republicans do hold the house majority them this kind of a bill that fully funds the border wall can pass both the house and the Senate and we get into the president's desk and actually fun to walk\n[noise] so what is the amount of money that McCarthy is advocating in this bill for the wall\nA twenty four billion dollars approximately four billion dollars that's that's what they say they need\nAnd so we get the whole kind of gotten so he's got the right funding at a twenty four billion dollars now the wedding I read your piece McCarthy wants to make this a campaign issue a referendum if you will a wall referendum for the mid term shortfall\nYeah that's exactly right and so again if Republicans hold the majority in the house and they add a number of seats in the Senate then they're going to be able to get the wall funding the full wall funding to President Trump next year if they don't\nIf they lose the house and the Democrats take it the the the Democrats are going to be able to block the wall and from the house just like they've been doing from the SAT at sort of the point is is that would require these build dies is it and make the entire election uh mid term\nReferendum or this this entire mid term election a referendum on the wall that any votes for Republican is a vote for the wall a vote for Democrats to vote for open borders would vote for\nI mean that the Democrats are the party of illegal alien crime and that mess Thirteen the Republicans are the party of law and order and\nPresident Trump made that case over and over again so if you want the wall and the water you have to show up and vote for Republicans that simple and that took this whole fight lays out but it's really it's become a referendum on on many other things too you don't\nGet me wrong I don't think this election is just about immigration\nBut it it's very much about immigration\nBreak like so it's it's very much about immigration and many other things as well including the economy including a the ... you know what kind of country do we want to be including do you do you support the craziness of this was their students that we've seen all these people that have gone off the rails with this whole time in our situation right like\nWhere the Democrats have gone nuts but the point is is that a ... it's very much a referendum about immigration as well\nAnd so again if you want a border wall you got to vote for the Republicans if you don't want a border wall if you want\nA lawlessness if you want illegal alien committing murder if you want and uh MS Thirteen running around if you wanted drugs spreading through your community are that are brought here by drug cartels vote for Democrats\nBy all means frightened because that's what you want but I don't think the vast majority of Americans support the opioid crisis I don't think the vast majority of Americans support a MS Thirteen committing crimes in their neighborhoods I don't think the vast majority of Americans want MS Thirteen that their kids' schools\nBy so fast the fact of the matter is it the way to stop that Republicans get to walk [noise]\nSo this is going to be a national referendum on the wall McCarthy going down there today when is he going to lead us out and and by the way many great job in breaking the story and if you don't know\nKnow [noise] we'll\n[noise]\nBreaking news this hour from town hall by Tom I'm teen seniors came Eichler slammed into the Florida Gulf Coast\nBreeding records

extensively and she is with us now are just returning from Brazil where we were following her work their Vanessa Newman asymmetric ... great great to have you with us for that\nTo me again John thank you so much always a pleasure to be with you\nKnow I don't think there's anyone in America\nThat does the media that is more knowledgeable about what is going on in the Brazilian elections than you are can you give him an overview you were there for months you just got back ... what's going on\nYeah [noise] yeah so the sound and calling and power glide Brazil and Argentina are a lot and I I've been to spend a lot of time in Brazil this year [noise] and ah\nI was basically what's going on is we have an ultra right wing ultra conservative swept through the first round of elections\nTo the way they're presented in the old system works is any party can run you know it's it's a different system from the American system and chew up two rounds of elections right so they had Thirteen candidates running and you can vote on the thirteenth park candidates [noise]\nThat these are extrajudicial killings things you know without due process of law that a lot of innocent people are being killed because you know once you start rewarding fun they kill more people [laughter] I'm not saying that you often not the right person\nSo that you know they get stuck in town\nThe more I think it can work I don't know because I think Mexico but seems to be is it basically became an arms race in Mexico the cartels were already so well armed they already have military grade weaponry\nOr that they could out quite a bit in the military now the question is will actually seen in Brazil because they're already using the military in Brazil in the ... which is the slums of Rio\nRight which in the ... you know doctors were required presidential order [noise]\nAnd they don't always win you know when they fight the drug cartels they're often out gun shadow he's saying that they'll do more of the same and the rest of the country a lot see one or whether it's you know they have the Philippine insect status you know so called six hours or the Senate\nIn Mexico but I think they left it too late or and you have too much corruption and the problem is also you have the local police and the local governors\nAh had too much corruption now you have a similar political system in Brazil where it's what they call it the chips that stuff but she says but local governors like in the U.S write the local governors have a lot of power or it's not\nIt's not old rule from the top it's a lot of local governments are a lot of local enforcement and that didn't work in Mexico and let's see what it works in Brazil\n[noise] well I think there is a difference and you pointed out all the experts to study that said that uh the the Mexican military was way behind your arms that were out guns and the biggest problem they had\nAnd you just nailed it if they would go in pursuit in areas and the local authorities were being paid off by the cartels so they were tipping off the cartels are about\nAll of the military operations where they were where they were going to hit\nA where their movements were and they had they had they had better they have better weapons and they did and they had the intel uh being fed to them by basically despise that were part of the local law enforcement apparatus that we're all in the tank so let's put the marketing military which is not that bad it's not like you're confident\nI mean the the the way they're rated it is about in the middle of the military in the world I mean they're pretty well trained but they didn't want\nTo I doubt if I've got a significant amount of training and intelligence officer who you are right you don't hear about it but there's you know there are still going to collaboration between the U.S and Mexico\nBecause this is a common problem for both countries show you know there's ... there is you know and it's very complicated in Latin America and you don't want to broadcast [noise] you're working with the Yankees you know too much because it looks a little bit like you\nCan't run your own affairs market kicking order so they can run and we know that they've been working with the with the Mexican military and they share intelligence because of that shouldn't have done they they weren't very good job but as you said the spies and the people working for the call Charles\nFrom former special forces\nRight so these are former military special courses that splintered off got paid more by the cartels they were the audio switches these sanctions for different card shop and then they said hey we can do this time around and establish their own cartel so these guys really know what they're doing you know\nReally unbelievable so uh it seems like Boston arrow is trapped in to do what you say the the desire for changing the status quo for Brazilians and uh you know it looks like you're looking at people people forget one in four\nOut of every Brazilians voter isn't even in jail or coal and uh yeah I understand I think I I read eighty five or Ninety percent of federal lawmakers or even a joke so this this very Christian nation and I think they're just part of this I\nI don't see older Workers Party candidate overcome a over comes to the deficit I mean that would be shocking to me when when you get forty six percent of your closest rival is twenty nine percent I mean all of that\nOf that of the other people that voted for the other candidates there's at least five percent of their who just don't [noise] I had died and they're not voting for a show like if a\nIf Boston there are just as people are getting together with\nWell you know you have a very interesting point because there was another changing dynamic in Latin American politics right synergy what issues\nAcross the region I mean I don't want to every every country with the same brush but if you want to generalize there are some things you can generalize on corruption and security so those are the two issues so aside from that unit on the other important issue which is rising is even John ... voter so a lot of these countries most of them I\nI in fact I Am I'm hard pressed to think of one another in Cuba are mainly very Catholic but now we're seeing something else which is a little bit more evangelical it's a form of Catholicism a but it's very much about spreading the word\nOf God it's quite problematic it's it's even John Paul I'm you know adults being baptized and rivers and all of that\nAnd that can new dynamic that we're seeing in Latin America you'll always kind of harm box and it has been in the sort of smaller local villagers 'em\nAnd you'll see it and you even see them parts of the last if you go into very neighborhoods you'll hobbies and our local churches and they called themselves getting scandals as opposed to got totally calls right so they can to Christian rather than count like [noise]\nUm but it's kind of next door to the dollar is um [noise] we're seeing that in in Brazil was the biggest example because it's the biggest country sort of stands out the most and as I said we had a hundred and forty seven\nMillion voters on Sunday [noise] um but you are seeing across the region you also saw it in Columbia out in in Iraq who cares\nA presidential ... you know just you know the summer so they're changing around a kill and they're viewing\nLet go a practice is also driving the anti act and the and the return to very conservative values but it's also another way of spreading the steam type of a\nPolitical ideology shouldn't have getting very intertwined the politics and religion and they view themselves as being on a mission you know a on a mission to purify the political system by bucking the system they're going they're becoming a force to themselves [noise] and um\nAnd it it it it it's going to be interesting to watch I I'm not sure exactly how this\nYou know how this plays out but of Latin America I think she just anything that's like the ...
