Collins and Murkowski I think both Collins and Murkowski will vote for Kavanaugh if there is nothing in that report flake\nI have no idea he is so compromise but\nRecords show he is a conservative\nIs he really willing to squander that possibly unique opportunity to put a conservative on the court and guarantee as I say quite a few years of conservative buyers from the court is he willing to throw that away a bit courteous so eager to beat the loved\nBy the left I have no idea the man is so full of hatred\nFor Donald Trump did it appears he'll go to any lengths whatsoever to confront him but honestly I Would be shocked if he votes against him\nWell what are we differ on that he's going to vote now yeah it'd be a ... he wants to be lying in the New York times and the Washington Post or some kind of a Republican hero\nOf our time and so you got to write a book and the whole thing and and make a lot of money he's going to vote no it really comes down to Collins and Murkowski me out it was just this is no secret\nAnd um I Would be personally shocked if there's nothing in this report and college voted no I I just could not even see her getting on TV and trying to explain it\nBecause she never says anything stupid I mean if you follow suit costs like I Do I Love following her because every time she speak just like okay that makes sense even if you don't agree with her I Know I think\nYou're right I don't think she'd have any grounds for doing it and she has kept an open mind from the start right and she has basically said unless something surface you know there's no reason not to vote for him what do you think about Murkowski\nI could not imagine if Collins to tell the least she's going to vote yes yeah that Lisa Murkowski all alone in Alaska sinking this nomination and sinking the state of the last\nTwo years of the Trump Administration up to twenty twenty\nBecause it'll it'll destroyed the Republican Party as we know what I Can't get Trump voters out and neither can anybody else if this guy goes down with no weapons now is there is evidence that different now granted him did his wedding ring so all that is\nOlder than her hands and\nI don't know how you take somebody down where there's no evidence because and\nYou basically read ward the Democrats\nYeah that I think it's almost the most offensive part of that scenario I totally agree with that show boating self promoting a heinous behavior the lack of decorum the lack of decency Dianne Feinstein sitting on this information simply\nBecause it made it for more potent gotcha moment there's that really that behavior that the Republicans are going to come down I sure as heck hope not and I think I agree I think Mitch McConnell together a card and that's directly Mitch McConnell has been absolutely\nFerocious about getting touches on the Supreme Court\nUsed to put through a lot of other\nA senior administration officials who are awaiting confirmation because judges have been his priority and I think he's very smart to do it I think he's ... I mean Republicans across the country should be applauding us because nothing more than\nThe judicial branch needed to repair it more than that and I so I think it's incredibly important but he's doing that um and I think he will get mccaskey and colon center rom and promised them the moon politically or if they go along with it and\nI don't mean that he should have to because as you point out if there is no evidence to support any of these charges shame on them for even wavering mean where do you got drunk in high school or not\nWhat we know now is Steven briar was arrested for under age drinking that didn't seem to stop his confirmation and yet it's not necessarily equivalent but let's get a grip here folks and look at what we know about this man what we know is it for Thirty years\nHe has to have with unbelievable dignity intact dirty a decorum he has had no charges ever leveled against him like anything like that as as an adult\nSo on the other side of that ledger we have hundreds of opinions that people things so highly of that they're frequently used as a reference point in a other judgments and other arguments legal arguments this man deserves a place on the\nSupreme Court I really hope he gets there\nOkay we're we're listening to a tribute to\nThe newspaper the hill and also the hill on line at all so far and she has a new column out called Trump's America First call to score the big win with a new NAFTA deal also lists I Love your new website I Love the light blue\n[laughter] me in a good mood really\nI I have to say is the kind of thing that you know you put off doing for years because it's just too much trouble but I appreciate that thank you know I like it it's\nClearly I I also like I don't know if I can say on the radio I guess I just didn't get feedback was were were friends\nBut I also love the way your name is at the top in what is that called when you're writing it my son always script script script and it's very soft and it also matches the dress you have\nOn that is on the same um like blue so it just works that's all in the kitchen\nAnd I appreciate that more than you know I work\nI'm going to pass that on my helper who basically pushes me to do everything that's constructive and pushed me to do that so\nMuch for that yeah whoever does your website told them that John Frederick\n[laughter] well thank you [laughter] [noise] I have no but thank\nYou for having me on um I got to run but it's always fun to talk to you appreciate it\nHave you with us and also sheriff Clarke will be joining us seven thirty five plus your calls at a couple of text year that I can read real fast I got about why\nAnd let's get to the journey in Chesapeake says what all this has shown me is that we have an issue with using the justice system to legislate\nInstead of the legislative branch doing the jobs that might be the point degrade cabinet so it was written opinions are not use is a scorched earth policy\nI don't think it matters once he's confirmed it doesn't matter what you think of it it doesn't matter I mean you saw that with the Clarence Thomas here too in a stronger George from Newport News [noise] you never passed out drinking beer because you drink rolling rock it's a cheap beer drinker real clear\nHe says and you will blackout\nRolling rock that's my brand judge Frederick radio network truck the troops stay with us\nWhat do we need a swing\nThey need to be punished families to come out part of it that cabinet [noise]\nStill for him and of course it's like when it comes I guess which I don't think there will be at least ... states really you know a lot [noise]\nYou know that's a great point Mac\nThe Bush family wears George Bush where's Laura Bush where's all the places where Jeb Bush nowhere to turn nowhere to be found not one of them you're right [laughter]\nSo where's the Bush family\nDoes anybody know yeah there there's there's certainly not shy about criticizing President Trump when they don't like something done right they jump right into that fray I mean they got time change but [noise]\nI don't want to ask you is that is awesome I was like a perfect person that [noise]\nYou said it takes me I Would have answered that question I was on the highway man that will take the ... you could never\nWhat did the first caller that's raised\nThat issue and thank you because we're the places where they don't want to be found not up to any of them not a thing [noise]\nNow former sheriff Milwaukee County as senior advisor to\nAmerica First policies action sheriff David Clarke hey Sean Clark great to have you back man\nTakes a lot in a loaded listeners again\nSheriffs um actually I kinda\nI kinda get your comment\nMatt just said from Richmond one of our callers you just heard that he said look this whole confirmation process with judge Kavanaugh he worked in the Bush White House and his wife where is the question is what do you think when\nWe were talking about politics in politics don't expect anybody to have your back you can't trust anybody in this political ... from this goes to Washington DC so when you ask where the bushes hiding somewhere and you know there is hiding somewhere trying to figure out a hate on Trump's more that's what's going on with them I think it's shameful but you know like I said\nYou know expect us got sort of thing in politics you do you have to have your own back don't expect anybody to yours\nOkay so\nLook some of their stomach Thomas that are being made by the left are appalling\nCritic it doesn't get any play in the media you can imagine sheriff Clarke if Republicans were saying any of this stuff but um you know we've we've got this one a lady in in Georgetown here in Washington DC where\nSays that white GOP senators deserve miserable that's after having already hearing\nThat she did a profanity laced Twitter tirade against Kavanaugh calling him a rapist and a perjure\nShe described the Republicans as a a death coal and Chelsea swine and she's teaching at Georgetown University what's the deal sure\nWell you know what the deal is here really get away with whatever they want and then when something mild is set up by somebody in our society and they go for the world I mean look at disassociated assistant dean at Catholic university says some between some things that got suspended by the university and she has a right to do that\nBut at the same time what you said there was nothing near nothing close to what\nYou know some of the language used by\nThe people on the left and the you know our site but I say our service qualify that the conservatives there were tired of the tactics used by\nThe left but instead of sitting back in and whining what we need to do it you know and getting outrageous what we need to do is to find better counter measures counter strategies to deal with this stuff more effective once when I see\nDifferent kinds of strategies because to sit back and pointed out\nIs one thing and that needs to be done because the line with a group meeting won't do their job but when you know individuals see some of the things that they do like we're talking about somebody called the other day\nM Ms Ford Mustang I think it was the guy from Fox News who got word that was their colors gang a little bit lower cost\nWho said she hated white man you don't get away with whatever they want but the ... one of the ways that we can call it that\nAt ground level and fighting back is to make sure that we get this judge Brett Kavanaugh confirmed as job one any people to stay focused on the task and it's getting just\nKevin all come from a new one he's been put through and he said it best I think when he said this thing is turn into a joke I Wonder if these senators on the Senate Judiciary committee and I'm Talking about both GOP in a Democrat that went up to ...\nThemselves just to public conduct at this search and destroy mission which is another thing another crazy\nThat took care of and I use that's what it's become you know this man it's been put on his family's been through enough this cruel and unusual punishment is as far as I'm concerned that is prohibited by the eighth amendment to the constitution to all these constitutional issues that are involved in this I'm\nGuilty before proven innocent out of the root of due process is trash the rule of law has been thrown out\nWe live in a country where you don't have to prove your innocence but all of a sudden now when it comes to judge Kevin how you got to ... percent of innocent these charges so this whole thing has been after died I say enough is enough I was disappointed when Chuck Grassley initially move to date from September twenty fifth and they moved it to the Thursday\nAnd then they moved it again your own kind of peace\nFor Democrats nothing's going to have peace them you see what they're doing now the Democrats come up with a list of twenty five people they want interview their job I don't know if if if I Know Mitch McConnell understands any citizen below\nThe Senate the other day but you know painting the Democrats and well why John think about this three senators\nClique Murkowski income was reportedly went to the president said hey we need political cover to fold why don't you just do this this uh FBI investigations so we can get by this or fixing the swamp has become\nThe doing the right thing would have just been holding the world but in any political cover I think this sick\nSheriff Clarke uh I really appreciate what you're saying and sharing that perspective because it's sort of it\nWay and you're right and what happened here's the problem with being in DC all the time like me\nIs you take that for a grain of salt because it is kind of the way the swap and so I I never really reacted to that but your one hundred percent I charge why would you need political cover to vote for somebody who has false allegations against them and I said they're false\nBecause they're not proven they're not\nCorroborated there's no witnesses and the witnesses that were um that were identified either denied it or refuted it so you're running sheriff Clarke what political covered you need for that\nThey don't you just said look there's there's no evidence and it's incredible and\nI think\nSome imaging his head where he's going to be you know why and I just got to be the darling of the New York times you know will be featured on CNN has some great free thinker or something\nSo it really comes down to a Collins and Murkowski I mean that's what it comes down to what do you think they're going to do on Saturday sheriff Clarke\nWell I don't know what to think in terms of what they're going to do this people it flip flop around\nThey don't vote their conscience it's really hard to say I mean we all thought John McCain\nMade some rest in peace what's going to vote to eliminate\nObamacare and he came in there and\nCast the deciding vote to keep it alive so it's hard to say these politicians you don't know where they're coming from it it's all of them are in the swamp and and they change their market by the minute so in terms of Collins and Murkowski probably whoever gets to where we're going to\nYou know what that that that might very well be it so I guess you could say it's the FBI read for is released we think it'll it it it could be this evening early tomorrow\nIf there's nothing in it than they have the whatever it is political cover they needed and you would think this nomination would go through 'em let me just ask you this if it doesn't go through what type of the fact you think that's going to have\nSheriff David Clarke on Republican turnout on November sixth only thirty three days away\nAnd I said

upright have no more making it to you know\nMore shelf or okay and that is what Donald Trump Donald Trump is trash from former president historical precedent that left that they understand that there was an article in July they understand\nThat Donald Trump going to be in their life\nThirty years from now not just with federal judges so but the fundamental he's making American society and that's why they hate it\nI don't understand why they even here lately fundamental change\nIt's from the big mainstream media and then from the store is back democratic apparatus inactive it turns out to get Trump natural you see people like that and I recommend I haven't read the book but I hear that the segment about Navarro in libraries are wrong in this book here I mean Donald Trump their hero he took on basically appetizers and there's a lot of global it\nAnd he said what we're gonna do it either after you go which everybody said what\nHappened he pulled it off and they keep it as an actor deal here trying to he's going to stop trying to from gaming the system through Mexico he's going to bring manufacturing jobs back and that's where our economy doing so well that's why black unemployment is at an all time low Hispanic unemployment twenty five year low these are the\nConsequences of the policies in actions of Donald property so that's why I'm so proud of what you're doing it and that kind of fighting and they just don't trust the war because you're literally at war not with the Chinese but with a with a global elites [noise]\nSo if you want to see the films that you may Trump that

and ring the doorbell support Donald Trump don't let anybody tell you this just about a local liquor does a nationalized\nElection democratic left are trying to stop the entire Trump program all of it in its totality ... like the drive to separate out the signal from the noise the signal of Donald Trump could not be stronger that is to return America sort of a\nFormer great the makers the economic power manufacturing crap [noise] national security that taste is the national interest of the United states or in mind when we commit our troops and commit our ah commit our resources in\nA show about the world and it's to our it's to bring it on order to the United states and this is what a Trump or try and start to deconstruct at NASA bureaucracy Washington DC that the Trump program and that's why the opposition out out to the store and it's I think it's a pretty\nBinary choice you know if you like what Trump's doing and forget all the noise and everything will be other nor requires thank written\nBy the by the major league hit just to get all that that's that's all the way that it's already forgotten history being important things up here sure\nDeconstructing the administrators they you know winning the economic or China Britain brings back\nThe manufacturing base to the United states giving our workers back back employed and high paying job\nThat the Trump program at you like that like the economy that go to the old and bring some transit because it's going to be tight and things like Dave Brat and these congressional districts in Virginia I think right now going to go

national poll that was exclusively on the\nHill the newspaper yesterday with now up to Dallas John McLaughlin but we really went and looked at the big things that are driving\nAnd what what our polling shows that\nI think Trump going back to the hard core issues that want to get out of the sixteen is at the victory particularly things on like immigration\nOr the economy a national security so uh you know we're doing polling or doing more room during rapid response we're doing I did the right thing to do it the convening authority grassroots I came out of the Tea Party movement and I'm a

more information on what they're doing\nTo go to dominion energy dot com that's the main energy dot com speaking the dummy energy\nJoining us now is Aaron ... media relations manager with dominion energy and he also currently serves as spokesperson and chief communications strategist for the Atlantic coast pipeline a six billion dollar six hundred mile interstate natural gas transmission pipeline\nThat is owned by a number of energy companies\nWe're going to get an update on where we are 'cause I Want my pipeline Aaron great to have you been\nMore than John how you doing [noise]\nFired up today Aaron I'm very excited\nBy the way all these pipeline jobs average salary Ninety five thousand dollars these are great jobs man and a rational long time but then after the pipeline job you get manufacturing and you get more jobs that's what the whole thing is about now\nWe had to stop for well give us an uptick\nRight so just to remind folks this is the Atlantic coast by bond as you described some new or natural gas transmission pipeline that's going to bring\nNew supplies of cheaper natural gas into Virginia North Carolina this is all about as you talked about this was all about growing the economy bringing manufacturing back to eastern Virginia Hampton Roads\nLowering our energy cost so businesses can grow families can have more money in their pockets and it's also about making our electricity cleaner so obviously we've been shutting down a lot of coal plants are the last several years because of tighter environmental controls\nAnd regulations and we'll replacing that with cleaner burning natural gas solar wind all the things that you talked about before so this this project is all about growing the economy creating thousands of new jobs rebuilding the manufacturing sector\nUm we started construction earlier in the summer\nAnd we made a lot of progress in West Virginia and North Carolina uh haven't started yet I'm Virginia we're still waiting on one final approval from the state environmental agency are but we expect to get underway in Virginia here I'm pretty towards like uh you're right that for about six weeks or we have to stop work\nUm before circuit court of appeals uh ordered a couple of agencies the fish and Wildlife Service to the national Park Service to revise some of their opponents\nThe agencies were able to do that relatively quickly and suddenly got back to work once the permits will re issued a few weeks ago and we're moving full steam ahead and in West Virginia North Carolina and I'm hopefully starting in Virginia you're pretty soon\nSo the six week holed up what barriers now it's just getting this done in Virginia just put it in layman's terms for listener\nCharles so we need we we we've got all the state and federal permits we need\nFor West Virginia and North Carolina this is a free state project [noise] ah we have one more permit that still outstanding and Virginia under the it's a permit for erosion and sediment control basically Virginia Department of environmental quality they regulate construction projects so that you don't create erosion\nAnd sediment cage them so that you get much\nWater in the streams and rivers um the agency has done an incredibly thorough job of reviewing every single one of the pipeline's path through Virginia all of our roads and excitement control plans I'm paid been reviewing our plans for\nHer more than a year now [noise] um but we expect to get final approval on those plants here I'm In the early fall so we'll we'll be able to get underway and Virginia\nAnd then we'll be working continuously through the end of next year so it's about uh\nSpring or early in the summer [noise] um and we'll we'll finish up and up next year and John this is all that you know once this project is built [noise]\nPeople are going to see a significant improvement in the economy particularly in the eastern or area and in Hampton Roads um they're gonna see lower energy costs you know the problem with God and Virginia is we haven't rebuilt our our natural gas infrastructure for decades and so the infrastructure that we have\nIsn't keeping up with consumer demand that we're using more and more natural gas to generate cleaner electricity heat her lose power the economy\nBut we haven't built more infrastructure to bring in the additional supplies of natural gas but we need so what's happening is three of us were winners the pipeline for so over strain that serve our region that\nBusinesses have their service shut off for several days hunger the major industrial companies had their their natural gas sort of a cut off and consumers paid hundreds of millions of dollars for an energy costs than they would have if we had the Atlantic coast pipe on it's it's simple laws of\nSupply and demand you have more demand and supply your your prices are going to skyrocket so until we get the Atlantic coast pipeline do consumers and businesses are going to pay hundreds of millions more energy costs than they should\nUm and businesses are going to continue to have their their service shut off during the winter and so that that makes it hard to do business for our party drifting companies but it makes it impossible to attract new industries like manufacturing to help grow the economy so this this infrastructure is really critical to our economy it's important for the environment\nWe're making progress and I'm gonna get Tom\nI Want you Aaron\nAaron is she smokes person and a communications strategic communications manager for dominion energy for the Atlantic coast pipeline I Want you to address the concerns of those people that are opposed to the pipeline\nOn an environmental grounds um and\nI don't mean to the ground so I just don't like any type of energy except solar and wind that's one set\nA but then there's the other side which is they have real environmental concerns that of course our position has always been if

really can't wait because this to me is going to be like last night one of the most classic games or\nYou've got two teams that are very very good one team what a hundred games the other one Ninety seven games as you'll be a great game tonight one game playoff winner takes all at Oakland goes to the Bronx will record and then\nI tend to agree with you when the thing is if it's the political kid

probably\nIntimidate ... aren't the way the crime is most of the land army to know how they should have a Nineteen very heavy at\nTimes but he turned to life in heaven it's worth the wait I'm Kelly and its political moment Bucky by Catholic pastor ministries [noise]\n\nBut I Love this child more love bringing\nTogether Virginia's movers and shakers fed policymakers it's the John Frederick true\nLife has been spending for an archaeological\nOnline at any time at the John Frederick ... dot com\nRight John John sugars radio network great to have you with us hey it's my time you're seeing my debts don't forget across all our Josh Rogers affiliates this weekend again it's secret stadium that's an ...\nAlabama where they take out in the sand for both dogs don't want to mix that's not one minute of it right because you never know buys in every game now\nAnd they're very exciting football team to watch their accent for this week although she does her own five yes they have had three just nail biter one after the other\nLosing by three to two E. T. F. you a couple of weeks ago\nUh they were in until the final minutes and then they put a lot of football up for you a lot on the score for they're never out of the game and\nCoach walk and I was with us and we've got this often just rocking I mean look have you ever seen in my fan you never thought you'd see the day with is a very young team\nWhere they're putting up the and thirty eight points a game and these are not at the end of the game right this is there in it to the final minutes\nAnd ... although there are only five they're going to start to uh get some of these W coming up maybe this week at Sanford the er Sanford dogs one and for a win for in the conference joining us now coach Scott walking the Wii MIT that's come straight down man\n[noise] excuse me on John\nOkay look these games and there is so exciting I Can't wait until a Saturday\nTo put my via might see that San and\nTo give credit where do I know your own five so you you know when you're going to give me the speech about winning and all that stuff that I get all that but look this is coach just exciting foot tall and you're starting all these underclass men I mean you've got something going on man\nOr I think we've done a really good job recruiting we just had a big recruiting a meeting yesterday because we're we're going to buy a week and you know recruiting tune BMI is very unique and it takes a little bit of time don't learn it and\nI think the staff and I am you know kinda figured out the best way to go about our business on the road recruiting and we've got some really good young players that are contributing you know out\nOf high level I think we're a plane and exciting level of often what ball all it was definitely my goal to do so um I don't know if you follow Mike Leach on Twitter you know he had a great quote on balance you know balance is not that ... percent Ron it's about fifty percent pass\nIt it's getting your skill players all five of on the ball and then in a balanced manner and I think we do that and then he equated it to the ... of doing that and then it's true you know in the ... often quarterback pulled back the half bags and both receivers of\nA chance to touch the ball and then in our more often the running back and\nLook for receivers and of course quarterback all get a chance to touch the ball and we got a lot of guys catch the ball making boys and they know the ... in any way though they're playing at a faster level and we like to play bass\nIn Napa ball of bonds because we thought the advantage we have in your mind as we can be mentally talker and physically better condition than are opponents so quaint a hundred played the game is they just walk off than\nOkay so in last week's gay and that was another great game and in another pretty pretty offensive performance fire team you're young quarterbacks you did she know throws for another four hundred plus yours four hundred and thirty yards [laughter]\nYou got you got nine first I was on the ground so I mean you can't see the team's not balance you get tough yards when you need them but I'm\nThe level of sophistication in this offsets um as you as you you run your\nVarious teams is pretty impressive and and uh the other thing is you're jet skiing is throwing that everybody right I mean you've got like six or seven receivers involved in this involving assault that's\nCorrect yeah that's the designers take who the defense gives us again it's very similar to triple Austin football\nIt's just you're throwing the ball the spotted versus reading a dipole back in pitching the ball I think it's more exciting for\nThe fans because they see the ball the whole time and it definitely helps us in recruiting because we can find a lot of guys that like the running jets and a lot of guys like to throw the ball biting running quarterback they can also growing up\nAnd keep the defense on us because it's very difficult nowadays because everybody's looking for that guy with you know all the R P o teams and those are all reaching so the guys that are kind of get left out or the guys like read that\nYou know maybe a little bit like maybe there's one or two deep facts that have Clemson or somebody doesn't want 'em but they're ... and we can find those guys and the I think it's playing dividends this season off at school [noise]\nUh there's no question a let's let's get to the game coming coming up this week\nThis is a winnable game no question I mean Sam for having a good team that they're having some struggles also a there always pretty tough at home though going Alabama Alabama I'm how are you preparing your team for this game anything different\nBut we got an open week this week John So we're not we're not playing Saturday and we got Sanford and then we've got the citadel the following week so everywhere else I'd\nBeen on an open we you you take the next two opponents which you're going to play and\nYou kind of divided up the practice time so we gave the young men on Monday all other than film study and lifting weights\nWas very impressed one of our receivers David on lower on the plane Ninety five plays having a hundred and fifty yards and the touchdown on ten catches a went in there and set a new PR for squad max on Monday by ten pounds\nIn Jordan more didn't as well often brats\nOr did we had three guys that we are as you know during in season on on squads which is a testament to the job they form in doing it in our\nWeight room but we're taking this week working on being the best are getting better hey what do we need to improve and then putting in a neutral schemes against Stanford and sit in the bill especially defense against it at all because they're ... and the tax which I think having played in it having been in office coordinator and that\nIs very difficult to defend just like I think are often difficult to the fans\nAre the big game at home you've got Sam for next week or Saturday until researching then you'd come home against us\nShannon in Chattanooga then you go on the road right right after that but let's talk about your decent I mean they're little house on the last couple of weeks if you look at the\nMercer game Mercer gain I think I'm doing this my memory about seven and a half year on to play 'em that's just unacceptable I mean you can't you can't win that way how are you in dressing that [noise]\n[noise] well defense was ... years where are you most shows uh you know we lost a running for instance in Allen crash and burn your graduation both of them are working great jobs making over sixty thousand dollars a year\nA Allen's in in in Richmond and a\nRaw onions in Roanoke are both working seen both young men are very impressed with them but we got to replace them end up you know replace them with Eliot Brewster who's you know why we Redford sophomore and\nHe gets better each and every week I thought he pointed his best game against a Mercer and then\nYou know Jim Harper is the older guys it's been starting and then we had been backing them up with Liam Coughlin and leaning is battling a an injury right now and and I played for the last two games and then that got hurt the third play of the Mercer gain and tried to fight through it and so you know Brett how came in the game and", "show_name": "The Glenn Beck Program", "year": "2018", "city": "Portsmouth", "day": "03"}
