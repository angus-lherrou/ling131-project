under federal civil rights law\nThe New York times obtained a draft memo of the department of health\nAnd Human Services that went to find sex as either male or female and on changeable the move would be the most significant of a series of maneuvers to exclude the estimated one point four million Americans who identify as\nTransgender from receiving civil rights protections under the Obama administration the recognition of gender identity became more fluid as you know so the Trump Administration\nAre gradually doing away with transgender as a sex for purposes of gaining civil rights now that has nothing to do with gay rights that has to do with defining a gender and I don't know\nRights and uh people want to be transgender I'm for whatever they want to be but uh I don't know that this is a tough one job for grants radio network we'll be right back to the gym [noise]\nFor when they get to our border and maybe you supply didn't\nLook good like food and water to help them get here and if so aren't those people also in violation of the United states law helping someone to enter our country illegally and can't be prosecuted\n[noise] uh well let me get back for your question the answer to that is I really don't know so I'm going to be honest about that I don't know what the hell do apply to that uh if people are giving food and water to the caravan or there are\nOther sponsors supplying them with the cash they need to feed themselves to go forward what or how you would implicate them or\nHow you would go to a foreign country and prosecute them I don't know that's certainly if that money was coming from the United states or they're not only by the\nSame way that the organ I heard is [noise] excuse me that a lot of churches and God Bless ...\nBut a lot of churches or or or taking care of these people once they get in there making ... dollars off of doing that and I just wonder if there isn't a I'm a credible going on with him so I'm\n... the people who do that like you said from the United states or maybe other foreign countries or be prosecuted for what kept him to a mile the United states all\nWell know number one uh there's uh even the president said at his rally they were getting money he didn't know where we're from but there there's no evidence is coming from the United states doesn't mean it's not okay so let me just stop there doesn't mean it's not but there is no direct evidence right now might come out this afternoon but right now\nUh there's no evidence linking to that the churches that make money off this the reason they make money is because they set up businesses\nIn order to take the refugees in seed them close them and then they charge the government and uh they make a very tidy profit over there and got a lot of money means is this a migraine refugee illegal immigration saying\nThat people always find ways to make money off the government and so there's plenty of companies associated with plenty of church is\nMaking a lot of money off the government because they provide for the food the clothing that housing in the education and they get more than they put out so it's becoming a very profitable business for people and these are short term it's right\nIt's a very profitable business for it it's almost all\nGoing to attack yeah they do it and then [noise] and then people down south to organize the rally to bring people north\n[noise] it's organized crime and I think what you're going to take a very close to who's organizing these people whose funding these people and see if there are some of these organizations in the United states didn't profit off of them ... once said you know you're making a good\nPoint illegals coming means no meaning made\nMake a ... blend you make you make a very good are you making very good argument for that I mean it should get looked into now if it's being funded by drug runners and sex traffickers and other uh bad people that are have a better themselves in a caravan and if their funding it than there was not a lot that we can do about that\nAnd there's a lot of people um who have inferred that that's where they're getting the money in order to make the trip to the United states is by bad actors are that\nHave access to resources that have a better themselves in the caravan whether it be sex traffickers drug traffickers\nMeals if you'd call them uh you know there's been rumors that there's a a that there's other people from parts of the country in this caravan the way that I look at it doesn't really matter who's there good bad or not it's an invasion at the end to the United states and if you let the stand\nIf you let the stand if you let them come in I'm In the political pressure become such that they get in or the majority of them again in five seven thousand to get in and you you know apprehend five hundred of them\nThe next terror van is not going to be seven thousand claimed is gonna be Seventy thousand and the one after that is going to be seven hundred thousand and then they're simply going to craft the United states and he can't do anything about\nIt so they're gonna have to stop this and if you remember a\nThe zero tolerance policy which was the antithesis of catch and release was put in place by the Trump Administration and Jeff Sessions in order to act as a deterrent and for a short period of time it did\nUntil they have to go back to catch and release because they separated the kids from the parents and we got the CNN kids in cages headline and it all blew up and it was the PR disaster and that was the end of it\nAnd so you know there's not we have to figure this out\nAnd some kind of immigration reform in the hole in the Congress is it going to do crap when you got seven thousand people ready to crash support\nThey they're going to have to figure it out thank you Glenn but we'll have to see how that goes right ah meantime the uh the caravan is becoming an election issue the Democrats like it's going to help them they really do they think that\nThe fact that these people are coming under his mom's with babies\nAnd it goes back to the kids in cages and don't you have a hard and Trump's me at all the Trump supporters I mean they don't want help the kids will debate the moms with the babies are they think it's going to help them I think this is a disaster if you're the Democrats right now every\nDay this caravan gets closer to the United states they are losing votes because\nThat we're powerless to stop powerless powerless because of the media and because of what happened with zero tolerance and so I don't think the president it's kidding what he says he will put the military there\nBut you're gonna have to have a wall and then they're all going to be camped out right at the border\nAnd they're going to need food water and they're they're not going away they have to go back they have to turn back it's got to be a very it's we we don't know how this was going to turn out but right now for the Denver crabs right now at the snapshot in time this is a political catastrophe for them\nTwo weeks before the election now what they're hoping it turns into is more kids in cages propaganda so then they can blame Trump the administration and Republicans on having the heart\nAnd separating kids from ... that's what they're hoping it turns out too but if it doesn't if it's just a humanitarian catastrophe on the border\nAnd people see pictures of ten thousand migrants tried to invade their country the Republicans got to hold the house\nBecause no one in their right mind can't think that that is a good idea other than\nThe most left wing partisans that believe that every one that comes over as a potential democratic vote that's it and that does not represent the majority of people in America so the president regardless of the political ramifications\nPresident Trump ran on this issue this was his signature issue it's coming for which there is no wall\nAnd he is going to have to take a stand and stop these people from coming in [noise] but they have to do it in a way that is a with in our value system if that makes sense Jimmy Williamsburg says this could be a powder keg if they\nGet to the border before the election imagine troop stopping this that's what the Democrats are hoping I mean that's why they were behind this at the beginning to figure okay if we can get this\nAnd it's a PR catastrophe a with a military with bayonets and mouse with babies I then uh it's it'll be great for the Denver crabs New York times post CNN the LA Times will be a beside themselves with clean\nSo you're right this is a powder keg uh Jennifer in Norfolk says\nThe gets back into the transgender issue has really complicated things with for the majority a man just won the women's you see a cycling championship he identifies as a woman and won't suppresses just tossed around\nAnd he competes as a woman with a male body science is simply

I'm Sorry I don't I'm pro gay rights or you want to identify as a woman and when it's cycling contest or\nI guess eventually women that are real women are going to get mad over it and filed a suit or something but I just I'm passionate about this and if somebody wants to identify as a transgender and married another do whatever they want I just don't care I\nMean that's\nHow they're made it and

but that's the Democrats nature nationwide there was a great Politico piece a couple of days ago still laugh if people want to go see it on the line points of the Democrats are many people are the liberal agenda and it's not a policy agenda I urge everybody go take a look at it\nYou're on the John feathers radio network where with incumbent Republican congressman Dave Brat from the southern congressional district that's central Virginia He's in a tight\nBattle for re election to a third term against a very well funded democratic challenger Abigail Spanberger or is this will be decided along with all the other midterms in fourteen days November six early voting\nIs already underway in Virginia costs were let's get back to the caravan and seven thousand people or is it not is it not unreasonable for a average people to see this and think okay\nIf these seven thousand people are allowed to come in and breaks our laws are just coming to the United states what what stops in next caravan from being Seventy thousand people were the one after that for being seven ... seven hundred thousand people I mean what would be the deterrent if they're simply allowed to\nI'm Jane I'm basically seen them mob status and just over run the authorities in and come in as you've seen them do in Mexico what would what would stop the second caravan from being since Seventy thousand instead of seven times\nNot that not ... that's exactly the point right that's why we need you Barrow prior to end the green light right once you have any undersea for a promise and the state the whole world\nAnd so once you let your guard at your picture right your picture President Obama in ... park right now\nWith all those in charge and Abigail Spanberger in charge and what would they do and you know what the answers here be total chaos folks\nFlooding and then there are a signal to the whole world hate they got an right they got an aircraft green light let's go right and so\nI thank goodness the president's turn up some strong signals the Congress was going to set up some strong signal a we have a good laugh bill that that you dealt with the docket kid I had a bill was Senator Cruz to deal with the\nUniting the parents of kids at the border we all compromise on that Democrats that no reasonable compromise because they want open borders cheap labor dominant to sanctuary cities and just look at Nancy Pelosi right look at San Francisco they gotta\nThey gotta make sure he's ... he's the city is in big pay right now go Google San Francisco everybody look at it and that's what they want to bring to Richmond and they're already starting to happen in a pile of the already not just idea like the end policy\nWill San Francisco has the seventh largest population in the United states and the third largest homeless population\nAnd that is growing and a priest when it's gonna be rivaling Los Angeles as we know ah the estimates are about twenty five thousand people at night are homeless in Los Angeles or sleeping under bridges and drain types that's a lot of people\nAnd San Francisco rivaling that\nAccomplishment I Want to get to a what exactly do I mean I've asked this question a number of times so I'm going to pose it to you also this caravan is coming they've crossed Mexico is becoming the president says I'm going to stop it I might send the military there\nWe've already gone through the hero tolerance policy and that was a public relations disaster so what I mean there's not time to enact anything in in in ... days it is going to happen you guys aren't even in section\nSo what should the president do how does he stop at like what exactly what he says I'm going to send the military they are in close the border what does that mean\nYou can be for the defense of consent everything you know to where the uh seven thousand a folk hero wringing our company blew out but more importantly we have a lot of leverage over Mexico\nRight back to where it's got to be done to president Mexico there's already a hundreds and hundreds of law enforcement or to weaken it pick off some of the folks and send them back home all ready and I think that the primary move that's what happened last time\nThan we supported the huge number problem and so it's just it's just ... we gotta send our own resources to send the wrong signal or that our our border is secure in there and obviously you need to build a wall and put up security measures are to keep their strength from\nThe difference if you want all their versus what we have to stay in ... it's the fact that the last is so hard and\nAgainst it is is almost the evidence itself that they know it will be a factor right if they thought it wouldn't be a factor and they just wanted to go ahead and do it but they know that would be effective in and they don't want it so we need all the above we we have good a warrant\nFor spent on the books are we just need to enforce\nIt and so that's that's the play golf\nCarts review with checks for American restaurant who's in your district he says I'm In the seventh district if I were to go to the ER and not pay I'd be chasing the Anthony earth and threatened with every type of legal action imaginable\nAnd then they were garnish my wages fish double standard is just crazy I mean there's this one of the issues for average people struggling to pay their bills\nYeah no that's that's right it's crazy because he's a citizen these darn records or around the book with a fantasy he's got an income stream that is that the feds have already Iran\nTerrible all his personal information from the income what he's made and that's the whole point and that's the total on the speaker of citizens versus non non citizen citizens are\nOn the hook for everything that the non citizens do illegally and I think the American eighty percent issue right I mean it's the number one polling Republican issue right now\nAnd that after they the camera knowledge chemical was the last show that the tactics\nFor years and they're using them in my district right collapses threatening businesses one half of the other downside stealing private property and you know leaving\nCareful notes on my own doors theloop that was widely reported and so are you American people see the choice right the economy's growing\nWe got strong America First policies and foreign policy at the border and the alternative is unpredictable to me it's just simply on think why not I do have people coming our way no right to Republicans are all coming home independents are breaking our way up to the Kavanaugh story and so in the end I think the uh\nVirginia people are going to do the right thing [noise]\nPerson but I have a minute I have I have a minutes or the show he affair we're going to get more information or the Turkish government is saying the next several weeks of MPs was involved in this\nOr do you favor some sort of sanctions or can crush on actions in response to allegedly what it appears that the Saudis did within their own constantly\nYeah yeah absolutely you you you cannot ever since the signal to another world leader even if they're writing an ally in other respects\nCredits are right or to take the life of another human being and so there's going to have to be stiff sanctions\nI think the White House is going to get there on a on it you know more than just a narrow targeted basis I think they're going to be significant and down the Congress for sure command and back that up by and got it we we have\nTo write so you can have an ally but when

to head down to Florida\nI Know I heard the weather was changing sort of like I got to go down there and find out what's going on in the Senate race so what better time than we have the Obama the weather in Virginia and I can finally get out of the rain it is beautiful here showing no question about it okay we've we've got a\nWe've got some things I Want to go over I Want to start with a caravan coming here to the tea in to the United states fourteen days before the midterms sure we understand us now grown to seven thousand people the president saying or they're not going to come and he's going to close the border if need be how does this play out Sean Spicer\nOn it I think it ... it look there's a lot of things right now it can get into the midterm elections that are sort of that very electorate is a demonstration of what the difference between the two parties are now you see these things happen it Chris Wise is\nThe importance of this election and so you thought that to some degree with Canada or people saying okay I get it this is why the policies and people that will come in with this administration and having a party in power\nSimilarly I think that you look at these people kind of a coming marching on up you know Mexico trying to come into our border\nAnd the president's been very clear about what his position is and that he's going to make sure that we are eight eight hundred law and order and it catches march on into our country if they see fit I I don't think the Democrats clearly have that same set of policy oriented so so\n... what the differences are between the two parties in various candidates as you head into an election and right now it couldn't be quicker\nSo what should ah\nWhat should the president's action thing now as they get if they if they do get through Mexico and you ... you have seven thousand I mean I understand the politics of it but let's get to the policy what should the president said he's going to send the military there how would how would that work how would\nThat play and wouldn't CNN be saying okay you've got bayonets so pointed at mom's with babies that's what CNN will do\nBy like ... you know it's just it's a it's actually a very complicated policy that I'm probably not the right person to get into it in a sense that there there's something about I think that you can send you the national guard a federalized or national ice them\nOr utilize certain aspects of National Guard I there is a tricky issue between title tiny titled thirty two that detail how you could use certain members of the military for domestic purposes\nBut regardless I think that the point that he's making it she couldn't figure out what it takes to do that\nPut them along the border and make sure that people can't cross over a but there is an obligation for anyone to make sure that we're ... for any president especially this what he's made it clear what his priorities are that we protect the border and we've got to make sure that people come into our country or coming so legally incorrectly and and not with not sort of I\nWill eat nearly an ad safety ... this is a country of laws or I'm you know if people are here to seek asylum I understand that we need to make sure that it's done through with the correct process\nWhere with Sean Spicer he was the former press secretary the first press secretary for President Trump in the Trump Administration he's also a longtime F. O. J. that means ... jobs a Sean\nAnd Sean is also the author of the book called the briefing\nPolitics the press and the president which you could buy on Amazon your favorite books or or you can buy it on his Web site go to Sean Spicer dot com is also a senior advisor for America first policies the number one political action committee in America that supports President Trump's America First agenda\nUp showing the show the situation and Mohamed been solving a you're in the White House at the time about a lot of our relationship with the Saudis was being discussed that was the president's first ... says it\nUh but now I guess is really embarrassed\nPresident Trump with uh the nonsense that's done out of this or what appears to be\nA some kind of an assassination in their consulate oh what do you think the president does now if uh it's proven to be true\nAnd don't you find what NBS if he was involved in a signing off on this don't you think that was a a basically a slap in the face to the president\nI think you're absolutely right that the idea that if you're that comfortable with the relationship that you feel that you can be ...\nNever mind whether whether the United states you know to begin with with it but but especially with the relationship that this president is trying to partner with Saudi Arabia that was his first try if you recall abroad because he really wanted to try and cannot relationship so\nI think that the actions that have been taken and the idea that it's taken too weak or a bit ridiculous you know the guy from the get go how serious this why\nAre they do clearly it it's one thing when they initially claimed that they didn't know anything about it that was tough to believe but next week later they're saying well okay so if something did happen and there was a fight with that you knew that two weeks ago so this is an unbelievably in helping stall contact\n'em and and I think that you know all the steps that they've taken has just been read I mean the the the cleaning crew setting and the team um they either to explain all of this which I think it's beyond the pale of objects waning um but right now I think the president should not just looked at in terms of the relationship with Saudi Arabia\nBut as a personal insult because\nThe idea that we treat in Saudi Arabia the way that we have and he made a section amazing gesture of respect by visiting them first and the presidency\nAnd trying to foster and strengthen the relationship we happened to him and this is how we get repaid\nOr the president needs to be strong in\nI'm In agreement with that show in a hundred percent I think that is spot on a ... exactly what we've been saying for some time it is insulting there's a slap in the face and it was very disrespectful and it's kind of like hey look we're friends I've got a hundred and ten million dollar arms deal therefore I can do whatever I Want\nAnd I think they're going to find with this president that's really not the way a relationship work so\nWe'll see how that plays out she wants to say I want to uh I\nI Want to ask you about these mobs these left wing wing moms that are going around I mean in Minnesota last week or two candidates were actually assaulted two Republican candidates were assaulted by these bombs is going all over the United states the threats to Susan Collins and others\nAre people getting chased out of um of a ... ... being a being chased out some subway stairs what's the deal here\n[noise] what look here's an interesting thing I I was really not a column last week that I'm I'm a constitutional lawyer or a scholar I Can't remember which what were the closet an interesting theory what's your name what he's talking about how our constitution protects us\nThe reality is if you actually read the first amendment if they're going to protect our ability to peacefully assemble right and\nThat's the key word peacefully assemble and if you think about how normally things work do you need you know there's do you want to go to temple and that particular city and whether it's we're getting or anywhere else you get a permit you got to do it and that's that's because you have a right to do what he just doesn't get European or do you do it where however you want\nHer to think about that because\nIt it all the action from the left against the right it is not in it we have a right to to express ourselves to we you know I address our government and our elected officials given carte blanche to do it however we want and touching something and threatening way here's the thing that I think the bigger problem to me John not only that\nSchmidt Nancy colored Maxine Waters Chuck Schumer all of the people who are leaders of their parties should be standing out in saying this is unacceptable you have any right to protest\nBut there is a way and it needs to do that going into a restaurant and basically threatening I Wonder if they're sending their having dinner and let's be clear because we're all these people on the left to go oh well they just stood in front of them one let let them try to have that down and tell you how it feels when you are surrounded by ten twenty thirty people\nCan't connect you to get out get out we're going to throw you out\nYou can't tell me that that doesn't make you feel correct\nAnd that's what they're doing and I just I think that the biggest thing the media is frankly a complete mess because if this is happening on the right\nPeople will be calling for people's resignation why are you standing against whatever good because they basically agree with them the function of mainstream media all sort of complex and that's because they refused to ask questions to the Democratic leaders as to why they're allowing this to happen and getting it to happen\nBreaking news this hour from town hall dot com I mean he's the President Trump says he's alerted the border\nPatrol and the military about a caravan of Central American migrants

take this one step at a time we need a full accounting\nAnd then we need accountability and as editor of the editorial page at the Washington Post that's what I'm focused on the nature of who'd Jamal was I mean that's the other part of this you know he was no enemy of Saudi Arabia or he wasn't anybody's enemy he was a journalist\nDoing his job\nYou know spark open debate about important issues he was a patriot\nHe wanted the right thing for Saudi Arabia he was even rooting for the crown prince to succeed in his reforms he had these ambitions and dreams and some of which we shared here at the Washington Post to expand the platform uh for voice is a particularly in\nOr about Saudi Arabia in the middle east or to allow for the kind of open debate\nWhich he felt those countries are entitled to and people there want but it's their governments don't allow so I think there's a a last hotbed if that's what it is which\nYou know now kind of reads like a final will and testament was not that it was a a mission statement I'm for what he thought the region needed and and what he still hopes to do\nHere's what we know Jamal walks into that constantly on October second and he didn't walk out the Saudis to know what happened\nSo the idea that we need days and days of investigation uh and forensic work and it's ridiculous\nJust tell us what happened and\nIn my opinion I you know in the United states government that was\nCommitted to the values that we shouldn't be standing up for what you're saying that\nWe wouldn't be sending people over the smile next to the crown prince we wouldn't be raising ridiculous theories about rogue operators we would be saying we need the facts and we need them yesterday\nAnd then we can figure out what the right policy\nAt the post in our

we know right now than they are operating within that caravan from people from the middle east to embed within that caravan trying to get into the United states\nThat many actors are trying to get
