answer is as Jesus said what was the first person there was never a sin cast the first stone [noise]\nI think the difference here is that it happened in the conflict and it was such a blatant disregard of the relationship that the president\nHas attempted to build with the Saudi kingdom and especially NBS I'm using the White House and things like that\nSo I think that's the real issue for the president and\nI you know he said there's gonna be severe consequences I Do believe that President Trump's along with the Congress is going to do something because the big difference here is it happened and I'm In an embassy\nWhich as there is an international order right I mean you're going to an embassy ...\nYou're not expected to get your head cut off with a\nChainsaw or a bone saw whatever they had so it's kinda gruesome and I think I think that's what's fueling the outrage I mean this is an ally of ours and\nI think it's put President Trump in a very very awkward position and there's got to be some accounting for that what the consequences are I don't know\nCertainly I think that Rand Paul and others and Bob Corker and others are going to demand that there's a hearing in Congress on what our involvement why we're still involved\nIn supporting the Saudis and the Emirates in the Yemeni civil war I mean I\nI think at least you're going to get that but when you agree with

again or the Muslim Brotherhood once again Qatar\nQatar which is supporting terrorism uh all across the middle east or do we want the Muslim Brotherhood the profit from the ... my bottom line and I know the Congress is going to force President Trump's\nHands on this I'm fairly certain that that you're right you're very ... read of the domestic political situation I Believe that's exactly what's going to happen\nAnd they're going to force us to stop helping Saudi Arabia and Yemen which is basically going to leave the flu season started to sign and it's going to leave the country divided um it's not going to solve any of the problems of what's going on in Yemen because you've got the same parties there that are battling it out\nOr it's just going to leave another Arab country in a state of division where people are fighting on the ground um so I see no no good coming out of that politically and I see no geopolitical good coming out of supporting the Muslim Brotherhood and\nI knew your market choking and I'm Sorry he died on sorry was brutal and I'm not going to defend Mohammed bin Salman man but you don't go rewarding\nYour enemies are with geopolitical gifts because\nYour friends made a mistake like that\nSo what do you think the United states should do is anything\nWell I I Would hate to be in President Trump's hands place um I I Know he's got he's surrounded by some good people secretary Pompeo and the vice president who is a very strong moral\nPerson uh what do they come up with I mean the king is not going to stitches\nSigned he's not going to throw into the

think we have to be a political objectives\nOf dividing various Arab countries I don't say we but I mean the the deep state the foreign policy establishment um and that's not a good thing it's the middle east on fire\nOr it wrecks the economy and puts a lot of young people out of work and creates floods of refugees and you see people like George Soros who would like to see refugees we don't want to see more refugees we don't want to see are gone sending more refugees to Europe it's the Muslim Brotherhood that it's been doing this both from turkey and\nFrom from Libya and they continue to do this because they're trying to flood Europe with refugees and people are doing the same thing with our borders in South America coming from Honduras and Mexico and wherever else are\nWe don't want to see that it's a mistake because it is it possible\nAnd were you may be NBS just isn't particularly effective leader\nOn a day later to get the closed door transcribed interview that will be

care is such an important issue and it's on so many people's minds joined this upcoming election and beyond\nIs my good friend del ballot sewers the executive director and founder of liberty health share now um my self and my family have been proud members of liberty health share forget this seven years\nIt is the best thing we have ever done you know all the healthcare debate [noise] we have to debate it and we talked about it and uh we analyze it for you on the air but I'm not personally involved in it because my family got out of this a long time ago we got out of the whole\nObamacare healthcare rat race and we went to liberty\nHealth share which the services phenomena oh this is a great organization where it's different because everybody shares in their own cost of health\nThose members and it is growing every day is the best kept secret in America\nAnd I urge all of my listeners now if you worked for the federal or state or county government and you've got a great health plan where you worked for the company and they provided you do a little a copay that's fine\nBut if you're an independent contractor or you work in the gig economy are you on a ten Ninety nine or you work for small companies like we have and we can't we can't buy the insurance we can it would put aside of businesses too expensive or you're a business owner any of those things\nThen liberty health share is a nominal opportunity for you and as I said my family is three and I've got a fourteen\nEasy to do the services great\nEverything gets done they need to go see it everything on your behalf

basis of our shared values and beliefs but we also stimulate one another to lean to lead healthy lives but the reason why there's such satisfaction in America\nAbout healthcare today that's why it's at the top of people's discussion list a concern lists as we come into this mid term election that is because we don't have a health care system in America John we\nCare system the only comment Dr O'Shea is way here so [laughter] and we got to change that and we still anyway one other encourage each other we welcome folks with conditions that by just simply\nAdding exercise or die or contrary to their lives were you versus diabetes and heart disease and high blood pressure certainly obesity we help people stop smoking we're focused\nOn the care of our health and that's what we've got to get back to ... and focus on and understand that health care is really about the care of our health and that's what we're focused on\nWell you stopped me from smoking so that's good [laughter] yeah

text I said you're never going to see Fenway again or they're not getting out of Texas and it was quite the opposite so I have to crush it like\nSquarely focus now part of the reason that they're squarely focus is the Trump Pence team has been on the road campaigning all over the country in key congressional key Senate races to make sure voters know exactly what's at stake in two weeks\nYou're with the John triggers radio network you're Godzilla truth in America we're with Corey Lewandowski he is uh the the author he's known authors kind of amazing career you went from campaign manager

what's\nAfrica for in our history more of the lowest unemployment rate for African Americans and Hispanics in recorded history the unemployment rate for women in sixty five years that's what the American people care about and everything else is just salacious rumor and innuendo\nLet's get to the to show give fair President Trump yesterday Corey saying that he was not particularly convinced about the Saudi narrative what happens now\nLook I I don't think there's any questions that this out he has a responsibility to show\n'em but we should also understand that this would not be

and then you'll see it shortly right right after you'll see some extra up right after that\nOkay and we or anticipating that whatever happens on November sixth compost ...\nActually helping drivers agenda forward tell me I'm right\nOr you're a hundred percent correct look I think every president after mid term election regardless of the success or failure so their party shuffle the deck a little bit I think you'll see some changes in the cabinet or some of those have been discussed whether they come to fruition or not I couldn't speak to\nBut I think it's very difficult to see changes take

that are still\nIn Mexico we should be fine right because next trip to the right order so we shouldn't have to worry about them I'm going to cross the border right\nYeah sure so what's your point\nBut my point is really what we eat anything that the president because he told us that Mexico will go up there so now what do I need to do what do you what\nHe said he didn't say that he didn't\nThat Mexico would build a wall he said that he would build a wall and Mexico would pay for it and the way they would pay for it is by the tariffs and renegotiating NAFTA which brings more money into the United states\nGive them the funding you need the money is there and be by by renegotiating the disastrous NAFTA deal which has hampered us ... workers manufacturers and makers of things for forty years in the United states were thirty whatever it's been\nA bite by renegotiating that when everybody said he wouldn't be able to do what he's done it it's a better deal for us but better deal for us workers more money at stake in the U.S that's how you're paying ...\nGoing to reduce the deficit kind of like how that's working right now to\nEnd the short term it's short term pain long term gain

the same thing happened under Reagan the ...\nGoes up in the short term firstly word for it because you're taking a large enough to pay for it so that\nThere's ... there's there's a lack\nSimilar to thousand Nineteen you've done this thing that the debt actually start to get reduced so there's a one year lag behind it because tax receipts are down people are just the best thing in the business is

I Want to five percent cut from everybody across the board you can find it have a good day ... what do you think of that\nWell first of all what your listeners to from time to time go on my Web page by non profit\nPolicy organization called American opportunity dot org American opportunity dot org and you'll see that over the years we've written about economic\nGrowth than we've written about foreign policy you alluded to a recent article that our boat on foreign policy of actually rich six and we also have some people writing all some Chinese issues about other issues like that they're on our Web page American opportunity to work\nBut one of our oldest for positions that we've done in our history the gross code which was signed at the time that the the last words in charge of the country and the wages were not growing it people were not working on it was gross slow\nAnd we proposed to be a policy of tax cuts for economic growth\nWell that's now been done and you know the whole point is this how you gonna get another debt\nYou're either going to have to raise taxes in\nOrder to finance the debt or you're going to have to grow in order to create more revenue build a bigger pie but at the end of the day the DNI good increased revenue if you just spend the same brevity right again if you get\nYour age or near the gross by the million dollars each and spend a billion and I asked this to Illinois so at the end of the day we asked some major decisions is Tucker but now we're going to spend our money\nRight now we're basically a moving into less just trying to move us in the direction of socialism which is a transfer of money from one pockets of the other but at the end of the day there's no limit to that and that increases the debt and furthermore dries out money that's going to be absolutely essential for the coming conflicts of the twenty first century\nIn our military spending is going to be absolutely necessary I research are are developed like a science these things are also has to be pushed for which we have a lot of priorities and good governance and good executive leadership got to be a good irrational leadership is going to be necessary to help define that spending\nSo um we can't actually tournaments because the president has made that promise on multiple times that was part of his\nEconomic platform he said I have a deal the deal is a you've paid into Social Security you have these different things and the money's going to be there I'm not going to cut that that represents\nCut military spending you know so when you when you look at a five percent cut across everything else discretionary spending you know you're not talking about trillions of dollars are you\nPlaying Joel desire the American conservative it's they're actually doing a majority\nOf the house or wherever we're spending money and then have a policy against us are real political discussion commit either in campaigns for intellectuals or otherwise taste of what we're spending our money on and what we have to spend their money [noise]\nBut once they get real short and that is if you increase taxes you reduce economic activity issue you're increased taxes you reduce economic activity it me and that's the approach to the left their goal is to simply go for the bucks and grab the money for anybody they can get his law\nAnd they use and make it quote they're rich quick but I can promise you John based upon all the numbers I've ever seen in order to pay for this debt and to pay for\nThis government if it's going to be a socialist you're gotta go into the middle class and get that money ... just after and conservatives don't believe that we believe people keep it as much of their own money as they can that's why I ran for governor I push the car tax cuts and that's what the goal is the goal is to give people\nMore control over the last people on their own money that's the Republican conservative my truck\nAnd that's why we have to try to do so the teacher\n[noise] governor Jim Gilmore that is a great analysis of where we are today that's why I Love having you on\nSo refreshing thanks for your time sir hey for more information you can go to

you got to do something at\nThe fact that this was done in a conflict ... an embassy look you either have international world order or you don't\nAnd for all my trip listeners out there we all screaming about sovereignty writes you ... you know one of one world government you know one one world order you want sovereignty well if their sovereignty that means is countries\nAnd it just countries there has to be an international order otherwise there's world chaos\nAnd one of the international rules are if you walk into an ever see it's supposed to be safe and sacrosanct not you get your head chopped off and put in a barrel a garden right that just doesn't that just doesn't work\nAnd and the and the essence gathered there is a day of reckoning coming governor of the day of reckoning it happens it happens when you\nI was really a you know until now this was in the\nCountry this would have been between countries\nBut no humans are tarnished reputation of the president's family\nSimply guilt by association and I personally believe that time has come to deliver a very strong actually [noise] and uh a slap on the wrist this is the kinds of Mexico where the Saudis have to basically learn\nThat what they're doing the harms not only their reputation harms harms their own country you can also harm to the interest of the United states of America or I Would start very much by making it clear that somebody is simply that the war is over\nThey have to wrap it up\nSo I Would certainly crimes take whatever actually Clinton against the people directly involved all went up to\nA certain extent of the real world we're not going to take personal action against Mohammed Vincent man I Believe but certainly I'm not the people in his inner circle that this or that hurts\n\nIn the commentaries that they buy somebody from us that we need them family is not as good an hour to the real narrative is the Saudis are much more than we need to have\nA it's not in a\nThe word I'm looking for it's not a one way streets and the Saudis the Packers Sunday United States is really quite considerable they can't go to\nSomebody else to fire weapons because obviously can but it means that if they break with us their own military comes to a screeching halt within within days because we provide all of the screen apart we provide\nAmerican companies in American technicians provide most of the maintenance of supervision\nAnd the skills are they tell you they said I don't believe the Saudi military could\nStay functional beyond a few weeks maybe a month or two without direct American support so\nWe have the upper hand there's no doubt in my mind we have the upper hand ah it also looks like the Europeans are going to stop selling a military equipment the salaries\nAre so that leaves them with the Russians are the only other viable place to go and I'll tell you I wouldn't want to be in countries like Saudi Arabia dependent on the Russians for my defense and it would take five years to basically stands out the American flag and by no\nMeans so much reaction to a very simple\n[noise] relations in case we may not rational\n\nOr the other great of course is that if you know so much damage to the only family is jails or their wealth and so forth was justified made him but at the same time he has made so many enemies\n[noise] domestically ...

up\nYou know a lot of the things that NBS has gotten involved in um have not been successful whether it be the way he's conducting the Yemeni civil war which I think uh even supporters of that would say it's been a disaster on every possible level\nThe um the blocking he did with Egypt Bahrain and the Emirates against Qatar has been a total colossal failures almost a comedy show because uh the country of cutting the state of\nCutter is much better off economically and otherwise and they were before the blockade\nAnd all the men is that the Saudis aren't getting any of their business I mean it was really a completes its atrophy and if you if you went to Harvard Mr bathroom toilet a business class and international relations how to do a blockade inhabit blow up in your face that would be
