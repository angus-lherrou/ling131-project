running for twenty twenty already here in the last week so things are wrapping up\nSo this is only from the Democratic side no Republicans have grown up there right\nNow you know this is talk of course about John Case sake and for Jeff blank running against Donald Trump for the Republican nomination I actually wrote an op ed for the statewide paper here in New Hampshire just last week I ... it's pretty\nChilling to take on Donald Trump I'm a ... you know the thing is it any time a Republican primary where a sitting president has been challenged getting on the right job and these guys are running on the left they really wouldn't have a prayer feeding the president and the Republican primary\nRight now right now that's that's right now anything can happen goodness knows who have had an\nCan happen anything of course and especially you know I got\nMiller drops of big weren't things insurance All right let's let's shift to the Democratic nomination credit primary where I think we're four hundred and Seventy nine days away something like that from the Democratic primary hamster [laughter] who's counting\nRight but not why I think it's I think it's smart crushed for you to to be talking about this stuff and got because then there's the presidential I stuff you know there's there's all kinds of things happening behind the scenes right now\nThis is where it happens right the pro pro life pro frozen them at him [laughter]\nAnd counting the day after November's election candidates start doing things in a more public way but like I said senator or Joe a branch from New York was up here yesterday campaigning\nWith Democrats can't pay a candidate for governor in New Hampshire\nAnd show she's laying the groundwork change and and you know she's doing that all across the country and um so she's\nStarting to to put things together I'm Alec Baldwin I I Know it may soon Shelley I'm sure you've heard about it to the guy he's he's making wrong he made his second trip to New Hampshire just this past week\nReally twice in the last six months Alec Baldwin Alec Baldwin and he said he has not ruled out running for president\nHe Mike we're back in the news more this is my comment in my producer of the show looking at we're making news this morning Steve ball like this one\nYoung Alex Alec Baldwin has John ah spoke at the largest fundraiser for the Democratic party in New Hampshire who um aren't just last week yeah\nWow see the rain is old Alec Baldwin is Jack Ryan you know it's kinda my God yeah [laughter] that was back in the Cold War you know a hundred October [laughter] that's right\nYeah so who else you've seen up in in New Hampshire and who would you get to be the front runners in the New Hampshire primary today likely to win the twenty twenty primary in February of next year\nEuropean Bernie Sanders Mr President he will be the front runner okay ... ... out about it now I'm In New Hampshire no doubt about it right and if he doesn't uh down a little bit Warren will likely be the front runner\nOkay so how 'bout what recently happened it was Senator Warren in New Hampshire how does that play with her I mean bumbling of the DNA ancestry ball this week but disaster you know\nAnd democratic circles I actually don't think it's the talk as much a liberal Democrats are going to be looking for a liberal Democrat regardless of facts\n[laughter] dangerous [laughter] you know they think they face their their choices in and position primarily on emotion and\nJesse Paris from ... Iowa just call it don't you heard that very a veteran democratic operative in in Iowa was describing a I'm a social scene but in reality in the in the Democratic voters the primary but they also want to win and they might go\n[laughter] that's funny now I\nI'm a Republican I think it was about one would have a similar problem I don't think she's electable in a in a\nGeneral election nationally nationally okay yeah I ... you know for that using that to be an issue as an example um and so I don't think I Will say though it is\nI I don't think it affected her here in New Hampshire\nI Do think it affected them getting behind the knee operation and\nAh and then you know the all the maneuvering going on behind the scenes among potential democratic candidate for her to actually take over a news cycle before the election the way she did was outrageously self serving\nAnd literally send to who does that why why do you think if you knew the results of the DNA test and it was counter to your narrative that you're trying to ... after you put that thing up midday on Christmas [laughter] you Mary that's right [laughter]\nNo I don't understand it [noise] so how do you think ah okay so you got Sanders worn just because this New Hampshire but the other guys have got to go there and compete or do they have to they might they just say\nYou know I think that you know I think they're too because there's always gonna think opportunities and as you probably know credit that I'm Still Clinton made a name for himself by doing well and and coming back to to win at a time when she was losing\nSo you don't have to wear your New Hampshire primary some to make one poll waves across the country\nSo especially as Elizabeth Warren is a front runner she's from Massachusetts neighboring Massachusetts\nThe candidate who comes in second and third or a kitten get momentum as a result\nYeah 'cause I think Clinton finished third right yeah that's right yeah so so but you have to win pleasure show in New Hampshire to advance do you have to yeah\nThat's right that is correct and I just I don't think people understand about the Democratic nomination process this cycle is that California has moved up yeah and they're going to happen that's expensive state and Kamala Harris\nComical Harris is going to have a big lead there\nYes and that's the I think it's going to be an interesting thing I didn't hear if you guys talked about this for like ... on the Iowa\nA conversation but what she does in the early primary states will be interesting given the California hooked up will she tried well we'll see try and uh and and pick a state to land will she try and do well in all of them and um you know 'cause they're so different sets of early primary states ... compared to California\nAgain I think you have to at least try to compete in some of these because the reality is even though you might not win New Hampshire you won't matter and the the nomination legitimately so you still have to win it in the in the electoral college that you cannot you can't\nJust blow past Iowa New Hampshire because those are those who have gone in either direction especially with Trump winning Iowa last time pass right no doubt about it what issues or drive a New Hampshire voters these days what's going on\nIs there still the number one issue um that Governor here is a Republican Christian who knew and he's\nAnd uh uh with what Donald Trump's been doing that and governor Sununu the economy's booming we have the second lowest unemployment rate in the country\nThen I'm part of the Democrats don't want to talk about that they're trying to talk about anything but the economy\nWith a family you paid leave issue ... they're just trying to make up an issue that might connect with voters other than the economy so that's going to continue to be number one second issue here\nChris I I don't know how it worked in other states you've heard Donald Trump even talk about this is the opioid epidemic grew a which is pretty ... pretty severe in New Hampshire so that's the second biggest issue really\nThat's that's yeah that's sad number\nThat it's affected our number ... we've had the we've had that disease in our family as well and it's a it's a scourge and the number of people dying as a result the doors and everything else was criticized country and it's going to handle it and I don't think that's part of Missouri [noise]\nSo it's not a partisan issue Mike a final productions where do you think coming out with got thirty seconds punch it where do you got for the Democratic nominee the Democratic finishers in New Hampshire twenty twenty\nI hey it's going to go a Elizabeth Warren or won't win or if she runs she started when the New Hampshire primary um it I think they're going to be I think there's going to be some kind of dark\nHorse like a um a court reporter I expect will be somewhere in the top three [noise] um and then and then you know what I I I Would not be surprised if someone like Michael Bloomberg drawn in as well because I'm a democratic state we need we need to pay for all of a businessman\nFind it All right Mike Dunn and he's joining us from the Granite State or New Hampshire four hundred and eighty days plus or minus out of the New Hampshire primary thanks for joining us we'll be back on the John Frederick sure this is Chris ... filling in as Christmas\nHow how about you know we're not all that doesn't really matter to me the\nNor nor should you should anyone in in politics and its cons but how do you how do you compare the intensity this year to last year when he was the same similar not as intense pretty\nSimilar I think we we're we're very proud particularly in Virginia last year when we send a message to the country into the world you know hating bigotry have no place here and that we were open and welcoming for business looking election as governor north him and his team and then you got that first\nSet of a house candidates that got across the finish line that just beautiful tapestry of um um\nAnd I just eat eat up so that was that was really great but I think what's happened in people's lives we have we can do this we can't do this and it's just help drop all day long and we said for example the search and the absentee ballots seeing 'em in Fairfax\nCounty ... county which our number one and two right now in the state on requests for absentee ballots you know that's good for us that that's really really I think we're just you know adding more excitement and enthusiasm right\nQuick kid was on earlier at seven o'clock hour he said he's he thinks the a turnout going to be forty to forty five percent of the large a large range and there but where do you all projecting turn out right now\nWe're just going out there looking for every single doctor\nAnd stuff [laughter] I Know where do you think that sort of those kind of bringing your average\nMid term elections which normally a hard but we have a reason to get out there is a lot at stake and um and a sandwich\nGoing to be better than your average and it turns out you know I'm not in the business or a bad we're just going to we're we've just reached over we can you're describing ... yeah we're in that she had a TV Now fading than we are just\nTrying to get out of violent and bring her anybody else that wants to ...\nBeen impressed with your with your proper Kansas this year in Russia they they definitely worked hard and what struck me as a sort of an obvious one is that the dominance of the male candidates nominees\nBut it is definitely the ear of the women are like to talk about our women candidates and then I got any any lack of anti\nNine [laughter] I mean for one thing is\nIs I mean and they're all they have a different kind of experience and diversity but it is in at all will be a good refreshing\nBrass um for Congress and across a process at the time in some states that are generally for West End up there on the temp congressional district that we're really excited about what we see up there on\nThe volunteers are just showing up on non stop and the Washington Post endorsed her which is something that I'm a you know and Barbara Comstock got endorsed every other time and they're very disappointed at her and she's going to stand up to Donald Trump and that proved not to do the Chinese so her hands are\nCheerful west so it's going to be on a congresswoman and then down and then I'll just run through a real quick if you want to ask me something about him but we will go on line L'Oreal in the second district a retired navy commander and a small business woman and of course Scott Taylor got he got his own problems with a\n... you know trying to cheat and quite frankly and on\nAnd and and having a staff are put half fraudulent signatures on the ballot I mean that's you know\nHer to stop that's pretty St Louis and I I think you're going to reject that that but even that we you know without\nThat we still have to find you know could credible candidate\nWell when I when I've seen in your in your hand is obviously a female when I think it's been regardless of the outcomes and we can talk about polling in outcome member and you're going to go\nAnd then you Williams and what was the six or what I think it's sending a single though is that you're going to see even more women in the future running for office regardless of party and I think that's a very healthy dynamic\nYeah yeah I don't want to I Want to I Would say two things on that real quickly really excited that Leslie coverage just got me to get a grant to blame 'em program for the triple seats but the thing I think you're exactly right about women women have always um um\nWomen have always studies show yes but you know then the ones that would and I know your mom would agree with me on ask what if\nThey don't go to my heart somehow from a hard don't go [laughter] I'm caught away\nThat writes my kids I got to get my degree not pay off my lines you know I mean you can do it better and I think we really want I guess if you have to say good outcomes of twenty six king was when they decided well not waiting anymore we're going to step on\nTheir own lives money something to offer\nI think when you weigh we'll just see more and more of that yeah because it's somewhat sad to say now otherwise you know if you're not to table you're on the menu and you can look at what is it state this year with women's health care\nWith families with health care in general you know we're not going to add that\nWere there like I don't think we'll go back to anymore\nNo no no I don't I don't think you should and I think having the frankly it's not just women but they're but they're in a certain age range to relatively speaking to me a couple of them you know a bit older a little bit younger but for the for the most part you're you're spending cut on mom's right the suburban mom is\nIs a strong voting I Want to say walk but a market that I I think your party is obviously intentionally\nTrying to attract\n... correct correct and I'm very suburban moms some advantages for Donald Trump I think you have seen the ramifications of that vote and we're reaching out and talking to them and particularly when you take something like the Kavanaugh's nomination where you know the sad fact\nOf whether you didn't did or didn't relate doctor for just as a man who championed we saw back his champ from\nThat is not going to be a judge an add on to it the fact of you know her very compelling

from into the three D. triple C a red to blue program um then you're you're making the news and the John Fredericksburg radio show this morning was\nThe other folks make news about ethanol in Iowa and

this special category of funding from the D triple C talked about that\nWell we just we just got that information ourselves and that just shows that the open seats we always talk about\nDoes the inside the beltway great recognize that as well she's Seventy two thousand our car you know the fifth district is really really think it goes from up in a faulty accounting all the way down to the
