being with us a Republican congresswoman Barbara Comstock representing the temperature ... district of Virginia\nOr did they go Barbara huh [laughter] well we got\nFrom that come out of the Clinton oh yesterday or you get your money coming in [noise] and that you're like oh I hear\nOn the Web site again Barbara Congress\nYour stock is sort of the state from getting on the information and days and get it down as well\nI just want to remind our listeners that uh everybody knows and listen to me I was a vehemently opposed to Patriot Act one son the Patriot act when it's sunset it you were a

without them shaped your act that set that up\nAnd you're the one that said you keep covering ... Jimmy government this unlimited power\nUp surveillance and its eventually going to come around and bite you in the bud center that's exactly what happened\nBy having the same very into the conversation yesterday with the director of the art because I asked him point blank\nArgue gathering information that includes the president's phone calls and of course he's butter and said oh I Can't answer that they're setting and the answer for him I just have the answer is yes there was an article about two or three years ago saying that they recorded Fifteen hundred of President Obama's\nPhone calls and then they minimize hand which means ... markets name out but how hard is it to tell when President Obama or President Trump was talking to a foreign leader your they're out\nOf their voices [noise] even if you minimize or you know a marked out and you can't tell who the voices are but we shouldn't be doing now we're listening to members of Congress conversations were listening to journalists conversations businessmen and women conversation and they record it and then they're out there and then the FBI\nCan search this database without her joggers Warren\nAnd my point him was in I think he didn't understand it or in senator Saturday [noise] if you're recording things on potential terrorists from overseas the costs it doesn't really apply\nBut if they're talking to America\nThe speaker phone calls are discussions with terrorists in fact the vast majority are innocent international phone calls [noise]\nAnd so we have had this discussion with them and uh it should be protected by the costume back some say the Fourth Amendment John Adams set of the spark that led to the revolution when you're in like the British soldiers coming into our houses you know breaking down the door and see if we paid our stamp tax [noise]\nUh we really wanted protection that we wanted to save the government and never come to your house or take any private\nConversations are belongings without talking to a church first\nWell that's a that's why you were so adamantly opposed to when you were a predictor of the future when this whole thing\nSenator or you've also been a very strong voice on the disappearance of\n... to show ... there's a lot of talk about what should be done and we want more information and like I get that but as a member of Foreign Relations committee you're the only senator that has proposed action which isn't to get answers on his disappearance because\nSenator thing is we have a videotape showing that he went in there was nobody on tape showing that he went out and I'm a crown prince NBS Mohammed bin Salman since uh the camera footage was corrupted or the battery went dead\nThat they can't really can only buy that it's like\nThe dog ate my homework I didn't get ever ready battery and sort of battery ... now you have a Cold War intermediate suspension um ah the arms sales to the Saudis until we get some kind of a satisfactory answer can you elaborate on that sir\nI think everybody should remember that Saudi Arabia and it's the largest state sponsor of radical Islam around the world what I mean by that or if they had been funding for their mother authors in Pakistan in the Philippines\nEven in the United states teaching her to the west to Christianity and teaching them radical violent jihad this is the salaries are we shouldn't be telling a weapon simply because of drought\nFifteen of the Nineteen hijackers who came here were from Saudi Arabia Saudi Arabia is a big part of our terrorism problem they are they finding the risk of terrorism and teaching of radical Islam around the world this latest episode\nI actually know that this could have happened\nWithout the federal government being a thought to private planes were team guys on on some of them have been linked to Saudi security services and intelligence [noise] um [noise] no it doesn't pass the smell test and you know we just cleaning it out to the president this morning he described\nArms sales to halt the arms sales are the only thing they listen to\nIn addition to them killing a journalist [noise] they're paying tens of thousands of civilians killed in Yemen they're doing it with our bombs when we are ... are firing their answer it slide and two weeks ago or three weeks ago the great they killed a school bus full of children's school children were killed a year ago they killed a hundred and fifty\nKill the Saudi are killing American because of the crime the fragments of the bombs are saying you know America and so we have to realize there are a reaction or some reaction and that's a blowback\nFrom us being involved in some Mr gotten civil war a is one that we actually create more terrorists but here's the other possible thing that's going to\nHappen again what happened in Libya when we talk or cut off he got clean often more terrorism became a breeding ground for terrorism market\nHere is that there is some remnants fairly fairly strong remnants al cater India but we're not fighting them that were Mitchell stricter civil war between the who these in the south and also with Iranian influence as well but my fear is that it\nSends into chaos and that you get the rights of al ... the same thing happening in Syria as that civil war that we got involved in the Senate and the chaos you got the rise of ISIS\nWill actually uh the network that I go on June near a couple of about a month ago was reporting that al Qaida fighters were actually given safe haven a by the by the Saudi forces in Yemen in ... in in order to fly through these so\nThis wouldn't it wouldn't be surprising because if the Saudis support in Syria they supported out in the news round which is essentially an offshoot of out there so the Saudis are all these poor people who hate America eight years you know who have a western ways and yet\nWe kind of big arms deal and the president because I Do it for a job for creating jobs

Trump supporter everybody knows day when it came down the escalator he campaigned on getting out of these entanglements not staying in the have you had a direct conversation with the president on how we should react to this\nNonsense and killing of the journal asked um he does know my feeling is that a lot of talk to them about once every week or two and what we have our conversation as a general ours by saying\nThat uh he has the same instincts but I Do that with the Afghan or two on the Iraq War was a mistake shut down a million times [noise] your shoulder instincts on Syria or that we should stay forever and\nYet he's surrounded by the state forever crowd and that's the real problem is I think the president's instincts are good I'm sort of in the crowd at what the president bigger president right and yet the people surrounding him are\nThink uh to offer you know part of the traditional foreign policy round here which is go straight\nPresident has invested a lot of political capital in the Saudis and it was the first place that he went in his first foreign visit a NBS came to the United states he did his media tour with him to Saudi spend a ton of money on media PR as you know uh in in in the swamp\nAnd so he's put a lot of 'em and and you know we kind of looked the other way when MPs rounded people up jailed them in that hotel whatever they did\nA ministry gentle has looked the other way is this going to affect our relationship with the Saudis and my ... and tying it to that is it going to change the president's position on the Saudi ... Fargo of the state of Qatar where we have our\nBiggest military base in the middle east [noise]\nYeah I'm not so sure you got to change his mind he seems to be pretty ...\nOn a continuing to sell our
