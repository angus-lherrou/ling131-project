Roach Motel he went in but he didn't come out and I now there's a lot of\nAllegations from the Turks saying that he was\nOf bags while still alive just a horrific situation\nAnd a disruption to the international community because when you go into as you know center an embassy or consulate that's supposed to be a safe haven I'm I Know secretary pay was near the president wants to wait to all the facts come out share with us your perspective on this as it is now\nWell John yeah you're like really troubling I'm a member of the Senate Foreign relations\nCommittee I and the lead Democrat on the on the sub committee that oversees the U.S Saudi relationship and this this has the potential to dramatically change the relationship between our countries\nUm you're right that I'm a mother of a journalist has to be taken seriously this is a journalist who was living in northern Virginia when you're Tyson's corner in Fairfax writing for the Washington\nPost and the murder of anybody a conflict which should be a safe haven without wouldn't take place a is shocking I'm so there's a couple of things\nThat we're doing in Congress first on Foreign Relations committee we sent a letter to the president would trigger\nThe Mac it's yeah I think you know the Magnitsky Act was named after a Russian\nDissident who was murdered by the Russians while for his political activity of Congress\nAnd to let her go to the president that gives the president are twenty days to make a ruling about whether the murder of as a human rights violation\nAnd if so what sanctions would be imposed we sent that letter about two weeks ago the other two issues that are currently under consideration I'm somewhat related are whether the United states should stop or put a moratorium on sales to the Saudis have significant\nArms sales to them and a half for years um and third and this\nIs one that I'm very focused on because it was a significant passion option Walker showed uses whether the United states should stop supporting any Saudi efforts are in the war in Yemen the civil war in Yemen that's going on between who see\nMinority in the Yemeni government in Saudi Arabia is very very involved in ... against ... who sees it now the United states is providing a support for the Saudis in that position refueling aircraft with others and um we have some\nVotes to try to stop us participation in that war we had one recently I got up to forty seven votes in the Senate\nNot fifty not sixty grand prix Africa protocol um and I am seeing me up the opinion that the war is a humanitarian disaster in the United states should not be just the Saudis and the prosecution of that war\nThat we're going to get more facts but bluntly I think the burden is on the Saudis to prove that they had nothing to do with any harm kidnapping or ... or a quarter of this journalist enough\nTax are out there enough information and collaboration is out there that the burden on their shoulders they're going to have to prove that they weren't involved in any harm but if they don't I think it's going to fundamentally change the relationship is that countries Saudi Arabia\nCenter king is this now the\nI Believe it is you know you're on the way you asked that question I I think I Know what you're thinking there and see very very significant challenges of a relationship in recent years where the overwhelming majority of the nine eleven attackers were Saudis yes um and then you move\nForward to a whole series of other instances Yemen um bizarre Saudi behavior in recent years um especially since the ascension of the crown prince MPs to his position\nAs you know when in within the last year the Saudis were involved in a bizarre kind of error kidnapping of the Lebanese prime minister prime minister Hariri ran out where they sort of as he was visiting Saudi Arabia you have sort of a\nForce televised interview announcing his resignation hurting the tradition Lebanon and that was widely viewed as a Saturday Night and I'll tell you when I go to the region um what I hear I hear I live in and out here in Iraq I here at talk Syrians in the region is that if every\nAs this terror van gets through Mexico and yesterday the southern border of the United states senator Kaine what should the authorities do what should we do\nWell well first I mean let's let's not wait I'm getting to that seat watchers or not to the Guatemalan Mexican\nBorder yet so we need to work with a\nGovernment some Guatemala and Mexico I'm On the S. and you know I Hope that the president's especially you know often tough talk about Mexico et cetera is not hurt our ability to reach in accord with Max Baucus I think one of the issues that important there is you gotta have allies in the world and\nIn when you have allies you can work together on joint solution is the best thing is for the caravan of people in Honduras or or not even get to the border with the United states but that would involve the U.S having a cooperative relationship with Mexico for example\nAnd not spending time trashy Mexico which the president an awesome does so I Know that a U.S military than north command which basically everything north of the Mexican Guatemalan border mhm\nUm our own you know we we do have a da chess and other a U.S presence in Mexico I Would hope that we would work with the Guatemalan and Mexican government's to uh to have that caravan\nOf folks remain in place I I Know the president hunger is always points out no country wants to export its young\nUm there are also things that we can do to help\nPromote stability in Honduras Guatemala El Salvador and if we do that we can reduce people who are leaving those countries to come to the United states\nYou know center I'm you spent time as a young man and missions in Jesuit missions and I really respect what you've done and your uh your work and that and now\nWhat do you think about these these violent left wing mobs that are going around chasing people out of restaurants bidding on Lindsey Graham sending a packages and and horrific emails to Susan Collins and\nGoing and they did it make what is it is it's so discouraging John it really is I had an event last night\nStroke is just a happy hour for young Democrats in Fairfax and disruptive protester cut again in my face with a camera and light up and yell at me hoping I think that I Would say something in temperature that they could have been put on video and whether it's somebody doing that to me whether\nIt's somebody sending something the Susan Collins is home whether it's a colleague Dina costs as in a restaurant um and it it's it's really really\nI don't know it's just it's just sickening [noise] um and you see a you know an escalation of all kinds of violence I hate Europe we saw Nineteen swastikas painted across all of a Jewish community center in Fairfax\nTwo Saturdays ago that was very shocking so I think we have to those of us in elective positions you what we have to do which maybe\nTry to be better role models bring down the temperature bring down the rhetoric you can disagree with somebody without being you know in temperature and civil to them I\nI really try hard to do that and everything I Do I disagree with the president on a lot he signed\nSeventeen and my bills you know either that I've been able to put on his desk I'm I I Try not\nTo get into the name calling saying but you're right any violence has to be condemned whether it's piling on the left on the rise violence that you know not political in nature I'm asked to be condemned one of the great things about our Constitution's\nAs you know your your favorite part of the constitution is in the first amendment freedom of the press and my favorite part of the constitution is in the first amendment to which is the right of the people to peacefully assemble the right of the people to petition government\nFor redress or creative says we we give citizens\nThe right to peacefully assemble\nBut it's got to be peaceful or to you know write letters to congressman but it's it's gotta be peaceful and I think that that the framers realize of engagement was necessary for democracy at work but they understood that the engagement had to be peace for any kind of disruptive or while on a Kennedy wants to be more\nCenter when a when you were former running mate Hillary Clinton said that on civility is acceptable in this environment doesn't that adds fuel to the fire I mean we're seeing a Democrat in Cairo dairy much\nYeah I disagree with that sense I think I think you got to maintain civility especially at the pop 'em let me just let me use to role models on my\nSide of the hour you can fix some role models on your side nobody would say Bobby Scott is not a very progressive Democrats very progressive Democrats dairy farm in his point of view points out what he thinks is white points out what he thinks is wrong with Bobby Scott has had a political career where nobody thinks and Bobby\nScott as an uncivil person or a name Paul non buyer would be another example in Virginia I'm very progressive Democrats\nPoints that way thinks is right that in mind calling out something that he thinks is wrong but nobody calls down Byron name caller nobody thinks he's on several [noise] so I think I can look at examples in and look I got colleagues on my side I can take their Senate colleagues on the Republican side more Alexander the Mars might share of that\nIt's going to say what he thinks he's going to point out of\nIt you know if he sees something that he thinks he's wrong or something that the Democrat once you get like there'll be plenty about it now but he says that Lamar Alexander is an unsettled person so I think I think it gets out there that says you know well it's time\nFor a holiday for civil early a long long I think we need an moral and ethical\nBut he's ... he's my congressman uh and he's been right on some of the biggest issues in America in the past two decades so yeah you can call them a progressive\nAnd John Henry and I'm going to see that even when you disagreed with Bobby Scott it's great you know what it takes a Bobby Scott as like a name call around to and that's not that's not who he is you know and and then we need we all we need to act like that\nI Would I Would put a I Would put your colleagues senator Johnny Isakson in that category uh Amsterdam thing everybody knows where he stands he's very conservative he votes with the president a hundred percent of the time but everything is done in this civil respectful manner\nI ... where we are very short on time and I've got to get to the election because that's [laughter]\nThat's coming up in Nineteen days you have a a what looks like to be center and insurmountable lead in both of polling and numbers but you know nothing is certain the only poll the matters is the one on November six tell me about your reelection campaign what you're seeing how it's going and what you think you know come up as\nWell as you as you point out John Nineteen days and yeah polls are looking pretty good but I always tell people all sorts of preferences and elections are about energy and preference listening to science as energy so what you want to see is energy um I've I've loved serving in the Senate might buy campaign theme that I chose was I'm trying to reflect\nThe way I Lived on the way I've served in Virginia that works\nFor all about Virginia about work some travel the of working on or you work and having good policies about working in the workforce but it's also about this Virginia that works for all getting kind of obsessed with the last two words and the pledge of allegiance the notion that uh you know if it's not working for all it's not working what's not working for\nAll we got more work to do so I'm going to continue should I be a lot about the honor to be reelected I'm going to continue to work on these areas are services Foreign Relations project and then health education labor pension I'm I have\nSeen rarely used during this calendar year twenty eight seniors are maybe no surprise given a lecture and that results in last November's elections in Virginia I continue to\nSee very strong energy turn out in advance voter registration for midterm year we're seeing pretty strong energy bully vote was taking place but you point out nothing for\nGranted type to go back in ... he says there's only two ways to run an election either run unopposed a run here I'm opposed to I'm running scared so that's the way I'm going to do all the way we are watching the east\nOr are we going to see a potential to obtain for president campaign is twenty twenty\nJohn I tell you I I was really an honor to be the first of all the Virginia politician on the national tickets in Eighteen forty in twenty six team but I definitely came back from a campaign saying like at the end of the wizard of Oz there's no place\n[noise] I Love being able to which meant\nAnd the work that matters is low level like your person will make people eat up they can be a little like in April but just the label so I Am very focused on if I'm staying in the long wall continuing circle\nOkay Senator Tim Kaine our thank you for your time or at a time today a great dialogue with use or as always it's always great to have you on for more information on the senators reelection campaign go to Tim Kaine dot\nCom Tim Kaine dot com and he's up for re election on November six that's the midterm struck with on your calendar if you're in Virginia\nAnd listen to me right now early voting and started so you can go and take care of that right now go to Tim Kaine dot com Tim Kaine dot com for more information to the same two thousand Eighteen and by the way that came with an aide to senator thanks for being with us\nA what a great interview that was I mean really great whether you like its policies or you don't doesn't really matter to me I get it how you do what you want but a\nHere's why I respect the center and kind of like I respect Barbies got they come on my show whenever I ask uh there's no topics there is no scripts uh\nI I mean I just said the center on here for what twenty five minutes unfettered asking them anything and you have a conversation and that\nIs the definition of civility we don't agree on a lot of things\nMost things but uh we can still have a civil conversation disagree or agree we can have a dialogue we never conversation we can have a relationship of the center and I have a relationship we have a friendship and just because we don't agree I mean look I ran Trump's campaign in Virginia\nAgainst them and we did good enough where Tim Kaine and Joe Biden had to come to Virginia on Sunday and Monday because we're closing the gap but that doesn't mean we're not friends and that doesn't mean you can't have a conversation and\nUm you know I thought his answers were very interesting or we agree on the Yemeni situation we shouldn't be there there's a lot of these Secret Wars that the U.S has and that we shouldn't be and then I'm going to go into in a minute and certainly the Saudi episode was job to show his upbringing oldest a polite but uh\nYou know we're in we're in the secret war is it you know it's like they're all under the radar screen and we're in so many of them now\nAnd the military industrial complex is so big and we've been in wars for so long that nobody really thinks about him until something goes a ride like are the Saudis blow up a school bus with the U.S made missile you know then we hear about it on the news\n\nBut I hear about it every day because I'm a senior contributor now for the al Jazeera Arabic network and so what we talking\nI get to go on panels with military generals on various countries and their representatives are debating of various hot spots that are around the globe until you get a little bit of a different\nPerspective is one thing that al Jazeera\nArabic does that al Jazeera satellites news does is\nIt really brings the world news home and they don't really have an outlet in the u._s. you got to go on the Internet but uh when I go on al Jazeera and I'm On several times a week yeah I've had to turn this week down most of my assignments because I'm busy with family\nStuff and opening up this new radio station which is a lot of work by the way at forty odd\nBut are\nTypically when I go on a an al Jazeera Arabic prime time you know the average average Seventy million viewers\nSeventy million not seven now seven hundred thousand Seventy million\nThat's their average reach prime time on an average week that\nCNN regions about seven hundred thousand on a good night they might get one of the prime time shows might get a million\nI go on al Jazeera Arabic I'm reaching Seventy million people around the globe defending of the president's policies\nSo\nI certainly rather do that that CNN it'd be quite candid with you it's not just a great network is kind of laugh\nYou know people think oh it's owned by a government I don't care who owns it I can just stay in my experience with it I go on a good time to respond and nobody tells me what to say I get a time and I get a general topic and sometimes the topic I get is not what they talk about um valuable to them because I can talk about anything\nBut um there you have it\nNow you just heard mark Warner's comments and the I'm In the ... Center for another difference between chain and Warner is pain is saying let's solve this water is like let's figure out how we can blame\nTrump it's like you know not not not get off\nThe difference between Tim Kaine's interview and mark Warner's hyperbole in his montage stark what it was like well\nTrump's fault the hurricane Trump's fault bad weather Trump's fault and the Astros got be Trump's fault stop stop knock it off\nBorders better than that I mean I think it's going to run for president 'cause he's becoming very partisan\nOh this happened to be good because Trump doesn't like the media so they have a green light what's that what you're talking about\nSenator\nTim Kaine on the other hand you know just a very sober assessment of the reality of what happened and uh you know those of us to believe that all these relationships or should come into review like me when you were a child in these wars\n\nWe have a legitimate beef I don't know why we're in Yemen Obama got us in trouble\nThey can't fly there on airplanes to bet\nJohn privilege radio network truck the truth across America eight eight eight or eight oh John aided aid for you know five six or six we'll be right back [noise]\nWhat do we really know what about liberal democratic Abigail Spanberger\nAnd her policies [noise] well we know she'd only been eat the tax cuts that have helped to Virginia families we know spanberger support sanctuary cities in Virginia and then he defended the binary gang NS Thirteen we know are liberal healthcare plan went bankrupt Medicare as we know at thirty two trillion dollar spending\nIncrease ... devil our taxes [noise] she wants socialized medicine that put government in charge of your healthcare instead of you know that spanberger would be a rock solid vote to make Nancy Pelosi the speaker of the house and we know she'd vote for impeachment of the president [noise] liberal Democrat Abigail Spanberger\nTax hike sanctuary city bankrupt Medicare and rubber stamp for Nancy Pelosi what else do we need to now [noise]\nI'm Dave Brat I'm running for Congress and I approved this message for my friends have day friday [noise]\nNancy Pelosi and her allies are spending more than ten million dollars to election if election they promise to raise our taxes like thousands and eliminate the two thousand child tax credit skill aware\nAs a prosecutor like skin repeatedly plea bargain violent crimes like myself rate and most station\nFor the genius are independent voice is Barbara Comstock I'm Barbara Comstock candidate for Congress and I approve this message paid for by contact for Congress\n[noise]\n\nWhile I\nEnjoy the live Twitter discussion I'm touring\nDid you get my twins I just quoted all over the place followed John Frederick\nJ.

through Florida there but I Wish him the best and I believe I saw I saw the email I Believe they named him that it's a four game tournament and then you have to move\nTo cut overnight you have to do something that in Washington John you know it's hard to do is cause cut spending not just you know reduce the increase in spending literally cut spending a lemonade departments privatize agencies Amtrak the post office\nYou got to move out of Washington let the private market do the things that's supposed to do\nAnd get government back to doing it things it was called ... which is to protect our rights that I mean there was nowhere nowhere to confrontation or we talk about the harm education is nowhere near the United states is she right why the education department lives are we in fact since the creation of the education department um\nEducation America's only worsen I'm not going to quit I'm not going to shock\nThat up to the government has the early but but but I think the localities parents states communities or they can run that far\nBetter than a one size fits all policy from washer and save taxpayers money is on the on the other side um [noise] we need to get back to limited government job that's that's the that's the case that's what that's what this country because it allowed\nPeople you and I occupy new orders businessmen and women are teachers except for you know from from parents came to to preach in the poll that we have freedom and now there's a state it's the same age and all these issues that's monitoring our activities\nOn the line and off life I'm ... and we really need to get back and recovered this idea of individual liberty that it's the government's role is only to protect the rights of life liberty pursuit of happiness and that and just to sort of given the opportunity to pursue alive to pursue our dreams our goals then\nYou have to look at things like the Energy Department of education agriculture\nThese things retirement and and the title Montana as quote unquote that we have out there um we need to really move things out of Washington into the private sector and that means drastic cuts I've got a website Matt waters dot com I've got a whole outlay of up prices will be getting caught a limitation eliminate privatized\nDownside outsourced August the types of the things that we do it around the kitchen table here at my home you know when when there's more months then there is money John we ... we have to make some hard decisions\nMatt let's shift gears I understand your passion for bringing the debt down a but even if you got elected you'd be a very lonely voice in the Washington DC in the swamp or weakness is that the most corrupt city in America the lobbyist that are running around here's the thing\nThat ever go there are up right and you're driving around the or the suburbs in northern Virginia and Maryland suburbs of DC\nTon of money they owe Dr ... who likes a citizen Mercedes they've all got serious sex and they all walk around five thousand dollars since ... and ...\nYou know what we produce in Washington nothing will make a ball that ring we don't we don't make a big thing we produce nothing they manufacture nothing they build nothing ... nothing yet they're all rich thing is that one out\nYet another five Richard discounts around the district of Columbia your factory rice and and yeah you know exactly what we produced Nazis\nOr accept more regulations more walls and the special\nInterests to step in and they think they are built it was you know recently being debated\nYou know ... and by the way Seventy percent of the farm bill it's food stamps and at the ... program and and you know it was here lobbying jobs Amazon at McDonald's and Walmart why because they want to be able to boot camp you know online so you can get your Amazon Prime\nShit right so the difference of problem why look on their headquarters here forever after all they know\nWho directs traffic in this country so it's so Washington politicians in the special interest and they're going to get in on it was a yet there's good and and and I I Can't blame 'em for that ah but but we we do need to roll back as a state\nThe state is mentality for that is a golfing any really every area of our lives\nI mean really yet I just think that the retirement security that we're we're trusting the government to uh pay retirement benefits that it can't possibly do that work and and and you know the fact of her former just illustrate Nineteen thirty five were not driving Model T cars which is a best\nSelling car like eight thirty five to their cars have changed we need to change you know retirements protracted\nRetirement say thirty forty year retirement system was never built at that time in Nineteen thirty five is two to four years I'm with the woman said we're victim really of our\nOwn success people are already longer were healthier that's all good but that system needs to change and ah you know the Supreme Court at Nineteen sixty two or ... that you know we're not even titles because\nSocial Security you're guaranteed usually get it and the Congress can change of the day or they can allow just to go bankrupt and stop sending the shots\nWere was Matt waters sees the United States Senate libertarian candidate in Virginia the midterms November six Nineteen days away three candidates running Republican who Corey stored Matt\nWaters libertarian intimate Tim Kaine the Democrat ran for vice president and came the overwhelming prohibitive favorite in this race the big question is can that water gets a temper senator he does then the libertarians get a spot on the Virginia ballot for how long has it went through and I\nBelieve it's five years five years I was like in his five years and then they basically they become a third political party in Virginia so the stakes for wars and the libertarians are very high mountain let's shift gears a minute let's go to this caravan now five thousand people make his way up through Guam\nOur position right now on us\nWell I certainly wouldn't I wouldn't you think a little differently I mean first of all there's no doubt that crisis\nIn Guatemala Honduras and El Salvador writers there's there's a there's a refugee crisis people are fleeing that country and I I think that we need to have a Latin Americans\nFrom it we need to sit down to the leaders of those countries and have a conversation I doubt that puts Mexico in that mixture because we're coming right through Mexico um you know what I think it starts out I Would I Would I Would rather than um you know ticket and approach\nI Would almost fancy humanizing approach to this ... anniversary anger filled approach why Trump is going I Would take that much more diplomatic approach and say how can how can we solve this problem rather\nWell that's a very long term memory once I let me just center and interrupted you know ... that's a very long term view let's all sit down\nAnd I guess it ends up getting more money to uh to these countries that you just said you would cut off so no money's going to get involved according them out orders for thousands of five thousand people are coming right now this is what I asked them can't they're coming out now tomorrow or next week now they're coming now their objective\nIs goes it makes it go get the southern border\nFive thousand of them cross a thousand or be apprehended we apprehend about twenty percent the other eighty percent you'd never find them again in up to twenty percent we do ever hit eighty percent of them uh ended up not returning for what every piece of paper they give them\nTo go back to court or whatever and they can't separate them from their children we've already been through that kids in case by case before the midterms how's it going to happen so basically they all get scot free if you don't do something what would you do\nYou turn to our role a party I mean some of the door open border folks actually I don't share that I\nWill even tighter border security we eat a stop\nTo it illegal trespassing right you can't see that so so what would you do to get anything I mean you need to\nHave ... either stack guard I lost my plan is to pull the forty two thousand troops you know Adam Germany but among the southern border for fifty thousand around your parents had a lot of the southern border but for twenty eight thousand down south raping about southern border we'd have a pretty good forced out directly spend our money defending his country rather than the countries around the globe\nNow we're talking that now we're talking see that's the plan let's get or a troops out of Germany Japan and where else out Korea South Korea let's get them out and\nLet's put him on the southern border that solves the problem and there's no increase costs now there's an argument that you haven't been in South Korea for a lot of reasons but why we have\nTwenty eight thousand troops in Germany and all those troops to Japan makes no sense whatsoever to anybody except those that want to perpetuate the military industrial\nComplex and make money off supplying these troops over the globe\nBecause the other day Matt let me just follow\nThe money in Washington it's really easy just follow them\nThose who is backing who what the donors are Wall Street spot at Goldman Sachs big donors that's all you have to do it's easy to I mean if they got caught up [laughter] exactly that we're all the time that was what's your website\nYeah that was dot com check it out and I love to have your support and and and since checks to other people about their bottom line is age\n... orders dot com Matt thanks for being being a writer and good luck of having you on again before November sex Curtis Ellis coming up give it right here\nFor what he described as weak immigration laws that have allowed undocumented migrants to enter the U.S the Republican controlled Senate and house\nThis year has rejected multiple immigration bills\nIncluding one backed by the president that would have combined border security funding with other measures short by the Democrats as I discuss with a Senator Tim Kaine the cute cog in this chain migration\nThe Democrats can go for DACA and they can go for a wall and they can go for the funding but they absolutely want chain migration\nBecause that gives them democratic votes\nAnd the Republican donors on Wall street back that too because that brings them cheap labor along with the illegals\nBut the president says I don't want chain migration because that puts a lock on the American economy\nI Want migration that is based on job skill a job needs to win the immigrant comes into the U.S they have a job and they can contribute to society just like Australia does and the man child trigger do doesn't Canada if the man child can do it so can wait\n\nThe prison goes on to say today I Am watching the Democratic party led because they weren't open borders assault on our country by Guatemala Honduras and El Salvador\nWhose leaders are doing real to stop this large\nFlow of people which I'm calling in a division that's may not Trump including many criminals from entering Mexico to the U.S the president wrote in his three part tweet he said in addition to stopping all payments to these countries all payments which seem to have almost no control over their population\nI must into shrunk of terms ask Mexico to stop the onslaught and they've been able to do so I Will call up to you as the military and simply closer southern border close it means no one will come in they'll be fifty thousand troops there you simply are not going to come in and there'll be a stand up for days\nAnd they're going to have to figure it out and then there'll be cameras on the other side's seeing people starving I mean this is what's going on here\n\nThe prison and it that the border security is far more important to him than that then the recently concluded new North American free trade deal\n\nNow a a spending package passed by Congress a month ago put off a debate over uh getting the money for the for the wall and effectively pushing back\nA record number of asylum seeking families from Latin America have recently overwhelms our corn border agents and immigration authorities or having another surge of illegals coming in\nBorder patrol facilities are crowded with newly arrived families bed space it family detention centers in Texas is at a premium and immigration court backlogs are growing because they keep coming in and we simply can't process them and we can't arrest them and send them back we already tried that\nAnd went through kids in cages\nAnd you're Nineteen days for the midterm so they got to be no more pictures of kids separated from their parents so all you have to do now before that night Nineteen days is up is grab a child\nIf it's yours the cause of doesn't matter grab a child in your family and you're going to get entry to the United states because of politicians are now on the Republican side petrified of kids in cages\nSo they're going to win again and the president knows he can't combat this politically because the PR it appears that disaster Nineteen days before the midterms so he says well here's what I'm going to do I'm going to deport them military is a problem with that here's the problem every solution right now\nNineteen days has consequences\n\nIf it was November seventh there would be easier to easier to do you're going to get the military at the border they're going to be with guns confronting moms with babies that's going to be all over the New York times because these people in the fake news media they want open borders open\nBorders even though it means that it's the end of their jobs and their businesses and they'll have no money in the country\nWill collapse they don't care because they know that there will be the elites and there'll be fine and then they will\nRule over\nThe rest of us poor slobs\nThe pro terrorists\n\nI mean I I don't even know how to even put this in in the logical terms mean what is they didn't even want to ask Tim Kaine he had to admit I'm not for overboard it's I'm not for these people coming over I mean but you know that the Democrats are going to defend\nIt and there are now calling them economic refugees oh we're not accepting refugees we you know where's the richest country in the world is not and then it'll be saying on CNN is not who we are\nIt's not who we are well here's who we are we're broke our schools suck that's who we are we're Twenty one trillion dollars in debt\n\nAnd now we've got a growing number of people in our schools that don't speak the language\n\nAnd it goes on and on and on and on and

actually deal with the Reagan Revolution killing and you're\nLike [noise] I I mean I think that might have a section [noise] [noise]\n[noise] and she said anything\nMy name's arrive at some family

your\nMind that [noise]\nI actually\nThink we can say\nWell she's got a point and we'll see what the president's response as you have to respond to that so I mean you you can't have allies that people go into conflicts and get chopped up with the with the chainsaw well while they're alive and then put in doggy bags I mean you just can't have it you just that's\nNot a civil society and I told you this before and I know\nAll my friends out there that like Trump they want to waste skews it and say he's not a journalist who was with the Muslim Brotherhood I don't care who he is\n\nYou have to be consistent in your view are consistent view for America first is America First and we want our country you know if you have a country and sovereignty then you need to have international relations otherwise you have a global of society\nSo in international relations there has to be a sense of border without order there's there's no sovereignty obvious follow the logic here\nSo I Believe in logic\n\nAnd math two plus two four\nAnd\nIf he had gone into a cafe and got assassinated\nCrap happens right in happens\nIf they blew up his car when he started it crop happens right they got to be for the guy we get it now their business maybe you have to get it if it happened in the U.S but uh it it ... you and investigated it would happen to us as homicide\nBut if it was in Turkey it's up to them but the fact that he went into an embassy\nOr consulate\nThat's that's where it breaks down that's why they've been dodgy thing was such a hard I mean once used and that's why the Iranians are over running our our embassy there and and keeping a hostage in Maine embassies are supposed to be\nA safe place for a world order\nAnd the Saudis violated that they stuck their finger in the eye of the of all their allies this ... this\nYear says in the United states it's Theresa May in Great Britain me they're also funding them they're also selling them arms there are also involved in the Yemeni war there's all sorts of implications that go way beyond the U.S here\n\nAnd the president has to send a clear single any well so what stopped jumping to conclusions number one he has to talk

sex\nAnd ... one for a both teams are looking for this big win but me and my ... at home and uh this is going to be the game where I think it's going to going to be very interesting\nJoining us now is a head coach Scott walking on the coach this is the game on the day in Lexington you fired up\nAnd fired up side for the battle for the shape go obviously it'd be a great atmosphere people definitely make claims from the game they're bringing a freshman class them on the whole core here churn up on and you have to be a great ball game always has\nBeen three years we played them in my career that's far close came down to the wire with a lot of the football\nWell a lot of while you're setting foot tall and uh they have a they haven't they have a pretty solid team or their their record hasn't shown and I think they're they're better than they looked start with their quarterback Jordan Jordan black\nAnd joined blacks first year I started a left handed off your quarterback extremely tough it's probably one of the better pastor said that there are through for a hundred and eighty a yard sale last week I was sixteen or twenty three so kind of opens up their traditional laws auction running attack with some good point actually passing\nOut again a very solid on the line they come off the ball lower heart very hard to stimulate you practice I get this dog running back their balance golf densely not between running past\nBut in countries where they touch the ball so very difficult to expand defense only a multi pressure unit are they bring along with us from a lot of locations you have to be\nReally solid or your past protection against them and they played strictly hard and then special teams are they they get extremely wealthy Mercer aren't alive so I'll play the game kickoff return for a touchdown so very well coached like rent Tom send their kids are like our young men they play strongly hard they fight for the for the\nFinal sound they never said die so heck of a ball game against the very top of the talented team\nYeah in a couple of weeks ago um Palestine quarterback Tom Flaco by the way is the brother a younger brother\nOf a so called a quote unquote elite quarterback Joe ... uh [laughter] is it is the elite quarterback uh well I don't know but based on uh the last game against tendency look pretty a link to me\nBut coach I'm Flatow really carved up the citadel defense and you look at you didn't ski and uh the the arm strength that he's got the maturation he's gone through your quarterback you did see your fast receivers\nUm they they have a ... I watched some of the game actually they have a lot of uh let's say upper you've got opportunities I thinking there's secondaries at a fair analysis of mine\n\nYou know the first team they played that just threw the ball around a little bit and you know their yawn on defense like we are and so it's a game got on\nI thought they played a lot better defense linking confidence was the game goes on and I think there'll be much better prepared to play a sauce after playing that ballgame Flaco also Kurt um what's his legs a little bit running the ball early and ah you know I think once again the young civil defense having\nSeen that will be much better prepared to take on our style of dolphins coming into our game\nDo you look at a young quarterback or doing a little more scrambling under the pocket maybe having some design runs slaves to keep the defense honest\nYou know we always have to sign run plays in for the for the quarterbacking so that's part of our all kinds of packages to keep the defense honest uh I'd prefer not to scramble from the pocket because that means we have a clean pocket\nThey sell it protects breaks down like it does you know at every level of football and you know obviously Greece needs to maneuver in the pocket and do what he takes it needs to do\nWhether it's run the ball or you know operating a scramble drill that we've done you know since we installed the off into spring teaching our receiver for to be for one reason is moving out of the pocket it easy to keep his eyes down the hill with a football", "show_name": "The Glenn Beck Program", "year": "2018", "city": "Portsmouth", "day": "18"}
