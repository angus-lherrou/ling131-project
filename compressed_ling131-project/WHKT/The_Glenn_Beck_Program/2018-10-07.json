they didn't find any cooperation [noise] um so I think you're going to get the Republican members um and ... ... I think Mitch puts his reelection jerk reductions do good work\nOK third third party cooperation none but I'm telling you this if somebody has to try the kinds of cases in court there's a lot different markers or better tests to point to somebody's me incredible so I you know talking to a therapist about ten years ago you know and which apparently they documented the therapist I mean who the hell put themselves out there and put themselves through this crap\nOr if it if it didn't happen um I mean what what are her motives I don't I don't see why she would\nHave a you know your convict somebody based on what just not into convict anybody but this guy's applying for the highest court in the land is not applying for a job or dominoes to deliver pizza and I think the the burden that you have\nIn terms of ah keeping somebody off of a lifetime appointment is entirely different than anybody can make any allegation talk of the operation that your ducked nobody's talking about taking away the guide liberty and putting them in jail that's a that's a different issue than it is you know in the library is that the Republicans\nAnd that Trump would put up somebody can come come out and say he uh did something to me forty years ago I have no evidence no corroboration and that's the\nYeah I didn't say something into sexual assault which is an entirely different issue and you've got to put yourself in the context of the time and the place and back then in the Nineteen eighties wasn't some people can't afford\nIt don't they don't come for nearly as much today about it they said that they back then when I was in high school and I kinda think people in\nYou you didn't hear about this guy and I'm not a machine but extremely credible I'm just very emotional ... and and I do think that's I think that taking that extra week going back in interviewing some of the people more judge and others around it\nI think it was with the right thing I think slam dunk in the spring or the day after her would have been terrible politics and would have been terrible on the institution having said that nobody else can remember the party\nWho was there ... there's just too many holes to really make the case that doesn't mean she's wrong but but that's a tough standard for the future you know what he can come forward and say anything\nNot to say that but it's just I just wanted to go back within six days and remember after she testified Chris Wallace from Fox News and the president to talked about how\nCredible she was an old public operatives protects the everybody right after she testified that this is done it's over\nCheese toast and then seven days later without Rob back to where we weren't amazing to me how fast the world changes but back to what we're talking about before I just we've gotten this cooperation sidebar mentions the last poll for mentioned I think had him up Fifteen I Want to say\nNow that he's up by fire signal but after I saw a poll last week that I'm Upset things that's that's all the polls you read when they're asking you to tell got on a hill certainly certainly\nAre you a production but but you know under fifty welders well understood and I and\nI think what you got to remember this is if he ... his independence in ... I think this is for him this this changes the outcome if he's right yeah I actually am I and I'm not an expert on west\nThink it would be hard for him to get reelected it would seem to me you know what a Trump when they buy like fifty points something like that\nAnd I'm not I'm not so not convinced and Susan Collins is going to run again either\nAn ad that that I think it's ... I'm not either but she never voted against the Supreme Court judge ever you have any group in state that has put a million dollars up to ... votes against million aspirin\nYeah okay now it's up to a million and a half ago find me but then it looks like a bribe but I'm I mean I I think at the end of the day without corroboration she's going to be there for for for which he or she agreed with Chinese not only twenty twenty twenty is she going to run again well should make that decision at the appropriate time [noise]\nI I think I think Tom now that I think she's going to vote yes ah the one that I have no read\nOn the top Davis is I'm Lisa Murkowski of Alaska what about what about you [noise]\nPretty independent I mean just remember this when she lost that primary to Joe Miller last Republican primary right she run they rise again with the name Murkowski now where you get started and ended up and also as you want to that last you know made the part about the independents beans and when you guys mentioned when it's because they claim they're they're reelected\nComes looking out for their state right mhm yeah and Murkowski has a big issue with the cabin opinion about Alaskan natives I think was ... she got\nShe ... she she she does on the on\nThat issue so no it's not clear cut I haven't seen the polling inland ... are they but the I think if you get ... like you know I think you're going to get flaky booed him out of committee do I think without some operation that Jeff Jeff is fundamentally\nVery conserved right now you got to do more research to he's also very independent and I think a very principled guy which is why people making flaky because he doesn't always taken one boxing\nIsn't always predictable but let's judged if you've got to understand for Republicans this unites us this this is a very important ... as it is on the Democrats on the other side a wanting somebody else\nOkay can I ask you a question has a has a a vice president were broken a tie on a Supreme Court nominee I couldn't not that I'm aware of yeah I think that would be unprecedented everybody [noise]\nBut that can and that will kind of a challenge that but it's still count how do you know that\nJust sort of thing and competition just as\nInviting can set and there's got to be no my story on Easter President Kennedy boats but he's not a member I I can tell you the state like Virginia last reunion states that are it's not Virginia not much in off [laughter] yes but that's already a lawsuit there's already a lawsuit challenging the whole procedure with other Democrats\nIf he's confirmed that they're going to go and they take over the house or the Senate to move to impeach that would be a disaster two thirds of the Senate good luck [noise] yes I just I'm like I think he already on the grounds and\nOf elections have consequences that's what I take away but here's I guess the Republicans in Minnesota stealing Supreme Court said [noise] well I say I mean all of a foreign policy from one here's the problem I still can't get over the fact that Trump won ...\nI think might bite every indication is a very honorable three for good or bad or good Supreme Court judge in in the traditional sense with these balanced steep knocked completely a liberal democratic operate before he won the bench but but met the criteria for it for a judge\nBut what is better not holding a hearing on them are doing what they've done in this case that it's bringing it's putting the sham of of hearing him and then finding a way to trashes reputation and voting no they weren't there to confirm it it was election year Republican senators were confirmed school youth seat and putting on a more liberal members just wasn't going to happen\nIn a presidential politics here not a mixture who who knows what the rules are writing about it but if the president and it's the president United States to nominate somebody for the frame court out the senator rights that threat so therefore I think McConnell's argument is set out\nWhen he says look a that was the presidential election yeah let's not about voters inside ... that's ... but I'm just saying\nThat they stretch it each time I don't know who started but it keeps getting worse and worse and worse\nAnd once you do it for one year you could do it two years you could do it three years I I don't know there aren't any guard rails long enough I think it was they moved from sixty votes to fifty votes for everything but the Supreme Court of course they're going to do it for the Supreme Court has made there are no guard rails anymore and that's and that's what's scary\nAre not going to be here again it's actually you're from a DJ Republican operative in Virginia Beach if there is such a thing did Joe mansion is only apply for in the latest Fox poll as of a two days ago apply for not Fifteen so Scott nice to what check his email is what one of our listeners said\nEight eight eight forty shot they have gotten another email on that let me check chops got another email where\nThe boys are packed in town waiting on the upper part of the\n... or so that must be well that is right for it and so I just got one eight or what's his name Beto is destroying Ted Cruz said those documents that were with Tom tom Davis a Republican congressman from northern Virginia and Jane which has favorites comments whenever\nWe've got chapter centers where that's where I'd shepherd is world headquarters here\nIn uh Fairfax city and Scott surveillance state senator from northern Virginia Democrat\nAnd part of democratic leadership I'm\nNot part of them are ... ... I'm fairly mature but there isn't room for saying that if you challenged or if you if you challenge the godfather the heart of anybody in the godfather it's not here either take several we're waiting on him I don't I don't think he's seen a seven am in a\nWhile real clear politics average on Mitch right now is nine points for well that's a far cry from Fifteen or here's one plus twelve timber Thirteen or Fifteen minutes and plus well but when I was\nLucky here that has been consistently had I think he's got I'll give you I'll give you that and I think but I think a no\nVote here changes that dynamic there was a poll earlier before all this controversy that showed that if he voted against city alternately numbers change\nBut from my perspective I think it cannot confirmation to is probably the terms of the Democratic again and probably five to ten sheets maybe and then it's easier to I mean I think it helps in house in her too because then it's a very red territory North Dakota\nUh Missouri I mean these are three solid see West Virginia\nIn the Senate race since Kavanaugh thing itself republic\nOr where where where we're at a time for a couple of instruction from the our news but one thing I think Tom nail this this is the only thing I've seen in the sense trumping house that has a unified Republican side never seen anything like this we couldn't figure out how to\nNumbers have it on discussion yeah you want to go ahead what do you want to go\nThat one but then we got to get the fuck for football hockey puck on go ahead\nOh well when I'm like last night amongst winner and the Senate Judiciary committee the official account of the Senate Judiciary committee is tweeting about Democrats do not understand the definition of blue thing\nI heard that it would be a Senate Judiciary account this thing is so off the rails and and and I feel like [noise] you know people were completely missing the point with all this process crap\nYou know the reason the judiciary committee's tweeting is that the Democrats have the definition rung up against all process and none of it is actually on where people are on it and where voters are on on this is Kevin ... only has the support of the conservative base\nAnd the message that women are getting around the country is that you know people are OK with sexual assault\nNo I think that if it was in Memphis they're they're getting in your now up for now it's a wrong doing or what is the only thing it it'll it'll shut this this is\nThe same Democratic Party that the fed and Bill Clinton that attacked his accusers right especially the one that got raped well\nFirst of all first of all I was I was in the ... the allegation of rape against Bill Clinton which which exists\nActually didn't exist during the impeachment process if you remember that woman came out a week after on national television that whole process so when you say the Democratic party rallied around him whatever that allegation wasn't even out there at the time I Will say second thing is\nThat was why he lied he was he was talking about with\nJohn Powell Jones is different than ... then that was not a rape I shot through ... and we haven't really cannot after that was ever catch on one interviews a week after the Senate and house in about ... and you had to sequence Kevin really was the same time it's Paula Jones or that you're thinking about the I'm going to need a ...\nThe point [laughter] the message that women are getting around the country is that this is okay\nAnd Republicans are now into a debate about the definition of blue seem I mean that will try and and doubled struggle I mean it is a is this is only official Senate traditionally ... look everybody knows what Butina art or not but you have to first of all I don't know what I'm\nSaying is Butina inserting drugs in your ... instead of taking them down your throat because your body will cost us a pastor ... you'll get around to doing that I learned during the eighties right where that everyone knows what that means I didn't know what are they going to be a very\nVery interesting about here very innocent crowd here that have no idea what that word me I Do not and then and then you know kept on going to go on national television taken out to be like oh it's a party and joke I mean this is so ridiculous and absurd wasn't embarrassing nominee that talk\nAbout the process a Democrat in God let me just really give them the world because you're talking about polling going on average just wait for\nThe phone ring on this and it's a very [noise] with the ... this is not overwhelming pulling against capital this is right down the middle at this point in which is the worst in history or we get to go just as are never downloaded or what whatever down the matter because they were just talking about the electoral repercussion we're doing is you're kicked the hornet's nest\nThe Republican base that was kind of depressed at this point in what you see now in in terms of the energy brings to both parties the enthusiasm gap it's close and that's a good across the Democrats a couple of different things\nAt least I mean I guess when you look nobody wants to have a somebody that are doing sexual has done sexual assault get off of that we want people to come up and you can you tell us when it's OK you can probably pick as a double standard right she she fell asleep get there or or\nThe guy who is the guy the ravens beat up his girlfriend and ... by the hair and they they pay them more money\nJust for for whatever it's worth I mean I I totally concur on Keith Ellison I heard that publicly I campaign for his opponent you know on line when he got into the primary for attorney general I said this is not right the way he's doing it um\nAnd she shows you should be that's an ... not you've been my biggest thing in general but it it it and it and it is bad because a lot of people will look the other way 'cause any should not\nBe the number two person on the Democratic National Committee right but this is the Supreme Court and you have a guy who\nNot only has a credible accuser and we'll put the other two aside from that but I think Dr Ford is an extremely credible accuser but she has new corroborate that\nWe're seeing a lot of cooperation and what's her corroborate her quoting contemporaneous\nHis his people she said Bush President at the party he turned over his calendars from the same month and at the same people are listed on his challenger and ... and being like a social group the burning of Ben Smith at parties\nAnd she didn't go to school so she wouldn't even know those people and that was all his calendars were released after she made\nNone of them you know leaving her best friend can remain\nI mean I Am I'm equally much money at high school reunion even next month it's been a long time and I'm the youngest person here if I was at a social function in high school and no one told me that a a a traumatic event for someone else had occurred I Would have not remembering the event the next week\nLet alone Twenty years later it came to me now and said oh were you at the party at a I don't know I was at that party or\nNot is this guy produced calendar of what he was doing that summer in nobody can pinpoint nobody can pinpoint where when the party was where\nWas who invited her how she got there how she got home\nYou got to have something outside of memory wishing credible witness absolutely but I've seen credible witness before going wrong memories get over Thirty years I don't remember a lot of Thirty years ago or or I remember them differently than they were in gift corrected\nLook I don't know who's telling the truth there but I think the mere allegation enough if that's now the standard putting somebody down I think we wanted to\nI don't think this is not an issue I mean I I I think now if I think that when you look at you know I'm ... people have\nPut a lot of holes in the story of the the third accuser um and I think that you know you obviously have to hear both sides of you know when an accuser comes forward up their credibility this visit user everything she had dead\nYou can cooperate with what she had done with how she has lived her life\nWith her the notes from her therapy sessions\nBut we're we're no longer than\nI Do not early in the notes from repair of the things that I guess you get them to the end she offered enough yet when the interviewer she won't give\nTo the community many\nI appreciate your passion and you know your friend and I love you to death but what'd you just start off I mean she said she couldn't fly and then we find out she didn't do that to me and my were fliers she's pulling all over the world and was in for hope with keeping ... a month ago she Iraq so\nThat they said she she couldn't be in a in a place where the one door that was not corroborate in fact\nThe person I dated or independents that you haven't seen any by the door she lives in tiny apartment with one or that was false she said it was a\nLie detector test I never did that I don't know anything about it then her former personal data nurse said no she actually got paid to help people through lie detector test you knew everything about it so there was a lot of things that you said that she couldn't recall or witnessed mistaken about that you can sit there and say everything that you set up\nFor that I don't even know what's true anymore yeah that's the arsenal why I I\nDon't even know I think her testimony was a compelling test my bed I Will give you that everybody watched that but I thought he was too and if my reputation for being trashed I'd be a little emotional ... as well what happens\nNow everybody's back in the corners and it's a very divided country what it his gun indigent equalize the enthusiasm gap which was in the Democrats' favor prior to that I agree with that\nWe'll tell bad but it's just you're not admit that this was a certain this was a circus I think it's diminished the book the institution of the Senate and the and the ... the clown show and I just got to it's a good at least they took a week to go back in the interview some of these other people in close that the ... it's never going to be enough if you come back and you don't take this guy out for the Democrats\nAnd on same on the Republican side so we'll have a vote tomorrow I think it passes in in ... and you move on\n'em and we'll go to an election that's not what we're saying earlier as if he doesn't ... probably be the best result for the Republican yeah elder going out more in tune\nI agree I think that the enthusiasm gap um I don't think it's not as much as the Republicans are claiming that has I think that there was some I'm annoyed pull on it's not they're not you know in our internal polling sure as you as you know like you know pulling motion noise in the wild this is going on there was a ... and the reality we're\nFair and the and the reality is that if you are correct that he's going to get confirmed\nThat there's not going to be a Republican boost from this and the election in fact it will be the opposite it's going to add to the army I'm\nRight in the Democratic until he was already at an eleven I mean I\nI don't think that's true and in fact I think that the Democratic intensity and she doesn't Seventeen ... you know you look at Virginia it was only on pockets of neighborhoods there were places where it wasn't a eleven\nUm upper income white neighborhoods were off the charts for Democrats but like the minority communities which has always been a historic democratic base had not that they were not engage in twenty Seventeen election in the same extent and they hadn't been engaged in twenty eight teams that I

horrific I mean she was just absolutely terrific I don't know who did or debate prep she I mean I I mean if you try to be in a debate if\nIf I dressed up as her and did that debate in my goal was to be horrible she did worse than I could have done it in person or try to be there what was that\nThis announcement that the temp district is competitive ... by Barbara Comstock for Congress I mean it is going to be a double digit rate she's reading from a script because he's trying not to screw up the fact that she's going to end by double digits um ... it's capable of\nOf doing more um than um\nThan that um you know she's been a state senator so I'm Talking on policy side I'm so she's not without chopped right but at this point in this race she's being told reduced script don't mess up that's what happened in that debate I don't disagree with you that like you know\nDoes Bush to be a little plane at the debate yes did she make any major areas no and that's my Barbara Comstock so upset about the debate that wants to talk about how she did so poorly Barbara's ... Jennifer didn't make any errors that allows barber to get back in the race\nIt's a landslide it's been a landslide the tenth district has every single demographic group that is breaking against Trump in this country over represented in it\nIf the Democrats do not take the tent the Republicans will hold Congress at that I agree with I don't think yeah it it's now and and right now that's not in the realm of possibility\nBut the Republican polling is telling me that she's tire or slightly ahead\nBarbara it's going to lose by double digits top when she's over perform for pulling Everytime her whole career she's over ...\nYears the problem is in bend is every demographic group or the Republicans are losing market share right now are collected in for federal employees are high income educated voters that gun now she's a woman\nShe talked with the difficulty they have the Republicans took away or the one weapon Frank Wolf and I had to survive up here and that was your marks\nI was not Tom Davis I was Mr Gordon prison Mr Woodrow Wilson bridge Mr rail to dollars ... Barbara gets none of that uh because the Republicans get away with their constitutional obligation uh on on do you know to to designate projects\nSo this makes it even more difficult race it it's a single digit race\nInto the closing weeks on a jet or for in terms of their operate search I'm not going to tell you what it is so I think this race quoting since I've seen races close a lot more at this point but this was this was a tough\nRace it's a tough atmosphere and as they tough districts and remember\nAll right well then triggered by what was that ... thing you said again just wants to be is on the backs of ... [laughter]\n\nJust I got to treat that out at eight thirty or when it's been driven Tom Davis and ... Peterson and you've got a lot of the truth here John just rhetoric let's get to the other races um let's get to the seven I just had Barbara I just said ... drama show\nYesterday she's a very complex candidate no doubt but ah I see little momentum going for Dave I didn't think he was going to win a week ago now I I think he is going to win a Ben how do you see that race [noise]\nSo I I had that one a slightly in Republican up until the Kavanaugh hearings at this point I think it's a toss up on because what the Kavanaugh hearings did was really re energized and fire up the one voter block\nThat's the problem for Dave Brat in some district which is suburban women\nUm and I think that the seven districts historically Republican it should be a Republican voted Republican ... um so I can last year um but I'm the one path or a Democrat there isn't an right go in Chesterfield with the suburban women\nAnd I think Abigail's a good match for them and I think that the Republicans are doing everything they can to lose that block naturally right now um and so I haven't is tough\nI think drinking Kool Aid on this Kavanaugh's nomination in terms of I mean I enter let me just say yeah in in terms of what this is doing politically and I think we all live\nIn our own echo chambers and we all have our own perceptions of how it's done but what this was done in ... and some other polling demonstrate this is the Republican base is now activated enthusiasm gap which is favored the Democrats for the last year and a half is now closed substantially\nAnd I think that works to prop secret ... David Wright has two two issues though outside the demographics district in the DNA that district is Republican number one he is not close the deal with some of cancers people\nAnd they were just as soon thrown under the Boston rent that seat out for two years and bring back or ... you know somebody it's more in line with their thinking and and even some scores and secondly Tim Kaine is going to be exceptionally strong in that district he was mayor of Richmond if he has a political he's widely ... he's the same ...\nYeah I think that's right this this jacks up that democratic turnout there so you got a factor that into this thing I still think at the end of the day that the DNA of that district establishes itself ... wins but the but this was a close race in Democrats have nominated ... she's very\nAnd whatever happens you're talking about uh somebody has got to be involved in democratic politics for some time I think I think Abigail Spanberger is going to happen it's got to be somebody's got to be reckoned with a democratic circles for some time ...\nDot die you know I don't I don't know a ton about the district or a you know I Will say I was driving down to south opportunity to go to an event last weekend and going through some of the rural counties and it seems like if Brad can pull Marjah doubted those counties are but obviously the critical mass of the the district is in Chesterfield man right go so\nYou know I I Would probably say you know robotically it's a Republican district but obviously if it's a wave here than it could be one that the Democrats deal then would after defended twenty twenty\nI always get the second district Taylor or whatever happened with a sale or the other day I had my radio show or the ... campaign put my [noise] my name and their team TV ads so I appreciate the PR for that what's going on in that race but\nThis is my first chance to respond to Scott right after he had his meltdown on your show um that went viral yet I'm Upset about our analysis last time I'm announces has not changed he's still going to lose\n'em and um I don't think I don't believe in New York Times poll I think it was you know I I ... up to this point I knew controls were pretty good at the last week they've they've not been um I think there's some noise going on\nI'm ... I think what is going to win and she's going to win going away um so I think she's going to win going away I think it's going to be a [noise] a secular up until two months ago I was doing everything right um and he's really blown it\nAnd he's not going to win reelection and so are you saying because of the whole the validation Israel sequences issue in the way he's handled it and remember that this district is one of the few in the country\nThat not only ... side a media market but is in a media market that doesn't really stretch too many other districts\nSo the media has been all over this is on the evening news every night you know if Barbara Comstock at a petition scandal and attempt district it would have made D.C eating for forty five seconds one night\nOr maybe a week later they quickly re mentioned that you know it goes way you you cannot get away with something\nThe tide water it's been out afterwards so let me let me look I think are the New York times for property rights cater is fixed that district very well\nUm you know the navy seal all kinds of stuff is if the issue matrix and use chosen I think you're in line with that district is not a far right kind of guy he understands a suburban Virginia Beach in Missouri and so we have all that going for him or his positions\nEvery year that favors Democrats ... which is a Republican what scares me about this is the fact that if you look nationally Democrats just a ton of cash\nAnd drop it a couple of million dollars on that race in the last week that megaphone just can overwhelm at this point and exaggerate these things I think I think New York times pulls correct commentators up today a again if are betting I I I think he wins\nBut in this environment with the kind of money Democrats put down a you've got to be nervous about this you're going to watch this on election night if the Democrats win this seat it tells me it's going to be a pretty good year farm in terms of we're talking thirty five forty yeah I just think about [noise]\nThe thing about this district is different than Comstock and it's definitely different than a brat is the turnout model is totally different and I think it's hard for Democrats to win the seat in non presidential year are just based on who votes democratic and Virginia Beach Norfolk\nIt's you know the the typical democratic voters will be a minority down there and in less you get an outsized performance it's not\nI think it's tough for the Democrats to win that seat I mean when I wanted to thousand eight he got flushed down the drain and twenty ten and the reason was democratic vote came out in the presidential year for Brock Obama it wasn't there the next cycle for Glenn Nye 'cause nobody knew Glen I watch\nUm I think God's got an advantage is that the turnout I remember back when I was in the house carcass we'd look at the turnout bottles and the numbers and [noise]\nYou know Virginia Beach in Norfolk the numbers are just forty percent of what they are in other parts of the state so it's just it's it's you got a lot of people that live there that are you know enlisted men or women that are registered to vote elsewhere so it's just it's hard\nYou know to to bring people out in that type of environment even though was bench correct you have one media market and\nYou know they could possible Scott from now till the end of the time but there's going to be a conservative there's going to be a conservative vote is going to come out\nAnd whether uh uh Maria I don't know how to pronounce it ... whether or not she can get people out based on her name as opposed to you know Tim Kaine is not as big a magnet there as he is enrichment um so I I still think it's a pill for the Democrats even though I agree that looks like Scott's kinda botch this one issue\nNineteen Ninety six and Tom Davis one member of this well I'm ... we had a we have scandal um statewide where John Warner put a television ad up against Mark Warner who is John Warner was far ahead and um he photo shop Mark Warner and do a picture\nI remember who's in the ... I Can't remember what we do to stop what he thought it was up and Clinton I think yeah he's ... with Clinton but was it was all her was saying there was a racial aspect to it too I Can't remember what they did but they\nPut a shot Mark Warner into a picture he wasn't in and um ended a television ad and it was a huge went national scandal for John Boehner who had a moderate brand and was a\nGuy that you know everyone looked she likes you know what you're trying to say Scott Taylor is there like had a friend okay and and and that people you know like respected John Warner much higher than got Taylor though [noise] and and his numbers collapsed and Mark Warner was going to win that\nOn a navy person and and the captain of my ship and I'm responsible for what happened and I apologize and it's got Taylor had done that you would want to do\nSo August I was worse campaign chairman that year and it was a it was a close race much worse than fourteen million dollars of his own money to hear that may just really a much closer race than it might have been otherwise good strong when it was he was on ... to ... or ... or the map and you kind of earn it after running a close race there but I remember it out and I really fired\nThe people that were involved in the ad and everything else and you broke it and it was an issue for a week or two and then John took accountability and he took accountability [noise] said or has mishandled this thing I think convinced is kind of destruction and having his people take the Fifth Amendment doesn't help it just keeps it in the news\nIs that enough to bring down somebody with a good reputation just done a good job in the first term or not\nUm and also I think the wave turnout are they talking about a new wave I think you're really talking about a ... that's really what's happening with the Democrats is that the suburban female voters have swung radically or to the Democratic party and that's what\nWe're going to take our forget our predictions rolling it back the next segment we got to get to run again yeah I agree with us\nI'm an ... billion Thirteen were there but not that popular up and running and libertarian broke five percent and libertarian the automatic ballot access to the next five years in Virginia which ... which are the Republicans that was going to expire this year\nTo ... percent again another ... there'll be another five years with libertarian automatic ballot access loud\nThey're great and why is it a good point and that water is going to get over five no no question probably seven foreigners here to tell you that your image I think you think five or it's going to win or with the\nUh [noise]\nUh what what uh what about Scott\nMaria [noise] I Know [noise] you know what's going on [noise] and uh so you were [noise]\n\nWell [noise]\n[noise]\nA stamp uh\nTerrorists got nothing but negative publicity from a over the last several months and I don't see 'em climbing out of that old could be wrong but I don't see that and I also don't\nI mean you're a cop stock can talk about her internal all she wants that's not what people were picking up going door to door [noise]\nSo what have you heard of that risk [noise] I just I mean you don't want our pet\nTo try to bolster the Democratic voters are going to democratic doors\nThat those people are telling her there with her\nWhen on occasion they've asked what's the main complaint and this was before Kavanaugh's talking about it since then it was the n._r._a. [noise] those ads have been effective but this cabin all thing\nI mean that's all your door to door and that's all I get\nThat far apart [laughter] credit Chester go we've we've we've got to get to the rest yup we've got to the beginning Monday Night ride Carolina right well let's start with where they are early in the right to be happy so far\nYeah generally happy I think the defence like I said a month ago yawn fast a [noise] good and and they're going to get better I think their deepest will get better [noise] um I I think they need to give a couple of guys more snaps a couple of guys less naps but\nBy and large I liked their defense to be a top ten defenses yearn for the next few years going forward that makes it for us\nI think they do they have one issue they need to solve and I can solve it if they listen to me they all week on the end they don't have any big play receivers that can go down catch the ball you know catch eight balls for a hundred yards\nAnd you need to have that too when consistently in the NFL you can't just keep throwing too you're tied into your backs especially with a\nTight and like Jordan read that's never gonna get injured his\nDad was on the street [noise] he's been on the street I in you know Bruce has my from Brazil I emailed him literally within twelve hours of it being caught by Dallas begging begging them to pick up jazz I have repeated it every time I said um [noise]\nThe day he sets his foot on Redskins park you'll be their number one receiver they could get rid of Josh dachshund yes I said it they could keep Jamieson and crowd on the slot they can get that keep that get records in that there are number two receivers fast\nBut then you need a big receiver who can pull down eight nine temples a game for a hundred yards desk and do it and so if they put him on the team they will be the best team the NFC East and will make the playoffs sweating\nDallas lakes losing um I think it's [laughter] I Know they don't like to when they like to lose a why did you know why do they do what they do I do they keep Jason gear to head coach you know I mean\nWhy do they get rid of Tony Romo and ah it's just I I think somewhere Jerry Jones just decided he was tired of winning the waters start losing for a while and so that's why does what he does\nThat what what do you think that I mean is that the answers that dependency [noise]\nYeah I I'm I'm they were going down and I can't believe we're talking about the Redskins are not referring to them as the first place [noise] yeah that's true first place and a phrase for a different place type\nYeah that's right I I'm going to say at this point a lot better than I thought there'd be this year still very very tough scheduling next week I'm going to say nine and seven and that may be enough to make the playoffs because the eagles are struggling\nOr one of the things it's always heard that\nOver ... you're going to do your game since Ninety four and one of the things that the Redskins have lack for some time as a speed demon than\nI Can't remember the last time I'm sure I'll probably missed something but I cannot remember the last time I've seen the Redskins a Redskin return upon her chick offshore touchdown man and a while and it's been a long time\nAnd I remember well one of the hallmarks of a ... little body of water so that he always had a professor you called it one burner\n[noise] whether it was you know on your nerves whoever I mean it was he always had at least one burner and we don't have that and uh it it shows\nHow many how many ... when you're there for about nine\n... tough I got fired last one I Know benefit from five to\n... yeah I think [noise] able to do after being [noise] maybe three and one [noise]\nAh they beat New Orleans at the superdome and on the way to an eleven o'clock season [noise]\nNo not\nAll right I'm going to go in the middle I think they're going to win ten games I think you've gotta like playoffs and here's your here's the thing about Alex [noise] I'm not a fan of it because he can't win big games in the playoffs and so we got an exciting quarterback but you know I've watched him now three weeks I'm not a fan one way or the other but they're on TV [noise]\nBut I mean he managed to games and he's never going to be you know he's never going to be themselves and he kind of\nI could see one thing I can see quite a challenge on them I mean he does he kinda fits what they're\nWhat the whole crew new philosophy is now granted I don't know when you get [noise] and I think that I think that seems kind of winter games are they they could get in the playoffs will be dangerous [noise]\nI got I got to sign off I got to be in court today okay thank you for sharing your events I mean I think we're going to let me just quickly add the unemployment down to three point seven percent the lowest since Nineteen sixty nine lord since Nineteen [noise]\nWhich you know I can settled for you to not get a raise can I comment on this really quickly John [noise] this is it's an amazing stat but not for the reason the Republicans wanted you to be in a maintenance that because people say nothing sticks on Trump\nAnd I think it's the opposite I think everything sticks on Trump the fact that you have an economy that's as good as it is and he's having a going to have a bad of an election they're going to have everything is sticking to\nHim because you shouldn't have with the economy [noise] one of the first times when the president picks up if it was an economy election [noise]\nUm the Republicans could actually be gaining ground in the Congress\nHigh income areas are the ones turning against in the faster so for people to say nothing sticks to Trump\nEverything sticking to try [noise] well I think you\nGet credit for the economy and I think I think he gets credit for the economy and I think that mitigate so against the law says they take just because of the ... the cycle but these coalitions are basically cultural coalition if they're not economic coalition and\nAs I said the Democratic enthusiasm in the independents wanting to balance the government is really what hurts the Republican point people don't trust the Republicans have the ... and you want some kind of check\nOn Trump's yeah he's doing okay they may vote for him in two years but in the mid term they want to put a check on I I Will say this I think the Democrats take the house is I think it's more likely than not\nAh I I don't know how they don't impeach the president when it comes out you've got the Democratic base right now it's rapid they want to impeach him now before\n... a mission and when you [noise] I I don't know how Democrats going back to their primary in twenty twenty can't not to impeach Trump I I just think that happens in rent for two years\nI think I Want to make sure whether they have any any reasonable evidence or not because like they have\nA lot of them think they have reasonable evidence now I don't know what more could have been you know what are you going to say um but I just think you look at the base and you look at the fact that the primary elections or what most of these members worry about\nThat it's politics or they're going to do it I'm not arguing shutting down to earth and takes on Capitol Hill yeah well I I think what happens is it changes the dynamic for twenty Nineteen it was one thing that twenty Seventeen Trump's than Republicans controlled everything to put a check on him what\nThe Democrats come in Congress like our clients of Republicans in Nineteen Ninety four\nIt kind of they go through the under Clinton played off against the Republican ... he actually did better than they would do it and I think some of that dynamic in twenty Nineteen that's the way that the Democrats had it for you in that window there back in twenty Seventeen you won't have that same level of wind in twenty Nineteen now there are other factors matter of fact\nI'm going to call [noise]\nNews is our from town hall God Tom ...

what he feels confident of victory that will be decided in June\nOr some time whenever they whenever they senator maybe an insect\nAnd two thousand Nineteen okay this is going to be the open Mike our will be taking your phone call for you know John eighty four five six for six the boys are back in town\nLet's start with venture backing the caps a\nI Know you were so excited about door to the caps game Wednesday night to see the flag the batter under ... world champion Stanley Cup tell us about the experience and China capturing the\nIt was incredible and um [noise] I don't know how to put it into words you know being a couch in my entire life and the amount of um anguish I think that all caps fans have have had over ... over that time\nUm and the number of times that we were right on the cusp and just couldn't couldn't make it and um it was a great night and a great ceremony and then seven nothing when and yes the caps can repeat I think that actually going to be better this year I think a cloud\nOf pessimism has been lifted from that team you know John one of the things that I can tell you the season ticket holder that was just so frustrating but you just couldn't break it was in the playoffs you know that that we have a great home ice advantage the or\nThe the entire year and the playoffs\nOver and over again we're moving in a fire right in the big game and and and the whole the whole right at the edge media jets um I've never seen an arena just go so\nLast year game seven against Pittsburgh and when we when we went out the ... in in twenty sixteen and um they went down one nothing and it was like you know one nothing that hockey is nothing and and I mean it was like you're at a funeral that we've already lost the game they were there for\nA short hair just collapsed right [noise] and and and and and that's and now it's like it's lifted and and and you could feel the playoffs last year once we got through Pittsburgh it didn't matter if we went down in the game people could still believe in a team and the team to believe in itself I think I think that\nThat the caps in their history was Wayne on the players were they were believing when they went down a gold at the the games where you can hear how they because the fans ... every everyone believed it and I didn't want to Pittsburgh got the last year everything changed\nYou could feel the change their I'm Thomas he's taken hold on a season ticket holder we set\nUp four sections away from each other sometimes each other and the the Dunkin' Donuts line in between factions [noise] um but um [noise] this is going to be a great era for the caps now I don't think this was a one year thing I think that you look at who's nets off is young\nI'm over in in his you know not in the mid mid thirties I think when you're thirty three thirty two [noise]\nUm [noise] he's gonna make a run a Gretzky for the most goals scored about time the regular season is over six hundred Gretzky is eight Ninety four he's going to make a serious run up being the number one goal score an inch on history and the caps have an incredibly bright future um [noise] and\nI'll just end with saying this my dilemma right now I put a thousand dollars and the cats last year when the Stanley Cup in Las Vegas Fifteen the one we want to in Vegas that the cash for tickets Fifteen thousand dollars when I catch the ticket the person that the counter told me the biggest payout she's ever paid at the sports book\nOr when people will take about like that and roll it over for two or three seasons and she said you know the caps three feet and you wrote us money over it'll be two million dollars by the time they have to repeat so I'm Still having this dilemma for the rest of the season I have not\nDone anything with the money yet because it may be that like you know it was just a thousand dollar initial investment I might need to roll it over a couple of times because I think the cats are legitimate threat not only to repeat this year potentially do you have to repeat I'm the only after all that every year by year so that's my dilemma\nBut I'm leaning towards the right now I actually think this team as a special team and one that um is going to have a lot of success going forward [noise]\nTo play out [noise] but uh that are concentration will be in a high concentration and those two district but also in a several others I mean you know we're not going to spread it all out all over the state [noise] um\nYou have to know you know you got to play where your ... your ... your strengths and it would be there I think a Ralph one uh [noise] I think we're out\nOne by twelve points twelve to Fifteen points I got an ear a in a [noise] blacks district and even more I think in Stuart events district\nAnd uh you know the dynamics are changing and it's not just so much a matter of of Trump or anything the demographics in the state or changing and they're changing almost daily and\nAh it's obvious which way you know they're moving are we going to be like Maryland that we're not going to be like Maryland but we um northern Virginia is beginning to look more and more northern Virginia suburbs more and more not totally but more and more like the Maryland suburbs\nNational it's not just reached want me right now the naturally in these kinds of various\nRight as I said New Jersey suburb same things going on everywhere in Eldorado sites every but you're seeing this you're seeing this an awful lot and um I think we have an excellent chance\nAnd no question we're getting help from the guy in the White House whether it will be there or not you know uh I I was joking with Mark Warner and I said well we we need 'em they're just more and more election [laughter] you know but I mean it's you know\nI'm a generally speaking we'd done better [noise] generally speaking when there's been a Republican and the White House have their print exceptions yes\nGenerally speaking the Republicans have done better when the Democrats than in the White House have there been exceptions yes but the trend is there\nAnd it was a mistake up all understand and I\nI I Would be surprised if we didn't know you know get to Twenty one in the end of the election that are minimum\nYeah I think I I I tend to agree you know you still have to defend a couple of feet like you got a couple of comments he got one over on the eastern shore that they do is in play I think Republicans can hold with the black seats if they don't have the black\nEye [noise] far weaker today a it's an incumbent probably anybody else to get some personal proclivities and\nAnd and things that I think that hurts him among some of those voters we have some strong candidate or black\nOr and I don't know what happens there he's got a hundred and fifty thousand in the bank so I didn't sound like he's ready to go away very quickly but I Will just my advice to him and he got nowhere to hold on one of the folder and you want to go out to undefeated not indicted if you could do that and it gets lost before\nIn ... when he and house delegation moves over the first district run for Congress\nGerman some very attractive candidate a you've but you've got some issue ... after the initial matrix there where he has not really thinking or his voting record [noise] um [noise] ah to that district and you've got the state house if the one forty nine into redistricting\nThat's critical happened many many I mean we have to wait and see but may work and the Democrats said with\nThe um [noise] I mean it would appear that the judges are going to wind up throwing it house district out eleven house districts\nAnd I think that's what whatever formula when they come up with that is going to a also be what the Senate's going to have to abide by twenty Twenty one\nAnd uh it could change or you know a kicker changed an awful lot [noise]\nUm you know a part of the districts are unpacked not totally but below the numbers I mean look what Bobby Scott\nI'm In his district one from what fifty some fifty six percent down to you know one forties and I'm a [noise] you know produced another democratic district\nSo you're going to have to see how that plays out but it seems to me that uh [noise] the judges drawing that district is by far and away their their best bet\nAnd if they do you know the Supreme Court I think it ruled before the gerrymandering is is has been constitutionally permissible until it spills over in racial discrimination and therein lies the problem and that's what the Republicans are facing\nThere and it's going to change its going to change the way you know a whole makeup of legislatures around the country\nWe're going to court for five to four court will do this differently blocks of each other going back if I may be wrong but I think when they send it back to the lower court it was like seven\nTo initially but I just say one other thing is you can understand the Republican base for better for worse has migrated from that country club the country and in so doing they've taken so out of some competitive districts where these were economic issues ripple you'd be very viable [noise]\nSo it's not just the demographics of the fact that they have changed the emphasis on issues in ways that help them in South West Virginia but but it hurts them in the growing parts of the state\nCan we talk about the ... and he also wrote a very popular governor with very low negative and you look at ... number ... support amongst Democrats\nWas not popular among Republicans was more polarizing in numbers Ralph Northam has incredibly low negative ads for somebody in this environment you look nationally um he has very high positives very low negatives um and in going into these competitive seats [noise]\nUm I remember in ... eleven and Democrats drew the state Senate lines and they lost the majority and who was the the person who was in every Republican ... seats was Bob McDonnell a popular governor can play a big role in there and\nI don't care how you slice it the national environment plays Baltimore that you have to have a messenger more help right there especially when you're turning out the Thomas writes\nThe the I mean it that that national scene where he's very heavily you know which is why you've had you know the the patterns that you've had\nUntil McCarthy Cuccinelli I mean you know what happened\nFor almost fifty year I'm gonna I'm In that I've been here about the surveys\nLike let's take for example the started at the start of in seat was not driven by national politics and twenty fifth and it was driven by local politics in Chesterfield versus Richmond and I'd like to be democratic um and I think that we\nAnd we don't believe we have more aggressive candidate but we don't have we entered its campaigns don't matter you know I don't think we had to I don't think we had a great message or that I think if you read right in that same race in twenty Nineteen and you had Ralph Northam on TV I'm In that district Ralph would not let me just say oh they vote the votes which tournaments chaos is going to create\nProblems for him yeah I think that's a greater problem\nIs that he's he's not harmonious where the district on some of those hot button issue I just think that like Rob working good governor I think he's a wonderful man but he gets a fireside chat in the FARC has now you put him on TV ... it's it's not the same kind of rally the team but he's an asset\nTo them and making this meat to use that ... I don't know if that's the kind of governor you actually need the snow and he picked up not a fiery picked up Fifteen states I mean I think in terms of color in his fiery and I'm at a carnival Barker one end and he doesn't he doesn't pick up seats going up north on death\nRow north of it and pick them up Trump picked him up for him yet if Trump would have been president and twenty Fifteen we'd be in the majority\nBut look I I decided I don't want to do on Ralph Northam disagree however I think he's been very much just say the chemical upon by three points and rapport with him on by eight and ... picks up here as he picked up fifty five point difference was not the fifteenth ... but there was also a hotel different let me tell you the\nWhite House under strict about Trump okay was a driving factor sure last November on top of that\nUm [noise] you had a ... and spilled over into everything [noise]\nAnd keep in mind Gillespie was not true Janelle I mean he was very polarizing [noise]\nBut um I just think people keep underestimating his governor oh I don't think anybody underestimate I don't think anybody under estimate same\nBut make no mistake I mean you know what's driving politics in Virginia right now is not a Ralph up its it's what's going on across the Potomac River [noise]\nIt's negativity driving politics on both sides right now in the one thing about roughly one he doesn't have any negative [noise] doesn't have many many he's a very like about ...\nI'm not you know art now go you know been knocking on doors since may I have not gotten one negative comment about brown non and that's you know it's\nIt's not the problem is you know I I agree with that he is an asset but he's not a fire reader that gets voted off for\nYou know I I think Tom Davis is not a fire eater they got to put up for the Republicans for Twenty years\nEvery single Republican Lippi she would have thought the person was married to Tom Davis because the Republican candidate had a picture of bigger than their own picture with a quilt for him saying like here's why they'd be great for your time sometimes without permission um so I mean having a messenger is important and Democrats are not had good ... north him as the first time in a\nLaundries right I agree but now he's thinking on income but that was an entirely different that I\nI don't know I tell you what man I I chose jokes kind of beat or do you guys under estimate Morsi and I'm telling you\nWhat he had a disastrous press conference I wasn't there and it was a disaster of all time so he had a disastrous press conference that really hurt him all kinds of underhanded things going on but you know after that\nMorsi's mayor and [noise] you know the the thing about Joe is he's an independent thinker he's got to go is the only way it's a you know he's not\nHe's not a whole bunch of any of the establishment caucuses or anything like that\nI think he's got to play very well in that district and I think a lot of friends there that I don't think that he got screwed by what they did to him and and take\nA gym or she did the smartest thing I've ever seen anyone to in politics when he when the when I think it was ... he won Mickey chintzy mceachin moved up I think\nAnd in that primary people and think he was going to win that primary out a deal any more than a landslide networks people are asking what do you went around and after he knocked on doors at you know and I wrote a handwritten note to every voter he spoke to\nThe data that for a week and a half before the election in the context of it that he had remembered the conversation\n... kept these postcards for six months and send them all out ten days before the election with a handwritten note from him talking about how their conversation and\nYou know I met your dog Sam or you're a teacher here and I remember that conversation and you know hope I can count on your support next Tuesday and\nPeople came out in droves I mean for him to go do that though and I I I see people read postcards but I've never seen one posting them to make it appear as ... months later okay well companies didn't I'm Tom Davis has everything better than anyone in politics libraries but [noise] but he did that to anyone in a landslide and like have\nBeen done before it ... no I don't underestimate Joe I'm just saying taking on in Congress district like I did it feel or not\nTo I'm not an expert on that's the big difference [noise]\nYou know if we had you know there's a whole lot of people have gotten into the general assembly because we don't have run on\nPurpose in the state a whole and and you won't have that you'll just have to people in there\nAnd she's well why [noise]\nI don't think I if I had the gas and I think it would tell her on whether or not live in that district I guess that Ross dance have extremely low name id pardon I Would guess that rod dancers extremely low name id and that if you test nickname a gym or his name I got to say that the ...
