this ah\nThe evolving story of the salaries it's now clear this was a premeditated murder this guy got chopped up in a\nBasically got out of there and some kind of doggie bags and they buried him in the garden or something the whole thing is that just a horrible situation but look a\nCrown prince Mohammed bin Salman the administration is putting a lot of things in the sky that Jared Kushner has\nAnd a lot of people are saying you know maybe this guy's just incompetent\nAnd capable of running the country everything he touches turns to crap whether it's the Yemeni civil war that's a disaster the gang of four embargo against the state of guitar that backfired and blow up in their face guitars better off today than they were\nNow he's got this thing where they changed their story night time what do we do here\nJohn as you point out it's clear that job the show was brutally murdered it's clear that it was premeditated it's clear that uh that I think the crown prince knew about that a NBS Mohammed bin Salman\nBanks I think have a lot to answer for and I think they have to be held accountable so I Do think that there has to be significant penalties\nThat they suffer I Do think to the question has to be asked is like does the United states believes that it can carry on a continued relationship with Saudi Arabia which I Do think we need to but\nCan that be when the crown prince I I think that's a pretty compelling question I think the administration is going to have to ask that I think Congress will eventually addressed that an asset to you know what will be the penalties are to uh to Saudi Arabia\nI listen I understand the impact of those those contracts\nFor what we're doing just supply a military uh equipment to Saudi Arabia\nI think Saudi Arabia I can be a like a a force\nThat is is a\nIs a is an ally to us in the in the middle east but I don't think that it can it can be that type of ally\nThat we want him that we need to you if this is how they're going to operate I mean we have you know we have principles in the United states that we that we stand by and our allies have to have to abide by those and I just don't see Saudi\nArabia doing that you know you you're pointing out the issue with Yemen too and you and I have talked about that before a those are all questions I think that come up and how we see Saudi Arabia operating in the range of policies being played out and are are they\nThat creates stability and that and that are working in the in the best interest of Saudi Arabia but uh other allies in the middle east enlisted I I I understand what they're\nGoing to push back against the Iranian but things are about the middle east direction I those are questions that we have to ask or policy standpoint and I think U.S policy\nToward Saudi Arabia you know needs to be directed by those areas are very sobering issues that we have it for us\nSo it seems like congressman and Whitman a total agreement and it seems like what you're saying is the best way to solve this is a four crown prince MPs will hammered that solving to maybe a step aside for someone else had his father for somebody else in their final question that\nOnly have half a minute and I've got to get your weather like that so very quickly um is there going to be a vote in Congress on our involvement in the Yemeni civil war and backing the Saudi coalition yes or no\nI'm John I I I Can't can't predict because I don't know where I go to Saudi Arabia but I Would say that it it will be fading Congress about what our policy is with Saudi Arabia and Congress\nAre they going to go more information Rob ... dot com Rob Wittman dark out early voting it started in Virginia you get out and get involved go to Robert\nBiggest election midterm election ever in the history of the United states and you're right here right now getting involved with me keeping up on their job it's because no fake news here just the truth great to have you with me John triggers radio network you're Godzilla\nOf the truth in America boy that nonsense going on up there every day got um people I compete with hotel people they just get up every day they read the paper you got the fake news you've got big coal region of the poll yesterday from the Washington Post it's unbelievable\nI mean the Washington Post like what are they going to learn like they don't want to work people say well what are they going to change polling methodology to get it right never because they don't want to get it right because it's not about\nAfterward poll it's about the poll driving fake news to get a fake narrative draw fake inclusion that's all it is it's all\nThe Washington Post actually putting\nOut a poll yesterday actually putting out a poll showing Barbara Comstock trailing\nJennifer ... said in the ... district by surging point now there is no way that watch didn't have the\nThird June ... point lead over bar because it's like every journal poll that I have seen on top stocked every internal poll with his pay four and a lot of money shows this raises a dead heat or cops are slightly ahead and the one\nAnd our lives and it's to be on fake news is and it's beyond the onion it's be on the national Enquirer what they tried to do they hate tops not so much they want that seem so bad they want the liberal do not think Jennifer watched it in there\nSo bad they can taste it they want their\nLeftist in that seeing so much that they will\nActually conducted poll make things up\nDoing in such a way to get the results that they want so they could put it out there and say the races over don't give cops are getting the money and don't work for her it's a lost cause so they do a fake poll\nIn order to do think now it's unbelievable nobody in that district\nIs going to look you in the eye and say that they think Jennifer Washington as a Thirteen point lead this race is tied and I think Comstock is going to win for the Washington Post started the care they'll not own up to any of this with either one of the New York times or ABC News or read the singer MSNBC\nOr any of the polling companies that are into who were the fake news and that's what they are so it's it's pretty it's a fake news network and it's designed to drive\nInto the closure to make you not want to do anything to help\nHer if you're in the ... district go volunteer for cops like she is going to win this race if you get out and help her but they live\nOn a daily basis and that's why the president says it's fake news editor he says it's an enemy of the people when you walk to the people and masquerading as a legitimate news network with a legitimate poll is that not\nAn enemy how would you define that this poll for the poster so\nAstronaut that even westerns most staunchest supporters think it's a joke because they know it's not true so what are we just let me just ask your question if they're putting out purposely putting out the\nInformation driving it so that does make is that the\nThe people it's certainly an hey it's an enemy the truce maybe the president needs to change one word it's an enemy of the truth it's certainly an enemy of fact\nIs unbelievable they're doing it again they didn't do does the sixteen and they're doing it again they've learned\nNothing you know ready to start with the Democrats have learn nothing from two thousand sixteen the legacy media has learned nothing in fact what they're doing now is they can't believe they were wrong\nAnd so they're doubling down and here's the thing if the Republicans don't relinquish the house bill legacy media after two elections in a row going all aimed for the Democrats and losing them both on a federal level\nI'm\nGood I simply tell you the truth 'cause there are roughly double Kevin relevant they are\nAnd tripling down a moral law\nIs on more think polls and more fake news again\nShould strive to results they want on election day again and it's going to backfire\nOn them I get\n\nI mean they actually think that somebody semi pipe clubs that don't go off at like at a change the trajectory the election\nHe'd get a life we're going to get an economic report coming\nForty five minutes that it's going to show another over four percent GDP Growth\nAnd their banking on hatred of the truck and somebody sending pipe bombs that don't go wash targeted that Democrats had already been influencing anything right now it's very bizarre it's very the whole thing is very suspicious and it's very bizarre\n\nRight now if you're in national Democrat here's what you have to deal with mobs and caravans and you're running against Republicans who are for jobs in country Bob versus jobs and country versus care of that\n\nAnd if they really think the caravan crossing the United states a bum rushing to the border at a clip of Fifteen thousand just coming in and getting food clothing shelter education hospital care and well let's just open up or are if if they really think that having\nTens of thousands of illegal storming the country\nIt's going to help them get elected know see what they were hoping for is a couple of thousand with kids and babies\nAnd they'd be separated and it would be chaos and Trump would be it meaning any put troops there and they'd have bayonets and everybody will be outrage and he's got to go\nIn standard has

the Kavanaugh debacle\nThey have the Taliban debacle\nAnd democratic briefings at a level never been seen in history of measuring the stuff\n\nThat is what's going on here this is why I'm telling you I don't know if the Republicans are going to hold the house where it's gonna be darn close there's no like Seventy fifty feet blow out here we're going to be up 'til three am that's got to be very

technology in place now\nBut we don't put time on this on this if there's that many people that are headed towards the border or we don't know what's in better than those in John my biggest fear\nUm it's easy you know it's like a Trojan Horse right listen Ninety five percent Ninety nine percent of those people could actually be seeking asylum um does that you know our hearts sort of go out\nTo ... with compassion however if you have people inside there that are bad actors and they're able to hide you know within this\nHealthy intelligence assets down range I think we're going to be monitoring and my guess is I can only speculate right now my guess is what I've joined operations\nWith Mexico on monitoring this caravan of seeing any type of emissions that are coming out of there talking about radio emissions or any kind of been told that we can blame this is not a good situation this is not good and at some point I think we have to fix our immigration laws in a way that again are are\nMuch more common sense then the sort of sort of ridiculous 'cause we have now are going on in the border\nUm the\nI think the concern that everyone has Denver is that okay there's twelve or Thirteen or fourteen thousand people we have to deal with it and\nUh everybody wants to be concerned everybody's concerned about the humanitarian aspect but a lot of my color here's what their concern was okay if\nThey get in if it's Fifteen thousand get then the next one's going to be a hundred and fifty thousand and you're not gonna be able to stop that either because we'll never get a wall up in time and even if you have a while to get a hundred and fifty thousand people have been a lot of people [noise] so um are you in favor of the president taking action\nNow to stop these uh that's a mob caravan from palm rushing the border and coming in are you in favor of\nStopping them from coming in now\nYes yes I mean it's it's I mean this is a matter of national security or it is a matter of precedent um and again this comes back to that was a normal American will say hey you know we understand people want to come to the United states but there's a legal process [noise] um and we're going to have to\nWe're going to have to follow that legal process you know we we think that legal process used to be applied all immigrants and you and you're exactly right John this would set a precedent that could really be damaging to the United states' security to our\nPolicies into our rule of law or you're right if the if we just about everybody in we're actually sort of acknowledging that open borders is what we want if we don't follow the rule of law and we don't stop the\nEase of migrants sadly we we have to stop them from coming in and set a precedent Denver\nA in about five or ten minutes the U.S government is going to release the new economic numbers or GDP expected to grow again this quarter at\nSo over four percent could these four point one or four points in Fort Wayne three a bomb autonomy was jumping along in about a half percent growth I mean this growth unprecedented where do you look for in that report in ... which can close and you think you might throw out of it on the economy gender recover\nWell the thing at first I'm going to look for [laughter] and it's just because I'm\nA geek out on the stuff is I'm going to look at the specific whatever report that I have I'm going to look at the number of jobs are based on that are open right now and I look at Virginia but I also see where we are going as far as unemployment but GDP Growth I'm going to look at manufacturing them look at agriculture\nI Love looking into the numbers and see where that growth enters and if we're continuing on this line John if we're continuing with the lowest unemployment claims and forty nine years\nPercent of every quarter which you know is amazing a it's a new normal was too I mean this is pretty incredible\nOr if you're looking at all these numbers I think right now what you're seeing is that the tax cuts were other jobs reform act worse opportunities zones can be LeBron's here in the in the commonwealth\nA ... and opportunities on investment all the things that we look at to encourage opt entrepreneurship to encourage people keeping their own money is working and that's where I'm going to look at it this report is is this just a continuation of this amazing amazing surge\nOr are we seeing and even more positive future for the people know if the district but also in the United states in the commonwealth of Virginia I think we are I think we're just seeing the beginning of this economic boom and um I I'm\nReally just really excited to see what those numbers say based on more job growth and what sectors are growing right now\nWhat kind of interesting to see these are coming out momentarily we expect that oh we're going to get over four percent growth and it's really really tough for a Democrat right now to talk about economics the economy or any of the issues that pertain to job and prosperity in America so they'd rather talk about something else that's why your opponent\nLovely coal burning talking about your Halloween costume\n'cause he doesn't want to talk about the economy\nShe doesn't want to talk about job she doesn't want to talk about growth didn't want to talk about kids moving on to the basement she doesn't want to talk about the boom and small businesses just want to talk about the deregulation she doesn't want to talk about the number of investments that are going on because of the tax\nCuts especially as it relates to one hundred percent deduction of\nCapital investments you didn't even understand that and so she doesn't want to do with any any of that she'd rather talk about your Halloween costume in two thousand five\nYeah and I mean which I Will not take down off the net by the way so here's what you would rather talk about she'd rather talk about forty million dollars in spending not only for Medicare for all but also for forgetting student debt right which is one point for a trillion dollars right now free community college for all are free college for all\nEverything she said and even in the bay she's like I Want to give away this she doesn't understand the taxpayer money is what you're using I get so limited\nBased on what I fought for you know in government overreach she says she loves government I fear government I think government should be limited I think government should be a fish and she's also served a taxpayer money for the middle class is nothing more than confetti she compared eyes to the Nazis\nI mean I I find the stunning John did anybody would vote for Leslie\nHer views are great for San Francisco and maybe a three square mile area there or somewhere up in Georgetown right in DC\nBut for the fifth district it's absolutely appalling\nThat she thinks these values are actually a political ball to the people the fence about every day and work for a living and don't give a rat's with the chattering class is saying on CNN or MSNBC or any of these other far left and they are now\nThey're just they're just propaganda machines and I think at some point ah that's going to break through that you have comments you have this coalition of common sense\nAgainst progress of candor is and I think that's what's happening in the fifth district and we're going to win this John because I represent American values I represent conservative values but\nDenver Riggleman\n[noise]\nDenver for Congress [noise]\nNope nope just ever\nShore positive no

fake polled coming at you all over the place they make these pulled up to drive a fake narrative don't believe them it's the same thing they did the two thousand sixteen they're doubling down they one of the press\nI just I I don't know if there's some crazy person doing it but it just seems awfully odd to me here's\nThe thing is the Democrats the Schumer is the the the whole crowd\nThat whole mob over there they were screaming we must have the FBI investigate before we can vote on Kavanaugh there must be a full investigation before we can vote on him before we can decide whether he should uh be you know the sense of the Supreme Court right\nThe same object saying we must have an FBI investigation before we can let that happen [noise]\nThey're not even waiting for the FBI to investigate where the bombs are coming from before they start blaming President Trump declared President Trump guilty responsible for the whole thing they're not waiting for the FBI to investigate these are the same people that three weeks ago\nSaid we cannot do anything until the FBI finishes its investigation\nSo I mean they were total hypocrites it it is absolutely irresponsible or beyond counterproductive it's it's absolutely you're responsible for them to be saying this is all about because of the President Trump or they're they're trying to they're they're trying to score political points off this which\nYou have to ask who benefits from these bombs that's all I'm not saying\nSane person sends bombs or fake bombs through the mail we don't know the bombs were real are fake or\nThey emptied out some firecrackers put it in a in a in the toilet paper two and a attached to a digital watch to it to make it look like a scary thing we don't know it's Halloween time it's easy to scare people what can I tell you\nWe don't know and I'm not going to go down that road what I can say is whoever did it is crazy in one way or another whether they're sort of fire bleed can be committed to an institution crazy or just that they've got a screw loose you don't do that kind of normal people\nWell adjusted people don't do that okay by definition\nPat Buchanan has a column out today very makes the point that when John Kennedy was assassinated Lee Harvey Oswald who defected to the Soviet Union was pro Cuba\nUh he was found to be the shooter a yet who got blamed for the John birth society and all the conservatives so\nThis is not the first time that the guilt by association or let's let's let's slammed the conservatives what's blame everything on conservatives not the first time it's been done before we even know who actually sent these packages so\nIt's a everybody's got to calm down take a breath and I think Sarah Sanders had it right we should be coming together the president is calling for unity dialing down the rhetoric\nAnd the Democrats are going in the opposite direction they're they're they're blaming the president unequivocally no question about it taking no responsibility whatsoever\nFor calling the guy look at this guy Brennan the president's guilty of treason what's the what's the penalty for treason death is basically a former\nHead of the CIA had been out they're calling for the president to be hung by the neck until dad and this is not considered inflammatory rhetoric\nI it's it it's disgusting the whole thing and it's just just hypocritical each people will go down as the all time greatest hypocrites\nOr something a Curtis I I think you make a great analogy on the depression that of the Democrats to crying and screaming and whine about cabinet\nGetting the FBI not investigating everything I mean why don't we just wait here I mean the FBI seems to be home again and southern part of the guy to come up with a report from so we're we're going to find out the answer it why not just wait\nExactly how 'bout everybody say calm down let's we got we we have the FBI on the case unless this guy was a or gal or or or bought or whatever [laughter] whatever entity it was they created these packages unless that\nEntity was a very very very sophisticated person\nOr a vote by it and if they were very spit stated they were able to cover their tracks\nTo these various places coming out of one place there are a lot of clues there and I'm confident that the FBI will be able to figure something out here and find out who did it or narrow it down\nThe fact that they use Debbie Wasserman Schultz as a return address that's kind of interesting in itself Debbie Wasserman Schultz is the one who was forced to step down\nFrom head of the Democratic National Committee\nOr because she had been rigging the system for Hillary against Bernie I don't know what that means but it's sort of an interesting clue you know maybe somebody thought that was funny to use her name out all these bombs [noise] I don't know\nUh but my corners this unless this was a very sophisticated operations that they knew how to cover their tracks at every step of the way you've got twelve packages now\nThat the FBI is investigating it let's wait for the FBI to figure this out to come up with something yeah why not wait before you start\nA and and why not why are they not waiting because they want to politicize it the the Democrats are missing no opportunity to score political points on this\nWell it's a ... it seems it just seems odd to me that at all this is happening but let's wait I mean that's where everybody's saying let's wait anytime let's get to let's get the economy will get to the Taliban invasion after the bottom of the hour a\nBut let's get to the new economic numbers that just came out the gross domestic product GDP growing another three and a half percent now let me just say what this means right this is the first time that we have had\nBack to back quarter a in a very long time a host of over three and a half percent growth back to back and consumer confidence uh up at an all time I can do for spending with them ... percent another great a\nQuarter of economic growth this is more bad news for the dams they don't want to talk about this that they don't talk about the economy or jobs or the gross so what did they talk about\nAre they talking well they talk about they've got this wonderful thing to talk about this horrible thing to talk about here with the with the bombs and they talk about the president to eat again they're falling in they don't realize they're falling into a trap and and it's their own tribal traveled around making\nPeople don't want to hear the Democrats talk about the president they want to hear Democrats Republicans the politicians in Washington talk about what they're what the politicians are going to do for them to make their life better write\nWhat I I I go to work every day I got a family to support I got a job I'd like to get a raise what are you going to do to make that happen how are we going to make my life better easier make me rich uh make make make my kids you know healthier talking about President Trump\n[laughter] do the jogging\nAbout President Trump causing the bomb scare\nDoesn't do that so and they're going back to the for the last two years old I've been talking about as President Trump is a Russian agent and now they're President Trump is a Russian agent who creates bomb scares I mean they're they're they're not doing themselves any favors\nAnd on the other side I mean it burns very clear jobs not mobs President Trump and the Trump Administration\nHave created the best economic conditions in this country in in a generation the best we've seen in ten Twenty years\nAnd that goes along the way that\nAnswers peoples' questions what have you done for me lately we've gotten me a job you've gotten me a raise you've gotten my kids on food stamps gotten my kids out of the basement there on their own now great thank you very much\nSomething I'm going to pose questions to answer it when it gets back so stay with us for another segment at the bottom of the hour but\nWhen you get back you know you and I were Trump Tower for the last two weeks and they don't feel the same like deja vu all over again I mean [laughter] I mean\nI could shut my eyes and go back to two thousand sixteen and it's the same thing we're always think told everybody to Trump credit when it was all it was all you know whatever it was that he was going through what the time with the Access Hollywood stay with us that we're going\nThese are the people coming out of the woodwork coming out of the hills coming out of the bally's coming out of the town is coming out of the farms coming to vote for Trump they've never voted before\nAnd uh so yeah there is a feeling of days I moved here all of these national generic ballot polls are meaningless national election\nThere are all things I mean it's all the calls I I've been talking all day about\nThe Washington Post poll that came out yesterday that shows Jennifer Wexton I had a barber cops are\nUrging his tense district by searching and look like there might when she should be the favorite no doubt that's a very tough for a district that Republicans the barbecue\nEvery internal poll that the Republicans have from the White House to the end or the scene to Barbara on down shows the right stuff like that that have a Thirteen point but this is what the Washington Post jobs they get a\nUh they get a ridiculous methodology to get a state polls get effect analysis of it did you fake news to get a fake conclusion\nDrawn so they could continue on with their fake narrative and like we've only been down this path so now I'm going to start calling them on\nAm your Godzilla of the truth in America where eleven\nDays out to the biggest midterm election ever Curtis Ellis is with us he's a senior policy adviser for America first policies this segment brought you buy the job creators network you know folks I sang it this is about turnout and\nCurtis just at the same thing the upcoming
