no further business to [noise]\nFront center on my bookshelf is a great book you've got to read it you get\nAmazon or anything else just by China Peter Navarro\nHill lay the whole thing out and he's joining us now why from the White House Peter Navarro senior economic policy advisor to the president and a sister to the president's for trade and manufacturing Peter you're my hero it's great to have you on that\n[noise] that I appreciate the cranes my friend but you're you're doing the work out there getting the message out and the message this week was basically a great detail\nBecause he actually keep the promises\nThat he makes what a concept for a politician and he promised back in June and twenty six he would renegotiate or that NAFTA deal NAFTA is now dead now have the U.S Mexico candidate agreement and it's great news ah for workers and manufacturing industries as well as farmers\nAnd innovators and when we go through some of the some of the elements of it if you want but\nYes ... is great for America\n[noise] let me start with that I Want to get to the elements and as you know you know as well because you talk to many times I've\nHated Nasser from day one I was one of the only Republicans rarely in opposition to it when it first came out and\nI always said that Ross Perot at the end of the day he was corking but he had that sucking Saudi that nailed that's exactly what happened so I never thought it was he the day we would go and so to me Sunday night was like Christmas but\nI Would say that the un on Wednesday so I just want you to spend two minutes on this and then when you get to the specifics of the deal I was in New York on Wednesday was at the president's alive\nPress conference and it was fascinating because somebody asked him about his negotiations there with Canada\nAnd one of the questions was prime minister Trudeau asked for your turn it down is that true and he said absolutely and then he said not only did I turn the meaning down I've instructed might trade team just stop negotiating with Canada\nThey're not negotiating it's good to say I don't appreciate how they're going about this they don't understand\nThe stakes here and so I've told them we're going to go with Mexico and maybe they'll come back to the table some other time but I stopped negotiating with them where John that was Wednesday Sunday night you get a deal what happened\nNo one Ninety nine percent of the deal was done based on a framework weighed down with uh the Mexico deal member um some weeks ago we entered into a bilateral with Mexico and that he had all the high notes\nHit sample or in the manufacturing space a strong domestic content and the cars we build running it hit\nMarket access for agricultural products hit hit the notes for protecting digital trade and so called biologics which are pharmaceuticals [noise]\nUh at at the modern end of the spectrum that we reduce still a little a little part on a couple of things like dairy and some dispute resolution mechanisms\nAre and I said this on the air on TV and radio yeah I was puzzled why was taken so long to get too I'm In agreement that really benefited all three countries so I mean at the end of the day like in this to a boxing match were were a lot of punches I get thrown but at the\nMatches over now\nThat that abomination that they signed in Nineteen Ninety four for NAFTA [noise] um this is actually good for America what a concept\nI Know right where with Peter and if it is I mean\nI'm telling you you know this better than I Am in NAFTA was a bad deal for America America\nChina getting into the WTO and two thousand and one which was pushed by by Clinton in Congress bad deal for America twenty twelve South Korean deal I mean we lost over a hundred thousand jobs from Maryland the auto industry that deal for America I mean for the president's line in these things up a like a the\nPins in a bowling alley and knock them down and it's beautiful thing to watch\nIt really is where when Peter Navarro he's assistant to president for trade in manufacturing and West Wing he's also a senior economic policy adviser\nPeter Navarro let's get to some of the tea items in this new deal the U.S MCA U.S Mexico Canada or some of the differences some changes if you could go through some of the things that would be great\nSure let's start with the easy stuff which is the modernization of agreement back in Nineteen Ninety four there were some things that didn't exist and therefore did eat a provisions are one of them obviously is digital training which is the protection\nOf of copyright Perino actual property to transfer to do within that something as simple as a\nAs an electronic book you might might buy and read have strong provisions for that there's a there's these things called biologics which is a reference to a gig complicated ah pharmaceuticals are that are very research intensive that are designed\nA overtime to cure things like cancer rheumatoid arthritis or whatever and uh we got a strong\nProtections for that up to ten years why is that important is because unless companies have protection or so that they can make some money on these things over a period of time or they won't put in the money for the research and development so so that's that's all good\nAh so so innovators of taking care\nOf a digital trays taking care of now\nUm another a small but important thing relatives the scope of the whole deal uh we were able to resolve some of the dairy issues with Canada and so uh that's good news will have much more market access there as well as for other\nTypes of products like chicken and egg things like that so that's good for me as a director of the office of trade manufacturing policy or the the the big white whale here that we actually got was a\nBringing back the supply chain to North America particularly for the auto industry with NAFTA did in Nineteen Ninety four is create a set of incentives to\nOffshore our auto parts industry in turn or vertically integrated manufacturing auto plants\nHere in the U.S it happened in Canada and Mexico as well so the key provision is Seventy five percent of the of any car that that are made has\nTo have a a\nA U.S part Seventy five percent and then to ensure that the u._s. gets its fair share of that regional content uh there's a strong provision for labor in their strong provision for the environment so you can't have sweatshops and pollution have in South of our border grabbing that business\nSo that's kind of dramatically change\nThe structure and supply chain of the global auto industry in a way where we as as a do or just purchaser a vehicle or per capita a will benefit from that so that that's that's that's the big deal it's it's great news for this country\nAnd you didn't have or or they're also sings cards that were discouraged China for instance\nFrom jumping into Canada\nAnd then bringing them into the U.S by a third party which have been great\nAnd it's the question yeah yes there are a and um we were written these enhanced border for a review and things like that but there's also a couple of provisions in there which which are going to be part of any agreement that we sign that\nThat are directly ah aimed at\nThe unfair trade practices that China for example there's in the jargon they called disciplines they call the disciplines on state owned enterprises being able to enter\nEnter the zone and uh China's you kind of the leading purveyor of state owned enterprises that engage unfair trade practices but he's also a provision in there for currency manipulation a and again there's a lot of countries out there\nThat purposely undervalue their currency is way of boosting their exports discouraging our exports\nTo them and trade deficit so if you look at this thing at this agreement um we see it uh both as a great deal\nIn and of itself but we also see it as the most sophisticated cutting edge template for future agreements in by the way I'd bury the lead here it is the largest at one point two trillion dollars it's the largest trade deal the U.S has ever entered into and the fact that it's a good deal for America\nHas the ability to have to beat you know\nThroughout the district north center at a district middle the district in southern portion of the districts that are under vigils would be able to attend on and and that was something that was a priority because now are the first in as of right now the only they very northern part of the district which I print\nPlace has a pretty significant burning on anyone coming from the southern portion district to read in the center of the district to get to the colpepper particularly given the time of the\nDebate well might not know the guy the tickets for that one they sold out within less than men [noise] [noise] right on and there's many many individuals have reached out to our campaign saying that they tried to get tickets but were unable to do so\nWell and my the big which was the third debate\nGotten a date from David team\nThe standard his name I just want to mention has said that um they said that they they have they've given me a bunch of ... to go back to the team\nWith we've not been able to get that done either hopefully we'll get that done in the next week or so okay let's get the judge Kavanaugh you're on the

in that Saturday's big vote a judge Kavanaugh the white out saying well we went through this report and I guess what nothing no ... he was free and clear that's what the White House saying but until the center get a chance to look at it\nWe're going to hold judgment metro coming up in a few moments the segment brought you by our friends that job creators network\nYou know I tell you what this off year elections these midterms are the most critical of the nation's history\nAnd you know and I know that these midterms in off year elections are about one thing you know what it is\nI mean they'll go after everybody because let's go have a proven model just just just just credit blast you know pick things up just somebody that she's making uncorroborated then substantiate are claiming you're done\nEventually you're going to roll through people look look at CNN they've had a number\nTrump surrogate son every single one of them gets\nThe Paris for the other day did this I mean eventually CNN is not going to have a single person to come on to represent Trump because they just take them they just take them out one by one and so I mean it's crazy\nIs literally need the opposition party they the ... the opposition ... I mean the media part of the Democratic party air wing of the Democratic party that's what they are\nInterested in telling the truth then this whole New York times story on this or Pakistan that we saw some unremarkable within the demonstrators that President Trump's falls bill was\nHis first he didn't come up with some crazy things as a break the law on taxes or anything like that they demonstrated they follow the law this whole thing with the media ... it's just another one thing after another after another after another\nBut it gets it's nonstop when they report this stuff about what President Trump is actually gone through your car or anything\nAnd I I I don't think they're going to do that where do they report stuff on the successes edition instructions happy they are interested in doing that and the reason being is that they're using the power of their media platforms to push their agenda the difference between having us\nThough is is that we didn't seem to embrace apart by the way brain like this we have a point of view were very open about it though that's the\nDifference between Russia and CNN or us in the New York times or the Washington Post they will lie to you they claim that their objective they're not\nThey push for a certain point of view and that's fine they have every right to do that okay they're private companies just like we were on but we are honest with our audience we tell our audience were would point of view are coming from they know what they're getting when we're talking to them and I think the fact that he's me or companies are\nLying to the people or to their audiences is disgusting and despicable and I ... I I think it's the biggest why in the last forty years in in the American media or that they claim to be objective because no person\nIn this country can be addressed you you just can't every decision that you may hear from what had mine to use to who you interviewed what stories you cover so which one do you do and so on and so forth all play into a all play into\nEverything has the opportunity for the instruction of by rate like instill a everything every decision you make is informed by your beliefs and so as you're making these decisions\nOn a you can be honest with your audience about what it is that you believe is so that\nThey know what they're getting when they get there and then you can still tell the truth you still have\nAccess accuracy rate but the point is is that the all of these media outlets claimed to be objective including giving you the truth but they're now they're\nComing from a perspective where they're all trying to take down Trump and that's their choice they can they can put forward that point of view as much as they want you know that's their their company\nHonest with honesty is the best policy twenty three pounds on the John Silver's radio network where when Matt boiling political editor of Breitbart News joining miss Breitbart News just download the app Breitbart News and then you get to go So Matt\nThese midterms coming up if Kavanaugh against confirmed on ... on a Saturday and I and I think you will uh we've just got a new generic poll coming out by quarter pack and it shows that\nThe enthusiasm gap that the Democrats enjoy plus sixteen has been taught to plus four weeks that the generic ballot a\nCongressional house ballot was Democrats plus for gene three weeks ago that's cut in half plus seven is there a comeback in the making for Republicans I think\nThey're at and by the way there is a ... hour from NPR News new PBS out yesterday that I think it was something like back in the summer it was the Democrats had a ... point\nA I'm a enthusiasm gap a advantage now\nThat now it's it's good statistically tied to only to point advantage to the point is that we're seeing lots of evidence uh and and we're also seeing it in particular race is right like so in North Dakota it looks like Heidi Heitkamp isn't coming back to Washington okay there's been now to pause there was one poll the other day or that had are down\n... points there's a poll that came out last night that are down ... points to Republican Kevin Cramer we're seeing a\nIn ... in Tennessee Marsha Blackburn is now pulling away the latest poll last night from Fox News had Marsha Blackburn pulling five\nPoints ahead or we're seeing Senate race Senate race the Republicans are gaining Louis Josh Hawley tied up with Claire McCaskill in Missouri and we're seeing Mike Braun tied with a Joe Donnelly in Indiana we're seeing Matt Rosendale hybrids Jon Tester in Montana\nSo if these were ... I think what will happen and there's plenty of other ones across the country as well the printing is is that when judge Kavanaugh is confirmed to the United States Supreme court it's going to\nA in a way that we haven't seen even in this\nLatest energy on the Republican side it's going to electrify the nation\nSo much so that all of these guys are going to start turning into five point Republican linked right like I think you're going to start seeing the energy on the G O P side uh um\n[noise] just electrified after a after drought a judge Kavanaugh gets confirmed people it's going to fire people up and it's going to deflate for Democrats base\nI don't think she gets the Trump base fired up which I'm very familiar because that's the case of my listeners there's nothing I could have done there's nothing that there's no big enough rally the president could have had there's nothing his campaign team could have done to lie\nSo many people just watched that it's an absolute horror and disbelieve the shenanigans in the clowns show that went on in the Democratic districts many I think it's fired people up and you're right you know there's there's one poll before this started high camp was what you were saying that she was like tied down by one and it was like it was\nThat she was only down by like a couple of points now is right now it's down ten to twelve\nYes every poll she's down by twelve she's done or she is going to get reelected mansion was way ahead ride was up by twelve Fifteen now is that like three and ... more she's going to beat him I don't care what man should does because Trump voters have been fired up so there's only one that they're going to win North Carolina\nThey're going to be Donnelly and they're going to be dominant in Indiana\nTo going to beat me ... [noise] she's going to lose a the astronaut in Florida he's going to lose I could see the Republicans if Kavanaugh wins Matt I can see the pick it up five seats or even six in the Senate fibers me either\nThe way the map works right now Republicans could come out the other end with anywhere from I think fifty four to seven seats in the U.S Senate or depending on how things go they've got a whole four seats so they've got to hold Nevada Arizona Tennessee in Texas\nAnd I think they're going to do that yet and then I think and and then they have\nThen there's a bunch of other seats that are in play like a sack Indiana or a Missouri Montana\nA West Virginia or Florida or North Dakota are and and several others on the on the map as well in fact you in New Jersey isn't why are we number of all the New Jersey Senate race in the ... in fact there was one yesterday that had our Menendez the Democrat\nOnly up one point I so the fact is is that there's an Ohio is on the map or ... or Michigan or Wisconsin there's plenty of opportunities for Republicans I and they could conceivably get into the high if they if they play their cards right here\nIf a if I get from Saturday the Republicans can pick up six seats and run the table I'm never can look up from New Jersey I I don't believe in the polls there and that that's going to win the Democrats are always went there\nBut you know maybe I'll be shocked but I think I think they're going to run the table and everything else and it's going to be a fun night but he's got to get tougher because if he's not be the opposite if he's not good for\nEverybody that I have talked to my show says there they're going to be really pissed and dampen the Trump voter enthusiasm so there's a lot of states boil always good to have you man\nAnd get your perspective you can follow Matt or just go to Breitbart News and that's the after you want to download their that for every day just pop that on and get all the top story there and they have opinion that prospect of\nNews or go to Breitbart dot com Matt\nI got thrown out of a tournament one time as a junior in the first game so I ...
