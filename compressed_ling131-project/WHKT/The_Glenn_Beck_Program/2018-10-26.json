it's taking Halloween pictures from my Facebook now\nShe's doubled down you know now it's not big but it's you know that they're trying to portray me as crazy based on I guess Halloween costumes and you know me John I have a good time so if they it's just it's amazing that last week she pretty much apologizes for marginalizing veterans says she's going to stick to issues\nThen she puts out a commercial or calling me an extremist and trying to make fabricated things up again this is what the left does their own hands is desperate ploy by desperate candidates and\nThat's why common sense back that's why conservatism is back and that's why I'm going to win the theft\nCommon sense back and I'm your commander of commonsense Dennis Rodman with us running for Congress if district Virginia let's get through the caravan I'm the president with my later today saying you've got to deploy a thousand troops you go\nTo a series of executive orders that would stop the Taliban from coming into the United states the problem is as soon as they stepped foot and say the word asylum we can't do anything or ... wars and the loopholes in Denver are written in such a way\nThat all they have to do is get a toe in get their\nHand grabbed and say asylum and that we can't do anything they cannot go back what are you seeing the president's proposed action here if you were in Congress\nNow what we're Denver Riggleman the proposing on this terrible it\nWas you know where a rule of law and ah we're we're we're a nation\nOf laws and we believe in the rule of law and the way the laws were written right now you're exactly right John I don't know you know how we we don't honor that based on what we believe us conservatives in rural and and people who follow the rule of law however\nI think Congress needs to start fixing these immigration laws as soon as possible and I also believe once that happens are vetting process for any of these people that are coming through has to be extreme vetting\nUh we do have some of the technology in place now but we don't put time limits on this if there's that many people are that are headed towards the border or we don't know what's in better than those in John my biggest fear um it's easy you know it's like a Trojan Horse right listen Ninety five percent Ninety nine percent of those\nPeople could actually be seeking asylum um those that you know our hearts sort of go out to ... with compassion however\nIf you have people inside there that are bad actors and they're able to hide you know within this caravan we have to a fair amount and my guess is is we're going to be sending some pretty healthy intelligence assets down range I think we're going to be monitoring and my guess is I can only speculate right now my guess is why I joined operation\nThey're talking about radio emissions or any kind of been told that we can blame this is not a good situation this is not good and at some point I think we have to fix or immigration laws in a way that again are\nMuch more common sense than the sort of sort of ridiculous since we have now are going on on the border\nUm uh\nThe I think the concern that everyone has ever is that\nOkay there's twelve or Thirteen or fourteen thousand people we have to deal with it and uh\nEverybody wants to be concerned everybody's concerned about the humanitarian aspect but a lot of my course here's what their concern was okay if\nThey get in if it's Fifteen thousand gets then the next one is going to be a hundred and fifty thousand and you're not going to be able to stop that either of because we'll never get a wall up in time and even if you have a war going to hundred fifty thousand people have been a lot of people so um are you in favor of the president taking action\nNow stop these uh this a mob caravan from former rushing the border and coming in are you in favor of stopping them from coming in now\nYes yes I mean it's this is what I mean this is a matter of national security or it is a matter of precedent um and again this comes back to it was at a normal American will say hey you know we understand people want to come to the United states but there is a legal process um and we're gonna have\nTo we're going to have the legal process you know we we think that legal process used to be applied all immigrants and you and you're exactly right John this would set a precedent that could really be damaging to the United states' security to our policies into our rule of law or you're right if the if we just allow everybody in we're actually\nSort of acknowledging that open borders is what we want if we don't follow the rule of law and we don't stop these\nThese migrants sadly we we have to stop all now from coming in and set a precedent river\nIn about five or ten minutes the U.S government is going to release the new economic numbers or GDP expected to grow again and this quarter at so over four percent could be four point one four points to four points rate Obama's\nTiming was trucking along in about a half percent growth I think that's gross unprecedented where do you look for in that report in ... which inclusions you think you might draw out of it on the economy general recommend\nWell the thing I first I'm going to look for [laughter] it's just because I'm a geek out on the stuff is I'm going to look at the specific whatever report that I have I'm going to look at the number of jobs are based on that are open right now and I look at Virginia but I also see where we're going as far as employment but GDP gross I'm going to look at manufacturing I'm looking at agriculture\nI Love looking into the numbers and see where that growth is and if we're continuing on this line John if we're continuing with the lowest unemployment claims and forty nine years apart continuing Los minority unemployment or for continuing which he grows four percent of every quarter which you know is amazing a\nIt's a new normal was too I mean is pretty incredible or if you're looking at all these numbers\nOpportunities zones can be LeBron's here in the in the commonwealth a ... and opportunities\nOn investment all the things that we look at to encourage opt entrepreneurship to encourage people keeping their own money is working and that's what I'm going to look at it this record is is this just a continuation of this amazing amazing surge or are we seeing an even more positive future for the people enough that district but also in the United\nStates and then the commonwealth of Virginia I think we are I think we're just seeing the beginning of this economic boom and um I I'm\nReally just really excited to see what those numbers say based on what job growth and what sectors are growing right now\nWhat kind of interesting to see these are coming out momentarily we expect that that we're going to get over four percent growth and it's really really tough for a Democrat right now to talk about economics the economy or any of the issues that pertain to jobs and prosperity in America so they'd rather talk about something else that's why your opponent\nLeslie Coburn is talking about your Halloween costume 'cause he doesn't want to talk about the economy she doesn't want to talk about job she doesn't want to talk about growth doesn't want to talk about kids moving on to the basement she doesn't want to talk about the boom and small businesses\nAnd she doesn't want to talk about the deregulation she doesn't want to talk about the number of investments that are going on because of the tax cuts especially as\nIt relates to one hundred percent deduction of capital investments Rob doesn't even understand it and so she doesn't want any ... any of that she'd rather talk about your Halloween\nCostume in two thousand five\nYeah and I mean which I Will not take down often that by the way so here's what she would rather talk\nAbout she'd rather talk about forty million dollars in spending not only for Medicare for all but also for forgetting student debt right which is one point for a trillion dollars right now free community college for our free college for all everything she had an even a debate she's like I Want to give away this\nShe doesn't understand the taxpayer money is what you're using and I get so limited based on what I thought for you know in government overreach she says she loves government I fear government I think government should be limited I think government should be a fish and\nHe's also said the taxpayer money for the middle class is nothing more than confetti she's compared\nIce to the Nazis I mean I I find it's stunning John did anybody would vote for Leslie her views are great for San Francisco and maybe a three square mile area there or somewhere up in Georgetown\nRight in DC but for the fifth district it's absolutely appalling that she thinks he's values are actually a political ball to the people the fair it's not every day and work for a living and don't give a rat's\nWith the chattering class is saying on CNN or MSNBC or any of these other far left and they are now they're just they're just propaganda machines\nAnd I think at some point ah that's going to break through that you have comments you have this coalition of common sense against progressive ... and I think that's what's happening in the fifth district and we're going to win this John because I represent American values I represent conservative values but I represent what the fifth one wants to do right now and that's why we're\nGoing to win this\nDenver Riggleman I Want to thank you for being with us what's your website\nA stepper for Congress dot com and uh it\n[noise]\nI don't know\n\n\nIt when for the Democrats now is slipping

to scare people what can I tell you\nWe don't know and I'm not going to go down that road where I can say is whoever did it it's crazy in one way or another whether they're sort of fire bleed can be committed to an institution crazy or just that they've got a screw loose you don't do that\nDefinition Pat Buchanan has a column out today very makes the point that when John Kennedy was assassinated Lee Harvey Oswald who defected to the Soviet Union was pro Cuba\nUh he was found to be the shooter or yet who got blamed for the John birth society and all the conservatives so this is not the first time that the guilt by association\nOr let's let's let's slammed the conservative what's blame everything on conservatives not the first time it's been done before we even know who actually\nSent these packages so\nIt's a everybody's got to calm down take a breath and uh I think Sarah Sanders had it right we should be coming together the president is calling for unity dialing down the rhetoric\nOf and the Democrats are going in the opposite direction they're they're they're blaming the president unequivocally no question about it taking no responsibility whatsoever\nFor calling the guy look at this guy Brennan the president's guilty of treason what the what the penalty for treason death he's basically a former\nHead of the CIA had been out they're\nCalling for the president to be hung by the neck until dead and this is not considered inflammatory rhetoric or it's it it's disgusting the whole thing is just just hypocritical these people will go down as the all time greatest hypocrites\nJust ask you something a Curtis I I think you make a great analogy a question of the Democrats who cried and screamed and whine about cabinet\nNot getting the FBI not investigating everything I mean why don't we just waiting here I mean the FBI seems to be horn again in southern Florida that got to come up with a report pretty so we're we're we're going to find out the answer why don't you just wait\nRight exactly how about everybody say calm down let's we got we we have the FBI on the case unless this guy was a guy or gal or or or ... or whatever [laughter] whatever entity it was they created these packages\nUnless that entity was a very very very sophisticated person\nOr a boat and by it and if they were very sophisticated they were able to cover their tracks but considering the number of packages delivered to the various places coming out of one place\nThere are a lot of clues there and I'm confident that the FBI will be able to figure something out here and find out who did it or narrow it down\nAnd the fact that they use Debbie Wasserman Schultz as return address that kind of interesting in itself Debbie Wasserman Schultz is the one who was forced to step down\nFrom head of the Democratic National Committee a because she had been reading the system for Hillary against Bernie\nSomebody thought that was funny to use her name out all of these bombs I don't know uh but my point is is unless this was a very sophisticated operations that they knew a how to cover their tracks at every step of the way\nYou've got twelve packages now that the FBI is investigating it let's wait for the FBI to figure this out to come up with something yeah why not wait before you start\nA ... and why not why are they not waiting because they want to politicize it the Democrats are missing no opportunity to score political points on this\nWell it's uh it it seems that it it just seems odd to me that that all this is happening but let's wait I mean that's where everybody's saying let's wait meantime let's get to get the economy will get to the Taliban invasion after the bottom of the hour a\nBut let's get to the new economic numbers that just came out the gross domestic product GDP growing another three and a half percent now let me just say what this means right that's the first time that we have had\nBack to back quarters or in a very long time of of of over three and a half percent growth back to back\nAnd consumer confidence uh up at an all time high consumer spending was up ... percent another great a quarter of economic growth this\nIs more bad news for the damn thing I Want to talk about this that they don't want to talk about the economy or jobs or the growth so what did they talk about\nAre they talking well they talk about they've got this wonderful thing to talk about this horrible thing to talk about here with the with the bombs and they talk about the president again you know falling in they don't realize they're falling into a trap and and it's their own drop a trap of their own making\nPeople don't want to hear the Democrats talk about\nThe president they want to hear Democrats Republicans the politicians in Washington talk about what they're what the politicians are going to do for them to make their life better write what I I I go to work every day\nI got a family to support I got a job uh I'd like to get a raise what are you going to do to make that happen how are we going to make my life better easier make me rich uh make make make my kids you know healthier talking about President Trump talking about you're\nA Native American DNA doesn't do that [laughter]\nI wouldn't do that\nAbout President Trump are causing the bomb scare doesn't do that so and they are going back to the for the last two years old I've been talking about as President Trump is a Russian agent and now they're President Trump as a Russian agent who Craig creates bomb scares I mean\nThey're they're they're not doing themselves any favors\nA date and on the other side I mean it burns very clear jobs not mobs a President Trump from the Trump Administration have created the best\nThe best we've seen in ten Twenty years [noise] and that\nGoes along the way that answers peoples' questions what have you done for me lately you got me a job you've gotten your raise my kids on food stamps and my kids out of the basement there on their own now great thank you very much\nA question\nTo answer it when it gets back stay with us for another segment of the hour what a\nTrump Tower for the last job they almost like a job all over again I mean [laughter] I mean\nI could go back to the scene and it's the same thing you know everybody kind of when it was all it was all you know whatever it was that he was going through what the time with the Access Hollywood that we're going to be right back I'll go way\n\nIt is there is a feeling of days or move here all of these national generic ballot polls are meaningless because there's not a national election\nOr they're they're all like I mean it's all the calls I I've been talking all day about the Washington Post poll that came out yesterday that shows Jennifer ... and they had a Barbara Comstock\nUrging his tens district like Thirteen luck I watched it might when she should she is the favorite no doubt that's a very tough for district for the Republicans can win barbers\nEvery internal poll that the Republicans have from the White House city at our ceasing to Barbara down shows the race does not have a Thirteen point link\nBut this is what the Washington Post jobs they get a uh they get a ridiculous methodology to get our\nState polls get a fake analysis of it to use fake news to get a fake inclusion drawn so they can continue on with their fake narrative and like we've already been down this path so now I'm going to start calling them on how ridiculous that isn't their job right now it's the same\nNow just by the way you're on the John triggers radio network I Am your Godzilla of the truth in America were eleven days out to the biggest ... election ever Curtis Ellis is without seizing senior policy adviser for\nAmerica First policies this segment brought you buy the job creators network you know both sides are saying this is about turnout\nAnd Curtis just said the same thing the upcoming election of measurements may be the most important you've ever seen there's a lot of the ballots besides your candidate your tax cuts are on the ballot the American economy grew in another three and a half percent on the ballot or great comeback\nAre renaissance that's on the ballot too so Wallace on about your jobs are on the ballot your jobs I think just kinda moved out of the basement\nThe soldiers like me tax cuts uh yeah that's about it and here's the biggest issue on the ballot eleven days who's in charge of America's future politicians and the corrupt\nThe crabs and the deep state of Washington DC where are you know if you want to preserve the victories of the past\nTwo years I'm urging you've got\nTo get involved this November yeah I Know you've got to vote yes I Know you're going to do early voting I Know that I can count on you for that but you got to do more going to make a choice election\nDot com choice the elections out time they'll make it easier for you to get involved you can make calls you can send emails you can send text you can knock on doors\nYou're too shy to do that okay you can take a neighbor to the polls I don't have a car no problem you've got to make the coffee there's all kinds of things that you can do what you got to get involved think choice election dot com because the only way you lose the two thousand Eighteen is if you don't show up and you don't work if you turn\nOut and volunteer you're going to win a big choice you less what elections out every vote matters big choice elections that Tom junior part don't get out work by the other guys in on November ... quite a big choice elections outcome this message paid for unauthorized\nBy the job creators network we\nWant to work and one of our new listeners other brand new talk station in West Rick Richmond and groups were counting W. J. F. at one point five to ...\nStay with shorts at\nTalk show at talk all those things everybody's close in doubt we started with counter trends were the disruptor after me and Curtis kissing comes our wars the can't wait for that he's our ten minutes on Tuesday to party the fighting Joe ... show where with Curtis Ellis\nA senior advisor America for his policies Chris looks into the caravan\nSome kids with a caravan the marching home I Do but the bombings there they're going to bomb rushed the border it's a bummer I Want to say one more\nThing about the uh about the election before you just said it's about turnout\nAnd that's what this is all about you've got the polls you got all this nonsense colds have got this that\nIt's about identifying voters [noise] sometimes pockets of twenty five voters here that the voters they're\nSeventy five voters they're a hundred there distinct pockets of voters that are on our side in identifying them and getting them out to the polls that's what this was going to come down to that's what it's coming down to\nThe Republican National committee and the others are doing a great job of that and uh that's what's going to determine this as much as old as probably more than all the ads and everything else so I encourage everyone to go out and vote and bring your friends\nAnd if they're going to vote for the other side don't bring them home free let them out of their tires\nI don't know you can't I don't do that we don't do that and we don't do that\nBecause you're lucky if you if you have a democratic neighbor and they're going to vote the all the way down and they came to the polls who don't have a right\nYou got to memorize you know what we want every everybody that as an opportunity to go get him out\nAnd get him a cup of coffee because at the end of this they're still your neighbor\nThat threat neighbors are still Americans were in this together folks right here in this together\nAnd you know what you disagree and that's it and that you have to okay okay I can now\nThe caravan now that what the air out of the tires there that's a good idea but [laughter]\nNot a very different because that's an okay topic\nHow do we stop it don't let them in the country don't let them in the country bigger the game the ... they're trying to they're going to try to game the system\nOnce I set foot on American soil they claim asylum there they've all been taught to say the words credible fear they have credible fear credible fear what credible fear not getting a job credible fear of having to live off mangoes and bananas\nA rather than a food stamps and welfare\nA so once they get to the United states is set foot on American soil and say the words credible fear there then qualified for that triggers the whole asylum seeking procedure and once they're in ... in the silent seeking procedure\nAll of the interlocking court cases and ruins and judges by these deep state judges say you can't hold them you can't be paying them you have to release them and give them a date to appear and they never appear they disappear and they just disappear\nInto the woodwork they get hired by corrupt big business bosses want cheap labor\nThey get sheltered by a corrupt sentimental is who think oh the let's invite the entire world to live in America that's going to do everybody a great big favor and it just becomes a big mess so the way to stop those it's an outlet them into the United states in the first place to stop them at the border build the wall\nTo wall literally and figuratively President Trump is sending up to a thousand troops\nDeploying the military on the border or that's what the military is supposed to do defend our country and if we're going to defend the country in Afghanistan of the time of the country in Iraq and defend the country in Djibouti where we have troops\nHow about we defend the country in Tijuana in Mexico the Mexican border and in Texas\nThat's right in San Diego and everything else we need to build his wall and the president determined he says I'm going to stop this because I think the printing Curtis understands I'm almost out of time here but I think he understood understand that\nIt's Fifteen thousand today if they get and smart it's got to be a hundred and fifty thousand and then one twenty five million because this is one thing that you said\nTo me a while back that really ah was riveting and then I got to take off you said that you said\nThere's four billion people in the world that all want to come to the United states so you don't let them all in and then you don't have a country you have a land mass that's basically it all by the time on the thing is also with us\nWhatever twenty five FM our new talk station or Richmond coastline staying with us Joe coming up like joke right here on the job projects radio network your guts the truth in America\nAnd hey don't fully fake polls go out but John triggers I'll be right back\n\n\nWalk this thing is we use ... got to go and examine our here's some\nKind of like look at what route to see what you just\nEven if you think are afraid to take a shower\nThey connected on line and thank him wherever you go to get the free John rhetoric Joelle following their radios your farm rowing machine and I do [noise]\nHow did this in America we speak English attorney Tom if we traveled to poor countries unless we speak a common language it may be very difficult to communicate\nKnowing the language in court and we're trying to convey information or even have a casual conversation people understand each other
