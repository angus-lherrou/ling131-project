he may have been a victim of road killers as I said on Algeria yesterday\nObviously the president didn't get that from his own staff he got it from king Solomon\n\nIs inconceivable to me that\nMohammed bin Salman crown prince Mohammed bin Salman NBS did not know about this it is inconceivable that they would have set Fifteen operatives to stay on bowl and they had no idea why they were there there was no\nCommunication back to the authorities are in the government of Saudi Arabia now the new explanation seems intended to ease a political crisis for the Saudis and to diffuse

saying\nI'm Marcia pulling way ahead now in that race she is going to win that's going to be a whole remember tendency Corey Lewandowski was was one of those seats that the Republicans were that the Democrats were Charlie about that they thought they could pick up that is now not gonna happen Blackburn way way ahead what do you see there\n[noise] [laughter] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] Marsha

that the Republicans are going to hold a Arizona with mixed alley I don't even think that's going to be close\nOr when it's all said and done and I think we're going to we're going to win the lotto as I've been saying for some some time All right let's get to Montana Jon Tester are being challenged by Matt Rosendale a re public the real clear politics has\nThis about two or three within the margin

to west coast when it's going to [noise] Arizona and Montana to put exclamation point\nJon Tester become former U.S senator from Montana\nAnd looking at the new Republican pickup [noise] three weeks I'm\nJosh Hawley are probably the biggest surprise for Republicans some people not sure that he was going to be the best candidate he's turned out to be a very good candidate\nRemember Claire

never wrong on this stuff in Florida\nSmall lead we don't know what the hurricane impact has been this governor of Florida it's been Stiller with these hurricanes I mean he's got a rapid response team they get power on very quickly\nUm so we'll see how this plays out that they're devastating hurricane in Panama City but I thought from the beginning Scott what's going to win this race\nI think when I tell you what would be much stronger than I thought was going to I thought by now\nThree weeks ago Rick Scott the up four or five points and he'd be starting to pull this racist talking you know you can't estimate the impact of hurricane because the people's focus away rightly so from the elections but that said you've got to accept really well known individuals who both state\nWide experience I have high fever abilities people Florida and so this becomes battle I think Rick Scott is out but if you would have told me with dreaming Scott would have been down one or two points to the public I Would say\nNo to that close to tell you the type of campaign\nThat both Rick Scott is trying to run [noise] center now fighting for because he wants to return to the U.S [noise]\nAll right I mean I thought that this race would always be tied up until the end I think I think Scott ... wins he's been very popular governor\nAnd so I think he's he's got the there in the state of North Dakota Heidi Heitkamp down ten or Thirteen I think that's over\nThat reaches over congressman Kramer would be calling senator Kramer very soon [noise]\nOkay so that that gets us to\nIndiana Joe Donnelly a still clinging to a slight lead over a Mike Braun um I just don't see Indiana's returning Joe Donnelly in this climate that we have with the economy going so well I'm predicting that are Donnelly goes on him Mike Braun win that seat once they are you\nI agree with you and John look this is the vice president's home state he was out campaigning there this weekend he was there Saturday or friday and Saturday I as you know\nHis brother is on the ballot in Indiana is doing so helping Mike Brown for that Senate race this is a big focus of the administration because of the vice president's state the administration knows or they can beat Donald [noise] and so I think you see Brian come away\nTwo weeks and starting to open up his lead over sleepy Joe Donnelly\nOkay so I'm like well let's get the New Jersey I Know a couple about a month ago you said that might come into play I don't see it ... up by ten Fifteen now he's going to you\nKnow I saw some internal numbers yesterday I don't want to repeal but I'll tell you what if I was when I started the numbers but I guess I'd be scared to death you get this Republican candidate whose putting his own money into this race is giving a scare\n[noise] the resources the Democrats have to put into [noise] keep on going to drop resources away from elsewhere and I'm not sure whether you look for in a five point race right now it's causing quickly\nSo I don't think he's going to win so we can just a great on that only because I'm from New Jersey and I just can't see them beat him and then there's but let me ask you this in West Virginia I'm I'm I'm really shocked at this I thought Morsi would be in a much better position against Joe mansion\nAnd then he is now but the most recent surveys that have come out mansion are still holding an eight nine point lead in that state that does\nThe attorney general has any chance at older course\nWhat he does and part of the reason is because the Trump Pence ticket won that state by forty two points if any state\nThat is Trump country I think it's fair to say that's West Virginia [noise] and you see the amount of time that the president the vice president in that state campaigning I Believe they're going to be in that state how third congressional district that Senate race now every time the\nPresident or the vice president goes in that state numbers drop in about a month ago Mitch was sixty four percent the president's been different times of ice and now he's offering under fix that if the people of West Virginia they know Joe Manchin well\nThey have to

the storm [noise]\nYou know again and go on talking about power for a moment I mean it's usually in these storms in some lines are down you put them back up and you start to get power rolling in\nAnd

the Saudi constantly to stand bowl but you know come out now they say well maybe\nFor interrogation and ah but there's no official statement coming from king Salman who denies the whole thing and now the Saudis threatening that there's any sanctions or they're gonna retaliate disrupt the world's economy and shoot up oil prices ... what the hell is going on here\nWell this individual\nWho's not a journalist opinion piece drive a lot of the American he was a resident alien he's been caught up in the middle of a geopolitical competition between two Sunni nations\nWho want to dominate the Sunni Muslim world that turkey which is becoming a near walk them and that is the ... the prime you ever go on and Saudi Arabia where Islam was started in the second century of of this\nPerson has been caught in the middle of an individual who reports on true about what happened to him didn't deserve what happened to him but they very very character were very close ties to the Muslim Brotherhood even to the bin Laden family I'm going to individual who was the next few of the biggest um state of the twentieth\nCentury ... so it's it's basically an individual caught in the middle of a science teacher cuts competition\nSo the president sending a secretary of state Mike Pompeo a to Riyadh to try to get to the bottom of this find out what happened obviously\nThe Saudis the first day when they put out which was that this individual was there an hour got his people work in a department but they said the dog in the cameras or something they they couldn't produce the footage of that now they're changing\nTheir a story how does this affect the U.S relationship with the Saudis as it relates to Mohammed Mohammed Mohammed bin Salman\nWell when we were in the White House or we were very encouraged by the reforms MPs was an issue that we'd be always used the term behavior modification Saudi Arabia have been in bed with the wrong people for too long\nTeam members of the elite has been slumping in supporting a jihadi out the ideologues and see how they act around the world\nThat was going on a very very good point\nThere is not what we expect from a nation that says it's recording itself so it might come players hook up with the cooperative always closet Westport corporate director\nHe will get to the bottom of it and they report turned out to be true about what happened took a shock that it will be consequences for Saudi\nArabia definitely in the field or on a I'm a traitor if my expectation [noise]\nDo you think that this might affect the United states are backing of the

that will lessen the impact on the importance of these radical groups all talk about this is the second the second or third order effects\nAre most important of all being Iran so you know that there is the balance in the region but the constant competition between the Sunni Muslims and she has the most of those ... recall real we cannot have negative consequences from this brand making Iran stronger\nSo yours bonds name President Trump right now if you just turn the clock back and you're in the oval office what would be the device or\nYou would give to the president has this new information comes out and appears\nThat it appears that this guy was murdered or allegedly in constantly because as Marco Rubio just set on Fox and friends he came in he didn't come out so he is still there are he's dead there's only two really outcomes and that's\nWhat would your advice be to a Trump\nNow well I I'm not going to speculate what happened what happened right all the garbage that's been written will read the story or what I what I what I advise the president is that we we have to do more than we have to have supplied absolute fool disclosed that by the Saudi Arabia as to what happened and then once we have pulled disclosure\nWe will make the requisite system is is not a bomb the ministry\nOf your game plan the way right but we have to have full disclosure\nAnd then the president will will decide whether it's um trading whether it's the support we give economically to uh to Saudi Arabia that that will suffer or whether it was something else\nWhere did you think um when the president went to the un ah this this past two weeks ago at the annual meaning and he and he said to king Salman he's looking\nYou know this is all fine and they were friends and all but like you gotta start painting up for this defense we're giving you protection you're you're you're only paying three percent\nI Want that double your your uh your oil prices are too high a lot of people were outraged by that but uh and then to examine said well gee nobody ever asked me that then he said well I'm not going to do that\nHow does that all play out that\nWhat the president is a pragmatist and he's constantly asking that question this isn't just about Saudi Arabia about uh partners and friends and age with elsewhere and even in Europe\nYou have a very simple question why is it the companies that are incredibly wealthy need us to sub to subsidize that friends so it's a very reasonable question that we're going to keep on off because if you're one of the\nRichest countries in the world and you don't need to substitute something\n[noise] tell several Gorka about uh the new book that you have out why we fight why should people by that\nWell look it's it's a great read it's about all the threat three space if you want to understand\nAll of the dangers out there and how the president's going to feed them whether it's Russia China you know whether it's a North Korea whether it's with Iran than the book gives you that strategic analysis but more importantly I I've been to both the big picture stuff with the stories\nOf great American heroes going right back where he was opposed to war with the geography is going up through World War two with the marine corps electric shift the colder than Vietnam with capital red McDaniel spent six and a half years and the Hanoi Hilton the prisoner\nOf war never never ever losing faith in God or in the United states and the last lady in a in a in a in a in a free gift parallel to uh adjusted the capital that I hadn't planned my my last story is about um\nWicker chambers who was ... in Nineteen forty eight before capital was even born Americans to do with the truth in Congress and was attacked the Democrats tried to destroy them just to try to\nSports a capital also if you want to know what's going on in the world that you know the press or two about it and re instill in yourself you know space in the American way of life and the retail stores about great American heroes the why we fight is pretty\nSimple what we're seeing what was the famous book that was written on where the current chambers\nHis his autobiography witnesses Whitney really life changing book\nDo you know that that my ... my father who's long dead now he was just a blue collar worker but um I was in high school and that he used to be used to pay me to read to hook she bring them home when he\nCame on tenor yeah this is a true story give me five or ten dollars\nTo read it and that was one of the first one he brought home and that was the ten dollar bill because it was pretty big and then I Would read them and he would he would I say I'm done and they would give me ten dollars\nBut then like three days you'd asked me a question and I both have the answer that question [laughter] ten dollars but I've never had a big thick book and it was called witness\nAnd I was a sophomore and he said a high school he said you've you've got to read this is about what what one of ten or Fifteen at the time okay you've got to get there is a book by um by now but I just ordered that the other day why we fight\nBy Sebastian Gorka

get some answers about what happened to the Saudi embassy anti turkey\nYou know what happened who's to blame well I Know that's nothing happens in Saudi Arabia was in the U.S knowing it who's going to be a hate for thirty three year old crown prince who jumped him over other people and he's the son of existing king\nAnd I think he's on a in a bad track I can never do business with Saudi Arabia again until we get this behind that phrase and what does that mean that means I'm not going back to Saudi Arabia as long as this guy in charge so you're selling the crown prince has to leave their stuff to them but\nI'm not going to have been the biggest offender on the floor of the United States Senate this guy is a wrecking ball\nHe had this got murdered in that conflict in Turkey and to expect me to ignore it I feel used and abused I was on the floor every time defending Saudi Arabia because there is a good allies\nThere's a difference between the country and individual the NBS figure is Timmy toxic he can never be a world leader on the world and what we're trying to hang up to the ... but what I Would do I know what I'm gonna do sanctioned the hell out of Saudi Arabia [noise] you know\nWe deal with bad people all the time but this is in our face I feel personally offended\nThey had nothing but contempt for us would you put a guy like me and the president in this
