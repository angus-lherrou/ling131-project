positive as he raised a lot of issues that are alive today where where he raised the idea of the ...\nAnd and pro growth tax cuts medical savings accounts and term limits and\nYou really are quote carried that was really a a full runner of Donald Trump right now so uh uh a lot of the issues that he rents are alive today you know and very well and and I would serve our country well if they acted on those things\nAbsolutely John\nTell us about\nYour association I Know you're associate with the with a couple of things you associate with Steve Bannon packing told me that and then also job creators network um but tell me about what you see happening\nOut there you did a poll the other day saying things are changing because of the Kavanaugh situation can you share their audience John McLaughlin what that is\nSo are you sure what it is is is that um I think the whole cabinet situation was more than just the Supreme Court [noise] it was really a play or by Chuck Schumer and the Democrats to try to win the Senate\nAnd when you look at the field of of Senate seats that are above the thirty five Senate seats that are up this year\nTwenty six or in states that that uh uh are held by Democrats [noise] uh twenty six seats in the head of the seat of the Democratic seats are in states that Trump won by a\nWarning the twenty Fifteen presidential lectured some midterm elections are decided by people that are coming out that that may voted in the presidential but a lot of the people that vote in the presidential don't come out in the mid term so when Trump bringing our strategy was\nRound vote for him and so we got a hundred and thirty nine million voters which has nine million more than came out for Obama or Romney\nAnd those voters voted overwhelmingly for Trump particularly in the heartland of the country where there was a Sun Belt so the rust belt and in the mid term you only get about nine million people voting so it's the sixty three million voters who came out for Trump coming out more heavily\nIn the midterms the Democrats are going to lose a lot of things for the U.S Senate side think humor played gamble to try to suppress the Trump vote where if the Republicans get embarrassed\nAnd half the whole cabinet or or if the Republicans don't provide the votes he needs to get confirmed then the Trump voters will be mad at our own party and not so millions of Trump voters stayed home uh humor\nWould have plenty to win the Senate where he'd keep his Democratic seats and possibly win a Tennessee Nevada Arizona and become the new minority leader because the Democrats are really fighting hard to take over the house and make Nancy Pelosi the speaker and by the way that\nThe polling took her a whole lot of times with the tactile is a bipartisan projects a packet out there to project with the ban and where\nYou could see it in the numbers Nancy Pelosi still very unpopular September ... thirty percent favorable number ... year fifty five unfair to vote\nAnd the vast majority of voters don't want her to become the next speaker of the uh you know the Republicans whatever reasons aren't cleaning up the way they should I mean a lot of the house candidates will challenge Nancy Pelosi in a district but you really should have\nAnd you know when you think about it you should have a a a gender where she wants basically she wants to open borders she was she was increased taxes she wants to weaken security I mean everything stance towards the antithesis to the majority of voters right now and she is going to\nBe the face of the Democratic party if they take over the house if they take over the house Nancy Pelosi will be the most powerful Democrat in the country and in Washington [noise]\nSo that's what she said she said on numerous occasions that she's going to be the speaker and she said even the other day\nLet those people that are running as Democrats say what they want at the end of the day I'm going to be the speaker I have the votes in the caucus and it was like do you have to do to win but then I'm going to be your speaker words when John McLaughlin he CEO and\nJohn has worked professionally as a strategic consultant and pollster for over three decades about how long I Know John and he's worked on\nPresidential campaign starting with our favorite things for Fred Thompson and many many others so great to have what is he was also involved in the governor Nathan Deal campaign\nNumber two thousand ten and\nThat when I ran the beginning\nIn ... in the Atlanta\nThen and now he's doing work with pat you down with others to try to figure out what is going on in the midterms here John\nLet's get to let's get to the name of the house so based on the generic polling I when I\nPackage that was on a couple of weeks ago he told me something you said for the Democrats take control the house pat get outside the generic ballot\nHas to be a\nMinimum twelve he sent for them to gain a seat stand to gain the the twenty five seats to gain the house and he said he said if it's under twelve what happens is a lot of those polls are districts where the Democrats are way ahead and uh in California and New York and cetera\nSo he says basically it's got to be twelve or right now the real politics average has been about sex right what Republicans chances of actually keeping their houses it even possible\nIt's possible but like we have pre Kevin or we we really separately them some parent we do our own monthly tracking national national tracking surveillance on them it's on our website McLaughlin online dot com\nAnd uh so if you go to McLaughlin online dot com you'll see these numbers but the but we're ... uh he's got a point I don't think it's called but\nI think it's close to the sex and they write about there we had a survey that would you compare August or September we can with thousands of likely voters across the country and all this there were times forty four forty four Republican to Democrat\n[noise] in ah September the ... before the Kavanaugh hearings we were down for the Democrats were had forty six to forty two uh the president told a job or cruel and falling from forty to forty six\nAnd differences since capital those Republicans was that the Democrats were trying to you know depressed and have not come out the Republicans have they been Trump voters or have them that ... uh\nThey've been re energized and the the pollsters have seeing him back in two states where Trump won like we had a poll this week last week where\nAre the Republican was the head of a Democrat McCaskill of Missouri by eight points\nThere's been other media polls were Indiana's a dead heat Montana's a dead heat ah everybody knows that he can't Heitkamp in downtown in North Dakota so she's at all is Joe Manchin must have pole so he switched his vote but on the house side the Democrats and and the reason I say it's probably closer to six\nBecause the Democrats in two thousand six when they took the house for us if they uh they only got fifty two percent of the national book the forty eight\nFifty to cause us to lose over thirty feet to lose the house\nNow twenty ... we had a better reports from it but still the and a lot of those seats are in place but a lot of the things that are that are a defining over an hour open Republican seats without um incumbent and you also have a bit of a the anti Trump voters are more organically I'm\nLikely to come out than the pro Trump voters go\nThe old in St Paul they say the economy's getting better fifty seven percent to thirty two percent so some of the people don't realize what the state if the Democrats take over the house and our voters were less motivated or before\nThe capital here now they're coming back in and you can see it in some of the polls but you've got four weeks ago is it a lifetime in politics yeah so uh so\nYeah so does this is the Republicans need to be a lot more aggressive and do a lot more contrast with what the Nancy Pelosi Democrats were due to this country versus what the president has accomplished\nTwenty eight days ago before the midterms were with a long time now with pollster John McLaughlin you can follow his uh his polling information go\nCom that's McLaughlin online\nSo John if you have to predict now twenty eight days out based on a\nDaddy is seen who wins the house by how many\nWell the house there's this house was uncovered that we're going to pick up Senate seats and it's pretty clear the question is how many do actually pick up as it is a is it are under performing gain of one to two seats or do you pick up three four or five seats so the Senate looks pretty good because of the battleground that the the number of democratic seats that are up this time\nThe house is a much different story where the ... on the chin most generic ballots the Democrats are ahead right right now and it's too close to call it for weeks to go with the Republicans were on a lot of their you know get out the vote no message campaign\nYou know cut off some technicality but this charges or for real [noise]\nHe's just our brother tumbled are tolerable actually with Washington President Trump says you're going to investment Nikki Haley will be leaving his administration at the end of the year\nSitting side by side in the oval office the president and ambassador

apologizing to the American people for the debacle offer the clown show the Democrats put on which isn't was a great opening and that was their lives and I was only four rows back in the media so it was right there front and center and\nI was kind of shocked by it and I thought it was great and then he also apologized to judge Kavanaugh and his family for having a God the nonsense and a lot of polls showing Cory now that the Democrats overplay their hand backfiring that Trump voters are fired up one using on the ground\nWell look this president came out yet to apologize to judge Kavanaugh\nFamily for what doors and windows or mainstream media will never apologized the accusations the attacker character and went to his reputation was unprecedented in your politics come in the mainstream you know these people doubled down\nIt's such a crushing when it's a concern\nIt's one thing I Want it to ... ruin another week times now no matter what the issue is when you catch liberals and what we thought it was the truth whether they're using language that conservatives couldn't say well you know that was the person was young we stand behind them or whatever it is it's always a double standard to what the\nPresident outlined yesterday when he was a judge Kavanaugh as Justice Kennedy was something very different\nTemperament older he has to do which is to bring attention back to where it should be with you as the personal appropriate attacker judge Kavanaugh family received from Rochester but also for the mainstream and the press has the\nBiggest microphone world and one yesterday what was the right thing to do and I can tell you and I said this many times there are multiple copies of the Republican Party\nEverybody right now it's fully married before we Trump today because we have seen\nNo one wants to do what they're capable of doing and what they do if they take back the house of representatives which is\nTalking about impeachment both of our president and moreover I Would jump to stamina already so the Republicans are United they're fired up to the point and it's going to be much closer election industry wants to give us credit for\nThat's where these guys want to do games book comes out in\nEarly December McCabe who is the deputy director of the FBI who was fired for among other reasons you know running the lying to the FBI under oath on three occasions he was fired\nFor that book is coming out because they all profit off of Donald Trump and wants to\nSell in the book world installation stories about Donald Trump policing now with fire and fury in Woodward and all the other you know tabloids that have been out there and published but my guess what Rod Rosenstein who's going to do he will use his perch the number two person at the department of justice\nTook when he finally leads whether he's firing courage to go and write a book and just you know be scaling against this present because that's how these guys stay alive and that's how these guys stayed you know in the public arena and it really it's a terrible terrible thing to be honest with you\nWith the new allegations out now\nThe rosters seen\nComments and he was going to attempt to wired wired to the president\nAnd they do with the tape for set 'em up and then go to the cabinet you invoke between us and then get them out and get two FBI as you said to have a senior official saying they believe them and they thought he was dead serious every quarter to a there\nNow to James Baker he thought it was seriously thought it was the origins of the planet the way that would just do information\nThat's awful me why doesn't the smartest guy now\nLook I think I think you're exactly right I think the president wants to get through this election cycle doesn't want anything to distract the Republicans have momentum on their side but I Do think you have to work long term at the ability of Rod Rosenstein to stay in that position look if rod wants to leave that position you can do that anytime\nHe can resign if he wants to but I think you have to call into question does have the ability to continue in his capacity as a deputy attorney general based on the information that we're hearing from other members other senior members\nThat served with him in a fictional capacity in the department of justice or the FBI they're saying the accounting for\nWhat McCain said to be true that she was very troubling to everybody and we do know unequivocally that Rod Rosenstein signed one of the fires that application renewables which allowed them to continue to spy on American citizens\nAnd it's not on redacted that we need that we need to see that we need to\nSee the three oh two which are the FBI's note after they talk to Bruce or at the department of justice to see what's in there and we have to understand what the insurance policy\nWas to keep Donald Trump from being elected that the FBI was talking about what role if any Rod Rosenstein habit in that because as a deputy attorney general he had the right to sign\nThat climate change from what I understand and what is becoming widely known now by the application was riddled with mistakes and\nAnd it was based on the false premise about eight dollars and that led renewable was actually tried when Donald Trump was the sitting president of the United states and the American people deserve the right\nTo see what was in that renewal application that Rod Rosenstein\nDo you recommend to Rob Jones November\nI look at what I Would recommend to the president is declassified documents let the American people decide and see what has actually transpired the FBI's credibility because of a gym called me\nAnd Amy McCain and now James Baker and Peter Struck and lead the page and have done that organization is just devastating it will take decades to recover from what they have done jet organization\nTrying to use their positions pizza which was already people badges going after American citizens spying on American\nCitizens because he didn't like the political affiliation over their opponents everything that our country has been against census inception\nAnd giants like Peter Straub where the head of the counterterrorism\nUnit had more ability than anybody he was the one who boxing the Clinton email investigation he's the one who led the team that it was called cross by Hurricane Sandy\nHey there's nothing to seeing these extra six hundred thousand including the emails that we're all part of the winners laptop and he's the one who said hey let's go after Donald Trump he's on alert that we've seen\nIt now with the text messages between Lisa Page and Peter Struck and they were at least at minimum complicit with what you call me and Amy McCain and Jim Baker and potentially\nRosen team wanted done and the question is John and this is a very very big question how did this go in the U.S government we know\nThat the director of the CIA\nAnd the DEA and director of national intelligence and others were aware of this spying going on on domestic soil against us citizens but exactly how high did it go this is this is the biggest untold story of the last two years because this could lead right up to the very top of the government\nWhich leads to Jeff Sessions\nWhat is your what what happened to me he's not doing anything launching special counsel to investigate with you\nPeople for political gain all the way up to and everything else where Jeff Sessions in the\nWorld on this whole investigation and it's been by and large turned over to the ... the inspector general of the department of justice to find out if there's been any wrongdoing and we've seen some of that report already because it's been released publically the report that recommended\nThe number two person at the FBI and they're only be fired but charged criminally\nWe're waiting for that to occur uh we're waiting to see what happens to\nAppear struck and Lisa Page and and and Jim Baker the general counsel for the FBI we're waiting to find out what happened to the gym combing because it is very possible that Jim Comey has brought up on charges of potentially perjury in front of Congress leaking of classified information even though Jim said he didn't think\nIt was classified that's not an excuse window that he gave his notes his work product which was he was not allowed to do\nTo be a law professor to make sure that get leaked out to the media there's been no accountability anybody any level of\nGovernment for what they've done which was try they try to influence the outcome of the U.S election because or Clinton supported by and large and they did not want to or the candidate Trump become President Trump and I don't understand what kind of doing and why it hasn't come out yet\nNovember are we going to\nHope so John I really hope so and I and I and I hope for the president's take on that he has a team focused on helping him achieve all over the results\nWhich he's been able to do by and large almost singlehandedly if you look at what the president's been able to accomplish what three point seven percent unemployment the lowest unemployment rate for African Americans and Hispanics he's done some of this ah when I was to help others stabbings in lieu of\nStaff quite candidly and we've seen in the Woodward book or the staff tried on multiple occasions to stop him from doing things and\nStopping trying to stop them from being successful but he's persevering he's gone on and done things and the historic levels just think for a second is we get a staff that surrounded him that actually wanted him to be successful to how much more he could accomplish he's done so much already but\nThere are still people who don't want to see him be successful\nThere are still people who serve and the government or whether they're bureaucrats elected officials or people who have taken positions that didn't support him in the campaign and they're still trying to start again at every turn and\nFor all of their success or he has had in the first two years with the mystery shopping I can only wonder how much more he could have had if you had the right team around him supporting him every step of the way in all of these government agencies [noise]\nFor the first thing you need to do a November Corey brings down the street and this is my goodness you're right you think if you look at all this president of the top twenty months and he did that in spite of us\nHiding things from taking a cell phone couldn't go to websites or not divulging information I mean it's almost criminal what they've done I think this is you don't staff just the people that are there to serve the president's agenda and\nThey were nothing but an obstacle trying to stop and is going and he still got all this accomplish it's an amazing that you can only imagine in the next two years what did you do if he has a house and he has a Senate and he's got people in there actually are\nAdvocating for him the gender rather than doing everything just stop it or stole it unbelievable corn with you thank you for being with us recordings book like Trump the drop got another\nGreat for coming out Trump's enemies that's due out in November I Believe that the\nTwenty I think we I look I promise you\nRight now Republicans are fired up but it's got to
