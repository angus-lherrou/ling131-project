I think this is for him is the changes the outcome I think that's right yeah I I Can't\nI and I'm not an expert on West Virginia but it's nice to meet Joe Manchin told position that I'm an independent guy I'm not beholden to either side and uh\nI I think it would be hard for him to get reelected it would seem to me you know what a Trump when the state by like fifty points something like that\nAnd I'm not on also not convinced and Susan Collins and going to run again either\nAnd that that that that I think it's ... and she never voted against a Supreme Court judge ever you have a group in the state that has put a million dollars a snake and let you go to ... million aspirin\nYeah okay now it's up to a million and a half the front of me but then it looks like a bribe but I'm I mean I think at the end of the day without corroboration she's going to be there for for for ... will agree with Tom ... not only twenty twenty twenty is she going to run again well should make that decision at the appropriate time [noise]\nI I think I think Tom now that I think she's going to vote yes ah the one that I have no arena though Tom Davis is I'm Lisa Murkowski of\nWhat about what about you [noise]\nPretty independent I mean just remember this when she lost that primary to Joe Miller the last Republican primary she run as a write in with the name Murkowski now where you get started and\nEnded up and also as you want to know that last letter but you know made the part about the independence the little guys like mentioned when it's because they claim they're they're reelect in terms of looking out for their state right mhm yeah and Murkowski has a big issue with the cabin opinion about Alaska Natives I think was something that she got she\n... she she she does on the on that issue so now it's not clear cut I haven't seen the polling in Alaska or the but the I think if you get ... like you know I think you're going to get flaky voted him out of committee do I think without some collaboration that Jeff Jeff is fundamentally very conserved right\nNow you got to be water Institute He's also very independent and I think a very principled guy which is why people think he's flaky because he doesn't always stay in one boxing isn't always predictable\n... up this judged if you've got to understand for Republicans this ... this this will be very important vote on the court or as it is on the Democrats on the other side of it [noise] wanting somebody else\nOr a kid can I ask a question has as a as a a vice president were broken a tie on a Supreme Court nominees chocolate and not that I'm aware of yeah I think that would be unprecedented out what he\nWas ... and that will certainly challenge that\nBut it's still count how do you know that it just sort of thing in competition just as an advice and consent and there's got to be no my story on the president's ban any books but he's not a member\nI can tell you the state like Virginia right not bringing in your state center it's not Virginia you nominate Janet off [laughter]\nAnd if he's confirmed that they're going to do and they take over the house or the Senate to move to impeach that would\nBe a disaster two thirds of the Senate good luck\nYeah I'd just like I think the ... and\nOf elections have consequences that's what I take away but here's ... ... let's get the Republicans in Minnesota stealing Supreme Court [noise] well I I mean all the foreign policy from one here's the problem you guys still can't get over the fact that Trump won two years later you still can't get over got let me bring my where am I married\nGarland well let me let me talk about I think might bite every indication is a very honorable\nThree four would have made a good Supreme Court judge in in the traditional sense these balance he's not completely a liberal\nDemocrat property before he wanted to what bench but\nBut met the criteria for it for a judge but what is better not holding a hearing on are doing what they've done in this case bringing it's putting the sham of of hearing him and then finding a way to trashes reputation and voting no they work at a confirming middle lecturing year\nRepublican senators were you to confirm school your seat and\nPutting on a more liberal member just wasn't going to happen\nIn a presidential politics here not a mentor who who knows what the rules are right about the president is the president United States to nominate somebody for the frame court not to satisfy rights that threat so therefore I think McConnell's argument is out\nWhen he says look a that was a present that you only had last year the climate of voters decide that ...\nBut I'm just saying that they stretch it each time I don't know who started it but it keeps getting worse and worse and worse\nAnd once you do it for one year you could do two years you can do it three years I I don't know gardening guard rails long enough I think it was they moved from sixty votes to fifty votes for everything but the Supreme Court of course they're going to do it for the Supreme Court if they there are new guard rails anymore and that's what's scary\nAre not going to you again insects here from a DJ Republican operative in Virginia Beach if there is such a thing did you sense a Joe mansion is only apply for in the latest Fox poll as of a two days ago I applied for not Fifteen so Scott nice to what chickens email is what\nOne of our listeners Saturday for eight hours a day they have gotten another email on now let me check that got another\nThe boys are factored town waiting you know I never\nI ... or so that must be well that is part and says I just got to learn about eight or\nWhat's his name battle is destroying Ted Cruz\nThey do is not going to win that where with top top Democrat on the Republican congressman from northern Virginia new James just favorite congressman ever we've got ... Peterson is with us we're at jeopardy this world headquarters here in\nCity and Scott surveillance state senator from northern Virginia Democrat and part of democratic leadership I'm\nNot part of the ... on a fairly mature but there isn't room for saying that if you challenged if you if you challenge the godfather\nI don't think he's seen as seven in a while real clear politics average on it right now nine points for well that's a far cry from Fifteen oh here's one floods well temperate Thirteen or Fifteen minutes and plus when I was like\nI mean look here's here's a has been consistently had I think that's what I'll give you I'll give you that and I said\nBut I think a no vote here changes that dynamic there was a poll earlier before all this controversy that showed that if you voted against the also the numbers change on\nThis they call ... I don't dispute the fact that the numbers would change [noise] um but from from my perspective I think it Kavanaugh's confirmation to is probably the terms of the Democrats and the plane that's five to ten sheets maybe it's then it's easier to I mean well I think it helps in the house and\nHer team because when it's brought on very red territory North Dakota uh Missouri I mean these are pretty solid see West Virginia in the Senate race Kavanaugh cutting itself republic\nOr wherever we're where we're at a time for elements finally our new but one thing I think Tom now that this is the only thing I've seen in the sense Trump announced that has unified Republican [laughter] I've never seen anything like that we could figure out how to\nThat limits the cabinet discussion\nYeah you want to go ahead and what do you want to go ahead and do it but then we got to get the fuck for football and hockey but God go ahead\nOh law away and I'm like last night among the winner and the Senate Judiciary committee be official account of the Senate Judiciary committee\nIs tweeting about Democrats do not understand the definition of building right now the Senate\nJudiciary account this thing is so off the rails and and and I feel like\nYou know people were completely missing the point with all this process crap\nYou know the reason the G ... meeting is that the Democrats have the definition wrong a book it's our process and none of it is actually on where people are on it and where voters are on on this is Kevin ... only has the support of the conservative base and the message that women are getting around the country\nIs that you know people are OK with sexual assault\nNo I think that if we can\nGet their message they're they're they're getting it you're now a pronounced wrong joining or joining it it'll it'll set this\nThis is the same Democratic Party to pay the bill Clinton better tactics accusers right especially the one that got raped well\nFirst of all I was really I went to the ... the allegation\nOf rape against Bill Clinton which which it actually didn't exist\nOn national television that whole process got so when you say the Democratic party rallied around through whatever that allegation was out there at the time I Will say second thing is feared\nThat was why he lied as\nYou're talking about with John where LBJ Jones is different than ... then that was on the radar chapter Jones was real actual ... came out after that was ever catch him on the interview\nWas a week after the Senate in certain about that you had to sequence Kevin really was the same time it's Paula Jones or that you're thinking about\nThe one you might need a bridesmaid abroad flipping is the first two were having them the first few without retaliation anyway the point [laughter]\nThe message that women are getting around the country is that this is okay and Republicans are now into a debate about the definition of who seem to have a trend and double struggle I mean it is ... and this is on the official ... look everybody knows the booth peanuts\nEither not you have to first of all I don't know what I\nThink this Butina is inserting drugs in your ... instead of taking them down your throat because your body will process it faster van and he got around to doing that I learned during the eighties right where that everyone knows what that means no idea what it means a great a very interesting out\nHere and it's been crowd here that I have no idea what that word me I Do not and then and then you know kept on going to go on national television taking notes and be like oh it's a party and joke I mean this is so ridiculous and absurd wasn't embarrassing nominee that talks\nAbout the process a Democrat\nAnd let me just give them the world you're talking about polling calling on wait for\nHolding on businesses very split ... this is not overwhelming polling against capital this is right down the middle at this point in which is the worst in history but we could Supreme Court justice are never done that we're we're we're down to matter because they were just talking about the electoral repercussion we're doing is you're kicked the hornet's nest\nRepublican base that was kind of depressed at this point in what you see now in in terms of the energy breaks it broke party enthusiasm gap it's close and that's a critical Democrats a couple of times\nAt least you know I mean I get when you look nobody wants to have a story that are doing sexual has done sexual assault get off of it we want people to come up with them it's OK you can have perfect witness a double right she fell into it or\nOr the guy who was the guy the ravens beat up his girlfriend in ... by the hair and they they pay the more I\nJust for whatever it's worth I mean I I I totally concur on the telephone I said that publicly I campaigned for his opponent you know on line when he got into the primary for attorney general I said this is not right the way he's doing it um and\nYou should you should be that's an ... not you've been listening in general but it is it ... it is bad because a lot of people will look the other way 'cause any should not be the number two person on the Democratic national\nCommittee right but this is the Supreme Court and you have a guy who not only has a credible accuser and we'll put the other two aside from it but I think\nHer clamping contemporaneous his he's it to people she was pregnant at the party he turned over calendars from the same month and if they're the same people are lifted on his calendar and ... and being like a social event at parties\nAnd she didn't go to school so she wouldn't even know those people and that was all his calendars were released\nAfter she made in none of them you know leaving her best friend can remember this like ... I'm a that's not robbery you know what but you know in in a ton of parents\nI mean I Am I'm going to much money in high school reunion in next month it's been a long time and I'm the youngest person here if I was at a social function in high school and no one told me that a a a vent traumatic event for someone else had occurred I Would have not remember event the next week\nLet alone Twenty years later they came to me now and said oh were you at this point you know I don't know I was at that party or\nNot is this guy produced caliber of what he was doing that summer in nobody can pinpoint nobody can pinpoint where in the when the party was where it was ... by her how she got there how she got home\nYou got to have something outside of some memory I Wish you credible witness absolutely but\nI've seen credible witness was before going wrong memory skip over Thirty years I don't remember a lot\nOf like Thirty years ago or or I remember them differently than they were corrected\nLook I don't know who's telling the truth either but I think the mere allegation enough if that's now the standard that take somebody down a I think we wanted to\nI don't think this is an allegation I mean I I I think we know if I think that when you look at you know I'm ... people have put a lot of holes in the story of the the third accuser um and I think that you know you obviously have to hear both sides of\nYou know when an accuser comes forward their credibility this this user everything she had said you can cooperate with what she had done with how she lived her life with\nHer the notes from her therapy sessions\nWith accurate I mean I\nDo not early in the notes from earth or she is the operator you get them to the she offered enough yet when the interviewer\nShe won't give the community Sherry committed they are not that bad I mean I\nI appreciate your passion and you know your friend and I love you to death but you what'd you just took off I mean she said she couldn't fly and then we find out you can do that to me and my were fliers she's calling all over the world and we're going we're hoping to reach a month ago she route so\nThat they said she couldn't be placed with the one door that was not traveling hurt\nThe person that they did during the passage him saying by the door she lives in the tiny apartments one door that was fought she sent me a\nLie detector test I never did that I don't know\nIt then her former person that David Hearst said no she actually got paid to help people through lie detector test she knew everything\nIt so there was a lot of things that you said that she couldn't recall or witnessed thinking about\nHarsh on the line I I don't even know I think her testimony was a compelling testimony that I Will give you that everybody could watch that but I thought he was too and if my reputation for being trashed I'd be a little emotional ... as as well what happens\nNow everybody's back in the corners this is a very divided country what it has done it didn't equalize the enthusiasm gap which was in the Democrats' favor prior to this [noise] I agree with that and and that is the politics of this we can argue forever there's got to be a good judge in history will tell that\nBut it's really not a ... this was a ... this was a circus I think it's diminished that broke the institution of the Senate\nAnd the and the court to cloud show and I just sort of if you're good at least they took a week to go back and interviewed some of these other people in close that the ... it's never going to be enough and you come back and you don't take this guy out for the Democrats and on same on the Republican side so we'll have a vote tomorrow I think it passes and in and you move on\n'em and we'll get a little like Jeanette ... says he doesn't pass it probably be the best result for the Republican cells are going out more intense\nI agree I I think that the enthusiasm gap um I don't think it's not as much as the Republicans are claiming it has I think that there was some I'm a new one poll on it's not they're not you know in our internal polling sure as you as you know like you know pulling motion noise and it while this is going on there was a and and the reality I refer\nAnd the and the reality is that if you are correct that he's going to get confirmed\nThat there's not going to be a Republican boost from the from the election in fact it will be the opposite it's going to add to the army I'm\nMark ... democratic until he was already at an eleven I mean I\nDon't think that's true and in fact I think that the Democratic intensity and she doesn't Seventeen ... you know you look at Virginia it was only on pockets of neighborhoods there were places where it was an eleven um upper income white neighborhoods were off the charts for Democrats\nBut like the minority communities which have always been a historic democratic base had not been it we're not engage them twenty Seventeen election in the same extent and it hadn't been engaged in twenty eight teams I I agree with that I don't and they still aren't and I think this allegations actually helping engage them\nBreaking news this hour from town hall dot com I

chopped right but at this point in this rates she'd been told we just script don't mess up that's what happened in that debate I don't disagree with you that like you know\nDid was she a little plane at the debate yes did she make any major errors no\nAnd that's my Barbara Comstock so upset about the debate that you know wants to talk about oh she did so poorly Barbara's limited because Jennifer didn't make any errors that allows barber to get back in ...\nIt's a landslide it's been a landslide the tenth district\nHas every single demographic group that is breaking against Trump in this country over represented in it if the Democrats do not take the tent the Republicans will hold Congress I doubt I agree with I don't think yeah it's it's not an end right now that's not in the realm of possibility\nBut the Republican polling is telling me that she's tire or slightly that\nBarbara is going to lose by double digits Tom what exactly does she over perform for pulling Everytime her whole career she's over\n... here's the problem is in bend here is every demographic root for the Republicans were losing market share right now are collected in from from federal employees\nAre high income educated voters that gun now she's a woman and she talks but the difficulty they have the Republicans took away the one weapon Frank Wolf and I had to survive up here and it was I was not Tom Davis I was Mr guy who clipboard in prison Mr Woodrow Wilson bridge Mr rail to almost\n... Barbara gets none of that uh because the Republicans get away with their constitutional obligation uh on on do you know to to designate projects\nSo this makes it even more difficult race it it's a single\nInto the closing weeks on a jet or for in terms of their research or market tell you what it is so I think this race closest I've seen races close a lot more at this point but this is this was a tough race it's a tough atmosphere and it's been tough districts in remembrance\nA tribute band [laughter] somebody thing you said again just as she wants to be makes a county morale and Tom there [laughter]\nI just I got to treat that out at eight thirty are driven Tom Davis and ... Peterson and you've got a lot of the truth you John just rhetoric let's get to the other races or let's get to the seven I just said Barbara I just said Abigail Spanberger on my show\nYesterday she's a very Catholic candidate no doubt but ah I see a little momentum going for Dave I didn't think he was going to win a week ago now I I think he is going to win a\nHow do you see that race so I I had that one as slightly Republican up until the Kavanaugh hearings at this point I think it's a toss up um because what the Kavanaugh hearing stand was really re energized and fire up the one voter block that's the problem for Dave Brat in some district which is suburban women\nUm and I think that the seven districts historically Republican should be Republican if the Republican brand left me I'm Still here but I'm the one path for a Democrat there isn't in regular in Chesterfield with the suburban women\nAnd I think Abigail the match for them and I think that the Republicans are doing everything they can to lose that block naturally right now um and so I haven't ...\nThink binge drinking Kool Aid on this Kavanaugh's nomination in terms of I mean I enter let me just say yeah in in terms of what this was during politically and I think we all live in our own echo chambers and we all have our own perceptions of how it's done but what this is done in the nearest polling and some other polling demonstrate this is the Republican base is now activated\nEnthusiasm gap which is favored the Democrats for the last year and a half is now closed substantially\nAnd I think that works to perhaps paper they bred has two two issues though outside the demographics\nThe district in the DNA that district is Republican number one he is not close the deal with some of cancers people and they were just assume thrown under the Boston Red that seek out for two years\nAnd bring back or ... you know somebody it's more in line with their thinking and and even some scores and secondly Tim Kaine is going to be exceptionally strong in that district he was mayor of Richmond if he has a political he's widely ... used to say my wife ...\nThat's the I think that's right this this jacks up that democratic turnout there so you got a factor that into this thing I still think at the end of the day that the DNA of that district establishes itself and bright wins but the but this was a close race in Democrats have nominated ... she's\nVariable and whatever happens you talk about uh somebody that's got to be involved and democratic politics for some time I think I think Abigail Spanberger is going to happen is going to be somebody's got to be reckoned with a in a democratic circles for some time ...\n... you know I don't I don't know a ton about the district or\nA you know I Will say I was driving down the south side Virginia to go to an event last weekend and going through some of the rural counties and it seems like if Brad can pull margins out of those counties are but obviously the critical mass of the the district as in Chesterfield man right go so\nYou know I I Would probably say you know robotically it's a Republican district but obviously if it's a wave here than it could be one that the Democrats deal than would have to defend the twenty twenty\nI don't get to the second district Taylor Maria whatever happened it was a sale or the other day I had him on my radio show or the ... campaign put my [noise] my name and their team TV ads so by three shaped the PR for that one out of that race but\nThis is my first chance to respond to Scott right after he has no down on your show on that went viral yet I'm Upset about our analysis the last time I'm announces has not changed he still does [noise] um and\nUm I don't think I don't believe in New York Times poll I think it was you know I I ... up to this point I'd not near trials are pretty good at the last week they've they've not been um I think there's some noise going on\nI'm ... I think what is going to win and she's going to win going way um so I think she's going to win going away I think it's going to be\nA [noise] a secular up until two months ago was doing everything like um and he's really blown it\nAnd he's not going to win reelection and so are you say it's because of the whole validate Israel's sequences issue in the way he's handled it and remember that this district is one of the few in the country\nThat not only sits in the ... side a media market but is in a media market that doesn't really stretch too many other districts\nSo the media has been all over the place on the evening news every night you know if Barbara Comstock had a petition scandal in Tempe district it would have made the CD for forty five seconds one night or maybe a week later they quickly re mentioned that\nYou know it goes way you you cannot get away with something\nThe tide waters that on afterwards so let me let me make I look I think a New York times for property rights taken her is fixed that district very well\nOr you know it was a Navy SEAL all kinds of stuff in it she issued matrix and he's chosen I think you're in line with that district is not a far right kind of guy he understands a suburban Virginia Beach in those areas so we have all that going for him now\nAnd you've every year that favors are Democrats who were watched as a Republican what scares me about this is the fact that if you look nationally Democrats just a ton of cash and dropping a couple of million dollars on that race in the last week get that megaphone just can overwhelm at this point and exaggerate these things I think I\nThink they are trying to close correct hunting take up to date a again if are betting I I I think he wins\nBut in this environment with the kind of money Democrats he's put down a you've got to be nervous about this here to watch this on election night to see if the Democrats win the seat it tells me it's going to be a pretty good year farm in terms of chocolate thirty five forty so yeah I just think about [noise]\nThe thing about this district is different than Comstock and it's definitely different than a brat is the turnout model is totally different and I think it's hard for Democrats to win the seat in a non presidential year I just based on who vote democratic and Virginia Beach Norfolk\nIt's you know that the typical democratic voters going to be a minority down there and in less you get an outsized performance it's not I think it's tough for the Democrats to win that seat I mean Glenn Nye water two thousand and he got flushed down the drain and twenty ten\nAnd the reason was democratic bill came out in the presidential year for Brock Obama it wasn't there the next cycle for Glenn Nye 'cause nobody knew Glen I was [noise]\nUm I think Scott Scott advantages that the turnout I remember back when I was in the house carcass we'd look at the turnout bottles and the numbers and\nYou know Virginia Beach in Norfolk the numbers are just forty percent of what they are in other parts of the state so it's just it's it's you got a lot of people that lived there that are you know enlisted men or women that are registered to vote elsewhere so it's just it's hard\nYou know to to bring people out in that type of environment even though as bench correct you have one media market and you know they could possible Scott from now till the end of the time but there's going to be a conservative there's going to be a conservative votes is going to come out\nAnd whether I'm a little Maria I don't know how to pronounce it ... whether or not she can get people out based on her name as opposed to you know Tim Kaine is not as big a magnet there as he is in Richmond [noise] um so I I still think it's up to help with the Democrats even though I agree that looks like scotch kind of watch this one issue\nNineteen Ninety six and Tom Davis on number this well um we had a we had a scandal um statewide where John Warner put a television ad up against Mark Warner who was John Warner was far ahead and um he photo shop Mark Warner and do a picture\nOr who's in the ... I can remember who we do to stop what he thought it was up at Clinton I think yeah you ... with Clinton with well her eyes ... there was a racial aspect to it too I Can't remember what they did but they sort of shut my corner to a picture he wasn't in\nAnd um ended TV ad and it was a huge but national scandal for John Warner who had a moderate brand and was a\nGuy that you know everyone looked she likes you know what you're trying to say Scott Taylor is there like had a friend okay and and and that people you know like respected John Warner much higher than Scott Taylor them [noise] and and his numbers collapsed and more wonder was going to win\nOn the needy person and I'm the captain of my ship and I'm responsible for what happened and I apologize and it's got Taylor had done that he would run around\nSo I just I was worse campaign chair in that year and it was a it was a close race mark Morris than fourteen million dollars of his own money that year that made this really a much closer race than it might have been otherwise good strong when it was use on beat him in the course were put them out kind of heard it after running at close right there but I remember it out or whatever they fired\nThe people that were involved in the ad and everything else in your brokered in it it was an issue for a week or two and then John took accountability and he took accountability said or has mishandled this thing I think it's just kind of structure in having his people take the Fifth Amendment doesn't help it just keeps it in the news\nIs that enough to bring down somebody with a good reputation has done a good job in their first term or not\nUm and also I think the wave turnout are they talking about a new wave I think you're really talking about a ... that's really what's happening with the Democrats is that the the suburban female voters have swung radically or to the Democratic party that's\nGoing to take off will get our predictions rolling it back the next segment we have got to get to the rent yeah I\nAnd libertarian broke five percent and libertarians the automatic ballot access to the next five years in Virginia what's your ... going which are the Republicans that was going to expire this year 'cause there'll be ... percent again now they're taking Corey Stewart there'll be another five years the libertarian automatic ballot access clouds\nAre great and why that is a good point and that water is going to get over five no question probably seven partners here take some good this is John you think you think Barbara is going to win or lose\nAh [noise] ah what what ... what about Scott\nMaria [noise] I don't [noise] you know what's going on [noise]\nAnd ah I see you learn that [noise]\n\n[noise] ... um\n... gotten nothing negative publicity from a over the last several months and I don't see 'em climbing out a lot of old could be wrong but I don't see that and I also don't\nI mean there are [noise] Comstock can talk about her internal all she wants [noise] that's not what people were picking up going door to door [noise]\nSo what have you heard of that risk [noise] I'll just I mean you know when I've had the\nTo try to bolster the Democratic but are going to democratic doors\nThat those people are telling her there with her\nAnd when it on occasion they've asked what's the main complaint [noise] a ... and this was for Kavanaugh 'cause I talk to anybody since then uh it was the n._r._a. [noise] those ads have been effective but this chemical thing\nI mean that's all you know I go to the door and that's all I get\nIt backfired aren't going to get back to their credit shots gotta go we've we've we've got to get to the rest yep we've got to get the big gamer I ride Carolina\nJust start with where they are early in the right you have to be happy so far\nYeah generally happy I think the defence like I said a month ago young fast a good and and they're going to get better I think their deepest will get better [noise] um I I think they need to give a couple of guys more snaps a couple of guys less naps but\nBy and large I liked their defense to be a top ten defenses yearn for the next two years going forward it makes it for us\nI think they do they have one issue that need to solve and I can solve it if they listen to me they all week on the end they don't have any big play receivers that can go down catch the ball you know catch eight balls for a hundred yards\nAnd you need to have that too when consistently the NFL you can't just keep throwing your tied into your backs especially with a\nTight and like Jordan read the genetically gonna get injured ...\nGathered on the street [noise] he's bet on the street I in you know Bruce has my firm Booz Allen I emailed him literally within twelve hours if they'd been cut by Dallas [noise] begging begging them to pick up as I have repeated it every time I said in\nThe day he sets his foot on Redskins park you'll be their number one receiver they could get rid of Josh Fox and yes I said it they could keep Jamison in crowd or in the slot they can get that keep that kid retro Senate they're number two receiver who's fast but then you need a big receiver who can pull down eight nine temple is a game for a hundred yards\nDesk and do it and so if they put him on the team they will be the best team in the inner city east and will make the playoffs white [noise]\nDallas likes losing um I think it's [laughter] no they don't like to when they like to lose a why did you know why do they do what they do what do they keep patient care to take coach you know I mean\nWhy do they get rid of Tony Romo and it's just I I think somewhere Jerry Jones just decided he was tired of winning the waters start losing for a while and so that's that's why does what he does\nThat what it what do you think that I mean is that the answers that dependency [noise]\nYeah I I'm I'm favorable and dance and I can't believe we're talking about the Redskins are not referring to him as the first place\nYeah that's true first place and a phrase um like different like type yeah that's\nI I'm going to say at this point a lot better than I thought there'd be this year still very very tough schedule and next week I'm going to say nine and seven and that may be enough to make the playoffs because the eagles are struggling\nOr one of those things but it's always heard that [noise] but I've been you know go into the game since Ninety four\nAnd one of the things that the Redskins of lack for some time to speak to him and then I Can't remember the last time I'm sure I probably missed something but I cannot remember the last time I've seen the Redskins a Redskin return a parent or a kickoff touchdown\nMan and a while and it's been a long time and I remember a one of the hallmarks of a ... ... ... was that he always had pets he called it more burner\nWhether it was you know on your nerves whoever I mean it was he always had at least one burner\nAnd we don't have that and uh it it shows\nHow many how many ... when the rank and yet that's not how I got fired last one\nKnow from watching\nYeah yeah [noise] I think they do to change [noise] maybe three and one [noise]\nAh they beat New Orleans at the superdome and ... on the way to an eleven o'clock season [noise] a non [noise]\nAll right I'm going to go in the middle I think they've got one ten games I think you gotta make playoff and here's an here's the thing about Alex and I'm not a fan of it because they can't win the games in the playoffs and so we've got an exciting quarterback but you know I've watched them now three weeks I'm not a fan one way or the other but they're on TV [noise]\nBut I mean the man's games and he's never going to be you know he's never going to be yourself and\nI could see what I can see why Allen got him I mean he does he kinda fits what they're\nThe whole crew in philosophy is now write that down and win games [noise] and\nI think that I think this team to win ... games or they could get in the playoffs the dangerous [noise]\nI got I got to sign off I got to be in court today okay thank you for sharing your events I guess we're going to let me just quickly add the unemployment\nDown to three point seven percent hot there are a lot of what since Nineteen sixty nine lord since Nineteen sixty [noise] which you know I can certainly do not get a raise of what's coming on this really quickly John [noise]\nThis is it's an amazing stat but not for the reason the Republicans wanted you to be in the making that because people say nothing sticks on Trump\nAnd I think it's the opposite I think everything sticks on Trump the fact that you have an economy that's as good as it is and he's having a going to have a bad of an election that he's going to have everything is sticking to him because you should have with the economy [noise]\nOne of the first times where the president picks up see if it was an economy election [noise] um the Republicans could actually be gaining ground in the Congress\nHigh income areas are the ones turning against in the faster so for people to say nothing sticks to Trump everything sticking to ... [noise]\nWell I think he get credit for the economy and I think [noise] I think he gets credit for the economy and I think that mitigate so against the law says they take just because of the ... cycle but these coalitions are basically cultural coalitions are not economic coalitions and\nAs I said the Democratic enthusiasm in the independents wanting to balance the government is really what hurts [noise] people don't trust the Republicans to have the keys to want some kind of check on Trump to see how he's doing okay they may vote for him in two years but in the mid term they want to put a check on [noise] I I Will say this I think the Democrats take the\nHouse is I think he's more likely than not\nAh I I don't know how they don't impeach the president when it comes out you got the Democratic base right now which rabbit they want to impeach him now before ... a commission and when you [noise] I I don't know how Democrats are going back to their primary and twenty twenty\nCan't not to impeach Trump I I just think\nThat happens in rent for these are the kind of on the issue of whether they have any any reasonable evidence or not because you're like they have a lot of them think they have reasonable evidence now I don't know what more is going to stay out of it you know what he's going to say um but I just think you look at the base and you look at the fact that the primary elections or what most of these members worry about that it's politics\nThree girls going to do it I'm not arguing we're going to show them how to\nFix on Capitol Hill yeah\nWell I I think what happens is it changes the dynamic for twenty Nineteen [noise] it was one thing that twenty Seventeen Trump's and Republicans control everything to put a check on him what the Democrats come in Congress like our class of Republicans in Nineteen Ninety four it kind of their lives you know it's the under Clinton he played off against the Republican\nGuard he actually did better than they would do it yeah and I have some of that dynamic in twenty Nineteen that the way that\n\nOne of the coffee [noise]\nBreaking news this hour from channel dot com I'm Ron ... by fifty to forty eight votes the

see the flag\nUnfurled world champion Stanley Cup tell us about the experience and Canada capturing the [noise]\nIt it was incredible and um [noise] I don't know how to put it into words that you know being a CAT scan my entire life and [noise] the amount of um English I think that all caps fans have\nHave had over ... over that time um and the number of times that we were right on the cusp and just couldn't couldn't make it and um it was a great night and a great Germany\nAnd then seven nothing when and yes the cats can repeat I think that actually going to be better this year I think a cloud\nOf pessimism been lifted from that team you know John one of the things that I can tell you the season ticket holder that was just so frustrating but you just couldn't break it was in the playoffs you know that that we have a great home ice advantage the yeah the the entire year\nBecause we've seen it happen over and over again\nWe're moving in a fire right looking in the big game and and and the whole the whole I\nMean it just um I've never seen an arena just goes so last year game seven against Pittsburgh in ... when we when we went out the ... in in twenty sixteen\nAnd um they went down one nothing and it was like you know one nothing hockey is is nothing nothing and and I mean it was like you're at a funeral that we've already lost the game and they were they're spraying shorthand [noise]\nRight [noise] and and and and and that's and now it's like it's lifted and and and you could feel the playoffs last year once we got through Pittsburgh it didn't matter if we went down and again people could still believe in the team in the team to believe in itself I think I think the\nThe the caps in their history was Wayne on the players were they were believing when they went down a goal that the the games where you can also and how they because the fans flavor 'cause every everyone believes it and I once Pittsburgh got the last year everything changed\nYou could feel the change where I'm Tom in the heat and taking hold on if you take an older we set up four sections away from each other sometimes to each other in the Dunkin' Donuts line in between factions [noise]\nUm but um [noise] this is going to be a great year for the caps now I don't think this was a one year thing I think that you look at too that's often is young I'm ... in in his you know not in the mid mid thirties I think when you're thirty three thirty two\nUm [noise] he's gonna make a run a grassy for the most schools scored of all time the regular season is over six hundred refuse eight Ninety four he's going to make a serious run it being the number one goal scorer NHL history and the caps have an incredibly bright future um\nAnd I just and re saying this my dilemma right now I put a thousand dollars and the cat flustered when the Stanley Cup in Las Vegas Fifteen the one\nWe want to in Vegas at the cash for tickets Fifteen thousand dollars when I catch the ticket the person at the counter told me the biggest payout she's ever paid at the sports book\nOr when people will take about like that and rolled over for two or three seasons and she said you know the caps three feet and you wrote us money over it'll be two million dollars by the time they have a three feet so I'm Still having this dilemma for the rest of the season I have not\nDone anything with the money yet because it may be that like you know it was just a thousand dollar initial investment I might need to roll it over a couple of times because I think the caps are legitimate threat not only to repeat this year to touch with you have to repeat\nI'm only after all that every year by year so that's my dilemma but I'm leaning towards the right now I actually think this team is a special team and one that um is going to have a lot of success going forward [noise]\nI hear what you're saying I bet the Astros last year to win the world series of tech and one as you know because you put to bed I Would have been in for you in fact the ticket we did when we didn't catch the ticket as\nYou have to know you know you gotta play where your where do you choose your strength and it would be there I think a Ralph one uh [noise]\nI think we're out one by twelve porn twelve to Fifteen points I got an ear a in a blacks district in even more I think uh in Stuart events district\nAnd uh you know the dynamics are changing in this and it's not just so much a matter of Trump or anything the demographics in the state or changing and they're changing almost daily [noise]\nAh it's obvious which way you know they're moving are we going to be like Maryland that we're not going to be like Maryland but we um northern Virginia is beginning to look more and more in northern Virginia suburbs more and more not totally but more and more like the Maryland suburbs\nNatural it's not just reached one right happening nationally in these kinds of areas\nRight as I said New Jersey southern Sindh things going on everywhere in Eldorado sites everywhere but you're seeing this you're saying there's an awful lot and um [noise] I think we have an excellent chance\nAnd no question we're getting help from the guy in the White House whether he will be there or not you know a A R I was joking was Mark Warner\nAnd I said you know we well we we need them they're just one more election [laughter] you know but I mean it's you know I'm a generally speaking we've done better generally speaking when there's been a Republican and the White House they have their print exceptions yes\nGenerally speaking the Republicans have done better when the Democrats been in the White House have there been exceptions yes but the trend is there\nAnd it was a mistake of a trend yeah on the stand and I\nI Would be surprised if we didn't know you know get to Twenty one in the end of the election Adam minimum\nYeah I think I I tend to greet\nYou still have to defend a couple of states like you got a couple of comments you got one over on the eastern shore that is in play I think Republicans can hold the black sea if they don't have the black I I think that [noise] far weaker today a in combat than probably anybody else because he has some personal proclivities and\nAnd and things that I think that hurts him among some of those voters we have some stronger candidates or black or and I don't know what happened to have you got a hundred and fifty thousand in the bank so I didn't sound like he's ready to go away very quickly but I\nWill do my advice to him and he got no wonder who am I going to hold them and you want to go out to undefeated non diet that you can do that and they lost before\nIn ... when he and house delegation moves over over the first\nDetails a stream and some very attractive candidate a you've but you've got some issue ... after the initial matrix there where he has not really or his voting record um [noise] ah to that district and you've got the state house at fifty one forty nine into redistricting\nThat's critical happened that made many I mean we have to wait and see but may work in the Democrats' favor [noise]\nUm [noise] I don't mean it would appear that the judges are going to wind up drawing ... house district ... eleven house districts\nAnd I think that's what whatever formula they come up with that is going to also be what the Senate's going to have to abide by twenty Twenty one and uh it could change or you know or it could change an awful lot [noise]\nUm you know a part of the districts are unpacked not totally but below the numbers I mean look what Bobby Scott\nI mean his district one from what fifty some fifty six percent down to you know low forties and I'm a you know produced another democratic district so you're gonna have to see how that plays out\nBut it seems to me\nThat uh the judges drawing that district is by far and away their\nTheir best bet and if they do you know the Supreme Court I think it ruled before that gerrymandering is is has been constitutionally permissible until it spills over into racial discrimination and therein lies the problem and that's what the Republicans are facing\nThere and it's going to change its going to change the way you know a whole makeup of legislatures around the country of course the record for five to\nFour court will do this differently Boston Public records and they go back if I may be wrong but I think when they send it back to that lower court it was like seven to two and\n... well I I just think one of the thing is you got to understand the Republican base for better for worse is migrated from your country club that the country and in so doing they're taking their self out of some competitive districts where these are economic issues you'd be very viable\nSo it's not just the demographics of the fact that they can change the emphasis on issues in ways that help them in South West Virginia but but it hurts them in the growing parts of the state\nCan we talk about the ... an office with a very popular governor with very low negative and you look at ... numbers ... support amongst Democrats\nWas not popular among Republicans was more polarizing in his numbers Ralph Northam has incredibly low negative ads for somebody in this environment you look nationally um he has very high positive very low negatives\nUm and in going into these competitive seats [noise] um I remember in ... eleven and Democrats drew the state Senate lines and they lost the majority and who was the the person who was in every Republican ... seats with Bob McDonald or in a popular governor ...\nAnd these are still nationalize races I don't care how you slice of the national environment play on\nWords you have to have a messenger more into health right there are special I'm turning out the Thomas right\nThe the I mean it that that national same ways very heavily you know which is why you've had you know the the patterns that you've had until McCarthy Cuccinelli I mean you know what happened for almost fifty year I'm gonna I'm into I've been\nHere about the surveys like let's take for example that started in the district of unseat was not driven by national politics and twenty fifth and it was driven by local politics in Chesterfield versus Richmond and\nI'd like to be democratic um and I think and we and we were you were to have more or less if candidate but we don't have we ended up in campaigns don't matter you know I don't think we had to I don't think we had a great messenger there I think if you rerun that same race in twenty Nineteen\nAnd you had Ralph Northam on TV I'm In that district routes would not let me just say oh they'll vote the votes stardom and it's chaos is going to create\nProblems for them I think that's a greater problem is that he's he's he's not harmonious with the district on some of this hot button issue I just say that like Rob Portman bit of good governor and he's a wonderful man but he gets a fireside chat in the fire goes you know\nYou put him on TV it it it's not the same kind of rally the tape but he's an asset to the\n... and then he didn't even have to use that I don't you know what I did not it is that's the kind of governor you actually need the snow and he picked up a lot of fiery he picked up Fifteen states I mean I think it's ... it's fiery and um and you know carnival Barker one hand and he doesn't he doesn't pick up the playoff north I'm dead\nWell north of good and pick 'em up Trump picked him up for him yes if if Trump would have been president and twenty Fifteen we'd be in the ... All right let's look\nI I decided I don't want to date on Ralph Northam\nDisagree however I think he's been very much just stayed\nCame calling from by three points and rapport with him on by eight and ... pick up the receipts and wrapped around and picked up at five point difference was not the fifteenth well if I'm telling you that but it was also hotel different\nLet me tell you the White House break about Trump okay I was a driving factor sure uh last November on top of that um [noise] you had a ... and spilled over into everything [noise]\nAnd keep in mind Gillespie was not true but you know\nI mean he was very polarized [noise] but um I just think people keep underestimating as governor ... oh I don't think anybody on the rest of the ...\nI don't think anybody under estimates name but they notice I mean you know what's driving politics in Virginia right now is not a Ralph uh it's it's what's going on across the Potomac River\nIt's negativity is driving politics on both sides right now in the one thing about Robert when he doesn't have many negative [noise] doesn't have many many he's a very like about ...\nI'm not you know I've now go you know been knocking on doors since may I have not gotten one negative comments about Ralph non\nNot not the problem is you know I I agree with that is an asset but he's not a fire reader that gets voted out for\nYou know I I think comedy is not a fire leader they got to put up for the Republicans but for Twenty years\nEvery single Republican Lippi she would have thought the person was married to Tom Davis\nBecause the Republican candidate had his picture bigger than their own picture with a quote from him saying like here's why they'd be great for your time sometimes without permission um so I mean having a messenger is important and Democrats are not had good last letter that learn rock north and is the first time in a sense Mark Warner and we've had a messenger\nRight I agree but now he's taken out an income that was an entirely different that\nI don't know I tell you what man I I that's the Joe Joe is going to beat her ... you got it under estimate Morsi and I'm telling you\nWhat he had a disastrous for us to offer I wasn't there and it was a disaster of all time we had a disastrous press conference it really hurt them there's all kinds of underhanded things going on but you know after that\nMorsi's mayor and [noise] you know the the thing about Joe is he's an independent thinker he's got to go is the only way [noise] ah you know he's not\nA he's not a whole them to any of the establishment caucuses or anything like that\nI think you're going to play very well in that district and I think a lot of friends there that no one thinks that he got screwed by what they did to him and and say\nCan I jump into the smartest thing I've ever seen anyone doing politics when he won the was it I think it was going to teach in the ... he won Mickey chintzy on each um moved up I think\nAnd in that primary people and think he was going to win that primary crowded field and he won in a landslide networks people are asking what did he do he went around and after he knocked on doors at you know what I\nWrote a handwritten note to every voter he spoke to\nThe data that for a week and a half before the election in the context as if he had remembered the conversation\n... kept these postcards for six months and send them all out ten days before the election with a handwritten note from him talking about how their conversation and you know I met your dog Sam or you're a teacher here and I remember that conversation and do you know hope I can count on your support next Tuesday and\nPeople came out in droves I mean for him to go do that though and I I I see people read postcards but I've never seen one posting them to make it appear as ... months later okay well comedy with um Tom Davis has everything better than anyone in politics lightning\nBut [noise]\nBut he did that to anyone in a landslide and like it's\nBeen done before you know I don't mean Joe I'm just going to take on incumbent district like I did it\nIn that race either gonna just to I'm not an ... that's the big difference\nYou know if we had you know there's a whole lot of people have gotten in general suddenly because we don't have run on\nPurpose in this day a whole and and you won't have that you'll just have to people in there\nAnd she's well why [noise] I don't think\nI if I had the gas [noise] and I I could be totally wrong with him in that district I guess that rod dance has extremely low name id pardon I Would guess that rod dance with extremely low name id and that if you tested the majority of time they might not to say the palm pilot I'm just [noise] but like in terms of I'd name id\nRichard Nixon had our name out\nThere [laughter] you know I just like I don't think rises like real superstar the Senate\nBack on you know Joe and I know Joe\nThan it got to get out out worth something like Fifteen or twenty to one okay Joe was out there knocking on doors are making phone calls now will just\nBetween the tax law primary too in that primary like Dick was independent district for Twenty years ... got drawn to say the price basically has a concept of campaigning and knocking on doors and doing the things that you do when you're in a competitive political rate\nFor Seventy percent of the vote in my district against Mondale\nYeah rock that's never been a Senate race and the lights on for ever I think you're better right now she's never been better if you got to ask you before\nAnd she got to get out of work I jumped out worker he's fighting Joe he's gotta he's gotta worker and the other thing is I don't care if I'm telling you he was going to get a tip the players that step of the vote out there for the fact that the power base in Richmond screwed this guy out of his livelihood and\nThat's that's real I mean he got screwed I mean what he did oppose long license it looked senator Stanley told me the whole thing is that ... that was blown it [laughter] what happened there was a total bologna\nAnd it was because uh it was it was big cards he challenged the Richmond system that's what happens that's why they pulled him and so I I just I'll Remember that\nLike you know there are a lot of people in that area that have and and this is the loyalty the job or see the reason he does well there's a lot of people there that is represented and when families\nHave had a time of need you know the attorney they went to the criminal defense attorney to help out someone in their family unit was Joe Morsi and that created the level of loyalty he has a big [noise]\nI'm not ready to call this one one way or the other yet but um\nHe has a real ... it's it's across that district from being an attorney I'm In the same way that Donald McEachin you know when he when he ran rubber on his running you know him as a primary challenge of what three times to incumbent twice twice as a challenger don't come a delegate then went to the challenge is going to come to senator\nAnd and make each one was the guy who everyone news on TV it was a lawyer um he had to help so many people in the community it didn't matter that he was a challenge or two in common um that's how they knew how much they thought he was in college right\nNow that are trying to do more seats than the guy who's defending their nephew there's time um you know against major charges that area he's one of the top defense attorney there so I just I I think that it's an interesting race in in ... we got to see you know will rise even run again we don't\nLet me look ahead to twenty Twenty one the governorship when it comes comes through and a lot of um determine who's in the White House was using that dynamic and so on\nBut when north um goes will the attorney general Montana governor clashes that who else is looking at this point in the Democratic party ours on her I mean there are name pops up there on that Perry oh it was not out of the picture you know I Would imagine in the wrong again of\nCourse but I Would I Would hope that herring in Fairfax thanks for delta or not to see contested nominations\nAnd you've got a lot of people in the back looking for upward mobility to get the mayor of Richmond stony you've got some other larger him getting her yellow sitting there on you'll have a primary and you'll get that big a successful can be dangerous if only I think the\nOnly a [noise]\nLong as you don't have a two way right [noise] a majority in Fairfax area and ah\nI think that uh them if it's one of them against the whole batch of other people [noise] uh you know either Fairfax\nYou're carrying somebody outside like you guys are talking about herring and a Fairfax Ron you're not talking about before stony who was absolutely going to do something he was the other person you're not talking about who could pull the upsetting in a two or three person race and that's Kenny handling Alexander\nMayor of from Norfolk right now who in a three way primary against to progress is trying to wild liberal left wing each other\nKenny Alexander comes and it's this guy this is track record in the mold of who water businessman McAuliffe fitness kinda Darwin ridiculous why\nThat's ridiculous first of all there's always there's a as if there's a moderate right or the Democratic primary is any way for the first piece safety but they're setting or if that can be a rough in order to be you're going to stay\nThere knock on line up behind cat I like Chinese a good friend but they're going to either line up behind either herring for Fairfax what about stony and I don't know I don't I don't I didn't know that are the same thing with all of our record guy people liking but they're either going to go with one of those two\nHow ... going to be a Republican any weight because Trump's going to be gone and twenty twenty I was going to win again which I mean first years of presidents he's gotta when they get on the\nSame type of campaign that Gillespie or your rights are Republican won't win that governorship you can't ... I'm telling you you know it's graceful\nJak Republican everyone went again in Virginia\nHow do you how do they want to learn that probably that's absurd how did it\nHow do you account for a Christie how do you account for\n... you know in in ... in Massachusetts I mean you know governorships in particular are not parliamentary rate and people make and you know you know but but let me tell you something as long as people in the Republican Party keep trying to turn a political nickel at the expense of somebody color\nOr somebody ethnicity or somebody's religion it ain't going anywhere I Would agree with you there and you can tell they can get away from that you bet well and they shouldn't be rejected or they got\nGot a text there from a Senator Bill Stanley he says never bet against fighting Joe so it'll Stanley agrees with me\nYeah he was a excuse me ... that we know who is Joe Morris lawyer huh Bill Bill Stanley yeah yeah okay what's that going to do a little\nBiased [laughter] speaking of seeking a statewide races I didn't feel family going to be a very dangerous candidate for attorney general I'm very like you have to run 'em and if he runs for attorney general gets the Republican nomination I think he's going to be very dangerous game well if he doesn't run he'll get the nomination but he has to run\nYou know what the problem is you can't come out of your [noise] they want to\nGet the numbers that there is no way you can do that you can't make it up you know and as I used to say to democracy Davis why are you doing this for this is coming to a precinct near you and it starts here but now it's the Richmond suburbs it's Virginia Beach it's everywhere that this is now these are ... which is national trends", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Glenn Beck Program", "city": "Portsmouth", "day": "06"}
