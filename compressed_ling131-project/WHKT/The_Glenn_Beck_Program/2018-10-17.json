he died at the consulate in Istanbul two weeks ago during yep botched interrogation according to a person is to me\nOr with the kingdom's plans this of course after Saudi Arabia it said that he left and they couldn't find the camera footage now he didn't leave and he's dead and it was a mistake\n\nAre you serious\nSaudi officials have repeatedly denied knowing what happened\nTo show the President Trump suggested on Monday after talking to king Solomon that or he may have been a victim of road killers as I said on Algeria yesterday obviously the president didn't get that from his own staff he got it from king Saddam\n\nIs inconceivable to me that Mohammed bin Salman crown prince Mohammed bin Salman NBS did not know about this it is inconceivable that they would have that Fifteen operatives\nTo Amsterdam bowl and they had no idea why they were there there was no communication back to the authorities are in the government\nOf Saudi Arabia now the new explanation seems intended to ease a political crisis for the Saudis and could diffuse some criticism of the Trump Administration which has refused to back\nDown for billions of dollars in a weapon sales for the kingdom so everybody here is looking to save face Trump Administration is looking to save face Saudi Arabia is looking to save face so they're going to\nTalk of the story look the guy was murder right he went in there to get a piece of paper and\nThey chop them up into little pieces and put them in bags and you're going to tell me that that was not authorized by somebody and residents after they lied and said well he just left\n\nNow they have to come clean here because the Turks apparently intercepted his apple watch communication\nBecause\nLike it's inconceivable that this out that the Saudis and have a camera working you know you go around these embassies and everybody spying on everybody that's the name of the game and especially when you're in a host country they got satellites and microphones that communication and bugs all over the place\n\nNow several Wall Street executives have pulled out every very lavish investment conference next week in Riyadh\nSaudi capital seat in the news and the treasury secretary still plenty to attack I mean the Trump Administration here really wants to go on with the Saudis as businesses ... is as usual\n\nAnd this is also a tough spot that Jared Christians and because he's been one pushing the expansion of the U.S relationship with the Saudis from the day he got in there\n\nNow they think they can just put this a communique out there was a mistake and we'll deal with the people that did this like we just really wanted to interrogate\nHim and get some information or that he died a John triggers radio network truck to the truth across

really have time for this there's too many other things going on in the world\nTo be concerned about these uh about that particular a tweet and a Rand Paul hear Lindsey Graham there's a lot of senators that we have a lot of respect for that or raising alarm bells and so you have to take what they say uh with all seriousness is\nMy only point in this and let's get to the bottom of it I think the president response here so far it's been spot on or it shouldn't affect the arms sales I disagree with the center on that one because of the president said they're going to buy the arms from somebody that was so it really doesn't matter but there's gotta be some\nKind of response and the president said that there will be a response but he's not going to make response until all the facts read I think everybody would agree with that right here on the John traffic's radio networks phone lines open eight eight eight or eight oh John eighty they portrayed oh five six or six uh but I really want to thank Edward uranium for that\nAny radio network anywhere in America except ours and I think that's a credit to uh everybody in this organization that we wanted to bring the truth and

going to happen have temper but All right let's go to a few clips here Mike a barber Tom\nFord forgot start coming up with it thirty five or vice president Mike Pence cut three vice president Mike Pence census important for the world to know the truth when it comes to finding out what happened to Saudi journalist your mouth crucial he cut three pets\nI'll be speaking to secretary pot failed later today [noise]\nI Know is that meaning Saudi Arabia [noise]\nA president said we're going to get to the bottom of it [noise]\nWe need to know who was responsible you know all those\nBut he was a member of a free and independent\nOf violence planes are likely to\nAn assault on a ... brat so [noise]\nSay that those responsible are held to account\n\nA that is very sober response here very salient from the vice president and ah let's now go to Senator Rand Paul from Kentucky was on my show just the other day a\nNot a fan of the Saudis as you know\nBut um I take would rent pollsters very seriously because you know I had been in the lonely battle for very long time along with Walter Jones in some others to get out of Afghanistan to get out of the Yemen's civil war to get out of these ... says you know I'm a non intervention less than I don't believe we should be involved in any of this\nStuff but uh that's just me let's go to Rand Paul here my cut for from Kentucky saying that they could show could chase is proof that the u._s. should not arm the Saudis cuts for\nWell I mean I'm Glad to hear that kind of ground take from Saudi Arabia\nBrokering crowded trying to get Congress to sending arms to Saudi Arabia in so far that other side of that\nUh it's important to remember that Saudi Arabia is the largest state sponsor radical Islamic they front and tens of thousands of ... around the world Pakistan, India Indian trouble paying all continue hatred of America they've been doing this for decades they're not our prime\n\nMinister catastrophe humanitarian faster so this latest episode was killing the journalist is just cruise we know that when he's not can be arming them\n[noise] you know as I said\nYou're not going to sweep it under the carpet not with Rand Paul and Lindsey Graham now you got to remember thinking about this alliance there and uh this is why you ... you can turn on my other competitors and then they can be talking about what's in the local paper eating their donor with their people bringing 'em stuff and the\n... to the typical nonsense they do one WNBA your W and I asked or whatever my other competitors are or you can be with me and you can get\nThis kind of analysis this is why this is not going away let me just tell you watching you understand because they got a lot of text about oh somebody just takes it and if he was a plumber it wouldn't have mattered here's why it's not going away when you have an alliance\nA policy\nOf this magnitude between Senator Rand Paul who like me is a non interventionist and wants to get us out of all these foreign entanglements suspect in the military industrial complex wants to get out of\nAfghanistan out of Yemen out of all these wars and he is aligning himself on this issue with Senator Lindsey Graham from South Carolina\nWho is a Neal Khan who is a military industrial\nComplex supporter who is in favor of a muscular foreign policy around the globe as you know and you can get those two in the Republican caucus that senators to agree on an issue of this ...\nJust Rand Paul and Walter Jones right that would be one thing if you had Lindsey Graham on the other side that will be one thing but when you have two people that as far as\nForeign muscular foreign policy Neal conservatism entanglements hall and Graham come into alignment on an issue or like this vote coming at it from a very different angles it's a very powerful\nCoalition and the Republican caucus of us that and granted not messing around Rand Paul's not messing around and so you just heard what Mike Pence said\nHe's not messing around I'm telling you does it matter it was a journalist or a plumber a day of reckoning is going to come and they did this\nThen uh when she when I'm In Atlanta my town\nI'm going to be laughing for five hours just just just like it did in two thousand sixteen at Trump Tower the Hilton\nWhen he wants to be fun so I'm really looking forward to it and ah anyway joining us now Barbara Comstock hey Bob are great to have you with the\nMorning great to hear\n[noise] okay so let me ask you this um par for the Democrats are saying that you voted for President Trump Ninety eight percent of the time and they're trying to tie you with that I Wish I could get a good thing I voted for him a hundred percent of the time you order for Ninety eight I think that's pretty\nGood but the majority of those votes were nonpartisan votes right so explain that\nBut you know the proud and thank you for asking this funny every time we talk with the press about this week said have you looked at about regardless of how you feel about the president or not what you really do is look at what a good policy for the American people\nAnd certainly for my constituents eighty two percent I didn't tell their party to push that your listeners\nHaven't heard that now they're hearing and for the first time you get the precedent covering\nOn and so what included it matters what first there are six pills to cut your taxes out don't you think the bells that aren't bipartisan because we know Democrats want to raise your taxes not cut them so will make that departure that I Am going to cut your tax that's\nMy comment and it's already crowded to raise them take away that child tax credit appear thousand dollar raise rates out and everybody you know and that would be devastating to our great autonomy that you know going so well right now\nBut I don't know if that was on that score card including pouring down on the opioid crisis but I Would just working on last night with our local loud\nAnd sheriff whether you go to ... minutes red tape or not that's a lot of any age but that was your car does that make the gal I can keep the government okay\nResearch at and say hey you know what we're doing great amount of\nFunding cut off his cancer research diabetes but there are all great investments that neither the Republican Party nor the president or getting credit for that results that we've gotten on a bipartisan basis you know it also has things like my boss I'm\nA criminal alien gang members out of the country\nAfter the stop school violence you know the people want something done dealing with school violence my opponent and failed on every street corner wait on that issue when it had three bills\nBut the president of the time this year that I think it's called by like you know helping get the background check system updated my project states neighbor had fell on\nThere are things that my opponent apologetic because she's a party and the press that didn't want to report they throw at that number and they just want to you\nKnow he's dead and the battle to everything but the good holiday is making our country stronger economic Clinton or national security and it's going to play some red paint that policy in the paper said the great thing I resent\nSo let's let's make the comparison congresswoman the Jennifer ... who was one of the most liberal state senators are in the common\nRated number one this year liberal and you know raising their taxes than burger Jennifer Wexton is supporting now people are paid to do that and I\nWill look at the end of the day they're all supporting him because like I Would yell spanberger has taken six hundred thousand dollars over money you're not going to take and a half million dollars over that and then say oh I'm going to vote for somebody else and by the way there is nobody else to\nGo look the whole thing is a ruse if the Democrats take over and blows you said this over and over and over and if they take over by one vote she has the votes and the clock to be speaker and the whole thing about not voting for her if you're a Democrat is a complete ruse so let's get to\nLet's get to your record which is really what are the ... campaign is challenging now\nThey're saying well a Barbara Comstock runs around\nSaying she votes independently she voted in favor of the district a but look we look at the record she's voted Ninety seven point seven the times for Trump but let's give a couple of examples where you went the other way let's start with salary increases for federal workers explain that\nThey've gotten a raise the federal employees there was talk of the Trade Center and I can't turn it around\nYou know in our budget for federal employees which I happen to think that's a good thing and I thought for it and I've been around\nNow my stress to follow where it makes you wonder if that were shut down which would hurt our federal employees I'd also either got a hundred and fifty dollars for every year but are pressing for reform my opponent it's going to be all that\nFor the first time in decades if I'm not there to fight for our region and this is going to be a Republican strikes and and I think it's going to be any house majority off but we certainly know according to the majority so if you don't have\nAt least one Republican in there fighting for the region are encouraged Dallas Airport as I got to make sure\nThe airport is protected by not somebody helping raise our federal employees but also our whole defense industry my opponent has not had any relationship with our parents um businesses and that there's such an important part of our economy\nBut also are on national security at the national security debate the primary I'm a Democrat towers she said well yeah I really don't know about any of that [laughter]\nSo that's certainly true but this is a vital part of our local economy and I have to experience there and trying to think critically injured and we need to be able to have somebody who had a relationship\nWith sanction as well as relationships with are very diverse economy and including art and science technology in our\nAgriculture which is the northern and western part of the district which has a large agriculture sector also\nWhere it was Barbara Comstock congresswoman construct she represents tend to disregard Virginia that's the northern who you're going from a Westerner Fairfax to Winchester she's running for third term her democratic opponent Jennifer Wexton one of the most liberal state the most liberal state senator\nOr in the common wealth they will not come on our show et cetera\nAfraid the answer a legitimate question I suppose I don't regret it I don't really have any idea but you can't find her anyway or Barbara let me think\nShe gets a narrow and Winchester major political event you know for decades um it's a hard job in the valley which the chamber she gets out of ... and this is something that\nDemocrats and Republicans alike all gone through their local Democrats city council people when they were very frustrated that things are getting turned out that that sort of just saying that even younger crowd\nYou know that you know she didn't show up that any of the county fairs where you really need with chocolate our agricultural community and there you have to understand the entire district not just on her part is that she has spent time with my sisters have reductions crowded\nIt but you know they're the death threats they raped rats reports in college you know it's got a great threat segment tax and you know we have people who are getting signed mowed down in their front yard where people trace their yard and drive over a sign and\nYou know they're afraid to put up a sign their neighbors will yell at them the transitions crowds I don't believe God I have some stability here regardless of what Hillary Clinton by the white Hillary Clinton supporter of my better [laughter]\nI'd like to eat the lights out as a part of the crowd and we need to have a heart attack and leadership here in our region\n[noise] well congresswoman there's no question of the angry mob mentality that's going around the country right now is very concerning to a lot of people as soon as I recall in the center for maintaining a death\nThreats rape threats are now we find out that ah somebody allegedly sent 'em a poison power to her home in Maine where family lives I mean all the stuff is just beyond the pale it it's it's it's it's beyond the pale and they didn't go to stop because there's\nYou know until until the until the Democrats are condemn\nThis that and Bernie Sanders kind of like halfway said well it's not a good idea but you know you got to Hillary Clinton coming out saying look we're fighting for the Republicans do where we we got to get rid of all these Republicans and so you can be on the whole I mean as long as they can do it it's going to keep happening\nUntil they stop I mean it's ... it's it's I Know your student history it reminds me of the sixty eight campaign Humphrey Nixon walls and a you're a\nProbably too young to

plumber\nConstantly chopped up in a little bit of teachers and taken out in a in the UPS boxers or something\nBecause he was critical of the Saudi regime in article ... he was doing for an American company called the Washington Post I hate to watch a cut of tape so now you know that it's okay let me crazy man you can't you can't do this pet you got it right you just ... this is not this is a\nConflict I mean if you said there's nowhere near the water remember it was also the Saudis that I don't know what they did they abducted or hostage eyes\nOr took out a the prime minister of\nOn a lot but not\nVery after two weeks three weeks after he went to the White House and you know what that everybody looks the other way again crazy let's go to an online dean and Eli yet burger junior a jar\nOf looking forward to your news station and eight days yeah they\nDon't want to ask you this question here yesterday uh currently a coroner's Newsweek or Mitch McConnell said that uh we need to cut Social Security and Medicare and\nHe said that in spite of what uh uh the uh government owing a certain period of trust to point down a tree in\nThe inner governmental debt and the money the Medicare trust uh you know and ... meant you know or or ground or Comstock or we don't see how to get an answer out any they have about paying back the money that they took out of the Social Security trust\nAnd I want to point out one other thing to me on the style burger brat debate or two nights ago that I'm\nDave Brat a hammer Abigail on a single payer health care and I want to point to the Arctic or to the ah sixty minutes interview that Donald Trump did during his campaign\nWas Scott Kelly what Donald Trump promised health care for all Donald Trump promised he was going to take care of everybody and uh\nHe was questioned about how you're going to pay forty explained that to interview a Scott Kelly is available on YouTube to crawl you want to see it\nAll along with the other campaign promise on YouTube were during the debates with Ted Cruz Marco Rubio\nDonald Trump promised that they could get the money from Mexico to pay for the wall and it was only going to cost ten to twelve billion and one on the promise to the people are forgetting about is that Republicans promised to for seven years that they were going to repeal and replace Obamacare\nYou know I don't think it's unfair for me to ask you about the promises that Republicans have made over and over again to us thank you John [noise] was\nThe number one on the seven year Republican promise to repeal and replace Obamacare Republicans lie teaching\nThey lie to the tea\nWhat they did they lied they went and lied and then they got your money\nHad anything right they voted to repeal and replace it when they know they had no replacement\nAnd it would get vetoed and it couldn't get through the Senate so they liked liar liar pants on fire a President Trump assumed they had a plan they had no plans and when Trump tried to get a plan together it fell through and John McCain voted no so he did not deliver on that promise now he's dismantling\nThe pieces of Obamacare that people don't like no question about that but I'm Republican as wide as far as the wall is concerned uh because I think you brought up poor things when we get the third one uh\nUse me but Mexico is paying for the wall because we renegotiate NAFTA deal much to our advantage and those towers and that money that is coming in has got to go to the wall nobody that had a brain in their head\nEver thought that the Mexicans were going to ship over a\nA truckload of um gold ended the in Fort Knox or they were going to give the U.S money in their treasury so the way is paying for it is by a renegotiating bad trade deals that were cost us hundreds of hundreds\nHundreds of billions of dollars and so they they are paying for it and just I think the poor thing is that is entitlement at what McConnell said\nA President Trump and Trump's ... campaign and said he would not touching channel is that he's not and if the ... if you'd probably can send him a bill to reform entitlements and cutbacks payments or eliminate people the president was detail it so the whole the whole issue of debt and uh\nThe Social Security fund and everything else that's that's got to be addressed but as far as cutting entitlements or this president has been very clear from the dig out of the campaign trail oh that was a covenant\nBetween people and Social Security recipients and he would not cut back and he had and if McConnell does that don't speak to it and you can't get an overriding detail so they're going\nTo have to come up with a comprehensive entitlement reform but cutting it is not part of the president of America First Trump but now mixed agenda thank you gene always a good dialogue Josh Red Wings or radio network\nMany policymakers here in Washington they don't they have good enough job in either Democrats or Republicans have done a good enough job of helping these countries improve their economy helping these countries improve the rule of law so we don't we put all that much money so we go to\nMexico has jumped more than ten spots on the economic development with international I think it's now number a weapon we've made in Mexico rich\nWith straight billions and billions of dollars millions of jobs and yet we still have twenty two million people in this country illegally the majority of the Mexican so not attacking Mexico or Mexican people I'm just saying we've made Mexico way rents\nOut of them kept [noise]\nJohn through the radio network you're Godzilla have the truth in America great to have you with this\nKind of a lot of fun or Tucker Carlson a little clip there and he's got a good point one third of Salvadorans living the United states one way or the other legal or illegal while they're here which he'd given money or because he gets a you know corruption is what ... then that's the\nNewest that it's the corruption too but they're all these countries are corrupt and now the new buzz words for the open borders crowded economic refugees now their economic reputation whether it's four billion economic refugees\nAcross the globe that don't want to come to the United states get housing get clothing get free medical care get welfare again the bottom of phone get a house get taken care of ... like it to get food get school and get an education for billion let's just want them all in and then there's no country goes bankrupt and then you're like\nEverybody every other bankrupt country I mean it's absurd argument their economic\nRefugees well there's four billion economic refugees across the globe idiot have a country or you don't\nThese open borders people they don't want a country this is for things they don't want to\nCountry they don't want an America that and wanting to say\nThey just want to open borders that I don't know what did they think is when did you come from what in the short term they'll have political power and then eventually their vision is because of that political power with all these four million people voting for them eventually that company or legal and vote and get the citizens and the company\nGets bankrupt you don't have the link and then you'll have the patterns that's really the society they want a handful of liberal elites running the territory that\nWas once the United states living very high on the hog making all the decisions drinking wine and cheese and caviar and flying around and\nHelicopters with all kinds of guards talk about gun control of the guards like crazy bodyguards armed guards tank trucks machine guns\nThe already protected and then everybody else will be fighting over food and there'll be the person that they will rule over I mean that's what else can be a gender thing there's nothing and open borders agenda wipes out your\nCountry your culture your government it\nBankrupted wipes it out so what other what other objective could it be that you have no country and the elite make all the decisions and they live\nIn their mansions with armed guards by the way\nThey have a hundred percent ... gun conscription except for their armed guards there they all have only going to get ever need to protect them that's still liberal vision them they're the elites they make the decisions average people too stupid to have a job and\nThey'll go when or how much food there'll be food why do you stand on line for an hour and you get a bowl of soup and a cracker and they'll provide it and if you're good to them you get a cracker and a half that's their vision for you\nIt's actually making billions of dollars and don't have their own island with armed guards because of the cheap labor because there are people who worked for you know a dollar a day this is what this is what the open borders society is after\n\nSome kind of a global order where the leaks are protected and they were all over the pro war Terri\n\n[laughter] I mean is there is there any other explanation they could possibly happen there's let's like Fifteen hundred people come into the United states in a caravan\nJust come in because their economic refugees who's not an economic reputation the entire African continent\nTo come here every one of them at the economic reputation is all of South America could be economic refugees four billion people that don't have the luxury ... well yeah because the economic registered\n\nSo where is this going and why isn't this on the ballot and why aren't we talking about this and jobs in the economy\nAnd why are we talking about this other nonsense like the hooker I mean why are we talking about this it's unbelievable to me talking about losing control of the methods Twenty one days\nOut of the Republicans want to when they should be talking about two things keeping the sovereignty of your nation so that you have\nIn America for your children because it\nIs being absorbed in going away and the liberals don't want it they don't want an American they\nWeren't open borders global a society no different here than in any other country or there are no countries just land masters and cheap labor I don't know what they what they should be talking about the great\nEconomy instead we're talking about\nStormy Daniels\nDon't care about Stormy Daniels I don't care about the porn actress I don't care that his thank God I don't care about any of this ... thing I'm tired of talking about that but you can't get away from it because that\nDisturbs the international order of things and if you have sovereign governments you\nNeed international or otherwise you'd go to open borders and then it doesn't matter the owner\nConsulates this one world government I mean I don't know what the liberals are trying to do here with the open borders I really don't get I get what Goldman Sachs is doing they wouldn't make as much money as it possibly can in the short period of time they can so they get all the money and buy an island and have guards and yeah\nI get that but\nAnd I get in the short term the liberals want open borders they get she quotes cheap cheap labor but at some point\nIt breaks\nAnd then they have the power and then what do they do that while they go to some other type of a society I don't know apartments that he wanted to transform America maybe that's it\nBut he can help me eight eight eight or you know John\nH worried oh John if there's no borders no country\n\nSo you got Fifteen hundred people your your your to cut their eight off\nAnd then the military should go down at the border and not let them in because the consequence is the next time it's fifty thousand up to the other\nHalf of them are going to make it over on on income or\nThe other half will get apprehended and get caught and released by the Fifteen how could actually go back\nThe others don't show up and then they called her friends say I'm In I'm In wherever Denver here's my cell phone number oh this was from my bomber phone I guess you'd call for free and come over then the next week\nI got a house like in the bomber call when I got for food stamps welfare kids were in school they don't speak English but to bad\nSchool have to figure it out and a lot better than it was because I'm an economic refugee\nAnd by the way a let me fill out the form here not check the box and I'll do vote because of people I'm voting for will make sure that I stay here they I don't know who they are I Can't read English but I Can't read a ... and that's that I don't know how else to explain this maybe you've got a better a better answer to me\nI really don't know\nNick in Virginia Beach as they couldn't agree more the open border crowd hates America\nShe's not all of them some of them just want money\n\nGoldman Sachs lower Manhattan and a gangster bank stirs that support all the stuff they love America but they love money more money rich money\n\nThey want bigger bonuses how do they do that cheap labor\n\nHigher stock prices fell off make money when American implodes they'll have the gold you'll have nothing\nThey're really\nThey're really and Goldman Sachs\nWall Street lower Manhattan\nWashington lobbyists oh we'll have the money so they will do the things people will always have the money it's you and I that", "show_name": "The Glenn Beck
