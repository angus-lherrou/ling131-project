telling me for months as Bob who was going to make this race I'm from New Jersey so I don't believe any of us all lives as far as I'm concerned but but now you got you got this thing as a as\nA uh the cook report saying it's a toss up is this real\nYou know I I think what the cook reporters doing is they have a really broad definition of a toss up I also consider the cruise missile alert a raise a toss up for 'em and clearly a Ted Cruz's is heavily favored to win that I think look I'm going to New York city um\nEvery time the only thing we watch on our local TV is the local news and every single commercial break at least one and a campaign commercials on that Senate\nRace or the Democrats are just port six million dollars more into the race in the last couple of weeks they are concerned and then they had a terrible favorability ratings uh football it's still New Jersey I I think it would be a maybe not completely shocking outcome but it would certainly be a very\nBig surprise it's Menendez loses that race\nI don't think he's got to lose I think that's just like those of us from New Jersey area like come on I'll forget it I think it's it's it's like people come in I\nThink that's part of the reality of this if this was a strong Republican years something must be different on it I suspect that race will be closer than most other contest in New Jersey but at the end of the day I think the Mendez goes back\nOkay so you mentioned something interesting ah Scott you said that seven or\n... in your most recent polling that the generic ballot difference between Republicans and Democrats had narrowed to seven and you said seven is enough to live in this environment the Democrats control the house uh obviously the math is easier to do is higher than seven they have a better\nChance oh what a what I mean I could do something about what is the number where you would say wow I think Republicans can actually hanging on\nBy one or two or maybe three is ask why is that\nAnd this is what he's talking about a national polls doesn't translate directly raced to race but I I think most people I certainly would say if the Republicans\nHoles before points that are favored to take the house that's five points are six points then you're kind of a toss up territory and then as you move up to seven points that hire a C C ... are are clearly favors then once I should point out you know we're talking\nAbout it being close right now with all of these races like Republican turnout is a bit higher they have a chance to hang on to the house but the other side of it is if the Democratic\nTurnout is higher than project in the Republican stay home the Democrats forget twenty three seats there you have a chance to get something like forty seats or forty five cities on a very good turnout nights so this\nOut and this idea of how close races are is something very important to the south\nRight because uh when you said what I'm going\nOn here is twelve are gone right we all know that you're so that that just looks legitimate twelve or costs so that leads right eat all I've been seeing\nThat they need to learn more to win control right now there are just over thirty races that are too close to call right now and they're highly competitive and if the Democrats when liberals\nThirty one they take control so clearly they have the edge and I should also point out says if the Democrats don't win control is they'll still pick up significant getting nobody's thirty one competitive races twenty nine of them are held by Republicans\nRight so they they would have to ... and and if they run the run the table right and that's where they get that's where they get the forty forty five seats waves take off right and uh\nWhat so if you do the math for those listening to us right now how tough it is for Republicans hold the house is a snake you lose eleven of the thirty seats that are rights that are tied right now actually ten\nThey can only lose ten of the thirties after one of the thirty I'm treated at right here in Virginia one is tied one of the Republican is slightly ahead of the second district Scottsdale or a day brat Abigail Spanberger tired and then a\nWatch than it had a top stocks in northern Virginia so in a blue wave Jay\nVery the district of all those as a Republican several good\nEvening or they can win two of the three are all three let's get the final word in from Elaine Elaine ah it's all of a quarter Scott it's all about Republicans turning out right that's that's really nice things days it's all about turning out\nAnd set out what what's your message we we we we have a couple of races in Virginia specifically where the libertarian is taking votes away from the Republican exits wing it what was your message

violent movies the video games you know John it's there's just too much money on the table because you can produce a new popular video game that is horrifying\nAnd detailed murder or rape or all kinds of things that you know really are not healthy and they make a billion dollars for the day literally that's possible and in some of these games that are coming out\nAh there's no will to roll that

them so they're simply released and\nThey disappear into the interior of the country some people say ten thousand today a hundred thousand tomorrow what is your position congressman on a caravan\nYeah well my my position is that and a\nHalf and I asked her and one of the leaders are here today after we won a fight big electric four years ago there was a huge embassy bills all through Congress that went down\nIn flames the next day it's a bystander fairly clear on it for the last thing that we're talking about pillows motor you're in a commercial with pillows you back in the primary both of them together promoting very progressive I guarantee that you're gathered and that's what you're going to get\nRight with the Democrats my opponent just want to say that in the seventh district part she says everything it's not the main terms right she says you're let everybody here and we're going to have a legal pathways ... as long as people work hard I mean the caravan income in the open borders she won't say otherwise she won't give it up or bounties\nFor sanctuary cities which is even worse and she won't come out and say that instead she praises the in the negative she says we should enforce federal law just left localities\nDeal with caravans coming in to the country went under the Constitution's the federal government has given that\nIt's already there and so I I don't think people pack the serve area what he's actually saying she's not saying don't follow federal law she sang legit you nor the law of the land and\nShe is running at Wal are forced to make it a spring floods knocked follows the law of the land and that's probably why I\nHave the support of the fraternal order of police down here and if you're going to talk of the sheriff's they're horrified right they have to deal with a massive inflow with drugs three hundred million lethal doses affecting all him across the border just this year and then human trafficking uh basically\nInto just humid evil that's coming through the border and all of our fears know about it and not the people are starting to see the real impact most families have\nParents to face to face it terrible scenario with a loved one with the drug addiction opioid heroin in ... knowledge cetera and spreading through the seventh district your knees every sheriff will tell you that and so you could have a more stark comparison rights are Democrats\nOpen borders or not and then raise all the costs who pays education emergency rooms welfare scored by the taxpayer does our joke Democrats\nPromotes everybody to come in and they want to get more votes than the American taxpayer pays the bills and and so he said none of this should be construed as being anti immigrant we're a nation of immigrants which we have a legal system for a million immigrants per year a\nHit this country is a melting pot all the people that wants to cover all children of God but that it has\nTo be not legally the reason they're leading Guatemala and Honduras El Salvador's because the rule of law has broken down\nAnd if you look at the blue states if people are moving from blue states to red states the reason they're leaving blue states and blue cities like San Francisco Chicago and New York is a crime is rampant in Democrats precincts they are not good rule of law they say they are and\nAll the evidence shows it's very clear where people are moving they're moving to red states and then a lot of those slugs from blue wants to change the red states turning blue so it makes no sense I think the American people are starting to get a real handle on how all these things are hurting their lives and their roots demanding change\nSo cumbersome specifically what should be done to stop the care of it you want to stop it what specifically should we do is to stop it from entering the in the United states\nYeah well it's like you said to catch and release is incredibly problematic\nOnce you put one foot here under US law you're given a certain legal status as you've got to keep that from happening answer the president is doing the right thing working with Mexico that\nShe writes Mexico has offered asylum folks are coming from Guatemala Honduras has said that if they're really seeking asylum you go to the first neighboring country which show that trip solve the problem\nProper folks are saying right and they've been interviewed I Know we want jobs ... jobs is not asylum\n\nHarm a refreshing from your government and so what we've got to get it straight I think the White House is a mess and uh\nWe we need to change the law and and this will again if you show the American people if you can you imagine if you say you have to take care of their you're sending a message to eight billion for people on the planet that\nHey United States has a generous welfare state boy you got to do is get caravan\nOf skills as ignore the rule of law a comment there highway through Mexico takes you know ignore the rule of law out there a barge into the U.S assumes that you're you get all the ... entitled to either the welfare programs education free emergency real everything taxpayers got to pay for it\nAnd it's it's that simple the American people have to reject that or will lose the rule of law this country where all the time I Want to thank God\nJames I'm Brett I'm germs race very very close friends um thank you for being with us again next that were coming out\nYou know what you're saying is probably the Democrats are going to win all the Republicans are allowed to work you do not do anything

like with your friends are these are sort of leaders stand with our community and I\nWas just one of the most horrific things that I've ever seen and I'm just hosted all kinds of anti Semitic stuff on social media and then a\nLot of nature you forty seven and\nWays that we should look into the availability for somebody that's obviously you know the law enforcement was looking at sort of social media posts as their potential uh legislation\nOr something that we might do in order to\nWhat were you know we I approached by a red\nFlag that those are those\nAre going to pass things you're very different states from California and Florida every Republican governor but we could also help our federal level\nBecause that would allow people to intervene in horse racing is the perfect picture

we all have our first right and people can say whatever they want to put it out there\nBut a lot of course there's also if you look at her house and look at her down to increase you know type of

the truth and that to me it's great to have you with us today with a fake news resulted again with state polls coming at you all over the place they make these pulled up to drive a fake narrative don't believe them is the same thing they did a Jew thousand sixteen they're doubling down there one of the press the Republican volunteer banks that's\nNow we get another one right now\nI just I don't know that some crazy person is doing it but it just seems awfully odd to me it's hard to get\nHere's the thing is the Democrats\nThe Schumer is the the the whole crowd that whole mob over there that were screaming we must have the FBI investigate before we can vote on Kavanaugh there must be a full investigation before we can vote on him before we can decide\nWhether he should uh be you know didn't send to the Supreme Court right\nThe same thing we must have an FBI investigation before we can let that happen\nThey're not even waiting for the FBI to investigate where the bombs are coming from before they start blaming President Trump declared President Trump guilty responsible for the whole thing they're not waiting for the FBI to investigate these are the same people that three weeks ago\nSaid we cannot do anything until the FBI finishes its investigation so I mean they're total hypocrites it it is absolutely\nIrresponsible or beyond counterproductive it's absolutely you're responsible for them to be saying this is all about because of the President Trump uh they're they're trying to they're trying to score political points off this which you have\nTo ask who benefits from these bombs that's all I'm not saying who did it it it's\nObviously some crazy person because no sane person sends bombs or fake bombs through the mail we don't know the bombs are real are fake or they emptied out some firecrackers\nPut it in a in a in the toilet paper two and a a attached to digital watch to to make it look like a scary thing we don't all the time it's easy to scare people what can I tell you\nWe don't know and I'm not going to go down that road what I can say is whoever did it is crazy in one way or another whether they're sort of fire bleed can be committed to an institution crazy\nOr just that they've got a screw loose you don't do that kind of normal people well adjusted people don't do that okay by definition\nAbout you can't have the column today very makes the point that when John Kennedy was assassinated\nLee Harvey Oswald who defected to the Soviet Union was pro Cuba or he was\nFound to be the shooter or yet who got blamed for the John birth society and all the conservative so this is not the first time that the guilt by association or let's\nLet's let's slammed the conservative what's blame everything on conservative\nPackages so\nIt's a everybody's got to calm down take a breath and\nAh I think Sarah Sanders had it right we should be coming together the president is calling for unity dialing down the rhetoric a and the Democrats are going in the opposite direction they're they're they're blaming the president unequivocal east no question about\nIt taking no responsibility whatsoever\nFor calling the guy look at this guy Brennan the president's guilty of treason what's the what's the penalty for treason that he's basically a former head of the CIA\nHad been out they're calling for the president to be home by the neck until dead and this is not considered inflammatory rhetoric I it's\nIt it's disgusting the whole thing is just the hypocritical these people will go down to the as the all time great is hypocrites\nDisaster something Curtis I think you make a great analogy places as of the Democrats who cried at screens and wind about cabinet\nGetting the FBI not investigating everything I mean why don't we just wait here I mean the FBI seems to be home again in southern Florida that got to come up with a report pretty so we're going to find out the answer why not just weights\nRight exactly how about everybody say calm\nDown let's we got we we have the FBI on the case unless this guy was a or gal or ... or ... or whatever [laughter] whatever it was\nThey created these packages unless that fantasy was staged very very very sophisticated person or a boat and invite and if they were very sophisticated they were able to cover their tracks\nBut considering the number of packages delivered to these various places that's coming out of one place\nAnd there are a lot of clues there and I'm confident that the FBI will be able to figure something out here and find out who did it for narrow it down\nAnd the fact that they use Debbie Wasserman Schultz as a return address\nThat's kind of interesting in itself Debbie Wasserman Schultz the one who was forced to step down from head of the Democratic National Committee a because\nShe had been reading the system for Hillary against Bernie I don't know what that means but it's sort of an interesting clue you know maybe somebody fuck that was funny to use her name out all these bombs I don't know uh but my point is that\nUnless this was a very sophisticated operations that they knew how to cover their tracks at every step of the way you've got twelve packages now that the FBI is investigating it let's wait for the FBI to figure this out to come up with something yeah why not wait before you start\nA and and why not why are they not waiting because they want to politicize the Democrats are missing\nWell it's uh it it seems like it it just seems odd to me that that all this is happening like last week I mean that's what everybody's saying let's wait meantime let's get to the economy will get to the Taliban invasion after the bottom of the hour a\nBut let's get to the new economic numbers that just came out the gross domestic product GDP growing another three and a half percent now let me just say what this means right this is the first time we've had\nBack to back quarters or in a very long time of of of over three and a half percent growth back to back and consumer confidence uh up at an all time I can see we're spending ...\nPercent another great a quarter of economic growth this is more bad news for the damn thing I Want to talk about\nThis that they don't want to talk about the economy or jobs or the growth so what did they talk about\nThey talk about all they talk about it and they've got this wonderful thing to talk about it was horrible thing to talk about here with the with the bombs and they talk about the president\nAgain they're following it they don't realize they're pulling into a trap and and it's their own tropic crop of their own making\nPeople don't want to hear the Democrats talk about the president they want to hear Democrats or Republicans the politicians in Washington talk about what they're what the politicians are going to do for them to make their likes\nBetter write what I I I go to work every day I got a family to support I got a job uh I'd like to get a raise what are you going to do to make that happen how are we going to make my life better easier make me rich uh make make make my kids you know healthier talking\nAbout President Trump talking about you're\nA Native American DNA doesn't do that [laughter]\nI wouldn't do that [noise] talking about President Trump\nAre causing the bomb scare doesn't do that so they are going back to the for the last two years only been talking about as President Trump is a Russian agent and now they're President Trump as a Russian agent who Craig creates bomb scares I mean\nThey're they're they're not doing themselves any favorites\nUh Dave and on the other side I mean it burns very clear jobs not mobs President Trump and the Trump Administration have created the best economic conditions in this country\nIn in the generation the best we've seen in ten twenty\nYears and that is goes a long way that that dancers people's questions what have you done for me lately you've gotten me a job he's gotten me a raise you've gotten my kids on food stamps he got kicked out of the basement there on their own now\nGreat thank you very much\nLet me ask you something I'm going to pose this question and then you got to answer it when it gets back so stay with us for another segment you got to get the bottom of the hour but\nAll over I mean I\nGo back to when I was going\nAnd these are the people coming out of the woodwork coming\nOut of the hills coming out of a bally's\nComing out of the towns coming out of their farms coming to vote for Trump never voted before and uh so yeah\nIt is there is a feeling of things I hear all of the national generic ballot polls are meaningless national elections\nOther they're all like I mean it's all fake falls I I've been talking all day about\nThe Washington Post poll that came out yesterday that shows Jennifer Wexton they had a Barbara Comstock energy\nIs temperature district like Thirteen log on in life and when she says she's a favorite no doubt that's a very tough district for the Republicans are when barb is\nWhat every internal poll that the Republicans have from the White House to the end or CC's too Barbara down shows the race question does not have a Thirteen slavery but this is what the Washington Post dogs they get a uh\nThey get a ridiculous methodology to get a hold of fake analysis of it to do fake news to get a fake inclusion drawn so they can continue or take narrative and like we've already been down this path so now I'm going to start hauling them on how\nRidiculous that isn't their job right now it's the same sense by the way round the John perfect radio network I Am your Godzilla of the truth in America were eleven days out\nTo the biggest ... election ever Curtis Ellis is with us he's a senior policy adviser for America first policy of this segment you buy the job creators network you know both sides of sang it this is about turnout\nCurtis just said the same thing the upcoming election image of us may be the most important you've ever seen there's a lot of allergies your candidate your tax cuts are on the ballot the American economy grew in another three and a half percent on the ballot are great hope that our renaissance\nThat's on the ballot to the wall is on the south\nIn your jobs are on the ballot your sins jobs that\nThey just kinda moved out of the basement that's on the ballot your race your wages you're for what changes as small business owners like me tax cuts uh yeah that's about it and here's the biggest issue on the ballot eleven days who's in charge of America's future politicians and corrupted crap\nSaid the deep state of Washington DC where are you if you want to preserve the victories of the past two years I'm urging you got to get involved this November yeah I Know you've got to vote yes I Know you've got to do early voting I Know that I can count on you for that what you got to do\nMore to make the choice election dot com the choice you elections are jobs they'll make it easy for you to get involved to make\nYou can take your calls I don't have a car no problem you can make the coffee there's all kinds of things that you can do but you got to get involved big choice election dot com because the only way you lose the Jews as an Eighteen is\nIf you don't show up and you don't work if you turn out and volunteer you're going to win big choice you let it die every vote matters big choice election dot com junior park jumped out work by the other guy just five\nOr six sort of big choice elections dismisses pay for an authorized by the job\nCreators network we wanna walk them all of our listeners other brand new talk station in West Richmond and ... counties W J what five to ...\nStay with us starts a talk show talk all those things are pretty close it down and we started with coverage right where the disruptor after me is just the can't wait for that he's not going\nTo say to friday to fighting Joe ... show work with her to tell us a senior advisor America First policies curse looks into the caravan\nGet through the caravan Margie column I the the bombs that they're going to bomb rushed the border it's a bummer I\nWant to say one more thing about the uh about the election before that you just said it's about turnout\nAnd that's what this is all about you've got the polls you got all this nonsense calls you've got this that it's about identifying\nVoters [noise] sometimes pockets of twenty five voters here voters they're Seventy five voted is there a hundred there distinct pockets of voters that are on our side\nIn identifying them and getting them out to the polls that's what this was going to come down to\nThat's what it's coming down to\nThe Republican National committee and others are doing a great job of that and uh that's what's going to determine this as much as all that it's probably more than all the TV ads and everything else so I encourage everyone to go out and vote and bringing your friends and if they're going to vote\nFor the other side's don't bring them to take me out of their tires\nI don't know you cannot don't do that we don't do that\nBecause you're lucky if you if you have a democratic neighbor and they're going to vote jeep all the way down and they can't get to the polls you don't have\nRise to the polls racing are you are so nice\nTo get them around as we once every ... everybody that have that opportunity to go get him out and get them a couple of coffee because at the end of this you're still your neighbor\nThat Shrek ... still Americans were in this together in this together\nAnd you know what you can disagree and not getting that you have to oh good okay\nNow the caravan now that what the air out of the tires there that's a good idea but\n[laughter] other gentlemen is very different because that's an invasion okay how do we stop it\nHow do we stop it you don't let them in the country don't let them in the country they're here to gain the sitting there trying to they're going to try it\nThey're they've all been taught to say the words credible fear they have credible fear credible fear of what credible fear of not getting a job credible fear of having to live off mangoes and bananas\nAre rather than a food stamps and welfare or so once they get to the United states and it's a set foot on American soil and say the words credible fear they qualified for that triggers the whole asylum seeking\nProcedure and once they're in ... in the silent seeking procedure\nAll of the interlocking court cases and ruins and judges by these state judges say you can't hold them you can't detain them you have to release them and give them a date to appear and they never appeared they disappear and they just disappear\nInto the woodwork they get hired by corrupt big business bosses want cheap labor\nThey get sheltered by a corrupt sentimental is who think all the let's invite the entire world to live in America that's going to do everybody a great big favor and it just becomes a big mess so the way to stop to not let them into the United states in the first place to stop them at the border build the wall\nTo wall literally and figuratively President Trump\nIs sending up to a thousand troops deploying the military on the border uh that's what the military is supposed to do defend our country and we're going to defend the country in Afghanistan and defend the country in Iraq and defend the country and to boot where we have troops\nHow about we defend the country in Tijuana in Mexico the Mexican border and in Texas\nThat's right in San Diego and
