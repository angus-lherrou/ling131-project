states so they bleep it has no right to any territory anywhere so so long as they repeat that position you're ... you're not going to get anywhere\nWith Edward uranium here to John predicts radio networks he's alive in Cairo, Egypt he's our\nCorrespondent for the John triggers radio network in the middle east is also with the voice of America and he's with CBS News Coeur smarter for very long time covering a Middle Eastern affairs [noise] so let me ask you this and we're Hamas\nWhy would the Hamas not be in favor of some sort of a two state solution to give the Palestinian people their own nation why would they be in opposition to that what's the alternative just perpetual war\nUm I think many a radical militant Islam is try the the Hamas people or the Muslim Brotherhood and they ultimately believe that they're going to a bank push Israel anyway um but what they're aiming for right now is\nTo have their own little independent conclave enclave in God's problem and they are are they were going to sign a deal with Israel for a long term truce\nAgreement which I think since Israel because they don't really want to see Israel doesn't really apparently want to see a two state solution anyway so they would be happy to\nSee God's that guy's a stand and West Bank is than to end up\nHave those two sides not reconcile opposite God's job the Hamas people found\nThat Egypt was pushing them to come to some sort of an agreement with a with a president a bath and then they just stuck\nTheir foot down and that sort of squashed the long term truce deal with Israel so I think they're willing to have a long term truce deal with Israel but just not to have a um a two state solution\nSo it sounds like what you're saying is that the president's grand plan here to bring peace to this region um which they've not unveiled other than we know that involves two states because they think that\nWhat you're saying is that are in your estimation your analysis that Jared Kushner plan is going nowhere whatever that might be\nI I don't want to be that pessimistic I mean it looks that way but I mean you know the middle east are very unpredictable anything could change\nThe change on the ground is mostly been the result of complex and I shudder to think that that's going to happen again but it could very well because the\nMiddle East is the tender box and could go up at any minute in any particular place the amount of people keep organizing their their protest on friday and they keep a plane to Arab News stations that there are people are getting killed after they marched them into the into harm's way um\nAnd the Israelis are not budging an inch on a this to say solution so I don't think either side is willing to make the necessary um moves towards a peace deal and die as I said once again we could see a conflict\nThat would set the whole place up by a conflict that could ultimately have results on the ground\nWell the only hope here is that I think what the president has done in moving the embassy to Jerusalem the U.S embassy is he gangs Israel the biggest shift they wanted right at the outset and it got that done and of course a President Abbas were saying at the un in his speech that based on that\nHe doesn't want the U.S fall you can't trust them he doesn't have their best interest he says one hundred percent aligned with Israel so why would I negotiate with them\nBut the other side of the coin is that the president now a a in a position where he can ask the Israeli government for a number of concessions\nBecause he's already given that the ... the one big thing they want it right so that I think that's what the strategy is now whether or not Edward that's got to play out I have no idea but\nIt's ... it's a pleasure right I mean at least it's a plan and we'll ... we'll see what happens but I don't know I think your analysis is spot on President Abbas\nSays he's really in a lose lose situation because\nHamas is not going to sign off on anything he does so then the other question becomes how are you better off getting a the facilitator and they're just um just to go shopping with Hamas or you better off\n\nI think that they they are\nA lot closer to an agreement with Hamas than they are without bath I'm an a bath isn't a bad position a internally with respect to his own party and if he made concessions ... with his own party could could toppled him he's an old man I think he's eighty three now\nReady for getting close to eighty four\nHe's had heart problems and uh\nI I I I think with all the pressure the Egyptians are put on him I think he would have come up with the deal if you cut out a so I think logistically a with respect to his own party he's not able to come up with a deal never mind with Ahmad [noise] um so you've got a lot of players here that are unstable\nUm I don't want to analyze the\nIsraeli situation because Everytime you you you ...\nAs well um and you remember of course a prime minister or being ... who was shot 'em so ultimately or if he were to making a deal make a deal and they work to agree on it to God God only knows if there would be somebody out there to shoot him as well so um [noise] there's so many\nSo many fudge factors in this kind of a a situation that it's difficult to see how you could move forward but President Trump is the merits of trying new things every time you look at him so I mean I I give him credit for that and who knows you might think of a new a new plan [noise]\nWhen I looked at least she's trying we're trying to do something uh so I I\nI really didn't like the fact that the president leads that he was he was a ... he was going towards the two state solution because\nMany of us really want to see the solved that don't have um some of the viruses that go with either side you really can't see this ever getting solved without without each country having their own state I mean you just can't see it and I thought the president was spot on\nWhen he says the Palestinian people have a right to be self self rule they certainly shouldn't be\nYou know wanting to download the Israelis and I think that makes I think that makes a lot of sense and we're only got a couple more minutes I Want to get very quickly to um the Turkish situation\nWhere the Turks plane now in in this whole thing like in ... I've only got two minutes but to find\nTurkish foreign policy right now as it relates to the Gulf and Syria and then left where where where where are they\nTurkey is divided because they were trading main trading partners are\nIran Iran is in trouble so they need to you know they need to find new outlets the countries there are there other main ally grabbed a president or the one he's a Muslim is he's a Muslim Brotherhood guy\nAnd he's in a corner being in a bind because he he's\nHe needs to come to an agreement with the Russians I despite the fact that there are opposed to his positions in Syria and with respect to the comic world in general um he had to walk into the line and a cut cut deals with President ...\nAnd that's what they sort of dining in Lebanon north of Syria a so he's struggling aligned with everybody he's making compromises while at the same time uh putting out harsh rhetoric um so I think\nAre under the surface he's trying to come to terms with both the U.S because they keep saying that\nThey're going to be put down a you know patrolling the north of Syria together it hasn't happened um I suspect that may not happen but I think they're trying to repair those bridges they've tried to repair bridges with Israel despite the fact that there are on bad terms about benefits\nEconomically with his current trouble with it trade with Iran and a lot of people want putting gas and oil pipelines and that sort of trying to cut deals here in a ship afloat [noise]\nAll right we'll see what place out any uranium from Cairo\nJ.

by the way uh with us on Thursday an Abigail\nOr she her staff put out a statement saying that\nThe ... campaign had cancelled all the debates and they weren't having it including by the ... campaign that responded to that and let me\nRead their statement this is from the Dave ... for Congress reelection campaign [noise]\nUh they said this is nothing more than the spanberger campaign trying to

the second to debate\nWith a spanberger campaign [noise] when you simply want honest terms with both candidates [noise] having equal opportunities to present their arguments in a fair for um [noise]\nSo here's what happened and I got out of the [noise] the spanberger can paint told me that\nFifteen which will be covered by CSPAN and coal pepper [noise] they said the second debate which was October twenty fifth in Richmond by CBS [noise] uh that\nThey had not they had backed out of that commitment and I was pushing for a date for my debate and the ... campaign was saying we can't get a date from day [noise] so I called the ... campaign and here's what they said\nThey said the fifteenth is good we never agree to the twenty fifth and we've\nNever agreed to a date for her fragrances radio debate that's what they told me they\nAgreed to have it but they didn't agree with that that's true and what the ... campaign told me it is they were going to do the first debate and the Fifteen and see how it goes [noise]\nAnd they were also criticized the spanberger campaign they said they were negotiating in bad faith [noise] and that they wanted to dictate the terms [noise] so and that's where we stand right now so both camps claiming\nBlaming the other um [noise] but the ... campaign\nAbsolutely denying that the TV debate on the fifteenth has been cancelled they said that is still on and that they wanted to go forward and see how that debate goes on what they were concerned about\nIs three things [noise] that spanberger people stacking the audience with anti ...\nActivists [noise] I'm liberal moderators not giving each candidate a fair opportunity to engage in express their views and basically by a format\nThat turns into a sideshow [noise] so that's what they the bride campaign said they were concerned about the spanberger people basically said that's just not true we don't want to dictate anything\nI can only talk from my experience in negotiating the format of my debate I submitted it today they said fine [noise] I submitted the spanberger and they had a number\nOf changes they want it [noise] so I can only go from my experience I don't know what happened with these other the other debates but I have a format\nThat has proven successful on the radio a sentence to Katie priced campaign manager brat\nShe had she said five signed off on it then sent it to spanberger I'm Justin ... communications director and they have certain revisions put the Russians were not a big deal I mean the only thing\nI'm not agreeing to but that doesn't work on the radio is questions from\nThat's simply does not work in a radio format so we're not doing that and I think you will have something where the audience kept submit questions but you know giving people microphones instead standing up you can't follow it on the radio so we're not doing that so I reached are rejected that other than\nThat I think that a few minor changes I mean they were cosmetic a time and things of that nature and it was like an hour and Fifteen minutes anyway\nA debate or both camps signed off on it with minor revisions and that was that so I don't I don't know what went on with the Richmond debate with CBS I've no idea although I did try to get CBS engage with me and they turned it\nDown and said they had this whole big it's kind of a debate rules so I'm not sure how

they all drove it people forget that I remember and you remember the Republicans drove this\nAnd they really believe that you know this was open trade open borders everything was going to be fine\nAnd look at Wall Street driven right they got they got big donations by Wall Street\nLower Manhattan or they have one focused and that's on the ownership class that's on if you are an owner things will be good for you because you make more money and they workers as please\nTake commodity the first thing you learn in economics\nThey talk to you about diminishing resources and supply and demand and they say the number one they get caught the businesses why\nLabor labor labor right\nI mean you learn that as a sophomore in high school\nSo it never stop no uh we're with Curtis Ellis eat the senior policy adviser for America first policies he's also the chairman of Emirates just of the American jobs alive Curtis or worked in the Trump Administration and the department of labor he was also on the campaign\nCurtis so way out for us this is a great victory for American workers American farmers lay out like the top three or four changes\nAnd housing positively affect the Americans going from and then you have to be able to United States Mexico candidate or us and say hey\nThe top ah some of the top changes increases the amount of a car or that must be made in North America it increases it up to Seventy five percent three quarters of the car to enter the United states duty free\nThree quarters of that automobile must be made\nIn the United states it increases\nThe amount of dairy products that the United states can sell in Canada so that our dairy farmers in upstate New York Wisconsin and the northern tier in California a lot of dairy in California [noise] number one dairy state America\nWill have a greater access not just to Canada to third countries speakers Canada under this agreement\nWill reduce subsidies to the dairy products\nExports to third countries it subsidizes its access theory production\nAnd a ... under cuts are prices in third countries are you there yes\nOkay I heard a click I wasn't sure [noise]\nAnd uh it it it\nIt increases protections\nFor more digital trade intellectual property rights in the digital trade which of course did not exist at all and the previous now after ... there was no digital trade there was no Internet ah there was a and and what's happened over the last twenty five years\nIs Canada putting all these crazy a protections in requirements and regulations so that Americans couldn't even sell stuff to Canadians on E. bay or ... it became virtually impossible\nSo a e commerce is now increased we can now actually sell stuff to Canadians over the Internet and um that that we couldn't do before and I was told that I'm ... I'm Still trying to check this out there and get an agreement there is a stipulation\nIn the U.S MCA that if Canada or Mexico enters a traitor\nThey're the biggest non market economy out there\nIf they do all bets are off we can withdraw from NAFTA and we can withdraw from our trade agreement with that country so basically what they say you can't set up the Mexico or Canada can't\nEnter into a trade deal with China and then trying to be calm and they use NAFTA as a way to get there it's the subsidized goods into the United states\nRight and that's that's what that's what was happening on NAFTA\nAnd that was also what was going to happen on steroids if we if we pass TPP exactly the Chinese she like rather than shipping the good a straight to the you you you you us they go to Mexico or they go to Canada and become part of that\nAnd we already have a trade deal right yeah yeah yeah you know the\n... the other huge thing about this since it's a step back for a minute and look at the big picture master was supposed to be the first step in the free trade area of the Americas right first we bring together North America countries\nThen we get kept or Central America free trade agreement and the next step was going to be the free trade area of the Americas from\nFrom tierra del sway you go to the north pole one big happy free trade zone and then we saw was with ti ti ti Trans Pacific partnership we were going to bring in the other side of the Pacific as well and see all of these things are part of the\nOf the vision the grand vision of creating a border was world and I am not exaggerating this is not some John birth society conspiracy top ...\nIs the fact the wall Street Journal again they have said\nOn the record there should be a law or they want to amend the constitution to add a ditch sprays there shall be no borders that is the dream of the global is of the global is corporations the fortunes fifty the fortune five corporations\nThey want no borders no nations they don't want pesky things like\nCongress or the president's ah ... making it difficult for them to do their thing anywhere on earth to find cheap labor over here find cheap minerals over their combined them into third place and sell them into fourth place that's their vision it's been laid out before\nIn front of Congress this is not a conspiracy [noise]\nThis new deal recognize that we have a country and we are entitled to have a country and it is a privilege for people in other countries to sell their goods in America is not a right it is a privilege we ever right to make things under our laws\nA labor laws environmental laws whatever laws that are good for the American people can decide what are the conditions in the situation for\nPrivate property right respect it off and you can make things to do well and have a good living in this country if you're from another country you're competing is from another country they privileged to be allowed to sell stuff in this country NATO right\nAbsolutely Curtis something better than anyone would kind of had a thank you for being with us [noise]\nI've only got twenty second I got to change topics and ask for a yes or no answer that's common\nPrimed fight Saturday afternoon yes yes yes yes I also say yes I think he gets on Saturday afternoon\nEverybody is predicting a western victory except me are predicting a Barbara Comstock victory and\nI could start by this and we're going to bring Iran but uh I think it was a week ago or two weeks ago right two weeks ago I covered that yeah two weeks ago or ... I don't remember I covered theme or Latin county debate between uh Jennifer Wexton\nBarbara ... and we ran out live on the radio and\nTo tell you that was [noise] that was the biggest thing crushing I'd ever seen in my life partner is that the top of her getting all all property was rattle off solution after solution after solution success after success after success plan after playing after plan\nMean I was embarrassed for actually uh I went to Paris for Jennifer it was so bad it was like she was a dilated and\nThere was a lot of talk after that debate like who prepared or and what the deal was but um you know what is what it is so okay ... joining us now when he declared her the huge debate picture Barbara Comstock hey\nGood to have you with us\nGreat to have done good morning\nUm what was the deal in that debate I\nReally expected Jennifer to do better than that I was embarrassed for her\nWell what can we focus on results versus read that they have you done a lot and we can go now to resolve that I heard a guy that I worked on a part of who promoted our prosperity you know the tax cuts and the economic growth me out for\n... percent economic growth a booming economy that is you know making a lot more thing possible you could\nPass a budget that has a record for things like Alzheimer's research and get a research report for veterans the largest military\nOf course these are all things that she resisted\nThe agenda that I'm getting attacked down the ad that they have up right now attacking me\nIs an eighty two percent bipartisan agenda that included things like you know record funding for opioid addiction treatment and education and if he hadn't told oh she's doing is resisting and when you actually look at her legislative record is standing cruel\nShe doesn't have any job accomplishments nothing on our website about anything she got jobs ... jobs because that was not as focused and tell when she was there with the chamber\nIs networks on things she focused on you know that the job they read this then\nLeft wing number one liberal candidate who's opposed things as reasonable as that's just too soon for victims victims of domestic and sexual abuse cheer posed that a justice near as opposed to oppose the bill one of the first thing she oppose\nWhen she was elected in the state Senate was a bell I had to help victims of domestic\nA bill that Scott ... told me was that great bill and on and he voted for so this is how far out of touch she and she doesn't have a record I mean a bunch of her ... she started her bills Joey says I vote I have a bunch of built our town it's things like moving the\nBorders of current events and all of these little you know changing papers the file in court you know there's nothing major but she's passed she's a follower NATO leader that thinks they toxic she has not been able to get Twenty one vote to understand that because I think you need to get to pass the major bill\nAnd this is somebody who cannot go out work across the aisle to get anything major with Twenty one people\nNow when you go to Congress you need two hundred and Eighteen and I've done that and I've gotten my bills and things like my two thousand dollar child tax credit got it into the tax bill got my colleagues to support that my project steak neighborhood which providing\nMore funding right for a crime and put a gun to fight crime drug crime and and and the Thirteen daring crimes perks that that's in the score card that they're attacking\nSo she just doesn't have a record to run on for a dollar each that's been to San negative and it's going to fail because people just to pick someone focused on their priority and getting resolved on prosperity public safety and national security not a racist or his that's out fighting you know saying no to everything\nWell look I think it was obvious in the debate and\nYou know it's fun to go to your party crowds and resist and said Trump stocks and all that get round up but then when you go into the debate stage you have to be able to articulate a vision and set of policies the odd we just want to resist the other guy and\nI think that's where she fell down in this debate or she really didn't have anything and then are closing statements\nTo be honest so I don't think she did her yeah\nThis is somebody Jennifer ... percent\nHas been campaigning with former\nRepresentative Jim Moran now this is the man who had not one but two I call the police time for abusive behavior known for by one and this is somebody seems hypocritical campaign says not called out its single Democrat not\nBill Clinton not John Conyers not Keith Ellison who I still you know that they can see a coach hair and\nOther members of Democrats who are still there that I have a casual and get on the elevator which has been called out and then go on to them or their behavior or insured hypocritical a\nUh styling part and then I don't think as we've just got paid for it to someone who mindlessly attacked George Mason university for naming their law school\nAfter Justice Scalia and you know getting thirty million dollars per scholarship as a result [noise]\nLet me ask you this the last time

to acknowledge that are just a big win by the way you're tired of winning yet MSNBC\nCuts six [noise]\n\nMake no mistake political waiting for President Trump it's a problem with me promise kept feeling good about it he talked about it according to eleven o'clock Rose Garden a back seat also been reading about it but yeah I think that like the top line takeaway is that it opens Canada up to the farmers\nYeah hey even MSNBC as a liberal or left wing fake news that they are have to admit it's a big win for the president I Will get the phone lines of gets I I've been in Woodbridge I've been here on the air\n[noise] your are good morning saying I haven't talked to you in a while and a mistrial die I Do have you on my on my work\nI don't think you mentioned this morning or something that senator um [noise] oh now I'm In South Carolina senator\nUh what's his name a limo Lindsey Graham\nWas on the last night and he meant just hoping rather interesting and I thought I get your feedback on it [noise]\nAnd it's really simple it's their target on can't get enough votes to get parents are\nCloser to the next President Trump doubled down on your point to him as a candidate for the Supreme Court position [noise] become a little extreme issue for the nation to vote on [noise]\nAnd I thought that was rather an interesting [noise] I'm actually pretty smart way to deal with this if we don't get enough votes to your plate becomes more politically cetera so I thought I'd throw that that you wonder if you're a peanut and [noise]\nIt's a gamble that I wouldn't take\nBecause well that's if we don't get the vote in the Senate\nRight right because you have to think if he doesn't get the votes in the Senate it was something in the FBI report that disturb somebody and then the actually Irene port become like the campaign as you I don't want to talk about this hour to talk about the economy I mean anything to me that takes away from the economy is bad\nI think it'd be goes down or if I went to president I Would nominate Coney Barrett the next day like if the vote it's Saturday\nAnd he goes down right right right on Monday I Would nominate company ...\nI Would make her the campaign issue I Would make the whole travesty of the Senate to campaign issue\nBut I Would get Kavanaugh off the table because now we're going to be real leather gaining all these are people that are going to come out of the wood work see told somebody's pig tails and middle school or something he got in a fight with ... when he got off the basketball but who knows what they're going to come up with\nThat is just a distraction so I I I think that's a horrible idea\nMaybe they'll do it I Would not advise that I Would nominate a more or less than it is when Lindsey\nGraham's advising a dictator and they're less I just wanted her to get your your thoughts on it and uh [noise]\nI sure would actually was just not a good one ah but I suspect since we're talking about it and say well why not because I think the American people are there\nAre short of something that was true and then beyond a background investigation that would get exposed short of that I don't know I think it written [noise]\nMaybe generate more people to vote for Republicans throughout the country but [noise] I just wanted to throw that out there\nAnd I just don't hear\nToday so why don't like\nI don't like anything about it because I think it it would take all the focus all the economy and I think you've already motivated the Republican base\nHe only beret and yeah I Would push that and I would I Would make that the campaign issue and you know good morning feeding her she's got nine ... ... I mean good good good luck with that one\nIn supporter of your position actually kind of wondering matter what it would be kind of an aunt Amy\nBarrett we've reached the ... election will lead to a guy who's going to get on to the Supreme Court is Kevin can't make it so I really actually reporting is is a valid one um [noise]", "show_name": "The Glenn Beck Program", "year": "2018", "city": "Portsmouth", "day": "02"}
