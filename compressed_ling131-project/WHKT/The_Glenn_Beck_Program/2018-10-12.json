Jimmy government this unlimited power\nOf surveillance and its eventual began to come around and bite you in the bud center that's exactly what happened\nBut I had the same very similar conversation yesterday with the drug could be odd because I asked him point blank argue gathering information including the president phone calls and of course he's\nButter and said oh I Can't answer that they're setting cancer for my answer is yes there was an article about two or three years ago saying that they recorded Christine hungry to President Obama's\nA phone call and then they minimize sandwich making cakes or to mark his name now but I order is it to tell when President Obama or President Trump is talking to a foreign leader your they're\nHaving their voices [noise] even if you're minimized or you know a marked out the names that you can't tell who the oysters are but we shouldn't be doing now we're listening to members of Congress is conversations were listening to journalists conversations businessmen and women covers\nThis database without a judge is Warren and my point him was in I think he didn't understand it or didn't understand if you're recording things on potential terrorists from overseas to cost the government really apply\nBut if they're talking to Americans or just random people are talking to America and we do get constitutional protections because many of the phone call our discussions with terrorists in fact the vast majority are innocent international phone calls\nAnd so we have had this discussion with them and uh it should be protected by the knocking back some say the Fourth Amendment John Adams says the spark that led to the revolution hurt when you're like the British soldiers coming into our houses you know breaking down the door to see if we take our stamp tax [noise]\nUh we really wanted protection that we wanted to say the government and never come to your house or take in private conversations are belonging without talking to a judge first\nWell and that's a that's why you were so adamantly opposed to when you were a predictor of the future when this whole thing\nSenator or you've also been a very strong voice on the disappearance of ... to show the there's a lot of talk about what should be done and we want more information\nAnd like I get that but as a member the Foreign Relations committee you're the only senator that has proposed action which is until we get answers on his disappearance because\nThe center of the thing is we have a videotape showing that he went in there was nobody on tape showing that he went out and I'm a crown prince NBS Mohammed bin Salman says uh the camera footage was corrupted or the battery went dead\nThat they can't really only by that is like\nThe dog ate my homework

[noise] parents a weird to realize that for every action or something and that's a blowback\nFrom us being involved in some Mr gotten civil war is one that we actually create more terrorists but here's the other possible thing that's going to happen\nAgain or what happened in Libya when we toppled Gadhafi we got chaos and more terrorism it became a breeding ground for terrorism market\nHere is that there is some remnants fairly fairly strong ram that it okay to India and we're not fighting them that we're mixing are stricter civil war between the ... and the salaries and also with Iranian influence as well but my fear is thirty centered that chaos\nAnd that you get the rise of al ... says the same thing happened in Syria or their civil war and we got involved in standard in the
