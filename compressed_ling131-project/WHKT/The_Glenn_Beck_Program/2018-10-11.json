we have gotten ... here and we're fighting for every one of those families and that's why we have a wide audience racist because we're in touch and we know is that correct\nOr every year majority leader Kevin McCarthy yesterday went to the southern border the United states and he says he's going to introduce a bill in the next few days there basically would bond President Trump's border wall to the tune of a twenty four billion dollars which\nIs what they estimate will be needed and he wants to make that a litmus test hey I'm turning it kind of turning that issue funding the wall as to\nA a mid term basically a referendum or is that something that you are in favor of or not\n[noise] so I voted for that and you know what the fuck for gas is back when they had that remember that gang of eight if they had\nYeah forty billion dollars for charity and that bill so it from outside on immigration has always included\nAnd try to include um any airport security will be a finding of well I mean you have multiple outweighs the border security and not just the opposite of doing that and so that it's always been part of an immigration problem I\nThink the president put forward that you have that resist any minority that ... you have to cross the line of attack anything\nJust because it's the president is putting forward and I think we've got to get half you know when I was in Congress was probably about ... I didn't have pose\nDealing with the opioid crisis or doing you know him cure including funding cut about supporting here and this is what's going on right now we're just really\nHurt the country so we can get it and it's got some of the experience on border security should happen with foreign to work with people in our area near the water you clay by the conversation was if we can just sit down and get that compromise\nBecause that is that and that is kind of terms have been on the table and a lot of different ways and I appreciate\nThat the president I Want to compromise on on ... where he might not have been there before but now he is he's put forward that a leader in my car than feeling that the Democrats need to come to the table [noise]\nOkay let's get to ... to show a Barbara and this is very troubling to me and a lot of people this is journal yeah this is\nNorthern Virginia a he was an employee of an American company the Washington Post he was very critical and his uh post articles in tweets and other things about the current Saudi regime under Mohammed bin Salman very critical now we have we have FBI intel leak\nThat or into sources said\nThat the Saudis were attempting to lure him back into Saudi Arabia in an effort to interrogate him and then we would assume put them in jail\nHe goes into the extent bowl a Sony constantly in Turkey to get paper work\nSo that he can get married or that he can a show the Turkish authorities that he is legally do [noise] course in Saudi Arabia so that he can get married to his Turkish fiance and do the do the right thing we have footage of them going in we have no footage of him coming out\nTurkish authorities are saying that there was fall play involved meantime we're funding Turkish military were selling them arms\nWhat's the deal here\nAgree are clearly [noise] appearing I think there's a lot of things we you know like [noise] the information we have to say\nThat I ever had a really great like a credit something on you know value happy [noise] somebody trying to tell the truth about what's going on\nYou know he can be very important\nTo find out what year\nAre you well there you know finding out and that could take forever and I think having been solved and just kind of underestimated the media frenzy here he thought it was kind of die out\nI thought the president or President Trump is doing a massively brilliant thing and in fighting the Turkish fiance um ... uh to the White House that's going to put\nMore immediate focus on that Rand Paul has called for an immediate suspension of sales of or any armaments to Saudi Arabia\nUntil they can they can provide evidence that he's okay or something are you in favor that\nI didn't go\nRent way see Rand Paul and is one and he's he's on with me in five minutes he has proposed suspension out [noise]\n[noise] [noise]\n[noise] yes [noise] [noise] [noise]\nThat we're at a time when I think a lot of different [noise] okay [noise] [noise] [noise]\nWe're all the time that you Barbara for being with us a Republican congresswoman Barbara Comstock representing the temperature ... district of Virginia she's up for a third term I don't remember six Barbara people want more information or do they go\nBy\nWhat they're getting a lot for example the Hillary Clinton yesterday in California LAN when I hear it\nOn the brink of athletes [laughter]\nWeb site again\nBarbara Congress dot com\nBubble gum sorry for Congress dot com can't get easier than that Barbara thanks for being with us Rand Paul coming up James right here\nArtists in Republican and Democrats have backed this sort of the state from getting on the information and there's been good at that as well\nI just want to remind our listeners that everybody knows that listens to me I Would vehemently opposed to Patriot Act one son of Patriot Act when it's sunset it or you were a lonely voice in the U.S Senate I remember you did\nThe filibuster for sometime in opposing and questioning\nOr the ... of the Patriot act you were right and then you are right now I was right then I'm right now and just so my audience knows this whole Pfizer thing\nA with Carter Page and a easy dropping out of the Trump campaign and the phony Pfizer Warren none of that could have happened without the Patriot act that set that up and you're the one that said you keep covering ... given government is unlimited power\nUp surveillance and its eventual began to come around and bite you in the bud center that's exactly what happened\nBy having the same very strained conversation yesterday with the FBI because I asked him point blank argue gathering up information including suppressed phone calls and of course he's fighter and said oh I Can't answer that are there shuttering\nAnd the answer for him I said the answer is yes there was an article about two or three years ago saying that they recorded Fifteen hundred of President Obama's a phone call and then they minimize him which means that sort of mark his name now but is it to tell when President Obama or President Trump was talking to a foreign leader here their\nTheir voices [noise] even if you minimize or you know a marked out and you can't tell her the voices are but we shouldn't be doing\nBusinessmen and women conversation and they're recording and then they're out there and then the FBI can search this database without a just war on and my point him was and I think he didn't understand it or didn't understand it is [noise]\nIf you're recording things on potential terrorists from overseeing that how it goes really apply\nBut if they're talking to Americans or just random people are talking to America and we do get constitutional protections because many of the phone call the arc discussions with terrorists in fact the vast majority are innocent international phone calls\nAnd so we have had this discussion with them and uh it should be protected by the knocking back some\nSay the Fourth Amendment you know John Adams set of the spark that led to the revolution\nBecause when you get in like the British soldiers coming into our houses you know breaking down there to see if we think are stamp tax [noise]\nAh we really wanted protection and we wanted to say the government and never come at your house or take any of your private conversations are belongings without talking to a judge first\nWell that's a that's why you were so adamantly opposed to when you were a predictor of the future with this whole thing senator uh\nYou've also been a very strong voice on the disappearance of\n... to show the there's a lot of talk about what should be done and we want more information and like I get that but as a member of Foreign Relations committee you're the only senator that has proposed action which is until we get answers on his disappearance because\nCenter the thing is we haven't videotape showing that he went in there is nobody takes showing that he went out and I'm a crown prince NBS Mohammed bin Salman says uh the camera footage was corrupted or the battery went dead\nThey can't really only by that is like the dog ate my homework I didn't get ever ready battery and so the battery died\nNow you have called for an immediate suspension of ah the arms sales to the Saudis until we get some kind of a satisfactory answer can you elaborate on that sir\nI think everybody should remember that Saudi Arabia is the largest state sponsor of radical Islam around the world what I mean by that or if they had been funding for director\nMadrid authors in Pakistan intermediate Castillo scenes in the United states\nTeaching critical west hatred of Christianity and teaching radical violent jihad this is just south of your car we shouldn't be selling a weapon simply because of drought Fifteen of the Nineteen hijackers who came here were from Saudi Arabia\nSaudi Arabia is a great big part of our terrorism problem they are they've funders of terrorism and teaching of radical Islam around the world this latest episode\nOr I see no way that this could have happened without there being a thought to private planes were clean guys on on some of them have been argued linked to Saudi security Services Intelligence [noise] um [noise] no it doesn't pass the smell test and uh [noise] you know we just\nThe arms sales are the only thing they listen to in addition to them killing a journalist [noise] they're paying tens of thousands of civilians killed in Yemen they're doing with our bombs when we're we feel when they're flying\nThere and it's like and two weeks ago or three weeks ago they killed the school bus full of children school children were killed\nA year ago they killed a hundred and fifty people in a recession and we wonder why someone in Yemen wants to drop a bomb on and kill or either a Saudi are killing American because they climb the fragments of the bombs are saying you know America and so we have to realize their reaction or some action and that's a blowback\nFrom us being involved in some Mr gotten civil war\nA is one that we actually create more terrorists but here's the other possible thing that's going to happen\nAgain or what happened in Libya when we toppled Gadhafi we got chaos in more terrorism it became a breeding ground for terrorism market\nHere is that there is some remnants fairly fairly strong remnants of al ... and yet we're not fighting them that we're a metric are stricter civil war between ... and the salaries and also with Iranian influence as well the ... center at the office and that you get the rise of al ... the same thing happened\nIn Syria or is that civil war and we got involved in standard in the chaos you got the rise of ISIS\nWill actually the network that I go on a gym near a couple of months ago was reporting that al Qaida fighters were actually given safe haven by the by the Saudi forces in Yemen in ... in in order to fight the who the so\nCalled this wouldn't you wouldn't be surprising to hear that the Saudis support in Syria they support her down news round which is essentially an offshoot of al ... so the Saudis are always poor people who hate America who has a western ways\nAnd yet we kinda big arms on the president says oh it for a job for a job that's not something that we should be\nConsidering what we argue arms deals we need to be considering our national security not trying to have some sort of Keynesian jobs cook\nYou're on the John triggers radio network truck in the truth across America where with\nKentucky Senator Rand Paul Republicans on the Foreign Relations committee a he's been the strongest voice in the U.S Senate on how we react to the ... to ... disappearance\nSo have you recommended this to the president\nCenter have you want to direct conversation because remember a look when I was an original Trump supporter everybody knows day when he came down the escalator he campaigned on getting out of these entanglements not staying in the have you had a direct conversation with the president on how we should react to this\nNonsense for killing a journalist and he does know my feeling was talking about once every week or two and we have our conversation as a general ours by saying that uh he has the same instincts as that I Do that with the Internet\n... instincts on Syria or that we shouldn't stay forever and\nYet he's surrounded by the state forever crowd that's the real problem is I think the president's instincts are good I'm sort of in the crowd at what the president bigger president right and\nYet the people surrounding him are I think a too often you know part of the traditional foreign policy around here which is going to stay forever and bankrupt America\nSenator pull all the president has invested a lot of political capital in the Saudis and it was the first place then he went in his first foreign visit a NBS came to the United states he did his media tour with them the Saudis spend a ton of money\nOn media PR as you know uh in in in the swamp\nAnd so he's put a lot of uh and and you know we kind of look the other way when MPs rounding people up jailed him in that hotel whatever they did\nThis the ministry gentle has looked the other way is this fact our relationship with the Saudis and my ... and tying it to that if you're going to change the president's position on the Saudi book Fargo of the state of Qatar where we have our\nBiggest military base in the middle east [noise]\nYeah I'm not so sure he changed his mind he seems to be ...\nOn a continuing to sell arms to Saudi Arabia I think Congress is also the same way they're going to put up some protests and say they object to this journalist being killed but there's there's billions
