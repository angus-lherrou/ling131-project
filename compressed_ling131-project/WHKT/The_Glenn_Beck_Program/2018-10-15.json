like\nYou got this brand new car and you just said you got a promotion raised at work and boy what about the Trump economy what do you think\nAnd it's a classic response and his wife I think the Republicans still have a shot to hold the house so she says well I don't like Trump as you know because you know I got to get on my car and they know who I Am on my TV or whatever and she's like well you know unlike you guys they don't like Trump I I don't like any does [noise]\nAh but she says I Do have to admit this economy he's got this really great\nSo then uh the my wife says well what are you going to do on November six and she's like a well I'm certainly not going to do anything to jeopardize this economy and that was her comment and\nI'm telling you there are so many Democrats like that out there that uh they might say they don't like Trump and they might say that there's been a poll or whatever but they don't want to and they don't want to do anything to screw this economy up\nAnd certainly putting Nancy Pelosi in charge is a prescription for disaster joining us now is Elaine Parker she's the chief operating officer\nOf job creators networking lane great to have you with us\nCan learning things for\nElaine these are economic numbers continue to just done people\nThe ah the the level of growth that we're having the newest unemployment report coming out to about ten days ago three point seven percent unemployment ... this is the lowest recorded on unemployment in the United states we've had since Nineteen sixty not\nWear the county where does the phenomenal Trump autonomy rank and they're just [noise]\nWell the health care in the economy just about all over the country are the top your shoes national security is important to many and in some states like Arizona immigration is a critical issue\nSo economy everywhere is one of the top two issues but I think you or your framing of the question is a little bit off you know in a while you know I've talked to about this a lot\nAbout the economy is great there is not as much of an awareness there was not\nA lot of voters are giving credit to the Trump and Republican policies that match creating a bit of a disconnect\nWow that's a I mean it's unfortunate and to me every day that goes by where the Republicans are not talking about the economy and jobs and\nPromotions and raises and you know the other thing or to give you a Elaine back involves C. E. O. of um chief operating officer of the jobs created network\nElaine another thing that is not readily talking about is the number of people now that are comfortable changing jobs Elaine ah\nWhich is another number that is off the uh CNN polling radar screen if you will but the number of people that were in jobs have dinner particularly want to be in or didn't like or one happy but in the Obama economy one percent one percent growth\nThey were afraid to move now you're getting movement from one level to the other people changing companies going more comfortable that they can make that move can you expand on that way\nAbsolutely and that's just all part of what I was talking about earlier rent having more out of all people died about fixing the hotel charged\nThem early when people are out there and and there's always a skills match on the jobs that are available and there is overseeing leaders riding on his side of the market and how it how to work and people are feeling comfortable and looking at\nOther opportunities we've got other opportunities for people who are taking their first stats on going to start their own company\nAnd the parents that child molestation had taken that make on health insurance more affordable for small business and sell providers through to get emotional health clans people are able to take at least\nAt a meeting and they weren't able to just\nBecause the cost of health insurance on and that was actually how can translate actually set fire\nTo survey last week\nWe found that the percentage of people are willing to give up their doctor mhm\nOn or their current plan on for a federal court and on the fact that people want access to health insurance they want access to affordable insurance and they see that the government has a role and sharing the fact that not providing it\nSo ah let's get back to Scott Ross\nThat issue going to show up on November six I noticed that\nThe Democrats come on my show now uh one of the major talking points are well Republican X Y or Z voted against a extending brings thinking nations when they voted to replace repeal Obamacare where's that showing up\nAnd that that is a fear that gets ... that people want to make sure that everyone has access to quality health care and to the greed of the church like that is believed that this person is going to lead to ending coverage for those with preexisting conditions that so that that are just ploy\nI'm obviously there's something that Republicans would say is true is er misrepresentation\nOf the vote to misrepresentation of legal actions that have been taking 'em so clarify what happens there is it's really because again Americans do want everybody to have access to health insurance to want to make sure it's\nHorrible they they're not aware of Ghana somebody activities the lenders mentioned some of the policies that have made less expensive plans\nAvailable which increases acts of 'em but probably of ending spending on health care you know the flashpoint a scary thought is in no kidding it's somebody in any condition and let me play she's going to be unable to get access to health care\nAnd so that's a leading the Britain driving some some people um yes to vote the other way I think you will if the if the Democrats get in and they're not going to end the bombing here\nI mean it's just as a side and it was kind of amazing because um two thousand ten and the Tea Party and all that we covered all all that and getting rid of Obamacare was like everybody's number one issue\nAnd now the polling numbers show that you know people have accepted it they're comfortable with it they they don't want to change it so um how how do you reconcile that\nIt's very simple that health care system ... wrote her the whole bombers here it was not by Obamacare people still believe that the system is broken [noise] um but it's no longer be the sole to find any part of health care discussion\nBecause it's been in place now for several years people aren't quite sure what is it a lot of the lake or don't like 'em have anything to do with Obamacare what we know is that people want to have more choice in their own and making their own decisions on health insurance [noise] we know that they are wary very wary of having the federal\nGovernment take over the healthcare system um there are a number of things that you would\nSay would be opposed to what Obamacare are put into parties but people are you know President Obama has now been out of office for a few years his policy was past eight years ago people want to deal with the system as it is and make it better um and they don't see either side really having a solution to that at this\nElaine Parker how do we\nWhat twenty two days remaining honey jet maximum exposure to get Republicans out on November sick how do we do is\nI think we have to keep talking about the economy and connecting the economy to the policies that the administration like the tax cuts in jobs that tend to the cutting of regulation um we did a poll a couple of weeks ago\nI'm asking who how many Americans and that there's been a tax cut and about a third of them said they didn't even know that they had their taxes I\nMean that's that's the stand shall we should be talking about um that the fact that five million Americans die each increase and it's been done as a result of that turns out that not just the people the companies that put out\nPress releases we got numbers just small main street small businesses to get ... has been getting raises and hiring people standing or businesses you just don't put out press releases about it so we know good things are happening for employees\nWe know people are getting money back in our paycheck to small businesses hiring or you know the economy's doing well but we have to be talking about it and educating Americans about that\n[noise] so uh what what is the advice that you have for Republicans that are running in tight races or how would you change their or encourage them to change their message in order to take advantage of the tremendous economy we have the one\nWell I mean I think it's very clear that choice choice between two paintings the on this very hot economy as a result of these policies\nOr going back to um you know wage stagnation going back to a higher unemployment and um it it's about a choice\nAnd and that's why people have to educate themselves on and on the benefits that these policies cutting out a distraction\nI don't want to thank God and it'll link for being with us Scott Ross Mazen the

jobs I talked to here's I don't talk a lot again but\nUh I talked to a John be August ... electric and he said I could hire thirty electricians right now if I had if I had a qualified guys are so I think the government plays a role in that I think that not that we take it over but we can work with\nWe can work with high schools to get to get trade school training there we can work with our community colleges and and get the type of training for these trades and things like that he's a good jobs you know and so we can get it out there in and work with the private sector work with a nonprofit work with our schools\nTo be able to get jobs you know available and and create opportunity for people I think that would be a big help\nYou're on the John surgeries radio network trucking

he just has run together that they've got a check from Randy for no fly Randy open your checkbook up for heaven's sake guys in the ... he's in your district oh no I'm Sorry rent you moved to the second I forgot whatever okay\nI didn't know you I haven't been on the air [laughter] Ryan uh Ryan I'm not a fan of that Ryan let me just ask you that straight out\nYou know you're going to I'm Republican I'm Sorry ...\nThings obviously you have to get Democrats crowds to consider voting for you in order to win\nAs you're talking to Democrats Ryan what did they say well\nWe have a program let me just back up a little bit one of the things I think that makes me unique is that I'm a pastor must have been a social worker I care about a lot of the things that I Believe the African American particularly urban area's really care about\nLike we've already talked about welfare public housing I care about criminal justice reform I've seen that close and so those are things we're talking about the economy is just as you believe in I Believe is\nGoing through the roof is booming and that's good for all Americans really been good for African Americans actually the unemployment is you know as long as it's ever been\nSo we talk about the economy and as you know a lot of African Americans particularly the the conservative African Americans in the church are very conservative socially so we talk about her life and what are they saying what they're saying what what yeah\nWho are telling them but when you go to a Democrat who voted for mceachin voted for Clinton there a democratic voter and you go in a rich man or Petersburg and you say I'm Ryan McAdams I'm a Republican running for Congress blah blah blah what are they saying what\nAre they what they said to me is you're right because I'll tell them you know what the Democratic Party has done anything for you they made a lot of promises but they really haven't produced anything and they say you're right and then I say you know what and Republicans haven't come and talk to you and message to you and ask for your vote and they've taken for granted in that sense\nAnd they say you're right and I say well I'm here and I started I to me I'm not about Republican or Democrat about solutions that I have solutions for years I've conservative solutions for you\nI've got different solutions in the Democratic party has but I've got solutions for you and I believe that the work I Believe that's going to give you the jobs that you need in this community I Believe it's going to give you the redevelopment that you need opportunity zones and we talk about that I Believe\nIt's going to give you the portable housing that you need I mean we ... we're not going to solve all their problems but I Believe that hey compared to what the Democrats have given you which is nothing I mean we are a huge step up and I'm actually here I'm president you know that's the one thing that they say you know what you're here and I appreciate that\nAnd then when I tell them I'm a pastor when I tell them in a social worker\nTheir eyebrows go up you know they're like oh really and they want to know more they want to know they want to know why I'm In this race they want to know well how do you feel about the president and I tell them I said you know what I Love the president I Love his policies but I'm not the president on my own person I have a different tone a you know I have a more moderate tone I'm One that wants to be a bridge builder\nI Want to reach out I Want to bring us together on our divisive voice\nAnd say whatever you think about the Democratic party or your current congressman is he's a device avoid all he has to do is tear down tear down the president I said I'm here to build up I'm not here to to talk\nEven to tear down the Democratic party for the most part I'm here to tell you the solutions that I have for your community and you know what it resonates with people because you know what people see in me is that I'm often it just like the president I Know that you love that about the president I Love that about the president that he's an authentic guy and what he says is really what he believes whether he says it right on\nTo paint it you know just to tell you what you want to hear a but I I asked illusion I really believe that we and I believe the public can party should be going into these areas with solution and that's what we haven't done the path and that's what I'm doing I Need to do it but you know what I mean each candidate because\nI have a hard to do it and I'm I'm Nicky qualified to do it as a pastor I've worked with the African American community\nReally my whole career and a social worker I worked in public housing works or without risk youth a mentor to African American kids we we rented taekwondo program with the police department so I have credibility it's not like I've just come lately you know I've been there I've done it\nAnd they see that and they know that and we're going in African American churches same thing and I'm\nStill it resonates because you know what I think African Americans are very sensitive they they can they can read people and uh I think they they I think most of them can read where I'm coming from and my heart and so a lot to me we're getting traction what's your website Ryan McAdams for Congress\nDot com primary down for Congress dot com and he'd be Mike Pence coming in for a rally seven forty five PM ah at sun trust building enrichment on Saturday October twenty Saturday October twenty that will be hundreds website when it's like riding a catalyst for being with us Deborah recommend coming up Kevin\nFor more information go to America First policies dot org this message pays for an authorized by America First policies in corporate is joining us now Denver recommend you know just when you started when get worse after big foot\nLeslie Coburn his Democratic opponent in the fifth district\nWhere are you crazy campaign this has been because\nUh I guess when you're down so big you gotta like throw hail Mary's or something but mostly Coburn on that debate Monday Night a week ago she went after Denver's military service on the grounds he was three thousand miles away from Afghanistan at NATO support facility\nDiego Garcia while he works on plans as you know for bombing missions um apparently applying that they didn't play a big role which of course we know we did and I'm Mr ... leads a co worker\nHas been a dangerous liaison said that he was snorkeling I mean this is a really\nCrazy campaign that coal birds are running [laughter] I mean that would go to like say Denver like didn't serve okay what else they going to make up joining us now do they get us the truth is Denver Riggleman he is\nThe Republican candidate for the fifth district in Virginia that's the Lynchburg area through Rowan Oak and Denver a is running for that seat to replace the retiring\nHow are you OK so a left wing governments husbands said no you didn't pay any bombing missions or after the nine eleven attack in Afghanistan that you were snorkeling and ... Garcia\nYeah I mean I'm you know maybe I think um I think the co burns have a problem with tweeting they seem to\nThey seem to to get angry and lash out on Twitter but that's how they run their whole campaign as they they say disparaging things that make up things whether it's big foot or radical or white supremacy and you're making fun of military service or saying I don't care about women are taking things out of context and then they rushed to Twitter to their Hollywood friends\nAnd they try to make it national news because you know they have such extreme policies um and I think they're true believers but they're just so out of touch and for a\nAndrew co burned to get involved to talk about my military service for somebody who's biggest service has\nBeen you know making a fantasy books I tell you almost get to the point you just start shaking your head it's hard to take them seriously I'll tell you that and and you know they they just as parents a lot of veterans to and by the way John Diego's not the only place out there and and that's the other thing I just I don't have to defend my military service to election them\nWell it was certainly a desperate attempt I mean you've got a very very well documented military service and you were the one who was head of the group that was the other one I mean\nYeah the thirty fourth ask expeditionary bomb squad during the amount of Diego which\nYou know what I mean you've talked about many times before and you know like I always told you you know their identities situations el harm's way there you know I wasn't I was supporting a bunch of just um awesome individuals I'm never going to battle one when you talked to some of the people you know the guys who objected over the Indian Ocean or\nI was trying to keep them safe but the threats in Afghanistan and they're going after the caves and also all kinds of other things that I Can't talk about honesty than yet um you know it's just funny because they don't understand anything about military service everything they've always done is going about themselves and now\nThey don't understand they enjoyed the war against the war fighter and they thought this would be a walk over\nWhen I came as a new candidate and they're finding out right now that I'm an alley fighter and um plus you know I mean I I've had gotten stuck in my chest show you know what the ... I don't think they understand\nThe gravity of what they've done and they made this personal level I never thought somebody would\nWell they're desperate or do you what are some of her you you mentioned at the beginning of the segment Denver Riggleman you mentioned that some of their positions were extreme liberal or things just name several several of them for\nSure I mean I mean everything they are extreme you know with the Medicare for all\nYou know I'm forgiving all student you know there's one point for a trillion and student loan death a debt free community college um the fact that they she called 'em I stick to stop 'em there's other things that we have\nThat we're going to roll out I'm open borders um my goodness um you just go down the line everything that Ocasio Cortez says there's pretty much what largely Coburn\nNow she's trying to run to the middle ah she knows her positions are extreme so that's why she stays in Charlottesville she doesn't really go outside the district much anymore she likes to stay in her ... her ... and I think it really comes down to she's a true believer and I and I know what I gotta respect that I mean she was a true believer in east causes but I'm\nI'm a true believer unconstitutional policies but also and individual liberty so it is truly a war of ideas now and uh\nI just hope that the Republicans get out and vote because she's dangerous for the strictest [noise]\nWe're we're the Denver Riggleman Republican candidate for Congress in the fifth district he's running against his Democratic opponent Leslie Coburn uh she's an author and has a lot of friends in Hollywood\nAnd a Denver running for the seat and him to retire on retiring Tom Garrett\nDenver let's get to uh some of the pressing issues on the world scene today I don't want to get your opinion on a let's start with ... ... ... a so called a\nJournalist if you were living in the United states living\nIn Virginia doing a column for the Washington Post very critical of the Saudi Government goes to the consulate in this day in both for routine paperwork to get married and it's like the older Roach Motel he went in but he never came out a hurricane or\nNever came out so it's like the Saudi Roach Motel\nNow the stakes get elevated because President Trump said over the weekend um if he gets clear evidence that the Saudis were involved in this cold blooded murder within their conflict and he's in this temple he said there would be severe punishment\nThan a prince Mohammed bin Salman MPs thirty three years old turns around on Sunday fires back\nAnd says if there's any ah sanctions against announcer any retaliation or we're going to double down and we're going to affect the economy's in world markets and pull our sovereign fond and\nRaise the price of oil and et cetera I we bought this arms deal with them a hundred and ten billion dollars when they've only spent Fifteen billion\nWe've also were backing their war their civil war I'm with the Emirates in Yemen where do we go with it\nWell number one I think um shall it used to have in Saudi Arabia to have a lot more leverage uh but now the United states is the number one oil and gas producer in the world um it's very difficult for them to I think it's a you know sort of a jerk I kind of leverage on us as far as President Trump's concern\nI think he's very serious I mean if it's found out that the Saudi Government sanctioned um this type of behavior I don't\nI don't think he I don't think you're just to spend hours payments I think she'll talk about pulling any type of support I'm against the Houthis in Yemen and I you know and that is that's that is something because you know we meet really do not like Iran they are our enemies\nExtract Iran from what they're doing a state sponsor terrorism is a very important goal the United states government but on the other hand\nUm if the salaries are doing this type of behavior now you're talking about are things that we just can't get done and I think President Trump would go all the way I think he would not only sanction them and and take away their arms sales\nI think you would ignore this red on oil and I think he would start to extract support for any kind of military stuff that they're doing over in the middle east in each of a military exercises or or any type of operation so it's it is serious\nDenver the other side of it is that uh some people are saying well look or the president and the Trump Administration has invested a lot in the Saudi\nRelationship in the Nineteen months he's been there and we do have this hundred and ten billion dollar arm so but I I Want to keep pointing out that it's on paper it's a memorandum of understanding for a hundred million dollars but the only ...\nAre you yeah it's an ammo you only spent Fifteen so it it's not I mean there's there's no sign deals or anything it's just and understanding right right so it's not really want it so\nSomebody was saying you know why maybe we just we just started under the rug and move on business as usual but a Marco Rubio the other day said that whatever action we took could not be symbolic what is your take on that\nHe's he's right I mean if again if the Saudi Government participated in killing somebody and it was sanctioned and we have the proof is\nMy guest that are just going to be much more than symbolic are my guests says is probably remove all support on multiple Bronx\nAnd I would say that\nThat is going to happen if if we if we find that's been proven and you know I don't actually on that line I don't have all the classified information All right and I couldn't answer to it anyway but if something were found out I guess that would be much more symbolic I think I think reveals right and I think that's why President Trump to announce everybody\n[noise]\nTwo days or weeks on the town hall ... gallon\nPresident Trump is painting the governor of Florida Georgia as well as Alabama for their response to hurricane Michael department in and first lady took a moment to agree to print the rhyme to influence Eglin air force base earlier today and he was

will maybe you're there you go ahead\nYeah I'm here I'm a quick question for a district seven I'm Abigail Spanberger doll pace and bright orange the average uh getting out there and an advertisement and everything else and it looks like it's a significant level um from\nWhat I can see from from what I'm seeing on TV to come to my son his computer to everything I I'm just kind of concerned about what's your take on that\nHe's in trouble and it's a close race I think their\nTheir strategy in it and people know what I'm so Abigail Spanberger I have to spend a lot more money on social media and Jean the earlier to get her name out there people in the district has a very high name id\nSo I think they're going to wait here until the final Eighteen days so I Know a lot of ads are have been a purchased by their campaign\nAnd I would think that you start seeing them but look it's a very very close race and it's really going to depend on turnout\nThe saving grace cheer for the day ... campaign is in the biggest blue wave in the history of all blue waves nominees ever in Virginia\nIn two thousand Seventeen\nGillespie carry the district by three that's for saving grace and um of course there's a big debate tonight on TV that's\nTelevised that basically right now the only debate scheduled day up to more tentative debates one with me that has not been confirmed nobody's going to make a decision until after tonight but it's a very close race I still get paid the advantage\nOr because of what I said in two thousand Seventeen that because I Know for a fact that advanced are going to come late but we'll see what happens also\nThe other thing it's got on the side is a a pie in Virginia has put all of their resources in the seventh district that's a lot of people banging out doors well drained like doing what they do so but it's like it's going to be close or\nWell it out earlier Scottsdale is now up by having he's going to win that as we predicted and of course I'm the only one in ... in the United states predicting a Barbara Comstock I'm Upset victory over Jennifer Wexton and in fact I'm going to probably do my show from her\nHeadquarters we're going to order a taste of rolling rock beer and when Comstock being ... then you're going to have to pick me up off the floor to make me stop laughing\n[laughter] All right thank you for your time John Hope I've answered that Andrew\n... very well thank you\nWell let's get the Sam Nunberg Sam Nunberg on the line Sam a long time\nPolitical associate an operative of Donald J Trump these now with the uh growing Steve Bannon political action to many citizens of for the republic and a ban it's got like twenty twenty five people and there's things got a polling going all over the place\nYou involved in the district and Sam is joining us now Sam great to have you\nOn your very optimistic Republican seats in Virginia\nYeah I think uh I think Scott is going to win I think is that he and he does the Christopher Newport university poll that came out today has him up by seven in that poll always a is biased the other way\nAnd I think David gonna win by ... by tiny a mouse and uh I Know barbers going to win so yeah I'm pretty optimistic I also wanted to thank Sam Nunberg for sending me a text last night talk me off the ledge\nAfter the actual got plenty to say hey go to bed the gonna win the series so I thank you for that Sammy oh it's good to know why\nEurope that they do what they had to do the first of all they do we get one of the [noise] they get what they would win one in Boston I suspect that what do I know I thought that the Yankees were going to be [noise] me too [noise]\nBut I mean it's going to be a great team like\nIssue will come out of\nThere actually I just back Milwaukee [noise] I don't I don't really know if it's an upset but I think Milwaukee maybe\nI well I think they are also so a wedding ... agreement with that but you know and see that the problem with being a natural thing is you're paranoid right because we were losers for so long that even though we did win a championship last season is just my whole family is our annoyed so\nLook to impeach President Trump by um by Danny ... certain narrative they're not the case it's older they don't they need the older pollsters they\nDon't understand the demographic what I also think too in the following the reason I tend to\nAnd Amy [noise] they're basing it on a voting model\nOr let's say the ABC Washington Post that's on typically the ... the worst of the words that is like that is like I mean the word it in\nThe sequence of let's say the worst political you'd think governor just thinks that you know Democrats are always writing Republicans are always wrong by [noise] um [noise] they base it on a mom or whether they're looking at people that typically do vote frankly are even registered\nSome power in voting this time and they base it on the fact of the woman march on talk now\nLet me tell you something millennials are coming out the vote the way they the Democrats pollsters are putting millennials are not coming to the folks\nWho are a democratic candidates explanation second issue in the news a lot to show me a poll on them that they don't tell you if you were to real polls are drawn I looked CBS you go oh what's that poll struck forget his name he released a book and he said his book\nI'm giving it to ... to their best\nCase scenario right now for the Democrats undermined polling\nYou have the Democrats the tendency majority worst case scenario undermined polling he only has the Democrats were against the Republican House by one seat\nI still think that under national circumstances the reason he says that is because what they do is they do they're generic that way\nI remember doing these congressional race in the way they do it for congressional as opposed to the Senate races they just not paying their or accurate way to do it because of the gerrymandering the way these districts are\nThe way they pulled people let's say in the state of California the state of New York\nOr even the state of Virginia and then they put that into their poll of composite it's just not accurate it doesn't represent for what they don't waiting accurately for what they have to come out to flip Republican seats the Democrats [noise]\nPart of it so what I Want to say part of it is just simple laziness by them laziness from Kate in a way of doing their part of it is that it's very expensive look it expensive if you wanted to do what we did citizens of the American republic see parents group we spent\nTwo hundred thousand dollars I'm polling\nAnd what we did was we saw in the region the polling in the state as well we didn't even do stay we said we want to see what goes by New York right we want to see the southwest California we wanted to see\nMe we want to see um [noise] we will look at the state of Washington right where we have not where we have Washington and we said we want to see the um northern and western column of Washington right that's the way you got to do with that look I'm two hundred thousand dollars but you know\nBy something called their number two we can't let this be the Democratic October surprise I wanted to tell you something the election may not be nice to say that it is wondering as I say a lot politically correct so\nI just think we need to handle it I also agree though um we need that there is there is no reason why we cannot seldom arms that can be used against Iranian or Iranian proxy or otherwise so the Chinese will solve all too so\nThat's what I got to where we are but I think the president just seems to handle this bomb I saw the ad I Would\nStart issuing idol [noise] because I have another piece of news to me was the kind of everything from parents apple wash right so now I mean not wearing apple watch that we know that even when you are the apple watch it [noise]\nYou know the government are talking about turkey can get all your audio\nSo he clearly be clearly [noise]\nFrom all public reporting murdered this guy I don't carry this journalist was Muslim Brotherhood I don't care who is allies or I don't care what you didn't have a lot and\nIt's a relevant [noise] right [noise] cannot conduct himself because he wants to watch certain societies towards Saudi Arabia modernizing frankly NBS one Saudi Arabia to modernize\nEconomically already so he can stay in power the same way that Trump is trying to make a deal with Kim Jong un Kim Jong I'm going to give up new can stay in power right right I think that there has to be some consequences for [noise] the practice I think will announce themselves\nSam we're in complete agreement green analysis thanks for being with us Sam
