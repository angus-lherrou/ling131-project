have seven point one million jobs out there and we don't want people to cell phones so I think it's fantastic\nTo get these that's the training that they need and getting the job\nWill keep them out of trouble and keep them printing hurting repeat offenders that's the best current grant program that could ever get a job nothing\nHappens when you have the job and you're making money and a contributing to society\nAnd the thing is that line or a job for a family a raise 'em a better pay raise more take home pay a job\nIs to not read and it's not flow in your your you know what it is is great and so when you get a job you're right and when uh when when men and women feel better about\nTheir ability to support and take care of their family takes a look out for people and uh just really this is the jobs economy I mean it is incredible the number of people the other thing the other\nAuto storyline Parker was this a trumpet economy and the resurgence we're having is the number of people now that in in uh\nIn middle income jobs or um lower to middle and jumped jobs who now\nFeel comfortable in changing jobs because there's a better opportunity for that you know before this when you looked at the numbers nobody would leave a job they were in because they were scared like the next job would be there long now\nThat's changing so people that uh I have a\nBetter opportunity at another employer they're now moving to benefit themselves that's another untold story of this economy do you agree\nAbsolutely and and we're seeing people do you have those kinds of choices and employers are competing school where um\nHis rise and people are making changes in their jobs because\nThere are better opportunities that pay more an even under the tax plans it took effect is here we're going to see 'em ordinary families to be able to keep a thousand dollars more each year out of their earnings and one other thing that gets kind of an untold story and he doesn't get a lot of [noise]\nA lot of pressure on and that's a good meal because action for small business owners pastors small business owners partnerships sole proprietorship on as corporations they're able to actually feel twenty percent of their business burning from taxes which is what you were talking about you're a small business as well and they're able to reinvest that\nMoney on it now they have to reinvest it more into ah\nInto higher wages because they're competing for scarce labor Alistair for jobs\nAnd still in Queens you feel good about their choices out there and and that's that's a great thing to me he's coming in more and more and more and we'll\nKeep reminding people out on the road is that if we want to keep this this progress going this prosperity than we do have to vote for each types of policies and for the Republican hunger is that his cookies policies in place that actually never seen a party running on\nRaising taxes that's essentially what Democrats are doing and the public needs to open their ears and listening\nTo the fact that they are running on raising taxes\nIt's amazing raising taxes open borders lower wages unfettered immigration sanctuary cities\nIt's it's it's their platform is insane and I don't even know what your platform is other than sanctuary cities open borders get rid of tax cuts I\nMean I have no idea and basically their their their whole policy is trumped sucks I mean that's their platform unbelievable never seen anything like it but here's the thing you got to vote and land because you don't vote you don't matter\nFor the other thing is you got loving day she got to get involved because the other side they're working really hard you got to get involved and here's the best way to get involved with the tax\nCuts worked out top I mean I

easier for me 'cause uh you know I go on the radio with a couple of different places your feet on the road nonstop for months I've seen it myself on the buses and a great job\nAway that you've made a real difference science you\nWhen they're going on\n\n\nAmerica First policies incorporated joining us now Ryan McAdams he's a pastor he's in the fourth congressional district\nOf Virginia at the beginning of this campaign people like me had\nWritten him off or dad said he couldn't win John mceachin is the incumbent I went through this last year that Sheryll was running and he's a good guy sheriff waited they thought they were going to win that got crushed and so I'm like no way you're going to win this or you're going to win this district\nWasn't again he's doing this in a little bit of a different way this guy is everywhere in Don they teach in strongholds he's in their churches he's in their communities knocking on doors you know we just got to win the Republican areas but he's given Donald run for his money in the fourth just he just had\nVice president Pence on Saturday\nCame for a rally for macadam plus the vice\nPresident's time here with Fifteen ten days to go it's a very limited they don't go and help candidates they don't take it away because they don't have the time and he's with us now we've got so went behind his back and something that's uh Ryan McAdams running\nFor Congress Republican districts for against incumbent Democrat John mceachin that will be determined on November sex it keeps it right for a second term Ryan good to have you with us man\nJohn good morning it's great to be with you congratulations on your your radio show being expanded into the acquisition appreciate everything that you said I I Love to delete in and um thank you so much to be you can get we're being with you this morning [laughter]\nLook I think you're you're turning this into a fun race I'm not saying that you're going to win but you're turning it into a competitive race and you're working hard up to a couple of things let's start with these pipe bombs where do you make it\nYeah well you you said well uh I was listening to you and you know there's no place for some politics I think that that we've gone too far maybe on all sides of even I demonizing one another and I think we need to get back to talking about ideas and solutions and and what's bad for the American people\nAnd stop trying to paint each other you know as a you know and then it means and you know we are competitors and races but we need to get back to\nUh what is American and that is or not this type of activity that we're seeing 'em right now with bombing or what to do to hike up rhetoric um uh that we see\nIn politics today so I'm definitely for a more moderate tone in and focusing on the things that really matter to Americans\nAmerican solutions\nTo tell me a little bit about um\nYour position on this caravan right we've got ten thousand people that's basically going to bump in Russia border the United states and write as you know even though the president said he's trying to put the military there or or um\nOr or the or the national guard it's a it's not likely that he closes the border because that would close off trade and our laws are such it's very odd ride because what you stepped watch sport over the border without your dogs\nRight you're here illegally sued to step foot foot that Ryan\nAs soon as you step the other four then you've got three large protecting you basically the floors law so\nThere's nothing we can do we can't catch and release you can only keep them for twenty days if they say the word asylum you can't turn them away you have to process\nIt and you can only which you can only detain them for twenty days and the asylum process thing the backlog now Ryan two years so basically you get a piece of paper and you get released into the interior\nOf the country if you were in Congress where do you do about this caravan how do you deal with is\nYeah well there's two different issues there but let's talk about the caravan first number one is we gotta stop problem I think the president's going\nTo stop them and there's no doubt in my mind that he's going to follow through with what he said that he's not going to allow them to come in I mean I think the\nContinuing to put pressure on Mexico um I I Love what he's he's done with Honduras and brought them all and said look if if you can't stop them and then we're going to start taking our money away and her friends that were given you or whatever that looks like but I agree there's got to be consequences countries is a allowing the title thing this caravan\nLawlessness that to happen\nAcross their borders coming up our way so I think continuing to push ... number one put pressure on Mexico the doctor's care of and\nI don't know if they'll be able to do that you know if it's the Fifteen thousand strong\nNow or whatever it is but we're going to have to stop them at the border and then the second issue is what you're saying is I think that we need\nTo change those asylum laws that that when someone comes in and and I know you know this but eighty percent or ability to claim asylum will will get it um and they'll go to the process and then most of them eighty percent of them will get turned away by the courts\nAnd so there's there's this you know this connection between those claiming asylum and then does actually going before the court and then then being deemed that it's completely erroneous\nAnd so uh I think both but like you said the problem is is that once they they've gotten that that status\nPer se men they never show up for court and then they're running amok in our country and so we've got to change that so that uh and I don't know exactly what the solution will be but we've got to change\nThat to to wherever that you know they have to be more stringent policy for people seeking asylum wants to cross the border\nRyan McAdams you're right we have to close loopholes and or\nIf you just read some of the facts here in two thousand or one half of one percent of illegal illegal that cross the border claimed asylum now fifty percent climate filed by two thousand Nineteen it'll be eighty percent I mean they they they just figured it out you coming in the in the United states you get out for look if you come\nIn and you don't get apprehended then you don't get apprehended and only fifty percent are apprehended eighty five percent just come in all of the fifty percent that actually get apprehended at fifty percent of them claim asylum and then uh\nI mean they're ... they're handed a piece of paper and they have a hearing in two years they just get on a par [laughter] I mean it's it's\nAn interesting it's Saturday what is going on that a president said that and\nLike you can't get the Democrats tobacco he can't get Republicans are backing them those that are sponsored by big wall street donors and Goldman Sachs that they don't care about it they just want cheap labor to drive shareholder value so they can make a higher bonus\nAll but gone\nThe following is not an actor but a real life story

me just say in response to that rich is what you just said is\nNot a conspiracy theory that is a reasonable conjecture based on what we know right now and I don't think you would surprise\nA lot of people if indeed uh these were never meant to go off and these were sent to a influence the election or change the narrative because we're talking about that not the caravan we're talking about that not the Nazi ah\nUps of I'm Sorry I got a text that's destructive me where we're not talking about the economy and we're not talking about the caravan issues that are killing the Democrats so that is a reasonable position to take knocked conspiracy reasonable but you know\nWe don't know and um I tell you when when when Mike Pence puts say a written statement out on Twitter\nAnd says oh we're going to find these people were going to apprehend them and we're going to get the bottom of it we're going to bring up a justice um I don't take that likely I think the FBI Donnan and ah there's too many that have gone out there's gotta be films just got to be videos there's got to be fingerprints has got\nTo be something and I think it's going to be short order by the time they find who this person is but it's it's certainly to me seems suspicious\nThat's all I'm going to say it seems to me that's just thank you very thank you for that very suspect or what again thank the good lord and savior

they're going to but again we don't we don't know the fact that this might be legitimate\nThese bombs might have been meant to go off and it took it took me some crazy person or what we do know is
