for the Democratic party needs to change the constitution or maybe painting a Second Amendment which can sense right arm and I'm going to hang up and listen hearing it\nOK number one number one a very thank you for the it's a great question or not in favor of\nA constitutional convention I Know many conservatives are they think that's the only way to get a balanced budget or it just opens up the door for all kinds of crazy stuff like getting rid of the second amendment so I'm In no ah\nIn no way in favor of any constitutional convention because you don't know where it ends up and so I'm not in favor of where I Am in favor of\nThough is this executive order because there is a loophole and it's going to end up in the Supreme Court and then you've got to find out if the Kavanaugh spike was worth it or not\nCitizenship for the U.S is just no longer makes any sense what it is being exploited by illegal aliens who break the law it's just being exploited it was in there for a reason for that reason his past\nThat loophole was put there that wording was put there for a reason that the reason was something like this so it's going to be it's it's going to be executive order or\nThere's gonna be five judges that it'd be we stop it every day is going to get argued up the court system it's got to go to the Supreme Court and they're going to decide that basically you're going to need five\n\nShores to say yes this wording that was in there was in there and take a ... there has to be an exception I think ... got to be for illegal aliens\n\nI mean if you just pick up his logically you broke the law it again in the country you're here illegally or a lawbreaker and I don't think it's as if it's I have a baby the baby is a citizen and then you can be a citizen and then all you're fairly can come over and they can all be citizens and you don't even have to have a job you know you'd have to work\nHow does that make sense it's illogical illogical\nThat this is an issue that I bet you know it doesn't matter what the polling numbers size pollster calls up or if there was born in the United states do you think they should be a citizen well yes percent of Americans are\nIn favor of birthright citizenship but that's because he has to question it would be called up and said oh let me ask you a question of two people if somebody comes in the country illegally and they are breaking the law as they're\nHiding from the law there are legal and the author land because they broke the law and they have a baby illegally I mean they have a baby she that baby a U.S citizen when

topics so little time right six days before the midterm let's get right to some of the big issues okay let's start with the caravan\nThis Justin sheriff this that's reported vice Fox News reporter Griffith Jenkins is reporting a last night that's a\nMexican states reportedly providing charter buses to drive\nThe migrants stashed her to the border so they can get here before the election on Monday and bomb rushed to the border jak you're saying\nAnd showing photos that the thousand strong migrant caravan is now being shorter blocks to the u._s. for a Jenkins showed multiple professional boxes and allied jobs and boarding migrants take them\nTo the border so they could get there before the midterms what is going out who's paying for this\nWell first of all this abuse at our southern border has got to stop I Believe these reports that are coming out on this has been a political ambush from the beginning of this has been a political construct a and time for the November six election but this president has made it very clear he\nHas to remain from protecting the southern border from this trespassing this was an eastern or southern border it's a national security threat I think the president is handling\nThis on the just the way he threw it used to working with\nThese other governments Mexican Mexican Government Guatemala Honduras he's\nLooking at all these options and that's what he should be doing that sort of executive does there was\nAn executive position as a share of elect surfer Milwaukee County when people ask me what should the president do don't\nTell nobody tell the president wants to do what what is the ... to do is give him options three or four policy options given all the information that they hear the three or four things that you could consider Mr President here are the pluses of those things here of mine is the president\nAlone has to make this decision and that's what's going to\nHappen so I'm putting my trust him I said in the decision of the president Donald Trump he has not let us down before was his decision making\nAlso sending five thousand troops to the border your share a pharmacy or you were in law enforcement have very long time sharp parks or it's only got five thousand troops or under the border twenty two hundred national guardsmen guard the border plus we have our\nOwn border patrol when they get there and what did they do like how do they stop ten thousand people just come again what exactly are they going to do why are they there how do they not you know my question is how do they stop it\nYeah that's an interesting uh than it's been interesting question first of all the starting the border that's an invasion and and I'm not going to set appearance in the military should should fire on them so on and so for those decisions that the commanders\nOn me but the fact is that you cannot you illegally enter the United states do not have a right to come into the United states they can request to come in through asylum but they're violated all the principles of asylum\nAnyone they declared asylum in Mexico they weren't interested because there's a political a construct so remains\nTo be seen what they will do a I wrote a couple things mentioned they'll set up some tent cities or you know entertain them until their their immigration hearings 'cause the president's made it very clear to catch and release days are over now there's no doubt in my mind\nThat there are some activists George Will probably already has to be written out of the the the pro illegal immigration folks on the ... record and get some judge some activist\nJudge probably in the Ninth Circuit to say that the president can do this can stop can't set up tent\nCities ancillary men and I think at that point a push it to come to show because it's an intrusion upon the violation of the separation of Powers Act I think it's an intrusion on the authority under the constitution the president has\nIn these situations so I think and this president has shown that I think he by by throwing out yesterday or a potential into this uh the anchor baby situation is birthright citizenship equal to push this issue he has\nTo push push the issue because nobody else will business the fault of Congress\nJohn you know this is the fault of Congress's inability or the will to fix this broken immigration system so this is what we have but the president does have some options but I think what he's trying to do and he's trying to force Congress to act\nOn this thing so he'll throw some things out there make the courts get involved make Congress getting bothered maybe find him we'll get some action on this but I think that if at some point if the court still continue to intrude on the executive authority under the constitution I think the president has to push back I don't know how that will be\nI mean what form that will take but I think he has to push back\nSo the the president yesterday sheriff David Carr of former sheriff over walkie county sheriff Clarke the\nPresident yesterday saying look at his birthright citizenship thing makes no sense a lot of people I've been saying that because if you wind up with her babies now we've got hotel we we've got a whole cottage industry of the legal companies uh\nMainly on the west coast basically you pay to come to the United states that that gets put into\nPresident says I was going to do an executive order because there's an opening in the fourteenth amendment now we know that's got to get overturned immediately by the nice says strict in Hawaii and everything else but ah this good as I've gotten Supreme Court what do you think if if if you took the average\nPeople um where do you think this is going to fall politically do you think your average as Americans are going to say yes good ideas aggravate me make no sense or you think you've got to say no I don't\nTo mess with the fourteenth amendment or that's the constitution that's who we are how do you think an awful\nLot of this ... acre baby thing just birthright citizenship is part of the abuse right and so this has to be rectified too there's a lot of moving parts and the illegal immigration thing uh so he's just taking these one thing one of the time because\nYou have to solve the whole thing you can't just take one thing and say well we'll fix this will be okay because it won't be okay this is the use of our immigration system does anchor\nBaby situation or like the\nPeople will be on the side of the American people will be on the side of the president listen if you look at some of these other immigration issues are securing the border border wall so on and so forth\nUm pulls heavily in favor of the president said the last one I saw nearly Seventy percent of the people want to southern border security they want an end to this\nUh these sanctuary cities they\nWant an end to illegal immigration so I think the politics of it he's going to be spot on I think you've where people will be on on this side of the thing is these things take time for them to work their way through the American public and so I don't know if this banker babysitting whatever the impact on next Tuesday\nBut I Know that in the long run this president's going to force Congress to do their damn jobs while they're not\nQuestion about that your other job triggers radio

he said there or thirty seats that\nAre toss ups are in play a\nTwenty nine of those Republicans of which Democrats have to win you wherever that was a tornado or twelve of the stories if one looks the other one is that an accurate analysis\nYeah I think that in that spot on Iraq of course with the most accurate polls are twenty six you know lax about where I\nHad age wise you know I I was getting the liberal cold there is a little more leeway to lower expectations up at the liberal stereotypes yes that lean democratic and likely democratic cease its which would be pick up on\nOur ... our number ... Seventeen of Republicans pick up here so basically that means that the Democrats would start with the Fifteen feet advantage I Know you said Scott's at eleven I trust his numbers are more that the liberal calling I was looking at other\nLet's say they start with Fifteen basically they're recording I taught that see some Republicans have to win two thirds of does the encouraging thing though is up those twenty feet in Eighteen of then President Trump won\nThat stretch in many cases by double digits so it's a Trump voter become the Republican voter we can hold on to the house it might be like

Breitbart News that so let me ask you this is so like what happened\nIs that what happens if the Republicans hold up by what can you imagine wow\nI think I think that again it comes down to like I really slim majority one way or the other side that right now it's going to be five he Curt last for either party that whichever party wins um this is going to be a very very close election on November the sex or it could very well could go to the Democrats are very well could serve recover can't I don't know yet arrived\nProgress in the process of prophecy person here right like I'm not trying to be a prophet like the rest of the fund is a whole series of what they're all losers and they all or none of us know what they're talking\nAbout but the point is is that this is very close ah there if Republicans you hang on for South the expectation that's been set by the media by the political class by Democrats\nAS Nancy Pelosi made very clear on Kobe or last\nNight and she has done in in so many different other interviews over the course of the past several months and the expectation is the Democrats are taking the majority\nAnd things have been by as he joined the fall short of that\nThat is a massive loss for the Democratic party for the resistance to President Trump and is a mess when for President Trump is Republicans hold on it's like even by one city or even a few more than that what would happen here is is it easy shot in the arm for President Trump going into his reelection then we're going to seize twenty something Democrats\nRunning for president in two thousand twenty they're going to tear each other up higher risk their party to everyone President Trump's going to be able to move forward\nWith ... more Republicans at the same because on the Senate side of things bigger wasn't really good for that you have the right now so we're seeing Republicans will probably have at least fifty four maybe as many as fifty seven or more seats in the Senate African ...\nSaid something like that in the Senate and then hold their house majority we're going to be able to see President Trump do things on it even more than what he's done the first two years he's going to have\nIn Congress because not only is he going to have\nA stronger Republican Congress on both sides to Capitol Hill what you will have Republicans who were wronged gr inside the party or have to act like guys like Paul Ryan and Jeff Flake and Bob Corker as their visa these are the people that are\nThat have been criticizing President Trump and grabbing its agenda do a hall from inside the Republican Party they're not coming back it's dead people like Kevin McCarthy and doing all why I\nI'll be honest with you as a leader of the house he's been doing everything he can to help the president gets wall ride rain like we're we're Ryan handguns and put his name is well\nI'll give him an enormous amount of credit on that front I tell you Kevin try to get off Easter were three ... you know we're getting him we are getting larger blank rare to say about Gorka we're going to get Margaret makes salaries that are like Jeff Flake and in Arizona all of these are operating inside the Republican Party so we're seeing the Republican Party group who are in the president's direction but if you're able to hang on\nA new majorities it hang on to the majority of the house\nAnd get to that place where they got fifty five fifty six they're going to be a little role the Senate Democrats\nIn the end it 'cause that's what the problem right we can't get legislation sanctions there's only one Republican Senate right now\nAnd there's only and there's a hand for those that are insects solid on the issues right twins is that if we can get to the place where you got fifty five sixty six it's going to be very easy to roll the Senate Democrats were going to be able to jam them with so many major piece of legislation\nI agree there Chuck Schumer to try to shut the government down or something on while finding at that point right like we thought well that went from last year or earlier this year is not going to go so well for them now\nBut the point is that the the opportunity to end with Republicans to hold onto your house\nWell and it's got to be it's going to signal really are the total breakdown\nOf the resistance of the Democratic party you're right if the Republicans hold a house like to vote and I think I agree with you met him and saying all along and they're ... they're going to pick up five maybe six states in the U.S Senate predicting five I don't think they're going to win mansion said so I think you've got a winning five states\nI'm going to switch parties apple I don't I mean we get back after he voted for Brett Kavanaugh\nHappen I mean that might happen just like like if the Republicans win by one of the Democrats went by one or you need is one person to be promised a you know German of appropriations or something and they switch parties and you know we've seen that\nHappen I mean it could be it could be a divided house it if it's if it's if it's somebody slips flipped over its it's tied to all kinds of things that can happen I don't think that that'll be the scenario but um I tell you why for my a legacy media friends are those are the CNN\nI'm going to have to go to New York that night and lots of windows because the people will

Steve Bannon's new cool political action committee interesting sport we talked to him yesterday and are\nAre citizens for the American republic I call a car 'cause that's the way I remember it and it seems for they can't get involved with campaigns are coordinated anything that's how it works and Sam Nunberg with us now is Sam a senior advisor for the seat for Sam good to have you with us\nAn honor to have to tell me I'm I'm I'm kinda like following Bannon\nRight [laughter] it gives me every day every day I Want to know where I don't I don't know why it's just kind of fun like where are you today about it so well and I know you're traveling with him where are you\nAnd uh on Monday we had a great advantage to Trump International Las Vegas we showed that Trump asked war we had\nUm Haiti or came in Danny Tarkanian white Spanish arcane is running in the bottom three she came to the event\nWe had John Macdonald is a good friend Corey he bought a GOP chairman a he was at the event and then she had some meetings in the morning we haven't done some polling\nAnd we decided to go to Kansas very last minute so today we were so last night we landed in Topeka mhm we had a gathering of twenty five people in a small room at the Hilton and I was like ... and the holiday and express\nExcuse me is that these guys and as I talk to you see this meeting with Kris Kobach later today is even going to be talking through\nA a congregation of Catholics and that we are going to go over to ... box um Kobach a campaign headquarters to me ... years tomorrow we our region tomorrow we're re drafting we're going to be in D.C\nShe has to do CPR prior commitment he had to take in Toronto\nSaturday we're going to be in Virginia and we are taking a permit\nAll right sounds like you've got to be scheduled now I just want to\nI just wanted to let everyone know they can cause I've gotten calls from the media is a Washington Post and others are the seashore cannot coordinate with campaign so that the people think well the same breath to be there as quarry store going to be if they feel like stop 'em by like anybody else I can stop by but there they cannot\nCoordinate this with a campaign so the question is a really vote anybody could\nCome to any of their events but this is not coordinated with the campaign they don't have to get first mission because it's a sea forces separate entity and they can't coordinate with federal or state campaign so just to get that\nAnd let me tell you something we were told five easy Kansas GOP either seeing Kansas geo ski state party who either banned and Kris Kobach the Kansas City who is going to lose the districts that are next to the one I'm sitting in right now they had\nSuggested that we don't even show up in their states so we are um we are motivating the base we remember when you see\nAny where she goes to talk about that people were there twenty five people were there they could say only X amount of people showed us satisfy excuse is five and media interviews yesterday he was on all the local affiliates talking about white people have to get out\nAnd vote\nWe feel that we're saying extremely effective you don't actually do something if you want to go back to the Trump campaign I actually um one of the things I learned from Corey Lewandowski was Corey said that Trump would get a lot of media more media that you could think and I didn't think it was as much as he ended up\nI had the TV on I have not seen an ad for Republicans Democrats are spending in Kansas ... thinking about race probably over three hundred million dollars a site called when I talk to the folks here in the restaurants when I toss it up last night at our\nMen they tell me that all they hear ads of Republicans taught ... I think the you know they get these were Cuban against these um they get these big government rhinos the same people that Donald Trump or to take on there you go on the air talking about how they're going to be voting for the Democrats\nBuddy in Congress that's what the Democratic party has done here and it's pretty effective puts that said I think was the president back on the campaign trail she can you wouldn't be nationalized the election I don't believe the media let me give you a perfect example I saw the ad\nUs in Nevada three if your audience goes on Nate Silver his website right now he says if the Democrats\nWill win has a Seventy five percent chance of winning\nI tell you the Democrat has eight zero percent chance of winning that seat I tell you I haven't bought us we're going to come out of their ... plus one perhaps plus too with the way that Nevada for his credit so I don't believe in what you're hearing surge any plan behind everything we have\nTo get that many of these markets as we can there's only\nSo much that Donald Trump can do there's only so much that his allies Hindu entire you know they're saying that Donald Trump the president seemed interviews the president's about citizenship which I was I'd like to get to choose and very briefly John writes you've already said\nArticle saying here's here's the president's schedule the president that's completely abandoned house that's simply not true asking you look at the schedule that he has taken a free trip he goes\nTo school in regard to important to\nProtect speech as of now we can keep the house if we only come out of that state and they get him one day I think you know I'm not going to go over to the seat I think we'll probably lose politically correct negative one there to get one end and Rick Scott\nEnded up winning they're respected ruining Tori on Senate races on the back of Donald Trump\nHe has done something to say if the Senate if I Am going to Missouri he's able to get into those other markets that our neighboring stores so\nI spoke to the White House as well just to get their read and they have not given up on the house so whenever you people want to read whatever Paul Ryan a group wants to start telling people you know I'm sure Mr Ryan who came out against the president\nOr what the president said well she's a hundred percent writes from from a legal constitutional point of view about his executive order mine came out against it being or wrong they are wrong I think that as a as we talked frequently I taste that right now\nIf people get out and vote we will keep the house\nNow I'm not telling you were going to gain seats in the house I'm telling you is that if everybody wants to vote support the president's agenda support this movement basically support us\nThe Republicans will keep Republican controlled house illegal barbarians at the hordes hordes of the game you know polo T ... ships\nLooks that this narrative that the ... for the president has been in\nThe house is about the stupidest thing ever heard they have an eleven rallies in five days okay eleven rallies big rallies in five days now what are you going to do when you do a big rally and you get twenty thousand people well you're going to do it in this thing in the states where there's a Senate\nRace up for grabs so you can get the most bang for the box but then\nYou pick the congressional district that you need to draw Trump so he was going to Fort Myers Florida or today just what that is a competitive stink bugs in the Senate and\nHouse after that he was going to Colombia ... same thing got a Center for race and that's an important thing in the house then he's going to a joint Jew Indianapolis he's going to Montana\nTo take out tester I mean you just want to make in Georgia there was a competitive seats there", "show_name": "The Glenn Beck Program", "year": "2018", "city": "Portsmouth", "day": "31"}
