short ...\nNot um we're not having any more difficult to time than we had been having 'em in the years leading up to um today so Virginia is about two thirds cellphone\nMostly or a cell phone only users and so our sample we we actually drop samples himself\nSo we basically go into the field with the batter to third one third cell phones and landlines split already um and we haven't found our response rate on cell phones to be any different than it has been which is not great um\nYou know the people typically aren't taking cell phone calls to do surveys like they were landline calls in the seventies to do surveys\nSo we're not finding it any more difficult than we were already um I Do have colleagues around the country who are finding cell phone number is being blocked more um and and it's driven by this um all of this fishing\nThat's been going on with our cell phone numbers lately\nI Can't remember what my phone number is recall from Idaho\nAnd we we do two things that we do to try to help us with that we identify ourselves as Chris rooting for a university so we're not we're not an anonymous number or we're not\nI'm an analyst number you'll see who we are when we call and then if you say look put me on your do not call list will put you on our callers that we won't call you back or we don't have\nTo do that because you know according to the federal regulations\nWere doing research academic research we're not working we're not getting paid to do this we're not making a profit so we're considered um researchers so we don't have\nTo comply with the do not call it but we do keep our own call with this and if somebody says don't call me I don't want to do surveys then we'll put them on our do not\nCall it so we try to be transparent in that way as well\nFascinating because most people go among them do not call list so they they are because because you are academic nature you so you're a turnout model is showing forty forty five percent that's interesting because people I talked to the campaigns are they're hoping it's going to be around forty\nThat's so that's ah so it depends on who you talk to 'em it could be forty eight um\nIt could be higher I mean here's the real sort of question that I have in my head right so if there is a big blue wave if there are a lot of voters that are engaged right now who didn't even vote in twenty Seventeen then\nWe're missing them in our survey were not capturing that right and that some of the pushback I got back um when we when put out our second district poll showing Taylor leading Luria some Democrats push back and said well you're not even capturing some of the voters that were newly registering\nIn and they're going to vote okay fair enough but we have the luxury in Virginia in in that we had a twenty Seventeen election that we think captured that surge\nPretty well it it ... it brought\nRalph Northam into the governor's mansion Ralph Northam won a second district by four percent first time a Democrat or one that district in about a decade so we think we twenty Seventeen captured that search pretty well but it may be even bigger than and also Republicans may have responded\nI'm buying by engaging their base\nVoters already know if they've done that we think we capture them because they were already voters anyway um but if turnout is higher I think it's going to help\nFor Democrats because it might be that extra search that we might that might be a lot of new voters that we're not capturing\nSo you you you saw the surge I called the suburban tsunami twenty Seventeen you saw that you saw it coming in\nI think you had and we are yeah we we were we were modeling\n'em in twenty Seventeen like we are likely model if you're a what we were doing and twenty Seventeen as we were we were modeling the same way but we're also looking for new the registered voters 'em in twenty Seventy because of that was that was that\nSearch that was the difference between twenty sixteen twenty Seventeen was a lot of those new suburban voters um and so we did see the search and twenty Seventeen we all know what it looked like in Virginia\nAnd so there's nothing that says to me that that's going to be any less here than it was in twenty Seventeen and there are things that say to me it might be a little bit bigger than it than it was one twenty Seventeen and by the way in twenty Seventeen the Republicans\nWere as engaged as as you would want them to be interest that Democrats were a little bit more engaged\nSo you'd think it might be even bigger this year\nIt very well could be I don't think it can be much bigger but it very well could be um Democrats in particular are trying to register new voters or they they weren't until the deadline and Republicans I'm work trying to register new voters as much as they were trying to mobilize their their base voters that are already there so\nI mean look at both parties it's not likely to be because we don't have a really robust statewide race going on 'em and we have competitive congressional races some places are not at other places so so that's part of the reason I'm thinking\nForty five um but if it ends up being forty eight it's because there were ... there's massive turnout going on and some of these really competitive congressional races um I don't know if you're a if\nYou're if you're looking for a competitive state wide rate to drive up turn out we just don't have that this year and so that's part of the reason I'm hesitant to say it's going to go as high as forty eight but look I've been wrong many times um and I'll be wrong many times in the future\n[laughter] you know I'm not quite the same ones not close\nClose um if I you know I did what I find interesting about the statewide races that um it's not close\nYeah you see Tim Kaine campaigning in his ... his campaign campaigning as if it were close he's running ads on on every in every television network in in the commonwealth he's\nCampaigning like he's got a a more for a bit of a formidable candidate that he has and I think there are two things going on I think Tim Kaine needs to send\nThe statement that I Move beyond twenties sixteen um and and and sort of the difficulties of being a vice presidential candidate on the ticket twenty sixteen but I\nThink he's also recognizing that in some of these are really close congressional races um if he can pull any coattails um if he can run out\nOddly enough Tim Kaine is running a campaign to get re elected to the U.S Senate and running several\nCongressional campaigns to elect Democrats um in in in\nSome of these competitive races at the same time um and he doesn't really have a challenger that has a lot of money but Corey Stewart is all over local talk radio which is where his voters are going to be and so I think Corey Stewart's running the kind of campaign that he needs to run to get voters out given um how difficult situation\nHe has and how little money is\nSo you're you have a statewide poll on at\nLeast we pulled the Senate race several times and then decided it wasn't going to be competitive enough to pull it um throughout the final stretch from Labor Day on instead decided to pull these congressional races because really for the first time in probably decades in Virginia if if if a hundred and some odd years we've got\nA lot of a lot of really competitive congressional races going on so we decided to pull the congressional races instead of continuing the pole what doesn't appear to be a very competitive Senate race\nBut we're we're wrapping up here in the second what's that what you do have a final call here on what that is going to look like in the day\nWell probably somewhere Fifteen ashes mine is where my ... I'm at right now it could be a little bit higher could be a little bit lower if it's a little bit lower it's going to some of these congressional races are going to look really good for Republicans are going to be really tight if it's if it's\nHigher if it's close to the twenty and some of these democratic congressional candidates are going to have a better night I think\nFifty sixty Seventy yeah anything moving a libertarian primarily making an impact at all you\nKnow and and and and we we anticipated they might given that that you know a lot of country club Republicans might not be interested in Corey Stewart but at the end of the day we're in we're in a very tribal period of our politics and if there's an are by your name a lot of Republicans are going to vote for that are and not actually I'm a libertarian\nTheir their vote so we don't see any uptick I'm I'm among libertarian candidates either state wide or in these\nCongressional races um there's a libertarian in the tent there's libertarian seven we're not seeing any uptick with either one of them\nOkay thanks Clinton kids were calling in looked like an opportunity wash the Libertarian Party they had a chance to crack the crack the market here in Virginia they might have fallen short this is Chris and filling in for the medication and John ... come on back\nOur this morning I'm doing well crafted hope you're doing well I've got a third day this week we've seen each other I Know your stock in their own stock and yeah I haven't figured it out yet let's not go there [laughter]\nYou're the electric right now I guess so ah I don't know if you heard the last second with Clinton kid from Christopher Newport or are you seeing anything different than what Dr kids out there when I heard that\nFrom the discussion that perhaps these seeing more of a blue wave that I'm seeing I'm you know I'm In in regular contact with all our congressional campaigns on throughout the commonwealth and frankly most of them are doing really well um and\nI I Will be a surprise to become really come down to perhaps just two and a congressional districts being really in play when we get to election night\nTo just to which too\nI I see the seventh and the town's clearly or other to\nBattlegrounds right now I think the other ones that perhaps people are looking at are the steps but I think Denver Riggleman is clearly running a far superior campaign there\nAnd so I think Denver a will allow will be fined come election night on there have been some you know pocket Scott Taylor's race scotch really working hard um\nI mean it perhaps we'll be closer than we otherwise would hope but I think at the end of the day Scott\nShould be fine as well so that's where it comes back down to Barbara Comstock\nIn the tens 'em and Dave Brat and establish this way I see as this point\nBecause Dr kid he didn't mention Nebraska spanberger racing I live in a district I see it every day at least in West Maricopa County and it was a stark difference in what's going on the ground at least but I I called back\nAnd try and do the object of follow the data you follow the data that quitting kids right in front of what you're saying um the Taylor and ... are the ones that are most of the quite as far as you know changing a\nChange in your party ranks if they're accurate or use got yelled at by seven and complex down by state or nine times like that [noise]\nSo if that's consistent than his polling is accurate um it would probably show up and see if we were doing on bread spanberger imagine that he would but what he also pointed out obviously the quality of the campus important local issues are important but also what are you pointed out was he didn't see the big Kavanaugh kicker a\nThat every once in a is talking about this is going to have this big search for Republicans for if it is it's pretty quiet people make up their minds\nJust going to vote and as he said Republicans would show up admit there as\nAnd and I sort of see the latter I mean obviously what I'm looking at is anecdotally I'm Brett during a prior to the to the judge now justice Kavanaugh hearings um there was some um perhaps to stay on the part of the Republican base um but that changed\nAlmost immediately uh with those hearings and I think the Republican base and Virginia and I think the Republican base around the country saw what a Democrat majority in the United States Senate and Democrats majority in the house representatives under Speaker Pelosi would look like\nConstant um investigations calls for impeachment says the president investigations of justice Kavanaugh\nAnd so what I saw as a state party chair with a clear up tech and enthusiasm response for emails fund raising jump significantly as a result of that\nAnd I'm as it's been said before somebody is going to write a check or send some money to the party or a candidate they're more likely going to vote for that person as well so it may not be shown\nTimothy has some they're clearly wasn't enthusiasm gap between the Republicans and Democrats prior to the Kavanaugh hearings but I think that gaffes than eliminated so now it's just a matter of current and our folks out\nSo you're seeing the enthusiasm kick if I talk to Morgan Griffith about a week and a half ago and he said the same thing you said you know it was a if you were doing the scale of\nOne to ten ten being you know absolutely out of the mind showing up no matter what you said you know Democrats were around Ninety in my folks around thirties but my folks are now up around eighty so he he he\nSaid he felt it on the ground and climbed told me the same things are so from the anecdotal standpoint I Do think there is renewed a server in the in the Republican base that quite frankly is getting a lot of what they wanted the last\nElection as part of the heart attack and politics you know you know when you get what you want your show up\nAre you satisfied or you know you start and happy new stay home because things are going pretty well what what's the point uh but I think that the cabinet things sort of re energized refocused or at least the Republican base on wanting to come out and vote but you're seeing that throughout the state\nI Am and I and I think again what I think that folks realize you're right I mean are they got what they wanted and twenty sixteen we have the president and acting tax cuts the economy was booming letter was unemployment and in that case and so the price I'm complacency in that\nBut then I think now the Republican base seeing all that can get on die and very quickly with the Democrats control the house and Senate and so I think Republicans are saying we've got to roll up our sleeves then if we want to keep what we've got we've got to go to the polls and vote for it\nUsually the cycle\nOf politics right so what are the new chairman of the Republican Party in Virginia or what is the next step for RPG worry all going what should Republicans in Virginia Beach got because when you look at Virginia and Maryland\nYour to your shoes very strange electorate you have a democratic Marilyn's with a Republican governor who looks like he's going to win three Fifteen or twenty points in Virginia which has\nBeen a battleground trending now towards a blue state Tim Kaine square thinks is going to win by Fifteen offers probably maybe twenty points as well you didn't really have this dichotomy don't you all across the Potomac we're we're the dynamics in politics have changed in Massachusetts has a Republican\nGovernor or whose op polling are the leading Democrats in the states Charlie Baker you have a governor a Republican governor of Illinois um is is is the ... other Republicans in Virginia writes for the electric\nI I think what you're saying I I don't know that in our current climate in Virginia whether any of the three candidates you mentioned governor Hogan and others were secure the Republican nomination in Virginia right now but I think what we're recognizing and I and I sort of sense to perhaps a more pragmatic approach among Republicans\nI'm again coming out of the Kavanaugh hearings I'm a somebody here six months ago had mentioned you know Susan Collins and Lindsey Graham I'm sort of a stalwart so the Republican Party people to laugh but now I'm getting request us how can we bring Lindsey Graham in to speak\nIn Virginia for candidates and and have him out of it\nWhat we need to do is have a broader faced in the Republican Party that can bring conservatives to gather around core principles and perhaps uh if we agree on eighty percent of the issues we can disagree on the other twenty later on after we start winning again\n[laughter] again this is like a because look both parties are having their their uh Internet signed battles\nRight I mean the Democrats have their own battles Republicans are having their balance we're gonna have some pollsters my pollsters ah some operatives from Iowa New Hampshire calling in the nine o'clock hour she wasn't that we have one calling in from a Democrat from Ohio when Republicans New Hampshire and tell us what's going on there are things that have the the national caucuses because it was just really was the\nOnly I say I don't have time to worry about that I got to do without the stakes set it up for reelection but they're not they're not worried about twenty twenty after we went and preserve our ... in the house and Senate next year in Virginia\nAnd gently push back here because the dominant theme in American politics\nIs what's going on in Washington DC and it's being reflected back in in the states and in the local to the districts because Trump is the issue right now since since June fifteenth of twenty fifty that man has driven the conversation\nEvery day in American politics and if you know four hundred and Seventy two days away from from the Iowa caucuses people are going to be focusing on those issues but it's going to get very retail very quickly why all the Virginia races are going on and that's\nThe beauty and the dynamic of Virginia politics isn't it because we are we are the polls we take the temperature all the time\n... that's exactly right and I think um for our congressional candidates this year I think last\nYear gave them sort of a wake up call and they could say OK graft ramp to roll up our sleeves and work much harder than we thought we were going to have to and so um you're right that this year old sort of perhaps give us a preview of what we can expect and twenty nine teams but that will be a sort of it's a pulse of the of the country for as you say\nBecause we have the entire general assembly up this time next year all one hundred and forty members news or the district to the general assembly are going to be up for election and there's so many issues at play Quentin Kidd was talking about what he's seeing in his polling is that quality candidates matter\nAnd local issues matter I got an email last night from a former colleague of mine talking about a quarry in northern Virginia and uh basically local development and he was engaged on also sends out emails on traffic patterns potholes and I'm like this is not what you're doing the general assembly but if that's what the motives want they want someone talking about it\nRight but I I think that's right people are really looking for results from their elected officials and the things that are impacting most people today with a booming economy and and job I'm\nStrong and wages growing people are looking at some of those other issues that impact them on a daily basis trafficking holds up in northern Virginia as you say the potholes in and and more rural areas of the country those are the things that people are focused on now because the kitchen table issues are doing great\n\nBut he loses power from how old are you in Washington [noise]\nCheck there and say Mike Pompeo says the U.S Mexico have to tackle the

think we're in the community together you're always justice energetic smiling go get them kind of guy you know like the um you know like a Mickey Rooney was put on a show you're always just like ... are you able to maintain that\nYes you know I I I'm you know I'm blessed to represent great folks and the guy in the first district you know I get my energy from there they are\nVery very passionate individuals that work hard every day in and do do great work so it's hard not to be motivated by that but it's it's hard not to be motivated to ah by the by the true on or that it is to represent it and I appreciate that\nAre you a worn down by Washington and all\nPlayed out Chris I mean I think at certain times it's it's it does it does give you pause as to you know where we are in the country and the divisions that are out there but but I always working every day to try to find places where we agree I think I think today takes a little more effort to do that\nNow and I think that's one of the differences in Virginia which I think has a very healthy system of government operates well is that you have deadlines are constitutionally are inactive\nThat hold the line on these things you can't go to continuing resolution that's an awful term I'm all for it but they also have I I Love the single object rules in place where you where do you deal with one subject and\nThat's it so you don't have this big mash up coming back from the other from the Senate or vice versa that just blows up the whole deal\nThough I agree and and be a good thing is that in the in the U.S house we operate under the same\nRules you offering third generals every joke with what's going on you and I both know that it's\nStill you figure out the rules about how things are happening on the site has different rules so many policy gotta get combined together and you look at and go out of our service related in any way shape or form in with the big the the the most highlighted example is a political act passed\nThe title of the bill was going to be Affordable Care act they they they took they took a ... all the language you out of it with her and the title of the survey or the house version of the Affordable CARE Act so it it it's that kind of procedural stuff it's just shakes her head go why how could that happen\nBut I Would argue that you know sticking with the logic of of systems Waikiki in your business man he was the way to make sure that your debate on track you actually have a lot of\nYou know darn related or after a piece of legislation people go how does that\nGet in there and it's like you know crawling everything\nOn the last train station like well that stuff doesn't doesn't belong on the earth is not related or it's just use you know as the left as equals a pass\nThings that are unrelated so I I agree that that's one of the I think the problems up here is that it doesn't it doesn't require to necessarily pay twelve part sleep when you're using that mechanism when you have unrelated ah aspects of legislature language to bill\nOr people will just you know look at it and go how how could that happen\nWhat I Hope you're well we'll take a look at some of the rules and get more to wherever upper junior way of governing up in the city because I I one of the things that are when you pull back\nFrom politics and and watch sports people get upset when they see rules violations because they know the rules to me last night there was a pitcher Justin Berliner through as a a wider it was beautiful smart and Enron darling you was a pitcher for the Mets in the eighties and some other teams\nSaid that is a pitch is when you are warming up the you put your mic down and say grab Patel I'm done that's a perfect pitch and it was it was called the ball and the next pitch that the Boston Red Sox guy\nHit home runs and as a as I'm saying you go that's outrageous\nThe rules my way she writes you saw was that was wrong and what happens when people in politics people got they don't know the rules to get upset about that is just not cricket you're not doing it the right way guys you know we deserve better and so they pulled back it's just the city they made sure their shoulders and throw their hands\nYou know it's just it's just not working I'm On my mind the you know I I don't get it right and said this and or anything you can do to to change that would be a benefit ended my rent let's get back to the absolute let's get back to the national district what what are your voters telling you\nWell you know where he has a lot of states I think ... very interesting how do we ... a a war I'm\nIncluding shit our economy I think people are a very positive about where the hottest style ah I think they have what's called by Congress lessening regulatory burden and changing the tax code I'll keep going for businesses to host but the things that\nWants to see going forward what I call the screening parts of the economy and first of those who have an education system that assures that our children students\nGet the bustle series educational experience to be able to fulfill the jobs are there are seven point one million jobs so Chris and Seventy five percent of those jobs will not require a four year degree and that means we have to emphasize\nCareer and technical education as much as we do colon strike education because that's where the jobs are those ... are skilled jobs that have occurred as far as a career\nOr you can go from an apprentice your journey to a pastor and have a career\nThere and do well in many instances better than you wrote one of the job that requires a college degree so I think people look at that and say that's where we have to go to New Hampshire looking around and going out is going to make sure that my child is soft on like how do we make sure the education just gives\nThem that knowledge skills abilities to compete for the jobs that are available today was teacher and I think they will look at it and say hey the other things in the economy are going really well\nOf course when I talked to was a prosecutor so I can tell you the top three things they talk to me about our workforce workforce and work horse or yeah or they say well we could grow up business they\nPointed just hiring workers to jobs and it's you know there are a job opening our own build a job opening so we're really going to have this south by moslem happening in one other element to this article is\nBrought Hillary for people to come\nBack is important for us as part of education so that\nA lot of

miles and miles away and get care and quality in a car\nWithout a solid game change for road so we walk into her when she was caught on that we have to make sure we have education system sizes Korean talking about education is Washington Post college education\nAnd these are these are these are the tough issues because people don't go broadband workforce development those those don't get the people out to the\nTo the polls and they're just like no that makes sense I like that you know 'cause when when people get down into the the granular already talked about with other callers today in politics in the garbage complex and people don't like complex there like fiber bumper stickers because they're pretty busy\nTrying to make their lives working and putting that into the context of their daily lives to come out and vote whichever way is a tall order for a lot of politicians right\nSure [noise]\nPolicy is complicating types town hall of hurt all the buddy buddy or a ... a social whether elected or off off the application of this conversation and you know those\nThings that aren't project on really still hang out here or something like that I got a quick listen or people that have\nCoal and gas companies soundbites in a way to help our economy the thrill out and it's up to ... you can always say all different function that's quite in Chicago\nBut I think that's why I don't

want you to project or vision for the future about how those thoughts you've got to withdraw so it's not just the laundry list Don\nIt what are you going to have collected other people's concerns although one of the challenges they feel\nAs I tell people audiences all the time I talk to him politics is about the future not too bad it is exactly and you can be seen like look what happened to various the economy is great you know unemployment is historically low and they just threw out the government pretty much there's some there's some there's some\nUnder two currents that you just have

school so you will see a lot of things around economic development ah leadership in training local and state governments outreach and things like public policy polling\nThat we deal with in the center for public policy in the ...\nWe're going we're coming up pulling real quick but you guys actually go out and work with those other local governments and businesses that you helped them just not just I think people don't understand that about higher education the value that you bring to the community and the stakes yes\nWe really do any read it died everything from working helping localities looking at potentially providing incentives for certain business to come into there could be doing a return on investment of what that economic impact it looked like on the proposal stage with regard to incentive then come back and provided that actual economic\nImpact if they went forward with a business and the impact that it had on the community with everything from reading your job creation and other\nAspects that way absolutely giant valuations of um you know criminal justice programs so the implementation of a mental health program or a drug treatment program on reducing recidivism local jails or a a community partner we worked with a non\nFrom everything from there and we shouldn't go to the program done projects that they do you feel are coordinating and combining actual help that they need with regards to our students and our staff a waste in their community program and then we've done\nA third party evaluations of\nPrograms in projects for the private sector and looking to pitch to the general assembly and need an actual third party non biased evaluation of that work being able to provide that report for that company for the general assembly to look at legislative impact so we do we are continual partner\nEvery single day with our local and state governments around\nThe commonwealth um and it it really is what we live and breathe in the wild or school specifically um we do it at a much more\nCar then our private sector counterparts it\nBecause it really is our mission our vision and it allows us to bring the bears are academic experts he says well within the louder school you know we have ever thirty academics taxi their area of expertise you want to talk about the economic impact I've got four economists\nIn an urban and regional planning program or you want to talk about the impact of an opiate programs a treatment program I've got to criminal decker ah academic see that's their area of expertise and they get asked\nAll around the country to look you know present their research and were able to bring that expertise could there for our localities ... in the commonwealth in Virginia\nSo that when you're a whole service higher education school\nWhen we\nYou know we we provided all give us your you're going to say we will education for freshman in college in graduate school and teach me credit grants give us your workers that we will train then an executive leadership and made her that preparation\nI give us your legislators and you're a lobbyist and we've all trained in policy\nAnalysis on the impact of a variety of hanging on legislation and give us your community that will help you come up with good solutions and then you need evaluation impact obviously should I say we really are I'm not one stop\nAll encompassing education and consulting academic arm for a local and state government and our our citizens and students around the common law\nAnd that's why I brought it up and then we'll go to the polling you're with your operations on there because I think it's so important for people to understand\nThe totality of a lot of things that governments especially however detention which has a bull's eye on its back\nAround the country but in Virginia we got a great higher education system we really need to be proud of it even though it's you know it's it's appropriate to hold them accountable ask some questions but a lot of things you're talking about aren't free they are exclusive of of usual operations and they are a complementary\nTo what you are doing actually consulting you were doing it in higher education I think it's wonderful I think it's misunderstood not understood at all but what's jumping to some polling a that's a while the school has done what are you seeing out there what have you seen what direction are we going\nTo talk a little bit like Clinton on earlier so let's talk a little bit about policy in in polling in public policy that we did this summer we were out alive we'll have another call\nRight here after the election in November but in our in our public policy review talked about higher at that we're talking about that for a second when we look at it we surveyed over eight hundred for getting in\nAnd um of our commonwealth and when we look at and ask people what they think about the value of higher education infringing yes over eighty percent of\nOur respondents believed that the community colleges that we forget our worst their cost over sixty five percent believes that are public four year institutions are worth the cost and then right under fifty percent believe that our private\nSchools in the commonwealth of the car so it's really important that you said that question around\nDown in Virginia we value higher education and not only do you evaluate but we're putting out a product that comes around the commonwealth thinks is age appropriate return on investment they believe that the cost that we have for higher education and forgive me I think everyone can talk about cost in general for higher\nYour news this hour from town hall dot com I found your Pakistan's\nTwo official border crossings with

he's making around he didn't think he made his second trip to New Hampshire just this past weekend really twice in the last six months Alec Baldwin Alec Baldwin and he said he has not ruled out running for president\nHe Mike we're making news this morning it was my comment in my producer the show looking at we're making news this morning the ball like\nThis one that was like Alec Baldwin had a job as a spoke at the largest fundraiser for the Democratic party in New Hampshire who um aren't just last week yeah wow\nSee if you ran is old out Goldman is Jack Ryan you know it's kind of my God yeah [laughter] that was back in the Cold War you know a hundred October [laughter] that's right yeah so who else you've\nSeen up in in New Hampshire and who would you get to be the front runners in the New Hampshire primary today likely to win the twenty twenty primary in February of next year European\n[laughter] Bernie Sanders runs for president he will be the front runner okay just no doubt about it now I'm In New Hampshire no doubt about Fifteen thousand or Dan Elizabeth Warren's will likely be the front runner\nOkay so how about what recently happened was senator ward in New Hampshire how does that play with her I mean some blowing up the DNA ancestry ball this week the disaster\nYou know in any democratic circles I actually don't think it's gotten so much\nA liberal Democrats are going to be looking for a liberal Democrats regardless of facts [laughter] you know they think they use their their choices in in possession primarily on emotion sent in a\nJesse Harris from Iowa just going to do if you heard that it hurt a veteran democratic operative in Iowa was describing\nA see 'em a so called scene but in reality in the in the Democratic voter in the primary motive but they also want to win and they might go you know I don't think seniors can win nationally I think you\n[laughter] [laughter] that's funny now I I'm a Republican I think that's why we have a similar problem I don't think she's electable when it's been a general election nationally nationally okay yeah I I like to talk to you know for that using that to be an issue as\nAn example um and so I got one thing I Will say though it's a I I don't think it affected her here in New Hampshire I Do think it affected the again the behind\nThe scenes operations ah and and you sit out of that all the maneuvering going on behind the scenes among potential democratic candidates for her to actually take over a news cycle books\nFor the election the way she did was outrageously self serving\nLiterally didn't do who does that why why would I\nMean if if you knew the results of the DNA test and it was counter to your narrative that you're trying to ... after a few protests\n[noise] you know [laughter] I Know I don't understand it so how do you think okay so you got Sanders weren't just because it's New Hampshire but the other guys have got to go up there and compete or do they have to they might say just say\nYou know I think they do I think that you know because there's always going to think opportunities and that's as you probably know Chris ... says I'm Still Clinton he made a name for himself by doing well and and coming back\nTo to win at a time when she was\nLosing so you don't have to win the New Hampshire primary some some ... ... waves across the country so especially if Elizabeth Warren is the proper she's from Massachusetts neighboring Massachusetts the Kennedys who comes in second than even serves a ... kitten get momentum as a result\nYeah because I think Clinton finished third right yeah that's right yeah so so I bet you have to win points or show in New Hampshire to advance do you have to yeah\nThat's right that is correct and I ended up with what I don't think people understand about the Democratic nomination process this cycle is that California has moved up yeah and they're going to happen that's expensive state and Kamala Harris ... is going to have a big lead there\nYes and that's I think that's going to be the interesting thing I didn't hear if you guys talked about sexual like that on the Iowa\nA conversation about what she does in the early primary states will be interesting given the California will ... will she tried we'll ... we'll see try and a ... and they said you should try and do well in all of them and um you know 'cause they're so different sets of early primary states ... compared to California\nWell again I think you have to at least try to compete in some of these because the reality is even though you might not win New Hampshire you won't matter and the the nomination legitimately so you still have to win in the in the electoral college that practice on you can't you can't\nJust blow past Iowa New Hampshire because those are those who have gone in either direction especially with Trump won in Iowa and south right no doubt about it what issues are threatened New Hampshire voters these days what's going on up there\nAre well they would expect uh uh the economy is\nStill the number one issue um the governor here is a Republican Chris or new new and he's and a bar with what Donald Trump's been joined hands and governor Sununu the economy's booming we have the second lowest unemployment\nRate in the country and tell them how to Democrats don't want to talk about that they're trying to talk about anything you bought the economy with a family and he paid leave issue ... they're just trying to make up an issue that might connect with voters authors in the economy so that's\nGoing to continue to be number one the second issue here Chris I\nI don't know how it's how it worked in other states you've heard Donald Trump even talk about this is the opioid epidemic through a which is pretty ... pretty severe and New Hampshire so that's the second biggest issue\nReally that's that's just sad it's a number of times it's affected our number here we have we've had we've had that in our family as well and so it's a scourge of member of people dying as a result of that is worse than anything else it's\nSo it's not a person as you might want to predict where do you think coming out with thirty seconds punch in the Democratic nominee miniatures and I\nActually want to win a primary um\n[noise] I got to be kind\nOf like I'm a court reporter I Will be somewhere\nAnd then you know I I don't like it as well\nAll right joining us from the Granite State of New Hampshire or a hundred and eighty days plus or minus out of the New Hampshire primary thanks for joining us we'll be back on the John Ritter sure this is Chris and Chris like my\nOff it's just it's great to its credit\nOut there on the trail how how do you know we're not allowed to read a lot I\nMean you know work nor should University of anyone in Wisconsin but how do you how do you compare the intensity this year to last year when he was the same similar not as intense when he said well\nSimilar but I think we were very proud\nParticularly in Virginia last year when we send a message to the country into the world that you know hated bigotry have no place here and that we were open and welcoming for business with the election of government or something and his team and then you know that ... set of a house candidates that got across\nThe finish line that just beautiful tapestry of um of of of our our\nWomen and a diverse women and I just it just eat eat up so that was that was really great but I\nThink what's happened is people realize we have we can do this we can do this and it's just helped doubled down and we see for example the search and the absentee ballots being honest in Fairfax County in Prince William county\nWhich are a number one and two right now in the state or requests for absentee ballots you know that's good\nThat's that's the only ones I think we're just added you know adding more excitement and enthusiasm\nRight quitting kid was on earlier on seven o'clock hour and he said he's he thinks the turnout is going to be forty to forty five percent that's a large a large range and there but we're projecting turn out right now\nWe're just going out there looking for every single\nTime [laughter] I Know where do you think the terminals kind of getting\nAverage mid term elections which normally are hard but we have a reason to get out there is a lot at stake and um and I said we're going to be better than your average and it turns out you know I'm not in the business of of that we're just gonna we're we're just reaching or we can you're describing ... yeah\nAnd bring our anybody else that wants to ...\nI've been impressed with your with your cropper attendance this year and last year they they definitely worked hard when they're struck me as a sort of an obvious one is that the dominance of female candidates nominees\nBut it just is definitely the year the woman I like to talk about our women candidates and then I got an Anthony Flaccavento nine [laughter] I mean Jennifer Wexton is is I mean at the end they're all they have\nA different kind of experience and diversity but it is all good and at all will be a good refreshing breath\nUm ah for Congress and across a cross at the time the state senator general for waxed and up there in the tens congressional district that we're really excited about what we see up there on the volunteers are just showing up on non stop and the Washington Post indoor stroke which is something that on\nA you know I Barbara Comstock got endorsed every other time when they were very disappointed at her so she's going to start after Donald Trump and that proved not to do the ... so\nJennifer West so it's going to be on a congresswoman and then down in uh I'll just run through a real quick if you want to ask me something about him but we will go out of laying L'Oreal and the second district\nA retired navy commander in a small business woman and of course Scott Taylor's got he's on his own problems with a or you know trying to cheat quite frankly and on and on and and having a staff or\nPut half probably around ... signatures on the ballot I mean that's you know that's unheard of stuff that's pretty St Louis and I think the voters are going to reject that but but even that we you know without that we still have to sign a credible candidate\nWell I Would I don't know what I've seen in your in your hand is yeah this is obviously\nA female when I think it says regardless of the outcomes and we can talk about polling and Malcolm in November and you know going to go up and\nHe's got ... Coburn and and the energy Williams was six when I think it's sending a signal though is that you're going to see even more women in the future running for office regardless of party and I think that's a very unhealthy dynamic\nYeah and I want to I Want I\nWould say two things on that real quickly really excited that last week coverage just got moved into a red to blue um programs for the D triple C but the thing I think you're exactly\nRight about women women have always um um women have always and studies show yes but you know then the one that would and I know your mom would agree with me on gas would have they don't go to my heart so there's not much\nDon't go away I got raised my kids I got to get my degree got to pay off my lines you know I mean can do it better and I think really one of the\nI guess if you have to say good outcomes of twenty six teams was women decided we're not waiting anymore we're going to step up and watch something to offer and\nI think that you way we'll just see more and more of that because someone said is that saying otherwise you know ... it gets\nHealth care you saw with families ah\nWith just health care in general you know when they have a lot to add to that and there I Would I just don't think we're going to step back anymore\nNo no no I don't I don't think you should but I think having the frankly it's not just that they're women but they're but they're in a certain age range to relatively speaking to me a couple of her new album or a little bit younger but for the most part you're you're center cut on mom's\nRight the suburban mom is is is a strong boating I wants to block but a market that I think your party is obviously intentionally trying to attract\nCorrect correct and um those suburban moms some of them to vote for Donald Trump I think have seen the ramifications of that vote and we are reaching out and talking to them and particularly when you take something like the Kavanaugh's nomination where you know set aside\nThe fact of whether you didn't they are getting to the doctor for different the man who temperament\nWe saw back his temperament that is not fit to be a judge in an add on to the fact of you know her very compelling test to test the money and on and and they you know Republicans decided not to believe ought to ... there's going to be some cases from that\nOkay um let's talk about\nMostly Coburn moving from into the three D. triple C a red to blue program ah you're you're making news during the drug\nFrederick radio show this morning with the other folks make news about ethanol in Iowa and Steve bullock is enjoyable editor and our globe and in New Hampshire we don't want to [laughter]\nYou're you're there are three for three but my colors here so this was news was recovering moving into this special category of funding from the D triple C talk about that\nWell we just we just got the information or sales and that just shows you know that's an open seat we've always thought it was very competitive and uh we we are pleased to see that\nOn the inside the beltway group recognize\nThat as well she's Seventy two thousand miles on her car you know the ... district and really really dig it goes from up in a faulty accounting all the way down to the north Carolina line it's got a lot of different you know we're all but you know it's got Charlottesville area and I tell you it's got you know then you've got sort of the D.C suburbs lift off here\nSo you got a little bit of everything that she is really a\nCampaign in every part of that district and ah\nAnd I think that you know here here here and it towards the end they finally you know solve the value in investing more in her\nWell it also says hey they have the resources to do it right\nWell that's a good point too I think that is and if you've seen the articles that you know our candidates\nAre actually out raising our candidates not even the committees are actually out raising 'em a Republican incumbents like you look at Dave Brat\nVersus Abigail Spanberger I think she got raised him three to one lady on this last um [noise] I guess this this recent filing report on and um and and you know that's it\n... which is like really gratifying because he had that small donors are the ones that really investing in show up and knock on doors since Sunday can I put the shoe leather [noise]\nBut I think that's showing up obviously in the polling generic ballot is a little behind where you all were last year at the end of the day\nOr energy just follow those if you just follow those those numbers and the data you probably do quite well election day maybe not as large pursue nominees that happened in Virginia last year but you know showing up on the ground um\nI I think the Democrats are going to have another a happy day here again kind of thing and it made sense this little plug visiting and things on back in the thirties but a citizen soccer I really appreciate your calling in fast and walk down the stretch final word what's it what's the message\nPut her on a bumper sticker for the voters of the commonwealth\nOf what is the Virginia Democratic Party stands for bumper sticker\nThat health care and economy that works for all\nThat you go Susan swagger ladies and gentlemen John in Frederick ... network um ... filling in for the vacation John Frederick sexist recalling in\nGreat
