observation ... thank you\nLook I'm you're going to hear the Democrats shorter\nLaying about how this disaster for the Republicans in the winter\nAnd you can only give his right they can keep doing that\nBut let me give it to your straight the treatment of Brett Kavanaugh\nBeyond the pale of what regular Americans who believe in the right thing to do at the end of the day when you get rid of the partisans on both sides and you look at middle America the people who elected Trump they have a sense of fairness\nAnd they think with this man has been through all the polls are showing this is beyond the scope and they were horrified by it\nSo I'm telling you that this controversy I Believe has woken Trump supporters and conservatives up that would have otherwise stayed home they don't like the Republican Party that are like ... they don't like any of the Republicans there are Trump supporters they believe in the sky\nBut they were not going to come out in the midterms they just they don't even know they don't care but this you have little match under Trump voters like and I've said this standard again\nThere's nothing the Trump campaign could have done to get these people out like the mistreatment that people are saying I'm Brett Kavanaugh and Josh Holmes who is the cheapest staff or Mitch McConnell spread\nLooking at some point in it he tweeted out\nLooking at some poll numbers this morning it's impossible to overstate how important the Kavanaugh hearings had been to voters it's like dropping a grenade\nInto the electorate teams in red states are not going to life these numbers they're all going down you know Americans have a sense of fairness and it cuts\nBoth ways it's not partisan if everything was flipped and the Republicans were doing this they would get punished by the electorate Americans have any deep sense of fairness that's why they are reacting to the kids being separated from their families and\nAll that they don't like that Americans don't like unfairness they don't like people not treated well I mean it's it's the American way they don't like it and so just before the midterms they're experiencing that you cannot get away from the Kavanaugh\nHarry I think this has been our major topic the last what three three weeks\nI don't even remember when I talked about something else so everybody is talking about pets even people that are not involved in politics and there's a sense of fairness and this thing is going to blow up in the Democrats face like you've never seen that\nAnd there's going to be I predicted there's going to be a massive turnout of Trump supporters and Republicans and in the country on the metro you're going to get the biggest percentage of voters turnout in these midterms than you ever had and that favors the Republicans and so they're going to keep the house\nAnd they get a gang five or six seats in the Senate as a result of the Democrats\nAll next week\nAnd they have little match it's like there's a gasoline can that over somebody overturned and the Democrats took any broken a match and let the book on fire and tossed it\nJohn triggers radio network with us we'll be right back

impeached in\nThe Senate they couldn't get anywhere near here two thirds I'm sure they got fifty percent and that was the end of that but uh and it costs the Republicans a lot because it didn't make

up and everything else in the in the mix was four hundred billion dollars the tax cuts also for example where a hundred and fifty billion dollars\nThey're paid for now if you're grown at three and a half they're totally paid for and the four hundred billion the Democrats wanted and guy\nAnd that we should not have allowed to happen that just goes onto the kids right if the debt\nIs Twenty one trillion into we're trying to preserve a principled with a bunch of states flap\nPlus except ... up the military ... democratic critique is exactly\nWrong as always right they're trying to say I vote against the military you know the whole point is if you keep plugging up the social spending you won't have any money for the military [noise] and so it's very clever trick or that's what the Democrats do because they cannot\nTell the truth on policy and you know the the spanberger campaign that the curiosity there's no one knows what she's running on I I seriously don't know what she's running out she came all went on health care and then she found out the price tag would you know thirty two trillion and would double our tax rates\nAnd she backed off health care\nAnd then you know I I don't know what else I mean she's against the tax cuts [noise] she said they were they interests and so what if people are on immigration she won't name an upper bound so I guess it open door to seven billion people open borders I Know she's four\nSo I mean it's I don't get it I I don't I don't know what she's running [noise] and so if you ever had around after you know everybody would love to know and she won't even put a full biography\nAnd on the on the campaign website it's fairly shocking [noise] well I'll I'll never\nOn eight thirty AM on Thursday and I will ask her just that also uh we're trying to get the debate date worked out the debate that we're sponsoring\nIt between yourself and Abigail I'm Still trying to get that day that I should get that in the next couple of days I'm told by a bunch of your campaign managers\nDave I Want to ask you about something you put up the other day you said that and they are in the mail or that is a promoting the spanberger campaign that\nYour kids found something in your mailbox for somebody had written on a on the mail or dating a rod in hell and you turn it over to\nThe authorities and your kids founded it says right in the hell Dave I'm when it was turned it over I mean did you actually feel at risk or didn't think that something my comment that\nWell we we don't know if someone puts Ryan how on your door down I think years later it's not a good natured Frank right though if you have kids at home\nAnd you get someone put a bomb card from it right on your door yes everybody has current concerns these days whether it's heated political rhetoric and and that and so of course\nWrote in hell yeah that I wouldn't I wouldn't think that would be a fun thing to find on your door so um\nIt's it's it's not\nI mean what can I don't know why the spanberger campaign people keep doing this kind of stuff just just run his campaign\nRun on the issues you have your debates and one of the parties is going to win I don't know why there's [noise] you're not you don't find this from the other side you know friend is from\nThe Davis campaign and I'm just pointing out if you're spanberger supporter out there this is not helpful it's not helpful to your candidate it's not helpful to anything it's just it's just horrible so it's not just run your campaign and that's the day before they are\nThey're they're folks are strip and they ... sign when we're giving big signs out they'd had people coming steel big science they say I I'm I've signed up to put these up for it they stole sign they take stickers up people's cars\nI mean they have their science placed illegally all over the place where you file this is a law enforcement candidate and\nShe doesn't follow the law [noise] and so that's a little striking right and so uh we we follow the rules I always tell the kids that are folks at the door to always be on your back behavior always be positive to everybody you know negativity\nJust don't think that anybody in your campaign would go to Abigail's home where she's got children and put Abigail rotten hell I just don't think they would do that and if they did they should get a\nMinus for that because it's not it's not setting I write tone and I would just tell the spanberger people that are listening to be now just knock it off just run your campaign right I mean there's just not helpful all this stuff is not doing anybody any good whatsoever\nAnd it's really dumped so just stop it just when you can't find him and if you will ever win and that's again so I Will go on right nobody's going to die so just knock it off and run your campaign\nDave thanks for being with us have more information go to ... dot com Dave Brat dot com how's it going to stay there will be with us Thursday in thirty am hopefully this week we'll have a date for our debate Dave thanks for being with us John traveling so radio network Denver ligament coming up\nThat's the south side of Virginia area the margins district in the state has like bigger than New Jersey Denver Riggleman Republican candidate\nThis is for the seat of retiring Tom Garrett and going up against Muslims Coburn and that will be decided in the mid germs on November ... regarding the favorite there in Denver good to have you in\nGood morning thirty five days in a way and then November sex is that what it\nIt is now thirty five days\nAnd wake up you have thirty thirty six days here tomorrow Tuesday so I think it's five weeks out [noise]\nWhat is the most surprising thing so far you heard on the campaign trail like somebody you've heard from ... a ... century constituency voters and you said wow that's a shocker\nGosh a shocker for me [laughter] and it's probably something that's minor comparatively but almost everybody I talked to in South sides about infrastructure so at one town I I Can't remember payments on their knees but Victoria [noise]\nAnd I think it was a Victorian or one of the city managers you know come up to me and it goes in Denver and I said hey what's your biggest issue and\nHe's sort of looked at me and he said sewer lines not replace since\nNineteen I'm like you gotta be kidding me [laughter] it was not good [laughter] sewer lines that break she I'm like oh my gosh that's crappy but [laughter] it's amazing to me the things that people are dealing with on the trail and just some of the things we're really amazing [noise]\nYou know the one in ... county I had one or the mother come up to me and she goes I'm really sick or driving my kid [noise] and your homework every night where I could get\nTerrified they got real problems and he really get to hear all the real problems on the trail [noise]\nWho isn't this interesting because the district that you would represent is very diverse obviously in for people who say look I don't have a wife by where I live a that's a real issue for poor people in today's environment that\nReally doesn't help when when when you talk about the the urban and suburban districts\nLet's get to a new president when on Canada last night Kennedy caving\nIn to the president's demand NAFTA which I think is now dead or I may never be seen again\nAre replaced by us em see U.S Mexico Canada agreement now here's the reality the Canadians dropped every single demand they had before midnight because the president was going forward alone at the press conference on Wednesday\nHe said he was done negotiating with candidate he didn't like their negotiators you didn't like their attitude and he said he told us they asked\nHe was done with him he was going forward without them then uh they acquiesced on every demand this is a good thing for the American worker in a good thing for your district tell us why\nWell I mean the first thing in the first thing you see is that they up to my mentor over the TPP right on actual dairy exports I mean we're talking about [noise] you know the import export of dairy with Canada\nWe can just ship more dairy products into Canada have open that up and for the fifth district I mean that's just amazing [noise] um and I think that's what I've been saying on the trail you heard me John of the farmers weren't screaming they said we believe that there has to be some short term pain for long term game [noise]\nUm they they have supported Trump [noise]\nThey should have at some point it's probably going to be too much to bear but they understood that they have been another system for so long and they want free\nTrade and they don't want subsidies they want to trade and I think free and fair trade is what we're looking at right now and I'm a military guy so I called it empty right free and fair trade what we eat and I think you're seeing\nThese promises being kept by the by the president [noise]\nAre at the ...\nI went to the un all week last week and a ... one of the key provisions that\nCame out there is that the president is looking\nFor some way to solve the Yemeni crisis I'm there they haven't gotten there but I Know that was that was a big topic along with with Israel and the Palestinians on any on everyone's mind\nBased on your military background how do we solve that because right now are there seemed no end in sight\nFifty thousand Yemeni are dead and we've also got a humanitarian crisis that could go beyond the pale of anything that we've seen children are starving there and we're backing\nOh man that's you know it's pretty interesting John it's a great question because I don't either no right now there is an answer in our military intelligence or about how to extract the Iranians um from what they're doing and their support the Haiti's and I think that's been a big deal for us is that\nYou know Iran is the number one number one part of a state sponsor terrorism and I think that what they're trying to you they're trying to use terrorism it's like a hedge demonic exercise\nTo do all these awful things [noise] I just think if it was going in there I Would try to find out that we could be more surgical\nAnd removing the Iranian influence based on intelligence gathering and based on the special operations\nThat would be the first thing I Would say is there any kind of alternative or course of action where they can concentrate just on removing Iranian influence um arms money\nThings that they do and I think that would be the first steps that I Would take also I think when you saw General Mattis go downrange I think it really comes down to the mission planning also in process we have to improve our mission planning process or the Saudis do\nThey have to improve their mission planning process of like a process does save lives we have to have some kind of legal structure there well we're not doing something we're not supporting something that's sort of ad hoc when it comes to targeting so there will be the first two things that I Would do is\nHow do we certainly were move Iranian influence in the second thing is how do we improve the mission planning process so that would reduce collateral damage while we're trying to remove that cancer\nDenver I've got to go to a quick word from our sponsors stay with us

John what the results were who paid for it\nI mean that didn't check out either that that whole thing seemed I'm a little odd to me um I also want you to stand on Susan Collins you said earlier that Susan Collins is the kind of in this whole debate here is kind of an unsung hero I'm a fan of Susan Collins I'm a big fan of hers everybody\nKnows that don't always agree with her\nI didn't know about yeah I'm a big fan of yeah and I\nAnd I don't always agree with her uh she's ... she's a moderate but I've always found her to be a very honest a very honest politician I mean she tells you the truth\nAnd she's she also happen to have you bumped into the hallway or something and she is super nice but ... says she's kind of the the the young son a champion here why did that in some detail\nBecause from my understanding from two Senate staffers one on your you share already committee wanting the senator's office not hers and also from one of the leaders [noise]\nOne of them are one of the groups are showing most powerful and important work on the nomination from the get go let me see for the allegations are my cold wind came out she was approached by Murkowski I don't know anything about like oh I Know it's worked\nOut ski [noise] one Murkowski initially wanted this nomination poll she would have gone far too for the FBI investigation you even saw Murkowski\nWhen she was in the halls the price that after a while\nOr what why do we have an FBI ratification closed door she was I don't know why [noise] Suzanne Collins said today in college and the very beginning when I go along with that and then it started out one she wants to confirm break\nInto she didn't agree with the way this process of the allegations were coming out she had argued ... Murkowski [noise] about it and I should also show you what profile [noise] the courage or that's what we used to work\nShe should have just come out herself\nShe was only haven't done it it's Murkowski Collins had gone out with her as well because they were both\nA female and went to tank columns showed\nHere and I had a lot of problems with her um although I you know maybe in hindsight I don't anymore because then it died she didn't want to play the genitalia cars and she white tapping looks she looks here's the other thing that Merkel here's the other thing and they keep saying well it\nWon't get a barrel and get confirmed the president would have only one choice if he polls if he polls count right now it would be to rule dominate the Arab\nAiming right for because people like me who are calling for power from the beginning because of the way she's finding signed it already actor pay her life [noise]\nI Would say no you gave us ... you know what I mean we would have set up we heard from the smartest people in the room with her from the road [noise] although I Know Don McGahn really pushed counter now through we've heard from everyone you know and it had to be the bushy no no no no you're giving us what we want now\nAnd he would have been amenable to that the president [noise] so I think she was also sang to Murkowski that she was confident where um what she in Scottsdale Calvin now in terms of roe v way that he was the job so she wanted to look for all the ways\nYou tell me one is still going to make calls or abortion illegal and Robie way would be overturned and then we'll say can you know the\nOnes that are being passed on that one so I'm really not going to provide for your tactics that will never happen\nAnd it's really a strong argument but I agree with you\nA hundred percent on Kavanaugh as it relates to an even kill me I was also in favor of made me ... that was my first choice and just like be careful what you wish for right because if something happens now when the Kavanaugh's nomination goes down\nDon't you agree with me now President Trump will nominate combing beret the following day\nI Would hope so I think he should nominate or even during the next day you can see that you have hopefully the next\nVacancy comes next year yeah but she she should be in the let me just kind of and I think once you're talking about though he is a very good nominee yeah he's very young and the president will have nominated with him I Believe right now in sixty three and I believe course of course just ... I I forget John but Gorsuch\nMakes me want to do was to the one oh like the like fifty\nShe won okay so you know better than me and then you can get\nBarry on I mean look you have you have a job he's already remake the bench for Thirty years so I so\nI think that but I think that you should be the next nominee I think that but I think that lucky I'm I think that the president has really played this well I liked the fact that the president look I'm the first one to tell everyone that somehow Donald Trump believe it or not does not play three dimensional chess\nSometimes sometimes when you hear people on like on a certain networks you understand\nOn this he did and unless he did some for delegates you say anything for four or five days ... materialize out [noise] and then he started it started attacking the process you started attacking the process\nAnd I thought that that was smart enough some states like in a very good about this I'm\nSure we ought to be very loyal to cabinet [noise] I Hope that this is the word die we don't get through\nAfter all this we will lose the Senate the one thing is Johnny showing up at all polling Republican [noise] becoming more engaged now and they're furious about [noise]\nWell I think it's going to backfire on the Democrats because\nWell ah there's nothing that you and I for Steve Bannon or Cory Lewandowski or anybody else\nThat's part of the Trump networks for campaign or political action committees or anything else nothing we could have done to motivate Trump voters more than the Democrats have done with this cabin or clown shall\nI mean people and I talked to were coming out of the woodwork they're pissed off\nAnd they're going to turn out on November six and I think as a result of that the Republicans are going to win and when Nancy Pelosi wakes up on November seventh and she's not speaker you know what she's gonna do blame Dianne Feinstein for this whole mess that's what's going to happen\nSam I've only got a couple of seconds make your prediction will the cabinet vote be delayed for a week\nOr more\nI think it's going to be the wages for the German days I think that's so whatever that comes on the [noise] the late ... I I think that what do you gauge me to think that also the reason why because it's been a while the Republican so upset about it\nAll right so it's going to be a week and that would be a this coming friday and then again\nNext week me on that we got a cabin or justice count on the bench for the Yankees are going to fight off\nNo I'm Talking about that first they have to get by Okla no and and uh the the problem was Oakland is if you're traveling in the fifth inning they get like Nineteen closures on that's the problem All right Sam Nunberg thanks for being with us by the way Sammy seem to get wiser\nFor ... check this out citizens for the American Republican Steve Bannon's brand new pack and uh he got salmon they're making some hey so Sam thanks for being with us men and keep sir I've had my best to your puppy [laughter]\nSimms dog Winston John severance radio network group you're right\nI'm trying to get our politics for five minutes can I Do know everybody says no we want more politics hardcore All right\nSo I don't know what's gonna happen the next week here or what we do know is that the FBI is going to do another background check and it's like kind of like a ... exam you put scope up there see what's going on and so is that six in the number seven I don't know what they're going to find out in\nThe FBI understand ABC News read ports that you're talking to a Gemini Ramirez 'cause we don't know if that's true because the fake news are so that might be true might not\nYou know you used to get a news report from ABC NBC CBS or Washington Post or New York times or whatever you know some major outlet Chicago Tribune things like that Miami Herald\nYou'd get a news report\nAnd you don't know whether to believe it or not now except for the Associated Press a pie that's probably the last thing and probably if you're in if you're traveling international algae era right other than that you're in the U. S. A. E. pi I trust the people to come into the eight people wire abide\nAnything else I don't know some ABC says\nThe FBI is meeting with Deborah Ramirez than [noise] five of her friends [noise] I don't know if that's true if they made it up do you have any idea they make all the stuff I\nMean I just put up an interview I did with Laura Trump and uh it's a pretty good piece but\nI'll tell you what I remember during the campaign the Trump campaign NBC News reported that the Trump campaign pulled out of Virginia you remember that that they pulled out a Virginia fake net\nAnd it was fake nobody called me I was the chairman or what are you calling for being out he was the\nDirector and nobody called the Trump campaign they just\nYou know Corey Stewart linked to fall story after he got fired NBC just went with it because the narrative that the Trump campaign was falling apart\nAnd they were pulling out of the battle crown heights and I went on thirty seven interviews in five days and still couldn't stop it I remember my son in Reno\nCollege professor jak at the University of Nevada calling me up three days later and saying hey dad what happened to campaign in Virginia I heard you guys pulled out did they fire you that's what my son said I'm like I don't know tell you're talking about\nOh I just saw him over the Las Vegas NBC News scroll on the bottom of my TV screen it's
