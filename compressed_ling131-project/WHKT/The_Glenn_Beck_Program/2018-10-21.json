that's and that's what that's what campaigns they follow the down they followed that you you look at the\nThe cross tabs in the in the polls and they go okay I've got a problem with um women between the ages of twenty five I'm forty five you don't go there on prime let's just say you know and then they know structure their messages according to be set up or if they have high positives for their opposition trying to attack the attack as to bring down\nThe positives and bring up their negative to have an outcome in the election are you having more difficult time getting people because of cell phones this is the this is a question from a from a texture short\nI we're not\nI'm In the years leading up to um today so Virginia is about two thirds cell phone mostly or cellphone only users and so our sample we we actually draw samples of cell phone numbers and so we do quotas on her cellphone versus landline sample\nSo we basically go into the field with about a two third one third cell phone in line split already\nUm and we haven't found our response rate on cell phones be any different than it has been which is\nNot great um you know people typically aren't taking cell\nPhone calls to do surveys like they were landline calls in the seventies surveys show we're not\nFinding it any more difficult than we were already um I Do have colleagues around the country who are finding cell phone number is being blocked more um and and it's driven by this um all of this fishing that's been going on with our cell phone numbers lately\nThat I Can't come up my phone number is recall from Idaho\nAnd we we do two things that we do to try to help us with that we ... ourselves as Chris rooting for university so we're not we're not an anonymous number or we're not\nUnless the number you'll see who we are when we call and then um if you say look put me on your do not call list will put you on our callers and we will call you back ah we don't have to do that because\nYou know according to the federal regulations were doing research academic research would not working we're not getting paid to you know do this we're not making a profit so we're considered um researchers so we don't have to comply with that you're not call with\nBut we do keep our own do not call list and if somebody says they'll call me I don't want to do surveys then we'll put them on our cola so we try to be transparent in that way as well\nWell that's fascinating 'cause most people go oh yeah I'm On those on those do not call list them and they are because because you are academic nature interesting so your turnout model is is showing forty to forty five percent that's interesting because the people I talked to the campaigns are they're hoping is going to be around forty eight\nThat's so that's ah so\nIt depends on who you talk to 'em it could be forty eight um it could be higher I mean so here's the real sort of question that I have in my head right so\nIf there is a big blue wave if there are a lot of voters that are engaged right now who didn't even vote in twenty Seventeen then we're missing them in our survey were not capturing that right and that some of the pushback I got back\nUm what do we want to put out our second district poll showing Taylor leading Luria\nSome Democrats push back and said well you're not even capturing some of the voters that were newly registering in and they're going to vote okay fair enough but we have the luxury in Virginia in in that we had a twenty Seventeen election that we think captured that surge pretty well it it really it brought Ralph Northam into the governor's mansion\nRalph Northam won the second district by four percent first time a Democrat or one that district in about a decade so we think we twenty Seventeen captured that surge pretty well\nDid um by by engaging their base voters already know if they've done that we think we've captured them because they were already the voters anyway um but if turnout is higher\nI think it's going to help 'em I don't know that helps one party over the other all the way it might be helpful to Democrats because it might be that extra search that we might that might be a lot of new voters that we're not capturing\nSo you ... you you saw the search I called in suburban tsunami I'm twenty seven to ... you saw that you know\nI think you had an all yeah we we were remodeling\n'em in twenty Seventeen like we are likely model this year or what we were doing and twenty Seventeen as we were we were modeling the same way but we were also looking for new the registered voters\n'em in twenty Seventeen because of that was that was that search that was the difference between twenty six you know twenty Seventeen with a lot of the new suburban voters\nUm and so we did see the surgeon twenty Seventeen we all know what it looked like in Virginia and so there's nothing that says to me that that's going to be any less this year than it was in twenty Seventeen and there are things that say to me it might be a little bit bigger than it is that it wasn't twenty Seventeen and by the way in twenty Seventeen the Republicans\nWere as engaged as as you would want them to be it's just that Democrats were a little bit more engaged\nSo you think it might be even bigger this year\nIt very well could be I don't think it can be much bigger but it very well could be um Democrats in particular are trying to register new voters or they they were until the deadline and Republicans I'm work trying to register new voters as much as they were trying to mobilize their their base voters that are already there so\nI mean look if both parties it's not likely to be because we don't have a really robust state wide range going on 'em and we have ... competitive congressional races some places and not at other places so\nSo that's part of the reason I'm thinking forty five um but if it ended up being forty eight it's because there were many there's massive turnout\nGoing on and some of these really competitive congressional races um I don't know\nIf you're a if you're if you're looking for a competitive state wide rate to drive a turnout we just don't have that this year and so that's part of the reason I'm hesitant to say it's going to go as high as forty eight but look I've been wrong many times um in all the wrong many times in the future\n[laughter] goodness knows that I'm Talking about the state is not close\nClose um it I you know I did what I find interesting about the statewide races that um it's not close yet you see Tim Kaine campaigning\nIn his ... his campaign campaigning as if it were close he's running ads on on every in every television network in in the commonwealth he's campaigning like he's got a a more for a bit of both formidable candidate that he has and I think there are two things going on I think Tim Kaine\nNeeds to send the statement that I've moved beyond twenties sixteen\nTwenty sixteen but I think he's also recognizing that in some of these are really close congressional races um if he can pull any coattails um if he can let out any coattails it could be really helpful to democratic candidates down ballot and so I think oddly enough\nTim Kaine is running a campaign to get re elected to the U.S Senate and running several congressional campaigns to elect Democrats um in in in some of these competitive races at the same time um and he doesn't really have a challenger that has a lot of money but Cory story is\nAll over local talk radio which is where his voters are going to be and so I take Corey Stewart's running\nThe kind of campaign that he needs to run to give voters out given um how difficult situation he has a little money is\nSo your state wide pulling that\nWaste we pulled the Senate race several times\nAnd then decided it wasn't going to be a competitor enough to pull 'em throughout the final stretch from Labor Day on instead decided to pull these congressional races because\nReally for the first time in probably decades in Virginia if if if a hundred and some odd years we've got a lot of a lot of really competitive congressional races going on so we decided to pull the congressional races instead of continuing to pull what doesn't appear to be a very competitive Senate race\nBut we are we're wrapping up here in the segment with which you have a final call here on what the Senate race is going to look like in the day\nWell probably somewhere Fifteen Fifteen ashes mine is where my ... I'm at right now it could be a little bit higher could be a little bit lower if it's a little bit lower it's going to some of these congressional races are going to look really good for Republicans are going to be really tight if it's if it's higher if it's closer to twenty\nThan some of these democratic congressional candidates are going to have a better night I think fifty\nSix fifty seven fifty eight yeah OK anything moving a libertarian friendly making an impact and all you do in a\nIn in in we we anticipated they might given that that you know a lot of country club Republicans might not be interested in Corey Stewart but at the end of the day we're in it were very tribal period of our politics and if there is in our by your name a lot of Republicans were going to vote for that are and not actually give\n'em the libertarian their their vote so we don't see any uptick I'm I'm among libertarian candidates either state wide or in these congressional races um there's a libertarian and the Panthers libertarian seven we're not seeing any uptick with either one of them\nOkay thanks Quentin Kidd recalling it looks like an opportunity last Libertarian Party they had a chance to crack the rocket market here a little bit in Virginia they might have fallen short this is Chris ... filling in for the vacation and John Frederick come back\n[laughter] you're the elected got it right now standing joke so uh you know if you heard the last several recording kid from Christopher Newport or are you seeing anything different than what Dr kids seeing out there\nWhen I heard that the the backend of heads um interview and I yeah I I sort of got the sense from a discussion that perhaps he seen more of a blue wave and I'm seeing I'm you know I'm In in regular contact with all our congressional campaigns um\nThroughout the commonwealth and frankly most of them are doing really well um and I\nI Will be a surprise if it doesn't really come down to perhaps just two congressional districts being really in play when we get to election night\nTo just to which too\nI I see you know the seven summits hands clearly are the two battlegrounds right now I think the other ones that perhaps people are looking at the fast but I think Denver regular man is clearly running a far superior campaign there and so I think Denver or\nWill it will be fine come election night on there had been some talk Scott Taylor's race\nScotch really working hard um I mean perhaps we'll be close to them we otherwise would've hope but I think at the end of the day Scott should be fine as well so that's where it comes back down to Barbara Comstock in the tense 'em and Dave Brat and establish this way I see is the point\nIs a doctor kid he didn't mention the Brad spanberger racing I live in a district I see it every day at least in western in Rico county and there's a stark difference in what's going on the ground at least but I I pulled back and try and do the objective follow the data if you follow the data that Clinton kids right in front of what you're saying\nUm the Taylor and ... are the ones that are most important as far as you know changing I'm changing party right if they're accurate or you get my seven and calms down by the state or nine times and like that\nSo if that's consistent in his polling is accurate\nUm it would probably show up if you if you're going to do one on brands memory I Would imagine that he would\nBut what he also pointed out obviously the quality of the candidates important local issues are important but also what do you pointed out was he didn't see the big Kavanaugh kicker or that everyone\nIn the talking about this is going to have this big search for Republicans or if it is it's pretty quiet people make up their mind just going to vote\nAnd as he said Republicans are show up in midterms\nAnd and I sort of see the ladder I mean obviously what I'm looking at his anecdotally um but\nDuring the year prior to the to the judge now justice Kavanaugh hearings um there was some um perhaps apt to stay on the part of the Republican base um but that changed almost immediately or with those hearings and I think\nThe Republican base in Virginia and I think the Republican base around the country saw what a Democrat majority in the United States Senate and the Democrat majority in the house of representatives under Speaker Pelosi would look like\nConstant um investigations calls for impeachment set a precedent investigations of justice Kavanaugh and so what I saw as\nSponsors the emails fundraising jump significantly as a result of that\nAnd I'm as it's been said before somebody's going to write a check or send some money to the party or a candidate they're more likely going to vote for that person as well so\nIt may not be showing up in the polls quite yet but I Believe that there is a renewed and as soon as he asked some they're clearly wasn't enthusiasm gap between Republicans and the Democrats prior to the Kavanaugh hearings but I think that gap spin eliminated so now it's just a matter of turning our folks out\nSo you're seeing the enthusiasm kick if I talk to Morgan Griffith about a week and a half ago and he said the same thing you know it was a if you were doing the scale of one to ten ten being you know absolutely out of the mind showing up no matter what\nA he said you know Democrats were around Ninety and my folks around thirty said but my folks are now up around Katie I'm so he he he sensed that he felt on the ground inclined told me the same thing or so from the anecdotal standpoint I Do think there is a renewed a fervor\nIn the in the Republican base that quite frankly is getting a lot of what they want to go after watching as part of the hard thing in politics you know\nYou know when when you get what you want your show up right are you satisfied or you know you're fat and happy new stay home because things are going pretty well what what's the point uh but I think the the cabinet things from the ... Energizer refocused or at least the Republican base on wanting to come out and vote but you're seeing that throughout the state\nI Am and I and I think you know getting what I think that folks realize you're right I mean it was got what they wanted and twenty sixteen we have the president and acting tax cuts the economy's booming lowest unemployment and and decades instead of what price I'm complacency in that but then I think now the Republican base seeing\nAll that can get done very quickly with the Democrats control the house and Senate and so I think Republicans are saying we've got to roll up our sleeves and if we want to keep what we've got we've got to go to the polls and vote for it\nUsually the cycle of politics right so what as the new chairman of the Republican Party of Virginia ah what is the next step for ... where are you all go and what should Republicans in Virginia Beach got\nBecause when you look at Virginia and Maryland you have to choose very strange electorate you have a democratic Maryland with a Republican governor who looks like he's gonna win swing Fifteen and twenty points in Virginia which has been a battleground trending now towards a blue state\nTim Kaine Clinton kept things who's gonna win by Fifteen offers properties maybe twenty points as well\nYou didn't really do have this dichotomy don't you all across the Potomac were were that the dynamics of politics are changing Massachusetts has a Republican governor\nWho's our polling are the leading Democrats in the state you know Charlie Baker you have a governor a Republican governor of Illinois\nUm is is is the ... other Republicans in Virginia sit right for the electric well\nI I think what you're saying I don't know that in our current climate in Virginia whether any of the three candidates you mentioned governor Hogan and others who would what secure the Republican nomination in Virginia right now but\nI think what will recognize it and I and I was sort of sense to perhaps a more pragmatic approach among Republicans I'm again coming out of the Kavanaugh hearings\nCollins and Lindsey Graham being I'm sort of a stalwarts of the Republican Party people to laugh but now I'm getting requested how can we bring Lindsey Graham in to speak in Virginia for candidates and and have him as a featured speaker and places it so\nI think the Kavanaugh hearings may have challenged that what we need to do is have a broader based in the Republican Party that can bring conservatives to gather around core principles and perhaps uh if we can agree on eighty percent of the issues we can disagree on the other twenty later on after we start winning again\n[laughter] again the cycle because look both parties are having their their ah Internet signed battles right I mean the Democrats have their own battles Republicans are having their battles were going to have some posters\nNot posters of some operatives from Iowa New Hampshire calling into nine o'clock Irish should listen to that we have one calling in from a Democrat from Iowa Republican hamster in and tell us what's going on there are states that are the national caucuses 'cause it's really what they are only\nOnly I see I don't have time to worry about that I Do kind of holding out for now I guess if they set it up for reelection but nothing that worried about twenty twenty after we went in to preserve our majorities in the house and Senate next year in Virginia and\nGently push back here because the dominant theme in American politics is what's going on in Washington DC and it's being reflected back in in the states and then the local to the districts because Trump is the issue right now since\nSince June fifteenth of twenty Fifteen\nThat man has driven the conversation every day in American politics and if you know four hundred and Seventy two days away from from the Iowa caucuses people are going to be focusing on those issues\nBut it's going to get very retail very quickly why all the Virginia races are going on and that's the beauty and the dynamic of Virginia politics isn't it ... because we are we are the polls\nWe take the temperature all the time\n... that's exactly right and I think um for our congressional candidates this year I think uh last year gave them sort of a wake up call and they could see OK perhaps around to roll up our sleeves and work much harder than we thought we were going to have to and so\nUm you're right there this year will sort of perhaps give us a preview of what we can expect in twenty Nineteen but that will be that sort of a pulse of the of the country for as you say\nBecause we have the entire general assembly up in this time next year ... all one hundred and forty members of the districts in the general assembly are going to be up for election\nAnd there's so many issues at play and what Clinton kid was talking about what he's sitting in his polling is that quality candidates matter and local issues matter I got an email last night from a former colleague of mine talking about Corey in northern Virginia\nAnd uh basically local development and he was engaged on he also sends out emails on traffic patterns and ... and I'm like\nThis is not what you do in the general assembly but if that's what the voters want they want someone talking about it right\nBut I I think that's right people are really looking for results from their elected officials and the things that are impacting most people today\nWith a booming economy and and job I'm strong and wages grow and people are looking at some of those other issues that impact them on a daily basis traffic untold up in northern Virginia and as you say the potholes and and and more rural areas of the country\n[noise]\n[noise]\nThis hour\nSaudi Arabia's

build for the future and that means stronger\nFor this time around where I approve this message and I never forget I worked for you [noise]\nWelcome back to the John for the show I'm Chris X. men filling in for the vacationing although he's not vacation and he's with his kid down in Florida during a little baseball travel ball\nJohn products are our usual host here in the morning John feathers radio network gives call it eight four five six four six eight eight eight four five six one answer any questions if one is a permanent relevant to politics in\nGeneral culture economics as best we can or you can technique five four zero to nine four zero six zero five four zero to nine four zero six eight zero that's my personal cell or don't give it up a when second never mind\nHey Noam ... will get you on um joining us now congressman Rob Wittman from the first congressional district up for reelection any former colleague of\nMine Mike bring him on the guy\n[laughter] they bought are you this morning you tell me how are you\nI'm doing well doing well busy busy these days but uh but but doing well\nGood man I tell ya I was ... this is not an endorsement but there's a a reflection of what I saw when you were in the general assembly working together I think we're in the community together you're always justice energetic smiling go get them kind of guy you know like the um like Mickey Rooney let's put it on the show you're always just like vitamin ... are you able to maintain that\n\nYes you know I I I'm blessed to represent great post and the the first district you know I I get my energy from that they are very very passionate\nIndividuals that they work hard every day and uh do do great work so it's hard not to be motivated by that but it it's hard not to be motivated to ah by the by the true honor that it is to represent them\nAnd ... she ate that and I'm having\nDown by Washington at all\nBut you know Chris I mean I think at certain times\nIt it it does it does give you pause as to you know where we our country and the divisions that are out there but but I always work everyday to try to find places where we agree I think I think today it takes a little more effort to do that but you know I've been successful in finding\nI'm all for it but they also have I I Love the single object rules in in legislation ... where do you deal with one subject and that's it you don't have this big mash up coming back from the other from the Senate or vice versa that just just blows up the whole deal\nThough I agree and and probably be a good thing is that in the in the U.S house we operate under the same rules that you are on during the general assembly jak you and I vote though that is\nStill really figure out the rules about how things are happening on the site has different rules so many policy that's got to get a bond together and you look\nAt it and go with Alice is related in any way shape or form in the the the the the most highlighted\nExample is here for about the Iraq passed the title of the bill was not the Affordable CARE Act they they they took they took a ... bill ... all the language out of it kept bumper and the title of the certainly the houses are is probably a quarter of Iraq\nSo it it's it's that kind of procedural stuff it's just shakes her head why how could that happen\nA lot but I Would argue that\nYou know sticking with the logic of systems like you see injustice\nManuals the way to make sure that your cheek debate on track you make sure you don't have a lot of you know Don related adopt or a piece of legislation people go how did that get in there and it's kinda like you know calling everything on the last train leaving the ... like\nYou know that stuff doesn't doesn't belong there are not related or the views you know as the as the vehicle to pass things that aren't aren't related so I I agree that's that's one of the I think the problem is up here is that it doesn't\nIt doesn't require the necessary debate in clubs porous said when you're using that mechanism when you have like related\nOr aspects of legislation or language\nTo bill people just you know look at it and go how how could that\nI Hope you all will take a look at some of the rules and get more to wherever a Virginia way of governing up in DC because I I one of the things that ah when you pull back from politics and and watch sports\nPeople get upset when they see rules violations because they know the rules ... last night there was a pitch Justin Berliner through as a slider and it was a beautiful smarter\nAnd Enron darling he was a pitcher for the Mets and the age and some other teams\nSaid that is a pitch you when you are warming up to you put your meltdown instead grab Patel I'm done that's a perfect pitch and it was and it was called the ball\nAnd the next pitch the Boston Red Sox guy hit him for a home run and as a as a fan you go that's outrageous only because the the the teleprompter had on there\nAnd then what happens and people in in politics people they don't know the rules to get upset about that's just not cricket you're not doing it the right way guys you know we deserve better and so they pulled back you know it's just the ... they they shrugged their shoulders and throw their hands\nYou know it's just it's just not working on on on my behalf you know I I don't get it right in the distance and or anything you can do to to to change that would be for the benefit ended my rent let's get back to the absolute let's get back to the national district what what are your voters telling you\nWell you know we're hearing a lot of state I think that they're that they're very interested in how do we ... a a continual um increase in our economy I think people\nAre are very positive about where the economy just borrow a I think they appreciate what's been done by Congress lessening regulatory burden and changing the tax code to make it easier for businesses individuals but the things that they want\nTo see going forward or what I call a sustaining parts of the economy and first of those things have an education system that assures that our children students get the officers are educational experience to be watching them\nTo feel the jobs are there are seven point one million jobs open and Chris and Seventy five percent of those jobs will not require a four year degree and that means we have to emphasize\nCareer and technical education as much as we do common stretch education because that's where the jobs are in those times today are skilled jobs but how awkward but as far as a career when you go from an apprentice your journey to a pastor and have a career there start early well so in many instances\nBetter than you wrote him a job that requires a college degree so I think people look at that and say that's where we have to go to looking at going how it's going to make sure the child is successful like how do we ensure the education system gives them the knowledge skills abilities\nTo compete for the jobs that are available today with the church and I think businesses look at it and say hey the other things and the economy was doing really well but Chris when I talked instances across it this way I can tell you the top three things they talk about our workforce workforce and workforce area and they said\nWe could grow up business today if we can just climbed workers to do the job and you know there are more job opening statement there are people build the job openings so where am I going to have this must have one other element to this article\nAnd that is brought in Italy for a broken neck is important on for hours I said part of education so there are a lot of families are children go to school they have a tablet computers and bring them home when they can't connect it's hard for\nThem to do the assignments that they've been given or the Armageddon with the\nPolitical vehicle taken to the library bottles to why five businesses anytime of the areas that don't have high speed can't do the business\nThey need to do to be successful and her one of the ways to bring on health care\nConnect with patients without having to go to an office building ... miles and miles away and can get that care and quality of those things all game change right so we really want broader than that we have to make sure we have an education system sizes Korean talking about education as much as a post college truck education\nAnd these are these are these are the tough issues because people don't go\nBroadband workforce development those those don't get the people out to the to the polls I mean they're just like no that makes sense I like that you know 'cause when when people get down into the\nBig regularity and I've talked about with other callers today in politics and the government's complex and people don't like complex they're like five were bumper stickers because they're pretty busy trying to make their lives working\nAnd putting that into the context of their daily lives come out and vote whichever way is a tall order for a lot of politicians right\nSure\nIn policy and [noise] it's complicated it takes town hall her off for anybody anybody in in our leadership position whether elected or thought possible applications have those conversations\nIn you know those booms lockers a whole lot of really still hangs\nOut here so it's just something that I come up with a lot of people say hey chronicle\nAnd yes it can be soundbites\nAre ways to help our economy heat but drill down is okay we've done in ... you can always say well he did or something that's quite shocking\nAbout us but I think ... or don't cross why don't you want a piece on the level of short asking for people to say I think that that's great you know chocolate syrup that may be seeing that's great but what people want to hear to work\nIf I'm going to place multiple again what are you going to do in the future how do you understand things get to eat on and what are you going to do to accomplish that what do you what you want to come back to us\nOr if you are we allowed to ask you approach the last ... last month for the things I sit on the phone but I was able to accomplish and and I just don't want that they want you to understand what's a quarter of that they want you to project location for the future about how\nThey're still going to be addressed so it's not just on the list of ... ... what are you going to connect with someone with people's concerns about the challenges facing your folks\nTell people audiences all done without ... politics is about the future not that bad it is and you can be seen like look what happened but very the economy's great unemployment is historically low and they just threw out the government pretty much there's some there's some there's some\nUndertow currents that you just have to go out there and pound doors\nYou understand and listen to people\nBecause the elections are about tomorrow night yesterday actually on the rise Rob I really appreciate your calling in today we wish you the best out there in the campaign trail you got what Eighteen days

Wilder school tell us briefly about the Wilder school what youre doing\nYes sir so uh where we're at a school of government and public affairs that we see here um ranked in the top any in US News and World Report for schools the public affairs you got for undergraduate and graduate programs focused on criminal justice homeland security and emergency preparedness\nPublic administration as well\nAs programs in the master's level and urban and regional planning in a PHD program and public policy and then we also have our Center for public policy what guy directly kids are consulting and community engagement arm of the work we do in the wild her school say you will see a lot of things around\nEconomic development a leadership in training look one state government outreach and things like public policy polling\nThat we deal with at the center for public policy in the wild her school\nWe're going we're coming up pulling real quick but you guys actually go out and work with uh other local governments and businesses that you helped him not just I think people don't understand that about higher education the value that you bring to the community and the state yes\nWe really do I mean we're done\nEverything from looking helping that localities looking at potentially providing incentives for certain business to come into their community and doing a return on investment of what that economic impacts it looked like on the proposal said\nWith regard to incentive then come back and provided them that actual economic impact if they went forward with a business and the impact that it had on the community with everything from revenue job creation\nAspect and that way out we've done valuations of um you know criminal justice programs so the implementation of a mental health program or a drug treatment program on reducing recidivism for local jail or or or\nA community partner we worked with a non profit from everything from their evaluations of the programs in projects that they do she also coordinating and combining the\nActual health but they need with regards to our students and our staff uh\nBut when the business community are looking at a third party evaluations of\nPrograms in projects in the private sector and looking to pitch to the general assembly and need an actual third party non biased evaluation of that work being able to provide that report for that company for the general assembly to look at legislative impacts so we do we are a continual partner\nEvery single day with our local and state governments around the commonwealth um and it it really is what we live and breathe in the ... school specifically um we do it at a much more\nCost effective rate than our private sector counterparts it you will because it really is our mission our vision and it allows us can bring to bear are\nAcademic expertise is well within the Wilder school you know we have every thirty academic faculty who their area of expertise you want to talk about uh the economic impact I've got four economist in an urban and regional planning program or you want to talk about the impact of an opiate program a treatment program I've got to the criminal justice a\nAcademic see that their area of expertise and they get asked all around the country to look you know present their research and were able to bring expertise to bear for our localities are in the commonwealth in Virginia\nSo that when you're a hero service higher education schools let me we we are we are\nYou know we we provide at all give us your students that we will educate them freshman in college to graduate school in PHD program give us your workers that we will train them in executive leadership and maintenance met preparation\nI give us your legislators and you allow the U.S and we will train them and policy analysis and the impact\nOf a variety of 'em on legislation and give us your community that will help you come up with solutions and then you need the evaluation of the impact on this we should say we really are um the one stop all encompassing education and consulting\nAcademic arm for a local and state government and our our citizens and students around the common law\nAnd that's why I brought it up and it will go the polling that your that your operations down there because I think it's so important for people to understand the totality of a lot of things and governments especially heritage which has the bulls on his back around the country but in Virginia we've got a great higher education system we really need to be proud of it\nUh even though it's you know it's it's appropriate\nTo hold them accountable now of questions but a lot of things you're talking about are free they aren't exclusive of of usual operations and they are a complementary to what you are doing and actually facilitate what you were doing in higher education I think it's wonderful I think it's misunderstood not understood at all but let's jump into some polling a that's a while the school has done\nWhat are you sitting out there what have you seen what direction are we going\nWhy don't we talk a little bit like Clinton on earlier so let's talk a little bit about policy and in polling in public policy that we did on this summer we were out in July we'll have another call roll it out right here after the election in November but in our in our public policy arena you talked about higher ed so let's talk about that\nThe entire commonwealth a true representative sample of all five regions I'm of our\nCommonwealth and when we look at and ask\nPeople what they think about the value of higher education in Virginia over eighty percent of our responded believed that the community colleges that we have\nIn Virginia or work their car over sixty\nFive percent believe that our public four year institutions are worth the cost and then right under fifty percent believe that our private\nSchools in the commonwealth of work the car\nSo it's really important that you said that question around down in Virginia we value higher education and not only that we value\n[noise]\nNews this hour from town hall Don timeline valley or in Dallas\nAnd so you have Donald Dell

thing the Democratic side no Republicans have grown up there right\nNo well you know this is talk of course about John chase sick and or Jeff blank running against Donald Trump for the Republican

Republican primary where a sitting president has been challenged it's getting on the right and job and these guys will be running on the last day really wouldn't have a prayer feeding\nThe president and the Republican primary\nRight now right now that's that's right now anything can happen goodness knows anything\nCan happen any thing of course and especially you know that God Forbid the economy

primary grass link were four hundred and Seventy nine days away something like that from the Democratic primary hamster [laughter] who's currently\nRight now that's why I think it's I think it's smart pressed for you to to be talking about just stop and go because the the the president shall I just stopped as you well know there's there's all kinds of things happening behind the scenes right now\nThis is where it happens right the pros frozen that I broke frozen them then [laughter]\nAnd then come the game after November's election candidates start doing things in a more public way but like I said senator or Joe a branch from New York was up here yesterday campaigning with the Democrats can't pay a candidate for governor in New Hampshire\nAnd show she's laying the groundwork change and and you know she's doing that all across the country and um [noise] ah so she's starting to to put things together\nYou've heard about a two of the guys he he's making rounds he didn't think he made his second trip to New Hampshire just this past weekend really twice in the last six months Alec Baldwin Alec Baldwin and he has said he has not ruled out running for private\nAh thank you Mike we're back in the news this this was my comment and my the producer of the show looking at we're making news this morning ... ball like this one\nYoung Alex Alec Baldwin has um a spoke at the largest fundraiser for the Democrat Party in New Hampshire to 'em are just last week yeah wow\nSee if he ran his old out Goldman is Jack Ryan you know it's kind of my ... yet but [laughter] that was back in the Cold War you know a hundred October [laughter]\nThat's right yeah so so who else you've seen up in in New Hampshire and who would you guess to be the front runners in the New Hampshire primary today likely to win or the twenty twenty primary in February next to Europe\n[laughter] Bernie Sanders run for president he will be the front runner okay just no doubt about it now I'm In New Hampshire no doubt about it if he doesn't uh down a little bit Warren will likely be the front runner\nOkay so how 'bout what recently happened with Senator Warren in New Hampshire how does that play with her I mean for fumbling of the DNA ancestry ball this week the disaster\nYou know and and democratic circles I actually don't think it's because it's much\nA liberal Democrats are going to be looking for a liberal Democrat regardless of facts [laughter] they [laughter] they they they they face their their choices and and position primarily on emotion and in a\nJesse Harris from Iowa just going to do if you heard that\nThe very a veteran democratic operative in in Iowa was describing a I'm a so called scene but in reality in the in the Democratic voter in the primary voters but they also want to win and they might go you know I don't think seniors can win nationally I think\nThat's the funny now I I'm a Republican I think the Elizabeth Warren would have a similar problem\nI don't think she's electable in a in a general election nationally nationally okay yeah I I like you know for that using DNA issue as an example\nUm I think so I think one thing I Will say though it's a I I don't think it affected her here in New Hampshire I Do think that affected the again the behind\nThe scenes operation a and then you know the [noise]\nThat's all the maneuvering going on behind the scenes among potential democratic candidates for her to actually take over a news sites all before the election the way she did was outrageously self serving\nDo I mean who does that why why would I mean if you knew the results of the DNA test and it was counter to your narrative that you're trying to look after you put that thing\nYou know I don't understand it so how do you think okay so you got Sanders worn just because it's New Hampshire but the other guys have got to go up there and compete or do they have to they might say just say you\nKnow and I think they do I think that you know because there's always going to be opportunities and that's as you probably know Chris I'm Bill Clinton made a name for himself by doing well and and coming back to to win at a time when she was losing\nSo you don't have to win the New Hampshire primary to make to make a lot of waves across the country\nSo especially as Elizabeth Warren is the proper she's from Massachusetts neighboring Massachusetts the candidate who comes in second and even third ah I can get momentum as a result\nYeah because I think Clinton finished third right yeah that's right yeah so\nSo but you have to win points for show in New Hampshire to advance do you have to yeah that's right that is correct and I ended up with\nWhat I don't think people understand about the the democratic nomination process this cycle is that California has moved up yeah and they're going to happen that's what we spent some stake in Kamala Harris McConnell Harris is going to have a big lead there\nYes and that's the I think that's going to be the interesting thing I didn't hear that you guys talked about this ... but on the Iowa\nA conversation but what she does in the early primary states will be interesting given the California moved up will she tried we'll ... we'll see try and uh and and pick a state to do well and well she try and do well in all of them and um you know 'cause they're so different to the early primary states ... compared to California\nWell again I think you have to at least try to compete in somebody's because\nThe reality is even though you might not win New Hampshire you won't matter and the the nomination legitimately so you still have to win in the in the electoral college\nThat try to push it on you can't you can't just blow past Iowa New Hampshire because those are those who have gone in either direction like especially with Trump won in Iowa last time that's right no doubt about it what issues are dry and New Hampshire voters these days what's going on up there\nWell expect uh uh the economy is still the number one issue\nUm the governor here is a Republican Christian you knew and he's and uh about what what Donald Trump's been doing it and governor Sununu the economy's booming we have the second lowest unemployment rate in the country\nAnd I'm off the Democrats don't want to talk about that they're trying to talk about anything but the economy with\nA family you know paid leave issue ... they're just trying to make up an issue that might connect with voters authors in the economy\nSo that's going to continue to be number one the second issue here Chris I I don't know how it how it worked in other states you've heard Donald Trump even talk about this to the opioid epidemic coup ah which is pretty ... pretty severe in New Hampshire so that's the second biggest issue\nThat's that's yeah sad but number it's affected our number here we've had we've had we've had that disease in our family as well and so it's a scourge of member people dying as a result of that is the doors anything else it's\n[noise] so it's not a partisan issue Mike a final production as what do you think coming out with got thirty seconds punch it when he got further the Democratic nominee finishers in New Hampshire twenty twenty\nI think it's going to go Elizabeth Warren a well when or if she runs she is going to win the New Hampshire primary\nUm I think they're going to be I think there's going to be some kind of dark horse like a um a court reporter I expect will be somewhere in the top three um and then and then you know what I\nWould not be surprised if someone like Michael Bloomberg long is it as well because the Democratic state we ... we end up paying for all of this\nAll right Mike Dunn a joining us from the Granite State of New Hampshire four hundred and eighty days plus or minus out of the New Hampshire primary thanks for joining us we'll be back on the John ... filling in that crust that much\nHow how do you know we're not allowed to drive home a lot I\nMean nor nor should you should the anyone in politics it's it's constant but how do you how do you compare the intensity this year to last year when he was the same similar not as intense when he's well\nSimilar but I think we we're we're very proud particularly in Virginia last year when we send\nA message to the country into the world\nThat you know hated bigotry have no place here and that we were open and welcoming for business with the election of governor north on in his team and then you got that job verse set of a house candidates that got across the finish line that just beautiful tapestry of 'em on all of our our\nOur candidates that are women and a diverse women on I ... it just it you know so that was that was really great but I think what's happened is\nPeople realize we hey we can do this we can do this and it's just health doubled down I mean we've seen for example the surge in the absentee balloting I'm In\nFairfax County in Prince William county which our number one and two right now in the state on requests for absentee ballots you know that's good for us that's that's really I remember when I think we're just added you know adding more excitement and enthusiasm right\nLike Clinton kid was on earlier seven o'clock hour he said he he thinks the turnout was going to be forty to forty five percent that's a large large a range and there but we're projecting turn out right now\nWe're just going out there looking for every single\nVote that way [laughter] I Know where do you think the terminals than your average\nMid term elections which normally a hard but we have a reason to get out there is a lot at stake and um and um so we're going to be better than your average and it turns out you know I'm not into\nYou're describing\nGround yeah we're in that she uh T. V. now famous and we are just trying to get out our votes and bring over anybody else that wants to come\nUp and then in person with your with your crop of Kansas this year and last year they they definitely worked hard when when they're struck me as a sort of an obvious one is that your the predominant of female candidates nominees\nRight this is definitely the year the woman I like to talk about our women candidates and then I got an e Anthony Flaccavento that in the\nNight [laughter] I mean Jennifer Wexton is is I mean and they're all they have a different kind of experience and diversity but it is all good and all will be a good refreshing breath um ah for Congress and across the crops up atomic several states that are in general\nFor West End up there on the chance congressional district that we're really excited about what we see up there\nUm the volunteers are just showing up on non stop and the Washington Post endorsed ... which is something that I'm a you know at Barbara Comstock got endorsed every other time when they're very disappointed at her and she's going to stand up Donald Trump and that proved not to be the case so a hundred times are\nJeffrey ... going to be on a congresswoman and then down and I'll just run through a real quick if you want to ask me something about him but we will go out on the line at lower oil and the second district a retired navy commander in a small business woman and\nOf course Scott Taylor got he's on his own problems with Don or you know trying to cheat and quite frankly and on\nAnd and and having a staff of ... ... signatures on the ballot I mean that's you know that's unheard of stuff that's\nPretty seemingly and I I mean 'cause I Want to reject that but but even that we you know without that we still have a fine you know could credible candidate\nWell I Would have on a when I've seen in your in your tennis you have to do or the obviously a female when I think it says regardless of the outcomes and we can\nTalk about polling and they'll come November and you know going to go up and he's got less than a Coburn and in\nThe in the Williams and Louis in the in the six or what I think it's sending a signal though is moves that you're going to see even more women in the future running for office regardless of party and I think it's a very unhealthy dynamic yeah\nYeah and I wanna I Wanna I Wanna say two things on that real quick we were really excited that Leslie covering just got moved into the red to blue um program for the D triple seats but the thing I think you're exactly right about women women have always um um\nWomen have always and studies show yes but you know then the ones that would and I know your mom would agree with me on the asked would have\nBeen all over my heart at some things don't go [laughter]\nGo the way that raise my kids I got to get my degree got to pay off my line and you know a man can do it better and I think really one of the I guess if you have to say good outcomes of twenty sixteen was when they decided well not waiting anymore we're going to step up you have a lot of money or something\nYeah because someone said is that what I'm saying now otherwise you know if you're not to table you're on the menu and easy look at what is at stake this year with women's health care a lot with families ah\nWith just health care in general you know women have a lot to add to that and there I Believe I just don't think we're going to step back anymore\nNo no no I don't I don't think you should and I think having the frankly it's not just that they're women but they're but they're in a certain age range to relatively speaking to me a couple of the older older a little younger books for the most part you're you're center cut on mom's right the suburban mom is is it is a strong voting I won't say walk but a marketing\nBut I I think your party is obviously intentionally trying to attract\nCorrect correct and um those suburban moms some of them who voted for Donald Trump I\nThink has seen the ramifications of that vote and we are reaching out and talking to them and particularly when you take something like the Kavanaugh's nomination where\nYou know stress on the fact of whether you didn't they didn't believe Dr Ford this was a man who temperament we saw back his temperament that is not fit to be a judge and then add on to it the fact\nOf you know her very compelling tests the testimony and I'm\nIn and they you know Republicans decided not to believe up to ... there's going to be some ramifications from that\nOkay um let's talk about ...
