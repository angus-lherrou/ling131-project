got we've got lots of coverage today and we talk a little bit about job but obviously what's on everybody's mind as the cabinet confirmation the impact is going to have\nSegment we'll get to the

[noise] there was a procedural vote today\nHow old are you seeing this breaking down there and what is the impact going to be an image as well so I I think you'd\nProbably get confirmed at this point that in the FBI didn't find any cooperation um so I think through you're going to get the Republican members um and probably Joe Manchin I think mentioned puts his re election in jeopardy if he does it as a fourth\nThird third party cooperation none but I'm telling you is if somebody has to try these kinds of cases in court there's a lot different markers or better test maybe we should point to somebody's being credible type you know talking to the therapist about ten years ago in which apparently the document and therapists notes I mean who helped put themselves out there and put themselves through this crap\nUm if it if it didn't happen um I mean what what other motives I don't I don't see why she would\nYou can just pick somebody based on what just now I didn't convict anybody but this guy's applying for the highest court in Atlantic not applying for a job to dominoes to deliver pizza and I think\nThe the burden that you have in terms of uh keeping somebody off of a lifetime appointment is entirely different then so anybody can make any allegation talk of operation nobody here ... nobody's talking about taking away the guy's liberating putting them in jail that's a that's a different issue than it is you know everybody's out to Republicans\nSaid that Trump would put up somebody can come come out and say he uh did something to me [noise] forty years ago I have no evidence no corroboration and that's the\nI didn't say something that's and sexual assault was an entirely different issue and you got to put yourself in the context of the time and the place and back then in the Nineteen eighties wasn't some people can't afford\nIt don't they don't come for nearly as much today about it and they said that they back then when I was in high school and I kinda think people in\nYou you didn't hear about the right track I lost a sheen but externally credible yeah very emotional ... and and I do think that I think that taking that extra week going back and interviewing some of the people more judge and others around it\nI think it was with the right thing I think slam dunk and just playing a role in the day after her would have been terrible politics and would have been terrible on the institution\nHaving said that nobody else can remember the party who was there ... there's just too many holes to really make the case that doesn't mean she's wrong [noise] but but that's a tough standard for the future but he can come forward and say anything\nNot to say that but it's just I just want you to go back within six days in remember after she testified Chris Wallace from Fox News and the president talked about how\nCredible she was in all public operators protects the everybody right after she testified this is done it's over ... toast and then seven days later without Rob back to where we weren't to may seem to me how fast the world changes but back to what we're talking about before I did we got\nI Want to say now that he's up by fire a segment\nOf blackouts I saw a poll last week that I'm a ... thing that's that that's the poll you read when they're asking you to do rock climbing hills around he certainly is not a partially\nBy by either under fifty well under well under shift and I and I think what you gotta remembering this is if you don't see no independent she's in Seoul ... I think this is for him this this changes the outcome of it is right\nYeah I I Can't I ... and I'm not an expert on West Virginia but it seems to me Joe Manchin pole position that I'm an independent guy I'm not beholden to either side and uh\nI I think it would be hard for him to get reelected it would seem to me you know what a Trump when the state by like fifty points something like that\nAnd I'm not on also not convinced and Susan Collins is going to run again either\nAnd I don't know that that I think it's ... I'm ...\nAnd she's never voted against the Supreme Court judge ever you have a group in the state that could a million dollars a say in law she votes against million got hands meant\nYeah okay now it's up to a million and a half ago front of me but it looks like a bribe I'm I mean I think at the end of the day without corroboration she's going to be there for for for which she I agree with Tom ... not only twenty twenty twenty is she going to run again well should make that decision at the appropriate time [noise]\nI I think I think Tom now that I think she has got to vote yes ah the one that I have no read on the top Davis is I'm Lisa Murkowski of\nWhat about what about you [noise] pretty independent I mean just remember this when she lost that primary to Joe Miller the last Republican primary right she run is they write in with the name Murkowski that we can\nSort of hang ups and also as you want to get a laugh but you know I mean the part about the independents pizzas when guys like mentioned when it's because they claim they're they're reelected terms looking out for their state right mhm and Murkowski has a big issue with the cabin opinion about Alaskan natives I think was something\nThat she got she ... she she she does on on that issue so no it's not clear cut I haven't seen the polling in Alaska or they but they I think if you get ... like you know I think you're going to get flaky booed him out of committee and so I think without some crap ration Jeff Jeff is fundamentally\nVery conserved right and you got to be water Institute He's also very independent and I think\nA very principled guy which is why people think he's flaky because he doesn't always taken one boxing\nIsn't always protected by this judged if you've got to understand for Republicans this unites us this is the very important vote on the court or as it is on the Democrats on the other side uh wanting somebody else\nCan I ask you a question has a has a a vice president were broken a tie on a Supreme Court nominees chocolate knocking aren't aware of yeah I think that would be unprecedented ...\nBut that can and then we'll kind of a challenge that\nBut it still counts how do you know that it just sort of thing that competition just as an advise and consent and there's got to be no ... or you want to eat the president and he goes but he's not a member I I can\nTell you the state like Virginia right not bringing in your state center it's not Virginia he'll sniff nomination yeah [laughter] yeah [laughter]\nAnd if he's confirmed that they're going to do and they take over the house or the Senate to move to impeach that would be a disaster two thirds of the Senate good luck yeah let's just like I think you're going to get around\nOf elections have consequences that's when I take away but here's ... let's get the Republicans have been stealing Supreme Court [noise] well I I mean all of a war on poverty from one here's the problem I still can't get over the fact that Trump won two years later he's still can't get over ... been\nMarried Garland well let me let me talk about America I think might bite every indication is a very honorable straightforward would have made a good Supreme Court judge in in the traditional sense but he's balanced he's not completely a liberal democratic operative before he won the bench but but met the criteria for free judge\nBut what is better not holding a hearing on are doing what they've done in this case and that is bringing is putting the sham of of hearing him and then finding a way to trashes reputation and voting now they work at a confirming it was an election year Republican senators were you to confirm school we used to eat and putting on a more liberal member just wasn't going to happen\nIn a presidential politics here not a mentor\nWho knows who knows what the rules are writing about it but if the president and it's the president United States to nominate somebody for the frame court out the senator by rights that threat so therefore I think McConnell's argument is out when he says look a that was the president you only have like a lot of voters decide that ...\nBut I'm just saying that they stretch it each time I don't know who started his but it keeps getting worse and worse and worse\nAnd once you do it for one year you could do two years you could do it three years I I don't know there aren't any guard rails long enough I think it was they moved it from sixty votes to fifty votes for everything but the Supreme Court of course they're going to do it for the Supreme Court if there are no guard rails anymore and this and that's what's scary\nBut I got I got a text here from a DJ Republican operative in Virginia Beach if there is such a thing did you uh Joe mansion is only apply for in the latest Fox poll as though uh two days ago I applied for not Fifteen so Scott needs to what check his email is what\nOne of our listeners that they ... they have gotten another email on that let me check into that chefs got another email where\nThe boys are factory town waiting\nOn right by the Breitbart spores that must be well that is part and says I don't know eight or what's his name battle is destroying Ted Cruz\nSaid oh it's not going to win that we're with top top Democrat on the Republican congressman from northern Virginia Jim riches favorite congressman ever we've got ... Peterson is with us we're at jeopardy this world headquarters here in Fairfax city and Scott surveillance state senator from northern Virginia Democrat\nAnd part of democratic leadership\n[noise] he's not part of the ... on a fairly good but there isn't room for saying that if you're challenged\nIf you if you challenge the\nOf anybody yeah\nSeen a seven am in a while real clear politics average I'm at right now is nine points for well that's a far cry from Fifteen oh here's one plus well temperature Thirteen or Fifteen minutes and plus wellness when I was thinking\nLike answer here there has been consistently ahead I may have shot I'll give you I'll give you that and I think\nBut I take a no vote here changes that have that dynamic there was a poll earlier before all this controversy or that showed that if you voted against it can also be numbers change on this is the\n... I don't dispute the fact that the numbers would change a but from my perspective I think Kavanaugh confirmation to is probably in terms of the Democratic enthusiasm plane that's five to ten sheets maybe\nIt's been a teacher too I mean well I think it helps in house in her too because when it's brought on very red territory North Dakota uh Missouri I mean these are pretty solid state West Virginia in the Senate races Kavanaugh clanking itself or public\nOr wherever worse where we're at a time for a couple of unscheduled finally avenues but one thing I\nThink Tom nailed it this is the only thing I've seen in since Trump announced that has a unified Republican I've never seen anything like this we couldn't figure out how to do it we're going to talk about\nI said Fifteen I was twelve point for when I went back and actually look at the polls\nThat limits the cabinet discussion\nYeah we want to go ahead of weight and that but that we've got to get the fuck for football hockey but go ahead\nOh well when I'm ... last night among the winner\nAnd the Senate Judiciary committee the official account of the Senate Judiciary committee is tweeting about Democrats do not understand the definition of moving I doubt it will be a Senate Judiciary account this thing is so off the rails and and and I feel like\nYou know people were completely missing the point with all this process crap\nYou know the reasons you just shake many sweetie and is that the Democrats have the definition run a book it's our process and none of it is actually on where people are on it and where voters are on on this is the Kavanaugh only has the support of the conservative base and the message that women are getting around the country\nIs that you know people are OK with sexual assault\nNo I think that's that is that you can get their\nMessage they're either they're getting you're now a pronounced\nWrongdoing or joining in the room and it's a good message that right I mean this is the same democratic\nParty to defend that Bill Clinton bit of tactics accusers Murray especially the one that got raped well\nFirst of all the time I went to the ... the allegation\nOf rape against Bill Clinton which which actually didn't they\nA week after on national television that whole process so when you say the Democratic party rallied around him whenever that allegation mostly mouth at at the time I'll say second thing is\nThat was why he lied to say\nIs you're talking about with all jumped right ... Jones is different than ... then that was not rape I got through to me I was ... really cannot after that was ever capitalize interview\nWas a week after the Senate in the Senate about that you have the sequence Catherine really was the same time it's Paula Jones or that you're thinking about\nThe need or what but either by abroad living in the first to where I was in the person you were not rape allegations anyway the point [laughter] the message\nThat women are getting around the country is that this is okay\nAnd Republicans are now into a debate about the definition of ... I mean the devil trend and doubled struggle I mean it is a this is on the official Senate Judiciary count look everybody knows what we've seen it either not you have to first of all I don't know what I'm\nHoping this Butina is inserting drugs in your inner instead of taking them down your throat because your body will process it faster Internet Iraq did you believe that I learned during the eighties right where that everyone knows what that means I didn't know what I Hope they don't want to be a\nVery very interesting very innocent crowd here that has no idea what that word means I Do not and then and then you know kept on going to go on national television taken out to be like oh it's a funny joke I mean this is so ridiculous and absurd\nWasn't embarrassing nominee that talks\nAbout the process a Democrat in let me earlier that you just really getting bad in the world you're talking about polling calling on energy winters\nBowling on this very split the ... this is not overwhelming pulling against capital on this is right down the middle at this point\nIn which is worse than history but we get Supreme Court justice or never dominant or what we have are down there may not matter because we're just\nTalking about the electoral repercussions when are you going to you kicked the hornet's nest the Republican base that was kind of depressed at this point in what you see now in in terms of the energy base of both parties the enthusiasm gap as close and that's a critical Democrats a couple of cents at least you know\nI get like nobody wants to have a family that are doing sexual has done sexual assault get off of it we want people to come over here it's okay you have probably for the double right she fell into it or\nOr the guy who was the guy the ravens beat up his girlfriend and drop your by the hair and they they pay them more money\nJust for for whatever it's worth I mean I I totally concur on Keith Ellison I got that publicly I campaign for his opponent you know on line when he got into the primary for attorney general I said this is not right to like doing it um\nAnd put your shoes you should be that's the end and not you may remember his name in general but it it it ... and it is bad because a lot of people will look the other way 'cause any should not be the number two person on the Democratic\nNational Committee right but this is the Supreme Court and you have a guy who not only has a credible accuser and we'll put the other two aside from that\nThat's what I understand a lot of your cooperation what's your core operation her collecting contemporary hits\nHits it to people she said was present at the party he turned over his calendars from the same month and at the same people are listed on his calendar\nAnd as being like a social group emerging offense at parties and she didn't go to school so she wouldn't even know those people and that was all his calendars were released after she made now\nIn none of them you know reading her best friend can remember this like right but that's not corroborate you know what but you know in in common in your\nParents I mean I Am I'm going to much money at high school reunion in next month it's been a long time or not and I'm the youngest person here if I was in a social function in high school and no one told me that a a a traumatic event for someone else had occurred I Would have not remembering the event the next week\nLet alone Twenty years later he came to me now and said oh were you at this pretty ... I don't know I was at that party or\nNot this guy produced calendar of what he was doing that number and nobody can pinpoint nobody can pinpoint where in the when the party was where was who invited her how she got there how she got home\nYou got to have something outside of some memory wishing credible witness absolutely but I've seen credible witness before going wrong memories get over Thirty years I don't remember a lot of things Thirty years ago or or I remember them differently than they were in his corrected\nLook I don't know who's telling the truth ear but I think the mere allegation enough if that's now the standard to take somebody down I think we wanted\nTo I don't think this is an allegation I mean I I I think now if I think that when you look at you know I'm ... ... people have put a lot of holes in the story of the the third accuser um and I think\nThat you know you obviously have to hear both sides of you know when an accuser comes over to their credibility this this accuser everything she has said you can cooperate with what she had done with how she had lived her life\nWith the notes from her therapy sessions\nBut we're we're we're actually right now\nI Know you're not too early in the notes from earth or she says you already get them to the end she offered enough yet when the interviewer\nShe want to give that to the community very committed they\nDon't want to look back then I mean I\nI appreciate your passion and you know your friend and I love you to death but when did you sense off I mean she said she couldn't fly and then we find out she jumped up to me and my were fliers she's flown all over the world and we're going we're hoping to reach a month ago she Iraq so\nThey they said she could be in a place where the one door that was tax revenue in fact\nThe person I dated her and the parents said she ever spent any by the door she lives in a tiny apartment with one door that was fought she said was a\nLie detector test I never did that I don't know anything about it is that in her former first date or said no she actually got paid to help people through lie detector tests you know everything about it so there was a lot of things that you\nThey say everything I said it's but I I don't even know what's true anymore yeah\nThat's correct arsenal wine I I don't even know I think her testimony was a compelling testament but I Will give you that everybody watched that but I thought he was too and if my reputation for being trashed I'd be a little emotional ... as as well what happens\nNow everybody's back into corners it's a very divided country what it his gun indigent equalize the enthusiasm gap which was in the Democrats' favor prior to this [noise] I agree with that and and that is the politics of this we can argue forever that's got to be a good judge in history will tell bad\nBut it's really not it was ... that this was a certain this was a circus I think it's diminished that both the institution of the Senate and the and the court to clown show and I just feel like it's a good one at least they took a week to go back in the interview some of these other people in close that the ... it's never going to be enough if you come back and you don't take this guy out for the Democrats\nAnd on same on the Republican side so we'll have a vote tomorrow I think it passes and and and you move on\n'em and we'll go to an election that were saying earlier as if he doesn't pass it probably be the best result for the Republicans are now more intense\nI agree I I think that the enthusiasm gap um I don't think it's not as much as the Republicans are claiming that has to think that there are some I'm a ... or not you know in our internal polling sure as you as you know like you know pulling will show noise in the wilderness is going on there was like ... and and the reality we're\nFair and the and the reality is that if you are correct that he's going to get confirmed\nThat there's not going to be a Republican

end by double digits um she obviously is capable of [noise] of doing more um than um\nThan that um you know she's been a state senator so I'm Talking on policy side um says she's not without chopped right but at this point in this rates she's being told we just script don't mess up that's what happened in that debate I don't disagree with you that like you know\nDid was she a little plane at the debate yes did she make any major errors no and that's what Barbara Comstock so upset about the debate that you know wants to talk about how she did so poorly Barbara's limited as Jennifer didn't make any errors that allows barber to get back in ...\nIt's a landslide it's been a landslide the tenth district\nHas every single demographic group that is breaking against Trump in this country over represented in it if the Democrats do not take the tent the Republicans will hold Congress at that I agree with I don't think yeah it's it's not an end right now that's not in the realm of possibility\nBut the Republican polling is telling me that she's tire or slightly had\nBarbara is going to lose by double digits Tom when she's over perform for polling Everytime her whole career she'd go work for\nYou and your ears the problem is every demographic group or the Republicans are losing market share right now are collected in from from federal employees are high income educated voters gun now she's a woman and she talks\nThat the difficulty they have is the Republicans took away the one weapon Frank more fun I had to survive up your nose you're more [noise] I was not Tom Davis I was Mr gotten closer word in prison Mr Woodrow Wilson bridge Mr rail to almost\n... Barbara gets none of that uh because the Republicans get away with their constitutional obligation on or do you know to to designate projects so this makes it even more difficult\nShe's with held a lot of her fire\nInto the closing weeks on a jet or for in terms of their research I'm not going to tell you what it is so I think this race quotas and so I've seen races close a lot more at this point but this was this was a tough race it it's a tough atmosphere and as they tough district and remember\nAlright where with a tribute than what was that something you said again just as\nShe wants to make some ...\n[laughter] I\nJust I got to treat that out at age ... thirty are driven Tom Davis a chapter you to send in your got a lot of the truth here John just rhetoric let's get to the other races\nLet's get to the seven I just had Barbara I just said Abigail Spanberger on my show yesterday in a very complex candidate no doubt but ah I see a little momentum going for a day but I did think it was going to win a week ago now I I think he is going to win a\nHow do you see that race [noise]\nSo I I had that one are slightly Republican up until the Kavanaugh hearings at this point I think it's a toss up on because what the Kavanaugh hearings did was really re energized and fire up the one voter block that's the problem for Dave Brat in some district which is suburban women\nUm and I think that the seven districts historically Republican it should be a Republican voter Republican ... I'm Still like him last year um but I'm the one path or a Democrat there isn't an right to in Chesterfield with the suburban women\nAnd I think apple yells at the match for them and I think that the Republicans are doing everything they can to lose that block naturally right now um and so I haven't it's tough\nThink many crew later this capital knowledge in terms of I mean I enter let me just say yeah in in terms of what this is doing politically and I think we all live in our own echo chambers and we all have our own perceptions of how it's done but what this is done in the ... and some other polling demonstrate this is the Republican base is now\nActivated enthusiasm gap would you favor the Democrats for the last year and a half is now closed substantially\nAnd I think that works to perhaps paper they bred has two two issues though outside the demographics the district in the DNA that district is Republican number one he is not close the deal with some of cancers people and they were just assuming throwing him under the bus and rent that seat out for two years\nAnd bring back or ... you know somebody it's more in line with their thinking in in even some scores and secondly Tim Kaine is going to be exceptionally strong in that district he was mayor of Richmond if he has a political he's widely ... either\nMark Warner that that that the I think that's right this this jacks up that democratic turnout there so you got a factor that into this spring I still think at the end of the day that the DNA of that district establishes itself from and bright wins but to put this is a close race in Democrats have nominated ... she's\nVery ... or whatever happens you're talking about a company that's got to be involved in democratic politics for some time I think I think Abigail Spanberger is going to happen to be somebody's got to be reckoned with a and a democratic circles for some time to shop\nDot dot you know I don't I don't know a ton about the district uh uh you know I Will say I was driving down to south opportunity to go to an event last weekend and going through some of the rural counties and it seems like your bracket margins out of those counties are but obviously the critical mass of the the district is in Chesterfield in right go so\nYou know I I Would probably say you know robotically it's a Republican district but obviously if it's a wave here than it could be one that the Democrats deal that would have to defend in twenty twenty\nOr let's get to the second district Taylor ... or whatever happened it was a tailor the other day I had him on my radio show or the campaign put my [noise] my name and their team TV ads so I appreciate the PR for that what's going on in that race but\nThis is my first chance to respond to Scott right after he had a meltdown on your show on that went viral yet I'm Upset about our analysis last time I'm announces has not changed he's still going to lose 'em and\nUm I don't think I don't believe the New York times poll I think it was you know I I ... up to this point I thought you know controls were pretty good I had the last week they did not been um I think there's some noise going on\nUm but I think what is going to win and she's going to win going way [noise] um so I think she's going to win going away I think it's going to be\nA [noise] a you describe Hillary up until two months ago I was doing everything right um and he's really blown it\nAnd he's not going to win reelection and so are you say it's because of the whole the validation signatures issue in the way he's handled it and remember that this district is one of the few in the country\nThat not only sits in the ... side a media market but is in a media market that doesn't really stretch too many other districts so the media has been all over the stress on the evening news every night you know if Barbara Comstock at a petition scandal and attempt district\nIt would have made these TV for forty five seconds one night\nOr maybe a week later they quickly re mentioned that you know 'cause you you cannot\nWith something like the tide water on hand to roast here so let me let me ... I like I think are the New York times for property rights cater is fixed that district very well\nOr you know it was a Navy SEAL all that kind of stuff is ... issue matrix and he's chosen I think you're in line with that district is not a far right kind of guy he understands as a suburban Virginia Beach in those areas so we have all that\nThe Democrats are very very good chance ... and you've every year the favors Democrats ... what's ... is a Republican what scares me about this was the fact that if you look nationally Democrat just a ton of cash and dropping a couple of million dollars on that race and the last week ... megaphone just can overwhelm at this point and exaggerate these things I think\nI think they are trying ... correcting papers up today again if are betting I I I think he wins\nBut ... in this environment with the kind of money Democrats she put down a you've got to be nervous about this you're going to watch certain election night if the Democrats win this seat it tells me it's going to be a pretty good year farm in terms of we're talking thirty five forty yeah the thing about [noise]\nThe thing about this district has different than ... stock and it's definitely different than a brat is the turnout model is totally different and I think it's hard for Democrats to win the seat in a non presidential year are just based on who vote democratic and Virginia Beach Norfolk\nIt's you know the the typical democratic voters are being minority down there and unless you get an outside performance it's not ... I think it's tough for the Democrats win that seat I mean Glenda I wanted two thousand and eighty got flushed down the drain and twenty ten\nAnd the reason was democratic vote came out in the presidential year for Barack Obama it wasn't there the next cycle for Glenn Nye 'cause nobody knew Glen I was [noise]\nUm I think God's got advantages that the turnout I remember back when I was in the house caucus we'd look at the turnout bottles and the numbers and [noise]\nYou know Virginia Beach and offered the numbers are just forty percent of what they are in other parts of the state so it's just it's it's you got a lot of people that live there that are you know enlisted men or women that are registered to vote elsewhere so it's just it's hard\nYou know to to break people out and that type of environment even though was bench correct you have what the market and you know they could ... Scott from now till the end of the time but there's gonna be a conservative there's going to be a conservative votes that's going to come out\nAnd whether uh uh Maria I don't know how to pronounce it ... whether or not she can get people out based on her name as opposed to you know Tim Kane is not as big a magnet there was ... enrichment um so I I still think it's up help with the Democrats even though I agree that looks like ... kind of watch this one issue\nNinety six and ... just wanted ... well I'm ... we had a we had a scandal um state wide where John ... put a television add up against Mark Warner who was ... was far ahead and um he photo shop Mark Warner and your picture\nOr who's in the picture and ... I Can't remember who used ... better shot but Clinton I think yeah you ... with Clinton was while her eyes ... there was a racial aspect to it too I Can't remember what they did but they put ... Mark Warner into a picture he wasn't in and I'm ... television that\nAnd it was a huge but national scandal for John Moore who had a moderate brand and why does a a guy that you know everyone looked she likes you know what you're trying to say it's got ...\nThey're like had a friend okay and ... and that people you know like respected John Warner much higher than Scott Taylor though [noise] and and his numbers collapsed\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd libertarian broke five percent and libertarians to automatic ballot access to the next five years in Virginia which ... which are the public and\nThat was going to expire this year because ... percent again now they're taking according to where there'll be another five years would libertarian automatic ballot access\nLoud they're great and why is that is a good point that's a fact what is it going to get over five no no question probably seven\nHere to filter out the orders that year which I think you think is going to win or lose\n[noise]\nUh what what ... what about Scott Taylor\nMaria [noise] you know what's going on [noise] and I feel ... [noise]\nWell [noise]\n[noise] and ah spam I'm a\nTerrorist got nothing but negative publicity from a over the last several months and I don't see him climbing out of the whole could be wrong but I don't see that and I also don't [noise] I mean you're\nCop stock can talk about her internal so she wants that's not what people were picking up going door to door [noise] so what have you heard of that\nDependent doors I'm not talking about you know going to try to bolster the Democratic are going to democratic doors\nThat those people were telling her they're worth it and when it on occasion they've asked what's the main complaint [noise] uh if and this is for Kavanaugh 'cause I talk to anybody since then\nUh it was the n._r._a. [noise] those ads have been effective but this capping off thing I mean that's all you know the door to door and that's all I get\nFired or\nQuit ... got to go we've we've we've got to get to the rest yep we've got to be getting money nice ride Carolina right let's start with where they are early in the right you have to be happy so far\nYeah generally happy I think the defence like I said a month ago yawn with fast a good and and they're going to get better I think their deepest will get better\nUm I I think they need to give a couple of guys more snaps a couple of guys less naps but\nBy and large I like their defense to be a top ten defense this year and for the next few years going forward it makes it for us\nI think they do they have one issue that need to solve and I can solve it if they listen to me they all week on the ends they don't have any big play receivers that can go down catch the ball you know catch eight balls for a hundred yards\nAnd you need to have that too when consistently in the NFL you can't just keep throwing to your titans and your backs especially with a\nTight and like Jordan read that's never gonna get injured ...\nDesert on the street [noise] he's bet on the street I in you know Bruce is my friend Bruce how I emailed him literally within twelve hours if they're being caught by Dallas begging begging them to pick up desk I have repeated it every time I've seen him [noise]\nThe day he sets his foot on Redskins park you'll be their number one receiver they could get rid of Josh Fox and yes I said it\nThey could keep Jamison in crowd or in the slot they can get that keep that get record saying that there are number two receiver who's fast\nBut then you need a big receiver who can pull down eight nine temples a game for a hundred yards desk and do it and so if they put him on the team they will be the best in the NFC East and will make the playoffs White House [noise]\nDallas like losing um I think it's [laughter] you know they don't like to when they like to lose a why did you know why do they do what they do I do they keep patient care to head coach you know I mean\nWhy do they get rid of Tony Romo and it's just I I think somewhere Jerry Jones just decided he was tired of winning and water and start losing for a while and so that's that's why does what he does\nThat what what do you think that I mean is that the answers that dependency [noise]\nYeah I I'm I'm they were going down and [noise] I Can't believe we're talking about the Redskins are not referring to them as the first place [noise]\nYeah that's true first place and a phrase or like the first like type yeah that's\nI'm going to say at this point a lot better than I thought there'd be this year still very very tough schedule and next week I'm going to say nine and seven and\nThey're all this year so I'm not in the ...\nOr one of the things it's always heard that\nBut there are over ... you're going to [noise] you know getting him since Ninety four and one of the things that the Redskins of lack for some time there's a speed demon and\nI Can't remember the last time I'm sure I probably missed something but I cannot remember the last time I've seen the Redskins a Redskin return a ... or kick off for a touchdown\nAnd a while and it's been a long time\nAnd I remember one of the hallmarks of a boom party girl was that he always had pets he called it one burner\nWhether it was you know on your nerves whoever I mean it was he always had at least one burn\nAnd we don't have that and uh it it shows\nHow many how many when you're there forever can get ... ... ... ... I got fired last one I Know they went from ...\nYeah yeah I think [noise] they threw it to happen again [noise] maybe three months [noise]\nAh they beat New Orleans at the superdome and ... on the way to an eleven o'clock season [noise] no not\nAll right I'm going to go in the middle I think they're going to win ten games I think you gotta make layoffs and here's your here's the thing about Alex Schmidt [noise] I'm not a fan of it because you can't win big games in the playoffs so we got an exciting quarterback but uh you know I've watched him now three weeks I'm not a fan one way or the other but they're on TV [noise]\nBut I mean he manages gangs and he's never going to be you know he's never going to be himself and\nI could see one thing I can see why they are Alan Johnson money that's been kinda fits what they're what the whole crew in the philosophy is now granted out a win games [noise] and\nI think that I think that seem to get a winter games are they they could get in the playoffs will be a dangerous [noise] I guess I got to sign off I got to be in court today okay thank you for sharing your even if they were going to\nLet me just quickly add the unemployment down to three point seven percent the lowest since Nineteen sixty nine lord since Nineteen [noise]\nWhich you know I Can't rattle stories are not getting ready to comment on this really quickly John and say this is it's an amazing that\nBut not for the reason the Republicans wanted you to be an amazing that became [noise] people say nothing sticks on Trump\nAnd I think it's the opposite I think everybody thinks that on Trump the fact that you have an economy that's as good as it is and he's having a going to have a bad of an election that he's going to have everything in sticking to him because you should have with the economy [noise]\nOne of the first times where the president picks up the if it was an economy election I'm a Republican\nHaving the best economic performance and the biggest gains in the high income areas are the ones turning against in the fastest so for people to say nothing sticks to Trump\nEverything we're sticking to try [noise]\nWell I think he'd get credit for the economy and I think [noise] I think he gets credit for the economy and I think that mitigate against the law says they take just because of the ... the cycle but these coalitions are basically cultural coalitions are not economic coalition and\nAs I said the Democratic enthusiasm and the independents wanting to balance the government is really what hurts or [noise] people don't trust the Republicans to have the keys to they want some kind of check on ... yeah he's doing okay they may vote for him in two years\nBut in the mid term they want to put a check on [noise] I I was saying this do I think the Democrats take the house\nIs I think is more likely than not uh I I don't know how they don't impeach the president when it comes out you got the Democratic base right now is rabbit they want to impeach him now before motors a commission and when you [noise] I I don't know how Democrats going back to their\nPrimaries in twenty twenty can't not to impeach Trump I I just think that happens in rent for\nThe kind of on the issue of whether they have any any reasonable evidence or doctors you're likely to have\nA lot of them think they have reasonable evidence now I don't know what more is going to say you know what he's going to say um but I just think you look at the base and you look at the fact that the primary elections or what most of these members worry about\nThat it's politics are going to do it I'm not arguing in shutting down to earth and now takes on Capitol Hill yeah well I I think what happens is it changes the dynamic for twenty Nineteen [noise] it was one thing in twenty Seventeen Trump's than Republicans control everything to put a check on him\nWhat the Democrats come in Congress like our clients of Republicans in Nineteen Ninety four\nIt kind of then but you know it's the end of Clinton played off against the Republican kind he actually did better than they would do it yeah and I have some of that dynamic in twenty Nineteen that's the way that the Democrats had that when they're backing twenty Seventeen you won't have that same level of wind and twenty a Nineteen now there are other factors would affect\n\nEven want to call

in the ... and and the whole the whole I mean it just um I've never seen an arena just go so\nLast year game seven against Pittsburgh and when we when we went out the ... in in twenty sixteen and um they went down one nothing and it was like you know one nothing that hockey is is not for nothing and and\nI mean you hear the funeral that literally lost the game and they were there is a short haired old again [noise] [noise]\nRight [noise] and and and and and that's\nAnd now it's like it's lifted and and and you could feel the playoffs last year once we got through Pittsburgh it didn't matter if we went down and again people could still\nBelieve in a team and the team could believe in itself I think I think that\nThat the caps in their history was Wayne on the players were they were believing when they went down a gold at the the games where you can look at how they because the fans believe because every everyone believed it and once Pittsburgh got the last year\nEverything changed you could feel the change their I'm Thomas and taken over on a season ticket holder we set up four sections away from each other sometimes to each other and the Dunkin' Donuts line in between factions [noise] um but um [noise] this is going to be a great era for the caps now I don't think this was a one year thing I think that\nYou look at who's not soft is young\nI'm over in ... in his you know not in the mid mid thirties anybody thirty three thirty two\nUm [noise] he's gonna make a run across the political scored of all time the regular season is over six hundred grand is eight Ninety four he's going to make a serious run it being the number one goal scorer NHL history and the caps have an incredibly bright future um [noise]\nAnd I'll just end with saying this my dilemma right now I put a thousand dollars and the cats last year when the Stanley Cup in Las Vegas Fifteen the one\nWe want to in Vegas that the cash for tickets Fifteen thousand dollars when I catch the ticket the person at the counter told me the biggest payout she'd never paid at the sports book\nOr when people will take about like that and roll it over for two or three seasons and she said you know if the caps three feet and you wrote us money over it'll be two million dollars by the time they have three so I'm Still having this dilemma for the rest of the season I have not\nDone anything with the money that because it may be that like you know it was just a thousand dollar initial investment I might need to roll it over a couple of times because I think the caps are legitimate threat not only to repeat this year to potentially be a repeat\nI'm only ... every year by year so that's my dilemma but I'm leaning towards the right now I actually think this team in special team\nAnd one that um is going to have a lot of successful in Port\n[noise] well uh I get what you're saying I bet the Astros last year to win the world series attendant one as you know because you put to better prevent in for you and I in fact the ticket we did we didn't catch the ticket as that we did roll it over but ah\nA several others I mean you know we're not going to spread it all out all over the state [noise] um ...\nYou have to know you know you got to play where your ... your ... your strength and it would be there I think a Ralph one uh [noise]\nI think we're out one by twelve points twelve to Fifteen points I got an ear a in a [noise] blacks district and even more I think in ... district and uh you know the dynamics are changing in this and\nIt's not just so much a matter of of Trump\nOr anything demographics in the state or changing and they're changing almost daily and\nAh it's obvious which way you know they're moving are we going to be like Maryland no we're not going to be like Maryland but we um northern Virginia is beginning to look more and more in northern Virginia suburbs more and more not totally but more and more like the Maryland suburbs\nNational it's not just reached wanted to write and I think actually in these kind of various right as you said New Jersey suburb send things going on everywhere about us our separate\nBut you're seeing this you're seeing this an awful lot and um I think we have an excellent chance\nAnd no question we're getting help from the guy in the White House whether it will be there or not you know a A R I was joking with Mark Warner and I said you know we well we we need them they're just one more election\n[laughter] you know but I mean it's you know\nI'm a generally speaking we done better generally speaking when there's been a Republican and the White House they have there been exceptions yes\nGenerally speaking the Republicans have done better when the Democrats been in the White House have there been exceptions yes but the trend is there\nAnd the sun would take up a front yeah understand and I\nI Would be surprised if we didn't know you know get to Twenty one in the end of the election at a minimum\nI think I I I tend to greet you still have to defend a couple of the like you got a couple of comments you got one over on the eastern shore that [noise] it didn't play I think Republicans can hold with the black seats if they don't have the black\nI I think the [noise] far weaker today a it's an incumbent than probably anybody else to get some personal proclivities and\nAnd I think that I think that hurts him among some of those voters we have some stronger candidates don't or black or I don't know what happens is that a hundred and fifty thousand in the banks are like that it sounds like he's ready to go away very quickly but I\nWill do my advice to him and he got no when ... when the phone and you want to go out to undefeated non dieting if you could do that\nFor Congress and then he comes back\nBut I don't think you want to injure career because I I think you beat him a stream and some very attractive candidate a you are but you've got some issue ... after the initial matrix there where he has not really thinking or his voting record um [noise] uh to that district and you've got the state house at fifty one forty nine inch redistricting\nThat's critical happened that made made any I mean we have to wait and see but make working the Democrats [noise]\nUm [noise] I don't mean it would appear that the judges are going to wind up throwing that house district of south Lebanon house districts [noise]\nAnd I think that's what whatever formula they come up with that is going to also be what the Senate's going to have to abide by twenty Twenty one and uh it could change or you know it could change an awful lot [noise]\nUm you know a part of the districts are unpacked not totally but below the numbers I mean look what Bobby Scott I'm In his district one from what fifty some fifty six percent down to you know low forties\nAnd um [noise] uh [noise] you know produced another democratic district so you're gonna have to see how that plays out but it seems to me that uh the judges drawing that district is by far and away their their best bet\nAnd if they do you know Supreme Court I think it ruled before the gerrymandering as is has been constitutionally permissible until spills over in racial discrimination and therein lies the problem and that's what the Republicans are facing\nThere and it's going to change its going to change the way you know a whole makeup of legislatures around the country of course the record for a five to four work will do this differently blocks from the other courts and they back if I may be\nWrong but I think when they send it back to that low record it was like seven to two and actually\nWell I I just think one of the thing is you got to understand the Republican base for better for worse is migrated from your country club the country and in so doing they've taken out of some competitive districts were these were economic issues Republicans would be very viable [noise]\nSo it's not just the demographics of the fact that they have changed the emphasis on issues in ways that help them in South West Virginia but but it hurts them in the growing parts\nCan we talk about the ... and he also was a very popular governor with very low negative and you look at ... number ... ... support amongst Democrats\nWas not popular among Republicans was more polarizing in numbers Ralph Northam has incredibly low negatives for somebody in this environment you look nationally um he has very high positives very low negatives um and in going into these competitive seats [noise]\nUm I remember in ... eleven and Democrats drew the state Senate lines and they lost the majority and who was the the person who was in every Republican ...\nAnd that's a big um item that timetable here\nAnd these are still nationalize writes I don't care how you slice it the national environment play on\nWords you have to have a messenger more than ... and ... and turning out the Thomas right\nThe the I mean it that that national scene where he's very heavily you know which is why you've had you know the\nUntil McCarthy Cuccinelli I mean you\nKnow what happened for almost fifty year I'm gonna I mean I've been here about the surveys like let's take for example that started in the ... seat was not driven by national politics and twenty fifth and it was driven by local politics in Chesterfield versus Richmond\nAnd I'd like to be democratic um and I think that we\nAnd we thought we if we had more aggressive candidate but we don't have we ended its campaigns don't matter you know I don't think we had to I don't think we had a great message or that I think if you rerun that same race and twenty Nineteen and you had Ralph Northam auntie\nI'm In that district Raul patrol it they're not going to be as they are they all vote the votes it's driven it's chaos is going to create problems for them\nYeah I think that's a greater problem is that he's he's he's not harmonious with the district on some of this hot button issue or just say that like Rob Martin good governor I think it's a wonderful man but he gets a fireside chat in the fire goes you know you put him on TV you know it's it's not the same kind of rally the tape but he's an asset\nTo them and let me give you didn't have to use that ...
