support alliance defending freedom I Want to thank you all by the way a for putting up with this right we're taking time away from our radio show to ask you to give money\nTo alliance defending freedom the organization the frontlines in this country defending religious freedom they are in fact abs is in fact the premier organization\nFighting on behalf of religious freedom all across the United states of America I Want to thank everybody who's given we're going to be engaged in this campaign all month\nThe entire month of October yeah we're going to take time out of our regular programming this month we only do it once or twice a year but it's important we only do it for good important causes\nAnd religious freedom is one of them abs has been fighting and winning for many years uh as alliance defending freedom senior counsel Jim Campbell tells us\nA it was started by people like James Dobson and Marlin Maddox and it was really just a response as these gentlemen and others like them looked out and saw there were a lot of challenges to religious freedom and they didn't see anyone out there to defend it so they said we're going to address this problem by putting together this new organization\nAnd so for the last twenty five years we've been defending religious freedom and defending freedom of speech around the country\nThat is right around the country and around the corner\nIf you or your neighbors face challenges to your religious rights alliance defending freedom will be there to offer free legal services to defend you just as they've been doing for over twenty five years now a white now your gift to alliance defending freedom will be doubled\nLike I just lost it\nUm I shut up for a little bit and I let you all way and I didn't intend to do what I just did\nTalking to my producer earlier today the big story was how much Native American does Elizabeth Warren having her it's what everybody's talking about so we gotta talk about it and so I went into the Tonight Show figuring my God that's what all the conservative talk radio was talking about\nHow much of a Pocahontas was Elizabeth Warren and what's Trump have to say about it because he's always got something goofy to say about it but I just decided about a half hour ago I got the stomach to talk about it\nIt's stupid and its own important I mean here we are and and I guess the the the poetry right the symmetry was beautiful because this afternoon before I went on the air we found out that for this past fiscal year\nThat just ended September thirtieth\nOr we've hit the highest federal budget deficit that we've had in six years seven hundred and eighty billion dollar deficit this past fiscal year and more on our way to a one point one trillion dollar budget deficit next year\nAnd I thought to myself well that's beautiful because that's a hell of a lot more important I talking about Elizabeth Warren's DNA results how about we talk about something important and I I

freedom the organization on the frontlines in this country defending religious freedom they are in fact abs is in fact the premier organization\nFighting on behalf of religious freedom all across the United states of America I Want to thank everybody who's given we're going to be engaged in this campaign all month\nThe entire month of October ... we're going to take time out of our regular programming this month we only do it once or twice a year but it's important we only do it for good important causes and religious freedom is one of them\nATF has been fighting and winning for many years uh as alliance defending freedom senior counsel Jim Campbell tells it\nWas started by people like James Dobson and Marlin medics and it was really just a response as these gentlemen and others like them looked out and saw there were a lot of challenges to religious freedom and they didn't see anyone out there to defend it so they said we're going to address this problem by putting together this new organization\nAnd so for the last twenty five years we've been defending religious freedom and defending freedom of speech around the country\nThat is right around the country and around the corner\nIf you or your neighbors faced challenges to your religious rights alliance defending freedom will be there to offer free legal services to defend you just as they've been doing for over twenty five years now a white now your gift to alliance defending freedom will be doubled\nAre actually anywhere in the country you're phone's your laptops all of that stuff\nWalls freedom dot com slash listen and you can listen to me anywhere on line and as always if you miss the show do catch the pod cast Walsh freedom dot com slash\nPod cast a they're coming again\nOr the illegals from South of the border they're coming again\nPeople remember what was it may\nMay maybe June memory had a a few thousand the caravan remember coming up from wherever they come in from Guatemala\nOr a few thousand and uh and they marched there way all the way up through Mexico and they got to our southern border\nAnd CNN and ABC and all of their media friends were there to meet all of these people who wanted to come into America illegally\n[noise] and the Trump Administration talked tough\nBut when then when you had all these folks at our border who'd been\nYou know marching for hundreds and hundreds of miles by the time they got to our border and the cameras were on them or forget about it\nEven the Trump Administration backed down because they didn't like that look they didn't like those objects and you know lo and behold many of you don't realize this but\nThat last time this happened that caravan of a few thousand illegals\nComing to our border believing that they had a right to come into this country the vast majority of them in fact\nDid come into America and the vast majority of them in fact our er here\nA lot of people don't realize that but they're here in fact a lot of people don't realize that catch and release is back I hate to say it\nI hate to lay that down in front of everybody\nBut catch and release the border policy of the Obama administration it's being practice right now by the Trump Administration\nWhen they don't want you to know that\nBecause the Trump Administration wants you to believe that they are tough on the border and they're different than the Obama administration I think they want to be different they want to be tougher but in reality they're not\n\nTrump pet his separation policy awhile back right adults in charge kids separated\nOr at a border and again the media the cameras got a hold of that\nThe PR which horrible even the Republicans complained and the Trump Administration back down and very quietly very quietly\nMoved right back in to catch and release\nWhere\nYou know what the deal is is you you you come into this country illegally\n\nYear detained for twenty four hours\n\nYour then given some sort of hearing date for two three four months down the road and you are released into our country\nAnd the vast majority of these folks never ever ever show up for their court hearing\nAnd so the vast majority of these folks end up staying in America illegally for ever\nThat's what's happening again right now who to blame\nWill come on now\n\nYou you you gotta blame me administration\n\nI I I understand that Republicans and Democrats\nDon't want us to get tough on the border but the Trump Administration said that they would and so if they're not who you gonna blame\nThe whole thing is just miss defined to me\n'cause I don't believe in the separation policy had our border I certainly don't believe in catch and release to me out policy at the borders pretty simple\n[noise]\nYou don't let him in to begin with\nPeriod\nYou don't detain them in some facility together you don't detain than in some facility separated\nYou don't detain them at all if somebody knocks on our door and they want to come into our country illegally you say respectfully no can't do that won't do that\nAnd there's no problem of detention there's no problem of separating kids and adults because you do the humane thing and you just don't let him in at all\n\nBut that's an option that even the Trump Administration seems to have no interest in\n\nAnd so we play this dance tour to begin to do once they come into our country think about that\nWhat\nAre we going to do once they come into our country\nThat's what we discuss that's what we debate that's what we try to figure out instead of a deciding that they're not going to come into the country it all\n\nMean spirited cold\nHearted is it really\nIs that is that really what it is defending our border like that that is a mean spirited thing to do\nWhile I beg to differ\nI understand how the Trump Administration didn't want the bad publicity when it came to his separation policy at the border\nAgain we we've talked about this\nWhen somebody tries to enter our country illegally you've got three options\nOption one is catch and release you ... you give them a court date and you hope and pray that they appear that court date down the road number two you detain them\nDetain them together to detain them separately hold them for a longer period of time and then give them a court date and hope that they appear down the road at that court that or option number three\nBrace yourself\nYou just don't let them in you simply do not let anybody into your country illegally at all if I were king of the world or rather if I were\nSimply president of the United states that is in fact the option that I Would pick now people want to people are seeking asylum well there's a right way to do that\nYou you go to a a port of entry and you seek asylum you don't just walk across our border\n\nSo when I say you turn them around and you don't let him in our country yeah and then you give them an structures on where to go and how to go about trying to\nClaim asylum [noise] but you don't let them in this country illegally [noise]\n\n\nAt the number of people who really believe that you would be absolutely amazed at the number of people who believe that\nThat that anybody\nHas a right to be here [noise]\nWhen nothing could be further from the truth [noise] nothing could be further from the truth\n\nBut we are at the end of the day we are so afraid\nOf and I I look I put\nThe Trump Administration in this basket as well we are so dang\nAfraid of truly\nDefending our border 'cause ... you want to defend your border well you know if that means that means you actually turn people away who are trying to enter illegally\n\nAre you ready to do that are you prepared to do that\n\nMost ... no Democrat is and I I got to be straight with you man I I don't know of the Republican who would want to do that\nI don't know of Republicans who would do that and I believe that Jeff Sessions our attorney general\nWants to be as tough on the border as we can\nUh\nBut I also believe that the Trump Administration\nHas blinked plenty\nWhich is why we find ourselves in this situation again see they pay attention down there they pay attention down in Mexico they pay attention down in Central America\nThey pay attention and when Trump first got elected and Trump talked tough I'm going to build a wall and that can lead anybody in here illegally we're going to deport people you know what a lot of people stayed away\nA lot of people stayed away but\nThen these people down there kept watching they kept watching they kept watching and\nThey saw that eventually our policy was kind of stay the same thing so here [noise]\nAre you ready to grow up to the free [laughter] this is the Joe Walsh program ... show waltz on to
