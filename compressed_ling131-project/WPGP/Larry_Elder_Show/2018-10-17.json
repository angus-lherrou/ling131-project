going to end up in a really bad place if you don't approve of what Trump said this morning what Trump did this morning and you don't speak up\nAnd you don't criticize him\nWhen deep down you know what President Trump said and did this morning we're so abhorrent was so wrong we're so ... yeah yeah yeah which show beneath the dignity of the office if you don't speak up\nYou're going to deserve it again he's going to say it again he's going to do it again if you in a\nBowl him to have no bounds\n\nAnd to be as insulting and as offensive as he wants to be you never have a right you will never

dang it's wrong for the president of the United states to call a woman or space\n... if if you can't say that\nI mean if you say to yourself and you keep it inside your head but because you have a radio show you're afraid to say it because you don't want to lose your audience or you got a TV show and you don't want to criticize Trump 'cause you don't want to lose your audience where he got a

of representatives to the Democrats I Do not want to lose the United States Senate to the Democrats\nAnd I can guarantee freaking T U that Donald Trump this morning waking up this morning and Pauline a woman in space I can guarantee you\nThat is going to help the Democrats take control of the house of representatives are you okay with that\nYou okay with that\nRight now we get the biggest largest

how can that be Joe\nMy mom loves Trump my friend down the street she loves Trump how can that be how can sixty sixty five Seventy percent of women in this country say that they're going to the polls to vote against Trump and against anybody who supports Trump's how can that be Joe\nOh I don't know\nI only served in Congress for two years\nNot the smartest guy in the world but if I were a woman\nAnd I woke up this morning and I saw that the president of the United states insulted another woman in public\nSo I don't know that might have something to do with it white get in line Stormy Daniels here's one woman that this president has insulted in front of the world I I don't know that might be part of it\n\nAnd I'm Sorry don't don't sit there and say Hey Joe sheep punched first\nOr that porn star hey Joel that porn star attacked the president of the United states first ah Joel and Trump had to punch back\n\nThe president of the United states the president of the United states in a tweet this morning called a woman in America or space\nIf you're cool with that\n\nI feel sorry for you if you're cool with that if you think that's a good thing\nIf you think that's what a president should do right if the if that's what a president should do call a woman horse face\nIf that's what you want your president doing\nI I pity for thinking that way or space the president of the United states\nOh by the way I don't know that I Need to even ask this detail but I Will ah the president of the United states called the porn star that he slapped with a horse face\nThe president of the United states called the porn star that he slept with wild his wife and four month old son were sleeping at home that's the woman today that uh Donald Trump called or space\n\nThere is a gender gap there's a gender gap right now\nLike we've never seen a and and when he continues to do things like this\nIt's only going to get worse and it's only going to make it that much easier for the Democrats to take back the house they won't take back the Senate 'cause the maps too difficult right but again just crass politics\nIf you care about crass politics what Trump did this morning is going to make it a hell of a lot easier for the Democrats take back the house how you like me now you like that\nThat's a good thing it's OK joke is Trump's being Trump's Trump's punch and met Trump punches like nobody mad Trump's always fight and I love Trump Joe because he fights the fight she fights\n\nOK okay\nBut it's reached the point where a majority of the American people I think have decided\nThere's there's there's just got to be a semblance of decency right just just got to be a semblance on I'm I'm good with a lot of the agenda man and I'm Glad that the economy's doing well man and you know I get all of that and things are pretty good right now but you're you know what there is just got to be a semblance\nOf decency now you may not feel that way 'cause you're the kind of\nPerson who Trump could shoot somebody on Fifth Avenue in New York City and you still support him so you may not feel that there's just there's got to be just a modicum of decency\nFor whoever hold that office and no matter what you think Stormy Daniels you think this porn star the president of the United states cannot and should not be publicly Colleen a woman or space\n\nThat may not be how you feel\nI can guarantee that mostly can be\n[noise]\n\nYeah I I gotta say this is a total embarrassment not only to me as an American citizen it's an embarrassment to the country members with you

voters in the state of Illinois my message to voters around the country is clear um Republicans and conservatives and\nTea Party patriots an independence or around the country all better get off your ass and get out and vote because the Democrats will vote in record numbers and Twenty one days guaranteed if you want to beat him you'd better get out and talk\nTo people in Illinois specifically the last broken bankrupt hopeless state of Illinois\nTo Republicans and conservatives in independence and Tea Party patriots in the state of Illinois heck I'm Talking to Democrats too if you want to save the state of Illinois um you have one option this November and Twenty one days\nYou got to vote Republican for state and local offices you have to vote Republican if you want to try to save this state\nAgain Illinois voters are ... are election has nothing to do with Trump\nAnd I know there's a lot of consternation about the governor's race\nI Know one thing\nYou want to be given to maybe try to save the state of Illinois state and local races\nYou've got to vote Republican\nYou vote for state representative you have to vote Republican you vote for state Senate you have to vote Republican we're such a miserable state one human being runs this state and he's a Democrat he's a corrupt little Democrat\nWho represents a tiny little district in the city of Chicago he used to house speaker his name is Michael mad again in for forty years he's run this day yeah that's like crazy right well it's true and people are leaving the state of Illinois why because it's too damn expensive to to to live here\nIf you are a business owner if you hire people if you employ people if you pay taxes if you work if you're a make or if you're a do or you know what you're getting now\nIt's too damn expensive to stay in Illinois\nAnd every six and a half minutes somebody who pays taxes leaves never to return again this exodus will not change will not diminish until Michael mad again leaves\nThe only way to get rid of Michael Madigan is to send Republicans down to Springfield\nI mentioned it last night a lot of you aren't aware\nBut every Democrat you sent down to Springfield the very first vote they will make in January will be to vote for Michael mad again for speaker they are the ones they are the ones who give him his power\nYou want to save the state of Illinois the only way to do

he misses show catch the podcast Wall Street um dot com\nSlash pod cast a eight five five six for two fifty six\nHundred um the biggest issue of the campaign\nOr if you look at most reports in most studies or appears to be health care\nAh both Democrats and Republicans\nAre acknowledging\nThat health care\nIs is the number one issue on the minds of voters this fall\nOr in fact I'm I've seen poll after poll after poll after poll\nAnd every single poll after poll after poll after poll I've seen has\nHas said that to me that health care is number one number one issue usually followed by kind of me the jobs and on down the line but it's health\nCare health care and what's interesting is when I got elected in two thousand and ten\nHealth care was the issue that and specifically was Obamacare\nAnd in two thousand and ten when Iran and two thousand and twelve\nAnd then really two thousand and fourteen as well\nRepublicans were the ones talking about health care\n\n[noise] Democrats didn't want to mention that because of Obamacare was really unpopular\n'em\nAnd Iran and twenty ten and a bunch of Republican draining twenty ten and we promised to\nRepeal Obamacare new remember all that you remember all of that don't you write\nJust give us control of of the house and Senate and baby we Republicans will repeal Obamacare route tend branch I think we set route and branch\nWill get rid of it right\nWell funny thing happened and oh by the way just so we're clear on the record\nWhen in fact\nHuge voter sees you the voters\nWhen in fact you did in fact give Republicans the keys to Washington DC a couple of years ago I\nRemember you gave Republicans the house and the Senate and the White House\nYou remember they didn't repeal Obamacare\nDid not\nWe'd been screaming for it and crying for for eight years I mean heck when I was in Congress when I got elected Republicans only controlled the house Harry Reid and the Democrats controlled the Senate Obama was in the White House\nThe very first to vote I made in the house was to repeal Obamacare\nBut we knew it wouldn't go anywhere we knew it wouldn't go anywhere easy is vote any Republican ever made repeal Obamacare knowing\nIt would pass the house and the Senate Harry Reid and the Democrats would never take it up and the ferry reading the Democrats for some bizarro reason\nTook it out of Iraq Obama would most certainly veto it\nSo for a couple of years they're Republicans kept repeat voting to repeal Obamacare knowing that it wouldn't go anywhere because it was easy\nAnd their voters wanted to hear it\nAnd then in twenty fourteen when you gave the Republicans the United States Senate as well\nThe Senate never voted on repealing Obamacare\nAnd then in twenty sixteen when Republicans hit the trifecta control of the house\nControl of the Senate Donald Trump a Republican and the White House\nWell\nNo more excuses right Republicans they had no more excuses\n\nFor eight years they've been scream and just please give us control\nPlease give us control and will repeal at all\nTo HP's hoops dog catch his car now what will now it's not an easy vote\n\nSo makes you wonder and in fact you know that Republicans sometime awhile ago stopped really wanting to repeal Obamacare\n\nIt was all just a game it was all just an act\nOr to get you the voters riled up you'd voters\nDid your job in twenty sixteen you gave him the whole town he gave in Washington D. C. and once they were in complete control they didn't repeal Obamacare\n\nAnd don't just blame John McCain for\nYou know putting his dumb down the Republicans in the Senate We're glad McCain voted against it the Republicans in the house we're glad McCain voted against it\nThe truth is the Republican Party by about twenty fourteen or Fifteen or understood that they they weren't going to repeal Obamacare and they stopped wanting to repeal Obamacare and they only said they were going to repeal it because they knew you want to be here [noise]\nAnd so we had that exercise back in twenty Seventeen last year Republicans back and forth back and forth back and forth and they just can't repeal it\nSo they get around with it revised it edited it tried to make it a little better here a little worse there\nAnd that is that what we needed a I was one of those rare Republicans who back in the day\nScreamed about repealing the whole thing that I\nStill feel that way and if I were still in the house I wouldn't have voted to repeal all of it but I understood that I was in the minority in my own party so a funny thing than happened a couple of years ago\nRepublicans started excuse me stopped talking about health care Republicans kinda sorta weasels away from talk of Obamacare\nAnd all of a sudden last year\nIt was the Democrats that made health care\nTheir issue eight years ago Obamacare quite literally cost Democrats control of Congress\nFast forward eight years\nOf their talk about health care and Obamacare\nDamn well might put them back in control of Congress\n\nWhat happened what changed\nWhy was this such a bad issue for Democrats eight years ago\nAnd why is it such a good issue now and why we're Republicans the only ones talking about Obamacare\nAnd healthcare eight years ago\nAnd now it's Democrats doing all the talking about health care\nIt's a big change will get into the why here in a minute but it's a big change and when you look at all these campaign ads around the country these days right now\nA big chunk of them\nAre centered around half to do with health care\nLike Democrats aren't even afraid to say the word Obamacare I mean when I was in Congress eight years ago Democrats they were afraid to say the\nGosh darn word\nMatt anymore\nOr things have changed eight five five six for two fifty six hundred it's not a good thing but things have changed [noise]\n\nI wasn't alone but we knew this would happen you\nGive the American people something and that's what Obama Care was\n\nEventually the American people\nAre going to get used to that something\nAnd eventually the American people are going to like being given something\nAnd then you'll never be able to get rid of it is something you just gave the American people\nWelfare health care\nAny any ... any benefit from the government\nWhat did Ronald Reagan say right when Reagan said the most difficult thing in the world to get rid of is is a government program when the ... when have we ever gotten rid of of a government program\nMean hell I went to Congress in twenty ten\nThinking that we would get rid of this program or get rid of that program we cut spending baloney\nRepublicans had no interest in doing any of that\nSo yeah\nYou gave the American people something in Obamacare and now the American people have grown used to it and they light and getting things they like getting free stuff\n\nAnd so now ... popular\nDemocrats notice\nSo Democrats are talking about Obamacare Republicans notice\n\nYou see like a a a a candidate for governor in Michigan\nRepublican bill shoot\n'em he's trying to he's trying to paint himself as a champion of a government health care in the state of Michigan\nBack in twenty ten this guy a bill shoot a

promise to repeal it the American people wanted to repeal it\nBut we said at the time we got to repeal it we've got to get rid of this thing because once you give the American people goody a
