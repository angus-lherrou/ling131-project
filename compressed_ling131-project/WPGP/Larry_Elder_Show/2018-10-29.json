uh our objective is to educate as many people athlete possibly can on their fundamental constitutional right to keep and bear arms but\nI started to step out and people noticed too I Am I started being invited\nTo some other events and at one of those events that I was invited to was a the D.C project mhm\nAnd I was invited by law back well and I wanted to thank Diane a mother in law in the back well for me it was fifty when they walk them every state went down to watch in D.C to speak with their legislators has gone on it\nAnd it's rare that ... get the opportunity to voice their opinion in a positive manner because we see so much negative energy about fighting um ownership or someone is always calling for more gun control\nAnd I'm as that project came to a close a little bit later I Want to say about a month ago we at the D.C project at the opportunity of being invited to take part in\nA debate with time magazine and with time magazine you\nA big project it was a gun debate about guns in America and I want to thank Diane Mahler my D.C\nProjects sisters who took part in this time ... magazine project as representing themselves as a gun owners they had the opportunity to tell their personal stories\nThey told they from the hearts they had to carry the passion that go there not knowing if they were going to be well receptive to accept it\nBut nevertheless it was a grant a project they did well they did great and for all the people that went there to represent\nScholarship or the the Second Amendment side of things because how often\nDo you get to tell your personal story what happened in your life and how it happened and have someone to portray it in a more rural or led on the front page of time magazine and I think that's huge for us that were invited\nThat we're able to go out and partake in this because nationally\nGun ownership in America don't often get to see the positive side of things you know what I'm saying\nSo you you you know that was that was a huge I'm Glad you brought that up because I'm going to be talking about that time mural cover in the next hour with their W. R.

we got about a ... you\nKnow I just wanted to get that out of there because you know it it was a great thing and it spread that gun owners or to a support us get a positive energy that they got from there because those women in Dallas mayor with their input their heart out you know they told their personal stories\nAnd and they don't get hurt as often so you know big up to that because we in two thousand and Nineteen D.C project will be back and watched in DC so I'll get to tell you more about that later\nYeah and you know the fun part about the time thing was a lot of people that you've never heard of before it wasn't everybody that you see or hear like me on radio and everything else it was a lot of regular people out there\nThat are telling the story again from both sides and it it's quite fascinating I'm looking forward to going through the whole thing round with about another we've got about another minute Chicago guns matter the ... the website is great it's Chicago guns battered dot org\nYour pictures up there and it talks a little bit about you so I Want to encourage listeners to make sure to go over and check out Chicago guns matter dot org and you're going to find

retaliation\nSo we saw a mass shooting at a church earlier this week as we continue to deal with this gang violence here on the city of Chicago that place is ... so much you know we want to get to the ballot box and make sure that we can put more people in position that's going to change\nWhat have you on at eight because absolutely and America I don't want to take\nTo armed American radio [noise]\nThis is a this show is flying right along I tell you if this hour anywhere near like the last hour the segments were just flying by so I Want you to make sure you buckle in okay going to be an\nAwful lot an awful lot of\nContent being covered we're going to move very quickly to that I Want to read a comment first let me start with this kind of as I opened up the previous our case you missed it I'll start with this I did a\nNational radio program in Great Britain today it's it's not an I Do a lot of those on the BBC and and international interviews after something like this happens that kind of reach out to me that have been very friendly to him over the number of years so and I certainly don't mind doing it I Love talking to the British people most of them feel exactly the way you do\nIt's just they're elite smuggling is at the top that doesn't they just simply don't understand Americans freedoms and you're not going to convince them otherwise but it's fun to go round and round with especially when you know you're going to get ambushed\nParticularly because you've been on with this particular host before in the past but the the article after my appearance on the show is titled it made I guess precedent on the LDC leading are leaving Britain's conversation\nKevin McGuire clashes with American gun rights supporter now see the light of the Pittsburgh synagogue shooting Kevin McGuire spoke with mark Walters passionate supporter of gun rights and host of armed American radio to get his view on gun laws in your book seemed adamant that stricter background checks\nWouldn't help the situation\nHas quoting me a background check looks at the background it doesn't look forward mark pointed out that he could name thirty mass shooters in America who had off past background checks quoting me again if a madman wants to get a hold of a gun you can in America it's unfortunate but it's true it's a very complex issue market it mark went on to claim\nThat a ban on assault weapons is not realistic and even claimed that he bought his first day our during the Clinton assault weapons ban which is true\nIt's easy to knee jerk reaction and say my God we have to ban this reality that's not going to work because they can't be bad\nThey are already here millions upon millions of Americans are not going to turn in their firearms who have done nothing wrong and that's the vast majority of Americans I said as an American gun owner we hate to see this were the ones that want this to stop you claim\nHowever at this point Kevin seem to lose his patients referring to supporters who have recently spoken out in defense of gun laws in the U. S. Kevin responded that the fifth of Americans with dunes are intimidating the fourth fifth that do not\nKevin ended the discussion by telling mark oh I don't want your thoughts and prayers anymore but he hung up on\nThey didn't say that I knew then he hung up on the end of the interview and apparently unbeknownst to me went off behind my back which is proof positive that you won the argument because these guys can't stay in the kitchen they like to go to the sandbox they they can't play with the big boys\nSo the video is on there if you want to go see it just Google LDC\nKevin McGuire clashes with us gun rights supporter and take a look at it I put it out on my Twitter page if you want to see it at a A R mark at a A R mark what's funnier than anything is the ... down below\nFrom Martin Palmer who says this cabin is in ... at a rude ignorant wonder if that the American was polite courteous and gracious throughout you have to present you got so angry after thoroughly losing the argument that he swam down the phone and went into a tirade behind his back\nIt made me ashamed to be from the same country I Am disgusted by this present or\nBy the way what on earth does American gun laws have to do with us here in the u._k. shouldn't we just bought out it is it like the u._k. is such a fantastic place crime is through the roof and there were more murders in London last year than in New York so\nI I enjoy reading that because I just thought before we went on air\nAnd I think it makes for great fodder to open up this discussion right now with a W are Hawkins from Breitbart News who I think will agree with me and some of the things I said you can actually listen to a minute and forty two seconds it was much like your interview\nBut he was thoroughly crushed eight of you are welcome to the show my friend so did I say anything in there that ah that you felt was untrue by background checks are assault weapons are banter confiscation or anything like that\nNo longer you you're basically stated commonsense position and or just the truth and that's it they can't handle it that's the bottom line I just can't handle it they're not open not only the one individual songs about the whole level they're not open to the fact that\nWhoa that\nYeah and it's not just as individual not talking about Brits were talking about every every left it thinks the way he does this guy's got classic American leftist socialism disease a truly does\nA and if it was fascinating I I've I've clashed with the guy before and I hope to do so again I appreciate them having me on the show it's an awful lot of fun and I like when they get so angry that they can't argue anymore you know they just they get so ... that they have to hang up the phone and and then you know talk about you behind your back because they can't win the argument\nOn the merits now let's go to Pittsburgh for a minute or two or three or four or five or however many you want to cover a W are\nWhat went through your head when you saw this as someone who covers this every single day and winds awards for doing so what went through your head when you first saw the news on Pittsburgh\nImmediately a ... or do what life was going free [noise] and uh so it's prime target or you know you get a lot of people congregated in a place where the school workplace church where there's no aren't protection\nAnd uh they gotta have or better thing I think they said he was in charge for twenty minutes I'm correct uh that that you know uh [noise] that was the first thing that went through my mind and I'd say the next language just grow feel horrible for the family\nBut you know the last talks all the time but how they get tired of the stores you get tired of this happening in six or ... or ... or the or else they say I get tired of it happening too\nI get tired of law abiding Americans living their lives in areas where there's there's no there's no good guy with a gun and uh that's what has changed my opinion that's what that's what was on my mind at the end of the day\nAt the end of the day I look back on what Trump said which I covered\nAnd I thought he did remarkable you know he did he really did it he said I Wish we had our security there and he said I also want to speed up the death penalty so that will people do these kind of think they know they're going to die and they're going to die quick\nAnd I think I think I think those are the two logical approaches to this ... year olds don't send in a place where there's not a good guy with a gun don't be the good guy with the other way to make sure you're in a place for their own protection and due call your senators and representatives\nLet's get some laws change so that people do it the liberty of living on death row for years and years on healthy\nAnd they have their appeal that's it kill him there's no reason\nFor taxpayers have to find some art or his life and that's what a life sentence ends up being\nAt California you're listening in a number of cities right now you're listening in Sacramento right there in your state Capitol you're listening in Southern California you are listening in the bay area my gosh ... a death sentence in California is nothing but we're show just simply window dressing\nAnd you're paying for it you're paying for that and I I don't know that it even bothers people out there anymore I really truly don't but it's interesting because I can use this as a Segway now to your first piece that I wanted to talk with you about today\nPerfect just works just amazing how we're able to do that on this program Chris Murphy mocks Trump for wanting armed security in places of worship Chris Murphy Chris Murphy is a gun hating valid lunatic left this socialist from Connecticut\nMarch Trump for wanting armed security in places of worship go ahead and take it away before we have to go to break\nThe only that's that's it you know and they tried to be ominous he said Trump on me on what he said he won't semi automatic ... a gunman with semi automatic rifles in every school and restaurant and go to Tom doesn't want any such thing\nNow but he used the phrase semi automatic rifles just to be like ooh and make a sham scary but guess what\nIf you had had an awkward officer in the Senate go with a semi automatic rifle\nHow grateful would we be right now because we have eleven people here with us that are going and who would be dead one animal that deserve to die but managed to live through it and that's why the little semi automatic trades doesn't bother me at all and mocking truck for warning warning arm protects you for innocence\nBut that's not going to be a sign will be a wind apply for Democrats so I Hope they'll keep pushing it\nI Hope they do too and we'll all kind of throw in my little exclamation point on this as we head into this ... W. R. because apparently Senator Chris Murphy has no problem with armed protection for himself and his colleagues on Capitol Hill\nAnd I want to make their story very very clear Senator Chris Murphy has no problem with armed protection for himself\nAnd his colleagues on Capitol Hill and I guarantee you\nHe has no problem with armed protection for his own family\nWill be back right after this [noise]\nAnd it just disintegration I Want people to hear what we're trying to say but you know I Know somebody out there right now is screaming at the age of your if it's not an assault rifle make sure you call it that we do we attempt to do that all the time sometimes there are even bigger points that we have to get out without turning the argument away which is what sometimes that would do\nAll right you know let's let's move on from Chris Murphy he's just as out in the lunatic\nAnd he's a hypocrite and he's also very oh he's a very dishonest man is what he is\nBut we already talked about you have another piece law enforcement synagogue attacker legally owned his guns I think this is important for one reason because doesn't that go that headline alone says it all I W are that's what goes to the heart of why we have a right to defend ourselves because we understand that evil exist evil\nChooses the time and place to become evil\nNot us but and we have a right to defend ourselves from it because we are powerless to even identify it aren't we\nTrue for a you know there's there's something I'm trying to call trying to turn as hard as I think what I write\nI I Know what I Do I write news but also on in my heart to educate people and and there's a corner I'm prone to turn where I can somehow\nGet people to think about the fact that there is no substitute for freedom I'm not trying to because I Am a it's very simple gun control is not a viable substitute for freedom and if you think it is and he didn't pay attention Saturday or you didn't pay attention to Parkland\nOr you didn't pay attention to Santa Fe high school a Cape twenty eight team but he didn't pay attention at the church in Texas November fifth one Seventeen I keep going but a gun control is not\nA valid substitute for freedom because gun control pre suppose is that if we limit everybody's freedoms\nAnd certain crimes will go away it does not work that way what happens is when you limit\nMy ability to exercise my God given rights you put me in an unnatural position or had been a member of the congregation on Saturday\nI would've come under fire and the senseless and somehow we have to realize that lesson that we can't every time we embrace gun control where we need to or not we're saying that's a good substitute for freedom folks there is no\nGood substitute for freedom there is not one that works and that's why a framer went out of their way to Hitchens second ...\nWell that I'm not even going to that is the exclamation point on that a perfect place to take a break you know I I got to say this on another note that when it comes to\nArming like Trump wants to armed guards who we are guards in may we armed guards in government buildings\nIs the problem with defending\nWhere we gather that our target spy evil\nDon't know if you know it's uh you you have to impossible to get into their head and it's hard to wrap\nYour head around it back when they W.

R. Hawkins and the second hour where we went through and had a lot of fun with him to going through all of his writings at Breitbart of course I opened up the pro both programs or excuse me both previous hours with my surprise call I got this morning from\nBritish radio and Kevin McGuire show over on LDC obese I guess it does it will be see let me just double check them from getting the right one oh it is a yeah L L L BC\nAnd Kevin of course a very popular journalist and longtime radio guy and journalists and pundits over in Great Britain and he says anti comes a day as long as going round and round with them before\nThey called me out of the blue or Fifteen minutes later I found myself on the air with him earlier this morning and as expected the I knew he was going to try to stop me from lesson that's exactly what he did he can't stand my response was and he he can't argue and of course he did what most liberals who lose arguments do he got mad and\nHung up on me and then attacked me\nAfter I was off the air with him apparently and I know that from reading the column that made\nSome news over there do they call them Kevin McGuire clashes with American gun rights supporters do read it Kevin McGuire clashes with American gun rights supporter and down at the bottom you'll you'll enjoy the column\nAnd there's also a link to about a minute and twenty four seconds of my segment with him I played it in the first hour and then at the bottom is a comment about how the host was incredibly rude and ignorant and that after I thoroughly\nDestroyed him in his argument he slammed down the phone and went into a tirade behind my back and\nOf course the commenter also mentioned that I was in the American me of course was polite courteous and gracious throughout and you know it's interesting because I've done a lot of British media over the years a lot some of it some of it the attack ambush style stuff from others they genuinely they the they're fascinated\nOur quote unquote what they refer to as our gun culture in America they should we do not understand it and that's understandable from people who have been disarmed and now a generation removed in Great Britain\nAnd this is what they always want us to a gun rights supporters and Britain have always warn me over the years and say was in Australia but you gotta realize in Great Britain now there was a new generation who have never known the right to bear arms\nIn Great Britain at all from the time they were born\nAnd those people it's not unusual to have them a little flustered by our culture and many of them are fascinated of course others are just haters they're out there but it was a really fun wild fast moving two hours\nAnd I got Sean were good to go now right we've got John on there so let's go now to Dr Jon ...\nAuthor of many books more guns less crime and the rest of them I'll let him tell you and of course a frequent guest on the radio program and someone that you see\nTalking about the numbers and crunching the numbers and talking about the same things we talk about here but in a little bit more methodical and economic way to present these numbers as facts John welcome to the program always a pleasure to have you thank you for joining me today\nGood talking to pay I Know you've gone round and round with some of the Brits over there and their media including Piers Morgan do you ever get frustrated by him\nNo I mean [noise]\nUh I guess I've just gotten used to it over time I suppose that's done much pointing get angry and frustrated by it but\nYou know it's it's kind of understandable people keep on hearing the phone things so no one really to kind of explain the logical arguments to them over there and uh you know you think academia is bad here\nProbably even worse there\nI have to you tend to tweet up and you and you're right about that it's it's fun I've I've done some television and radio over there and I have no doubt in my mind I'll be hearing from them on Monday or Tuesday or even before this day is over believe it or not because of the time she said it wouldn't be shocked so listen I'll keep you posted you can follow me on Twitter at a our market will put the links up just like we did this one\nJohn you end up on your pay is very important\nAh CPR see crime prevention Research Center but some of your research how uh [noise] excuse me how a botched study\nFooled the world about the U.S share of mass public shootings us rate is lower than global average you try to tell that to somebody overseas they tell you your nut cases ... fill us in on that what did you\nWrite well we had a study that was put out a couple of months ago few months ago now or that basically we went through and collected mass public shootings from around the world are we had to hire people and different countries in order to try to help us out on that\nAnd um you know it's\nYou know people get the impression of\nHow the United states stand by let's say the media stories we hear cases like\nThe horrible tragedy that happened yesterday and a Pittsburgh\nUh but we don't hear about cases that have happened in the rest of the world so just this last week a there was a large mass public shootings in the Crimea which is now part of Russia very strict gun control laws or\nAnd or are they at a school shooting at a college student went and shot up the place a shot to death Twenty one other people and wounded Seventy but my guess is a\nVery few Americans heard about that story I mean that one got more media attention in most cases most it it sort of ended up looks today\nAround the world are you know or if you have a big school shooting in Germany or you'll be lucky to get a you know one minute brief on the news on that and that will be it and they will disappear\nOr the Europe it's much more news coverage and mass public shootings in the United states and\nUh we get in it then you're even gets on other attacks and other countries in Europe\nAnd uh you know it has a big news coverage has a big impact on people's perceptions of all of you know the rates at which these things are crazy so I'm not\nSurprised but that's where he's all in our paper and our research we go through and let the case for all the different countries so people with a new sources so people can go\nAnd check those things themselves if you go to our website\nAt crime research dot org and click on the button that\nTop that says research do go down and among our various research projects so the uh the the the data and the project but we did on mass public shootings around the world\nYeah CPR she original research I'm On the page by the way listener and I I Want you to go there when you soon as you get a chance is real simple crime research dot org crime research dot org and when you click on the research button which I've done many many times you will see CPR she original research and it is just filled\nWith data that you can use for whatever purpose just for your for just because you want to gain the knowledge maybe you want to answer a question maybe you're preparing for a debate whatever the case may be it's all here for you\nAnd you know it's interesting John ... we're going to get ready to take a break here in a second but when I see these numbers\nAnd I look at this the first thing we get hit with and I have before myself is along the lines of of doesn't happen as frequent as it does in America you got the highest homicide rate in the nation it's crazy or in the world and that's not true when we come back after this break coming up maybe you can address that\nAnd I what brought that to my attention was a tweet that you put out earlier today\nShowing with Ninety six percent of the vote counted Brazil's extreme right wing candidate was won the presidency with a large fifty five point five to forty four point five percent margin old Chicago style economics in a country where the homicide rate is five times ours\nHe supports people carrying guns particularly for women for protection John we've got just twenty seconds that shocked a lot of people to hear that there are countries who have a higher homicide rate than ours because they think we have the highest homicide rate in the world but with with just about five seconds that's simply not true is it\nNo I mean well well below the average will below the media and in terms of homicide rate and there's even problems comparing homicide rates across country so that could go on too long ago\nYeah let's do that we're going to hear some music can take a break right now so when we come back let's look at some of those numbers listener pay very careful attention to this because you hear people spit this stuff out every single day and you don't know where they're just spit it because it's a talking point that they read somewhere\nDon't go away John live in the cross breed holster studios right after this crime research dot org\nYou know they may be kooky or dumb or whatever but they are not so stupid that they do\nI'd take easier targets in the same thing is true with the mass shooters they made me crazy in some sense but they're not stupid they want to try to kill us like people are so they want to go to a a a venue where\nThey know victims are going to be able to defend themselves because they know the longer it takes for\nSomebody at the theme to arrive but the more people they're going to be able to kill so yeah I guess I Am frustrated but I'm frustrated because on one side\nThey seem to think that they have all the moral authority that they're they call for laws that either had no beneficial effect or actually cause harm you know these gun free zones are wanting to stay up all of that and yet when a when these attacks occur they want to\nPosture as all people who are willing to do something well my responses yeah you're willing to do something but let's do something that actually works let's do something that actually matters it wouldn't make people safer\nYou know there's so much media and what you just said I could take the rest of the hour without ... quickly I'll go to a point out the media when you were talking about the media\nThey won't because it doesn't fit their narrative that's why they leave out that portion of course you know this was from talking to you what you heard John Say about the Kroger shooting we're going to be talking about that on armed American radios daily defense tomorrow in fact and probably on Tuesday as well but as John Locke pointed out on his Twitter page you can follow him\nAt John are locked junior on Twitter by the way to get all this information in real time as he puts out it's a great great Twitter page\nBut he points out Stephanopoulos doing the same thing and ABC and they just eliminating the fact that he white concealed carry permit holder ended the attack and he goes on to tell you in a tweet and it was a column that he was doing it that he wrote about how the headline could be totally different\nHow it could be white concealed carry permit holders saves blacks from shoot I mean it's just that the media narrative your listener\nIs what drives us we've talked about this together for so many years and it is very dangerous the way the game that they are playing in the way the media handles this for a lot of different reasons when we come back\nI Want to ask John's opinion about what the Pittsburgh mayor sat and I do want to go back to the homicide rates in where we stand will cover that I promise we'll get there when we come back with John ...\nFrom crime research dot O. R.

CD but they're not included even though they're in Europe but those who the other countries in Europe\nAre and I'm a you know they won't include countries like Brazil or Russia or you know that obviously clearly meet the income criteria and other criteria they're they're they're always why Russia is not a full member of the\nCD is because of the political issues that are involved not because of economic issues\nAnd uh you know so I Would I go and give presentations discussions that kind of pointed out what the graph look like if you include all the developed countries or if you include deflect the wall but they want to go and pet\nBut it's really you know most people don't know the old days have fourteen countries up there and they just assume laws you know that must be all the developed countries I don't think most people even in their mind quickly go through and say well you know you're missing other European countries in the world\nSo you know it's not like the media really cares about trying to hold these people speak to the fire in the media is doing this as much as other\nYou know there are so many issues here it's not just\nThe murder rates are the homicide rate issues about gun ownership so the United states it's supposedly way out there by itself in terms of gun ownership you'll see claims that forty four percent of civilian own guns are owned in the United states that's just garbage\nAnd it and they will put is numbers together the small arms survey which has gotten funding from\n... ... people they just they just\nAre not a credible source they won't even tell people where they get their numbers for for most countries\nAnd the countries that you can figure out what they do they're just not credible so you may have let's have a survey in a country which has a um gun registration\nCanada for example before they had long gun registration and Ninety eight or you would find surveys that would show at least eight million long gun owners in Canada but when they get the registration they only got about three to register their guns\nAnd the survey numbers quickly dropped to me now is it that five million or more people will bragging about having guns even though they didn't have them or did they instantly going sell them all there was no\nMedia stories that you find about people wanting to their local gun store and and trying to get rid of the longer that they had\nAnd there never will be enjoying it it's not credible and I've got I've got to stop you there I gosh I hate it I I was fascinated listening to you I looked at the clock it and boom\nHere we are at the end of the end of the hour John ... thank you you are such a valuable resource\nListener crime research dot org all of this information is available to you remember ignorance when left unattended read stupidity do the ignorance this information is available to you\nThank you for the Grand Canyon and good luck [laughter] [noise]\nMy friends this is Tuesday this is the third our of the dentist Prager show I'm Dennis Prager [noise]\nI Love this hour the ultimate issues our [noise]\n...

before\nBut saying you shouldn't be up on the news I obviously I Am I have to be I Want to be\nBut ultimately\nTo use the term ultimately the ultimate issues\nAre what matter me the vision of life today's program today's topic\nIs so important that I only wonder if I ever devoted merit to it I mentioned that I mentioned it in passing regularly but I don't know if I've ever devoted an hour to do you have do you see one\n\nYou're checking for going back very far it's an invitation\nAnd that subject is a word that is not you it's the most important thing and it's not used\nWhich is a a real reason for the problems and troubles of our time in America and in the west of the world generally it's the double you work with the double your this is\nWhat people will know thinking thinking work\nWorth\nAbout how many people even if like say the bill you word no wisdom you know it's you know how bad it is how bad the situation is the word is boring to most people\nSeem to a young person would you like to be wise I think you will get to the response what do you mean what do you like wisdom what do you mean\nWould you prefer wisdom or a new iPhone\n[laughter] [laughter]\n\nThe federal really that will really do it I Would I think that the somebody needs to do what poll a with a I I'm not even just ... you know under forty\nIf you could have every\nYou could ever knew the newest model Android or the newest model iPhone every year for the rest of your life\nOr wisdom I Wonder what people would vote for but I think most people would say what you mean that's the point it's not valued\nLet me tell you what where is is that my whole life it it has been a ... a love I Want to understand what is wisdom understand me life that is what wisdom is okay it's a it's it's the single word term for understanding of life\nYou can know a great deal and understand and nothing that is why the highly educated are usually the least wise members of our society\nA because universities teach the opposite of wisdom they teach you to be a fool in my opinion some people escape on harmed but many the old and secondly because they teach you implicitly from a explicitly\nThat knowledge is what matters rather than wisdom\n\nWhat to what aside from political correctness and the preoccupation and race and gender what does it show that Shakespeare's poster was taken down at the University of Pennsylvania English department\nIt shows a lack of wisdom because he wrote the wisest please written in the English language but it's not valued\nAll that matters is not wisdom but in this case race and gender so they they dismissed him because\nHe was a white male and they put up a female I don't know what color\n\nWisdom without wisdom you can't do\nGood\nVis and good is what most concerns me good versus evil you can't be a good person if if you're a fool and the food is the opposite of the ... person and those of you who are biblical you oriented build up the word fooled is used pretty often\nWhat is the fool the food was the person without wisdom doesn't mean a person without compassion so let me talk to you about compassion for a moment wisdom is infinitely more important than compassion in setting social policy\n\nYou with me it's if if you just hear that today it will be very important if it's only that sinks in in making political social policy for a society wisdom is infinitely more important than compassion\nCompassion without wisdom is destructive\n\nAnd that's what we have that is what we have in the western world vast amount of compassion or pseudo compassion that doesn't matter even if it's genuine compassion compassion without wisdom is overly destructive\nSo I feel bad for people I'm not going to get into policies are going to continue the discussion about wisdom but I give you an example here I\nFeel bad for people who don't have as much as others and so we will give them more benefits\nBut the white person asks what are you doing to that person and to the society by giving them more and more people benefits\nIs it good for society is a different question that's a question of wisdom is compassionate is not a question that has anything to do with the wisdom\n\nCompassion without wisdom is destructive\n\nAnd we don't produce people with wisdom because wisdom is into wisdom isn't salt it isn't taught because it isn't solved\n\nI Believe ultimately that the radical secularization of western society is at the core of the lack of wisdom\n\nWhen I get calls this I have I Know I mentioned before when I get calls here from let's say twelve or Fifteen year old and the kid talks about important things of life\nI Am certain that they are in a religious home and in every case that it's turned out to be true\nThe twelve or Fifteen year old if they would even listen to discussions of great issues like I have a my show even if they even will they would call in about let's save\nThe planet they wouldn't cold in about an issue of wisdom they would be worried for people they would be again compassionate without wisdom\n\nThis is the great problem they realized that in college so I have all these professors who are very very bright very very male legible in early on ways\nThey didn't understand life\nI fear for a society that does not value wisdom and that is happening in old western society\n\nWhen a Prager seven seven six is the number eight seven seven to for three triple seven six\nWisdom will create a much better society\nThan compassion I Love compassion [noise] but you can't make policy of compassion you make policy\nWith wisdom [noise]\nYes indeed tell you how most recently [noise]\nCame for realization for me when we come back\nAs the ultimate issues our own set of spring [noise]\nCounty with ... ... ...
