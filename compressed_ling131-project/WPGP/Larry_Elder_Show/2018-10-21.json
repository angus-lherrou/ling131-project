in Germany I'm In the late Nineteen twenties in\nNineteen thirties um so I decided to write killing the ss because we had written killing Patton huge success and we had a lot of research material

world worse or is the chances of making the world worse or at least as good as far as making the world better when you have a revolutionary idea\nMaking the world incrementally better is spectacular that's what we should be doing in every generation but overthrowing the foundational ideas of a society because you have a dream of something better which is what character respects the characteristic of the left\nRemember from the will to fundamentally transform the United states of America\nThat's revolution\nThat is where only bad things will happen in the bad things do happen\nShe writes here that she's a middle aged single heterosexual feminist by the way one of the things that I did not mention in my first read of her\nOf her column in the Washington Post and I'm not seeing her name deliberately 'cause I have no desire to a model left this I have no desire to humiliate people\nAnd it's not important to she is she they're interchangeable they have the feminists are feminists are feminists are feminists are on the left about it is interesting that there is no mention in any of the columns by her or other women writing in this column in the Washington Post\nThat may be part of the solution to their loneliness and she says I have never been so lonely used to marry\nShe seems to be looking for a relationship but she has the the word marriage is not even enter she's a she is divorced if I'm not mistaken a buck cheat the there's no mention of of marriage so she wants to wish racial loneliness\nWe've relationship or even an unappealing temporary are fleeing would appear from what I'm reading\nThe divide between men and women is never felt so why am I have never been so lonely too what she described that I Know what I describe a two\nAnd then she writes about her on her being uncomfortable with this really nice man she went on a date with for three hours\nAnd he kept saying whatever you're comfortable with when she asked where he wanted to eat lunch he said whatever you're comfortable with and now I read to read from her over the course of three hours that lie became as ... ... she didn't like that\nAnd then what I even not only put in bold for myself to underline what it was time to part ways I was comfortable giving him a platonic hug\nIt was not sexy being the one in the driver's seat for three hours\nSo if the manager of the driver CDs a patriarchal guy and uh probably somewhat of a massage therapist and if she's in the driver's seat she doesn't find it sexy\nWell and then she wonders why she has never been so lonely in her life because what the feminist like Old West is living to make believe world\nReality\nIt is is awful and then they have an imaginary world where things will be better so she says if the if the man is a dominant decision maker that's er glaring red flag that's what she writes after she's disgusted with the guy who says whatever you're comfortable with\nI don't need a man she says to ask permission for every movie makes but of course that is exactly the way young men are taught today you have to ask permission for every move you make\nWe shouldn't let the battle cry of consent translate into

October fifth do you know where your date stands on Brett Kavanaugh you should\nSo she said she doesn't like to talk politics on first dates but now it's inevitable that she wants to know where they stand my Brett Kavanaugh\nSo she writes a few years ago when I was getting back to dating after getting over a breakup\nI told the friend about how I felt stuck in a paradox okay listen to this this has nothing to do with Brett Kavanaugh disrupt the title but listen to this again\nI told the friend about how I felt stuck in a paradox I wanted to be open to love but I also wanted to protect myself

in the Washington Post held only she is and how crappy relations between men and women are\nI'm ally continue reading at that moment it felt difficult to do both now I imagine a lot of leaders feel stuck in the same dilemma really that's not true\nLeftist leaders are stuck in this dilemma conservatives have matured understanding of life it involves inevitable pain there is a pain in life this is
