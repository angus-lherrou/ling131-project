with mark\nI'm now I voted for President Trump simply because he said he was going to during the ... if you were a Democrat or Republican and he was strong and you're you're out and make America great again and\nEven matter what side in Iran view were bad and all these people that are against them or one in like little dogs on between or like\nGovernment I think the Democrats overplay their hand let's go to Joe in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania you're on was mark\nHey mark I just don't understand I Can't get this through my head why Hillary Clinton isn't being held accountable when she openly called for civil unrest last week um until the Democrats are back in power when you do that and you have a national or international audience\nDon't wackos are going to come out of the ... work and she should be held accountable for making that statement\nYeah but you know she's on the other side she can say anything she wants\nRight [noise] I you know what\nIt means the other day as far as that

if you look at the school system I teach part time and see what it's like in the inner cities none of that seems to matter their immune to that\nBecause what they have on their side they have to press they have the media they have the schools certainly have the colleges they have so many things going for them that it's no wonder that the Democrats get so many votes from minorities because they

for big business yeah we didn't even get the big business won't last time most of the rich people in this country voted for Obama and certainly made it wasn't a trunk vote for Hillary Clinton\nSo this idea that Republicans her for of our big business and the Democrats or the poor and the people who and we had a court challenge me on that or for the poor and and the disenfranchised each not

nine one eighty nine Seventy nine or good walls freedom dot com and click on the ATF ban or\n\nA couple of ways to approach these midterm elections if you're in the conservative media world right now\nSomething's going on\nOkay like everybody in this business knows that the Democrats are fired up\nEverybody on Fox News knows the Democrats are fired up and they've been fired up for a long\nTime every conservative talk radio person who you listen to they knew that the Democrats have been fired up ever since Donald Trump got elected they're angry they are fired up ready to go vote we all know that\nAll the data shows that all the evidence shows that\nSo we can either tell you that\nWe can ignore the ... the blue wave because we know mostly you don't want to hear about the blue wave I mean look I got everybody most conservative radio shows they've got people from across the political spectrum listen\nSo I got Democrats got independence liberals conservatives that got Republicans I've got everybody in between was listening to me right now most of the people listening to me right now are Trump supporters most of the people who listen to conservative talk radio they are\nRepublicans slash conservatives\nAnd if you're a conservative radio talk show host\nYou've had to make a decision are you going to be straight with your listeners\nAre you going to tell on that in the evidence is clear the data is clear Democrats are fired up their voting at a much higher percentage then Republicans have been voting in every special elections and in every primary election students is down from became president am I going to tell my listeners that\n\nWhile my getting new or that\nSame kind a jet Li lie in my listeners cause I Know they don't want to hear about the blue wave\n\nNOW News speaking for me it's it's easy\nIt's it's a it's a decision I never have to make me 'cause I just tell you what I think that's the only way I Know how to do radio I tell you the honest to God truth as I see it which is why\nSo many of you now that we're three to four weeks away from the mid term so many of you have grown very tired of me from the beginning\nTalking about the blue wave I didn't want to yeah I didn't want to deceive you\nAre so I started talking about the way from the very beginning because I saw in a blue wave from the very beginning by the way let me interject here everybody knows a blue wave is common\nThe question is how big is it cannot be it can be big enough to take back the Senate is it can be big enough to take back the house and if not how many seats in the house is blue wave gonna produce everybody knows that a blue wave is calm and the question is how big is it going to be\n\nBut see I've had another motive all of these days and all of these weeks\nTalking about the way I talk about it because I Believe it I see it I've seen that for the past Eighteen months\nBut I talk about the blue wave is while I talk about how fire it up and angry and the Democrats are as well because I Want most of you to get fired up I I Know that most people listening to me right now\nLike me or a conservative like me you don't want the Democrats to take back the house and Senate so I've been reading in the siren every day every week I've been here\nEvery day every week the Democrats are common the Democrats are common\nBecause I Want you to rise up I I don't want this wave however being it's going to be I don't want this wave to defeat us I Do not want the Democrats to take control of the house or the Senate\nLed so I've been trying to wake people up to the fact that\nThe Democrat vote is up over Ninety four percent\nThis primary season over twenty fourteen the last midterm still Republican vote is only up twenty percent that's a big difference Democrats are fired up and they've been voting\nAnd if our side doesn't get fired up and come out and vote on November six we will most certainly lose the house\nAnd struggle in the Senate\nSo look everybody else you listen to you on TALK radio and everybody you watch on Fox News or they got their own reasons for doing what they knew for telling you about how fire it up and Democrats are or for a\nNew arena 'cause they know you don't want to hear it in the new the about the red wave the new that smoke a lot of red white\nAnd look I've even heard guys like candy and I and other people on Fox News who had been ... and the blue wave up until about two weeks ago\nAnd now all send you gotta Hannity talking about oh my God we ain't got to get out there there's no way damage Steve Democrats man they're so even Hannity even got people on Fox News or who who have\nLevel bass these last Eighteen months to ignore what spin in front of them because they don't want to turn you off\nAnd now even they're forced to acknowledge the reality that the Democrats will be coming out in droves this November the only question is will Republicans\nWield conservatives again this is a\nThis is really easy decision for me to make\nBecause radio was really easy for me to do all I Do I got this this microphone and all I Do is say exactly what I Believe every single night\nA riot every road I order through this microphone is what I Believe and when you just say what you believe it's really easy\nYou don't have to think about what you're going to say right you don't have to calculate you don't have to strategize oh my God what am I going to ask what am I going to say that my listeners today how am I going to present to snow it's easy I just see what I Believe every single day\n\nAnd I believe in my head\nAnd I believe in my heart that the Democrats are in fact a burning for war and they're going to come out and vote this November in droves and the only question mark is\nWill Republicans\nConservatives\nNow I understand something um\nWhat Hillary Clinton said yesterday that the days of civility over\nAnd a lot of people on our side got bothered by that\nAh I'm In a play you a little But Eric holder from the other day Eric Holder was at a campaign event in Georgia and he pretty much the same thing and I'll play that for you in a minute Eric Holder\nA room full of Democrats maybe uh when when ah when when when it's time for the Democrats to be like the Republicans it's time for the Democrats to kick\nA and steel and do whatever we have to do when\n\nNo no no more of this when they go low we go high business or a thank you very much Michelle Obama Eric Holder to all the Democrats when they go low we gotta go lower I'll play that for you in a minute and Eric Holder\n\nIs sure to get an abuse from outside like Hillary Clinton got abuse or from our side yesterday when she said you can't be civil anymore\n\nI don't know what the big deal is this is just further evidence\nThat the Democrats are fighting back you understand that our side one in twenty sixteen right side we got our guy in the White House our side controls the house our side controls the Senate we just got to good conservatives on the United States Supreme court um we've been fighting\nA A N we'd been winning and the only thing that's going on right now is the Democrats are fighting back what's the big deal about that\nUh there should be nothing surprising about what Hillary Clinton said yesterday or or Eric Holder said last night the Democrats are fighting back as well\nA reminder of how fire up they are and the question is\nWill our size the fire enough is enough to see\n[noise]\nI just need to know where to go beyond the director asking you why how to vote I'm a Reagan Republican I'm Joel laws Republican which by the way kind of pissed me off he didn't run again anyway [laughter] Neal war why go last your idiot\nThe other guy idiot\nI'm not going to knock it off punch the party line I I\nDon't know what to do by\nWell Mike you're starting off in the right place don't automatically punch the poverty line that's the best clothes on our men\nNever happened never out yeah oh man was a committee Democrats were years when I use the longer agree to disagree but it was a party line guy I'd never be that way but I'm law really lost cause I I I Can't support these idiots that are representing me\nAnd I know he might think you're my friend thanks for calling this is this is really a problem\nBecause again I just mentioned two Republicans in the Chicago
