show\nInteresting experience five dealerships car dealerships LA area\nAnd the experience was essentially the same in each it'd be such an impact on\nOn my on me and my wife or to speak correct English on my wife and me\nThat I actually have written my Tuesday column\nComes up tomorrow or alone on this subject\n... walked among the things that most go up to me was the lack of knowledge about cars that they're selling among these all all of them are young mostly male\nA sales sales people at the at the car dealerships it was it was remarkable\nI asked some truly basic I mean really basic questions and the answer in each case was\nWas suffering from SUV first time I've always just driven a car\nAnd anyway\nShopping for an SUV and I are very rarely shop for cars because for much of my the last decades I been driving cars of advertisers which\nEventually they they sold their businesses in any way whatever it is it I'm now as we're having a new experience to having had in a while ago even car dealers him I don't want to give car dealers the business I Want to do would buy into another want to know what to do with the you know with car dealers\nLet me give them the business but it was it was really fascinating everybody was nice I mean all the sales people were nice it's not an issue there were almost all young men with whom I took test drugs I think in every instance ... for four or five the fiber young men\nBut the thing that got my wife and me was any question I mean any question that I asked was clear they didn't have an answer and they said with no embarrassment I'll look it up oh let me let me this look that up\nSo uh as I said at the end I think that if this is an old representative and it may not be like fully acknowledge that but if it is it all representative\nThere were two things that immediately strike me and one is that the idea that you should know as much as possible even about a product you're selling has has not registered\nBecause hey I could look it up why why do I have to know if that is you can come in all wheel drive why would I have to know\nThe length of the of that SUV versus the other one it's like all I could always look it up and the other is in general knowledge may not be valued\nWhy do you need to know what he's being if you could just pull out a little smartphones from your pocket and find out all you need to know\n\nThis is now if you feel that my general generalization is not valid or you do a very curious to hear from you because it made a real impact on us\nI Am trusting the lines are working one ape Prager seven seven six eight seven seven to for three triple seven six\n\nThat was a that was one aspect of the experience that hit me there was another one too which is even\nDeeper than that is that the there was there seemed to be an absence of passion\nI again I remember from years ago when I when I last really went looking for cars with dealers the the the sales folks were passionate about cars that's why they were in that profession\nI didn't have that sense from any of these ah salespeople again all young\nI didn't have any sense of that\nThat they were passionate about cars it was it was they might as well have been working in a shoe store this is not a negative these were very nice people ... ... ... not a character challenge it's just a statement of a change that\nYou know if you haven't seen anybody in in a war you ever seen a young person in the long term wow boy did you grow you really grown because you haven't seen them see you see if you haven't seen something of a long time you can see a change\nSo this was a change that we saw a gentleman do you ah ... when we spoke to ask a technical question our our launch working is what is your story showing that you know\nOkay All right anyway uh\nWe'll find out oh they're not working you know I'm Sorry folks I hate giving wrong information I was given the information\nThat all the lungs are up okay these are unfortunate things that I must admit annoying me but you gotta live with it and you gotta live with it and that's the way it works\nThat's what I saw though there was it was in it and and then I translated that into as well\nThey they didn't seem ...\nIn in young people and I'm specifically addressing men whether they their ambitious enough and I wonder too if in this generation we have in

I said you know when Franklin Roosevelt disgrace fully turned back Jewish refugees from Nazi Germany\nThey weren't waving Nazi flags and singing German nationalist songs and talking about how they're going to transform\nEngland us in the U.S in Germany damage I mean that people are mixing up the Jewish refugees from Germany with the German American but you know um these people are not refugees ... they're not being persecuted by the government's\nThey're they're just living in kind of crappy countries you know and those countries are crappy for a reason for historical and cultural and political reasons because they never embraced ordered liberty they um they ... they inherited a bad\nDictatorial political culture from Spain uh whereas we inherited a kind of anti tyrannical de centralized political structure from England and\nAs a result they have worse government worse economy they don't have secure property rights that's one of the major things\nThere's a great Latin American economists her had her I think his name is turned on the court\nOr ... I think it's ...\nSoto was\nThis photo and he said if you enforce property rights for the poor and let them protect their property rights from the government\nAnd from thugs and from drug drug lords Latin America could be prosperous within a generation but in the absence of it they were fleeing America and we have a huge welfare magnet a lot of these people you know they they come in and start working their kids will grow up properly I public assistance\nLarge percentage of their family members are going to be on food stamps or right away refugees get a get a whole honey pot full of benefits from the government and you know why the Catholic my own Catholic churches so gung ho about this refugee armada\nForty percent of the U.S Catholic bishops income comes from\nThe U.S government programs to certain immigrants forty percent is government contracts and one out of four five Catholics in America\nIs now an immigrant mostly for Latin America because our bishops have been walling in these scandals and running ... gay bath house is labeled a seminary so one out of five one out of four American Catholics have left the church\nI'm Sorry not one at a four four and a ten for Catholics born in America can leave the church and the only way to replace them without reforming the church is to bring in more cannon fodder for Latin America which also brings in hundreds of millions of dollars from the federal government\nYou are made that point to me last time and it it it just shook me up because it makes so much sense if you can feel the church with Americans you have to bring in none of Americans\nWho will last or maybe ten or Twenty years and then they'll get disgusted and they will join a Protestant Church because they don't want to have get bishops bug going seminarians they don't want to have [noise] way she is that many priests who have boyfriends they they don't want the child abuse running or Anthony\nAnd by the way or just for people smell when you are a Catholic will be back in a moment you are listening to them as Prager show\nThe dentist bigger show live from the relief factor pain free studio\nOf some American either military person or ice person or border guard up pushing some mom with a\nBaby and then uh it's it's it seems to me they win the propaganda war\nNo no I think that I think you know how they win the propaganda war if these people set foot on us soil and then suddenly each one of them has all these legal rights and gets in that short SARS funded attorney\nNo that that's not to forgive me John that's not the propaganda war that's winning the war I agree with the propaganda war\nYou know I may I say right to say one of those ...\nLet me just breaking point it seems to me that they win if they get in and the women if they don't get it\nBecause if they are good I Hope you're right I just don't want to get all those folks I pray you're right\nI think if Trump shows weakness\nIf he tapes then Republicans across the country\nWe just our hearts saying we realize the game is over even Donald Trump can't stop this\nOpenly absurd obviously false attempt to claim asylum and refugee status if even Donald Trump can't say no to something this ludicrous and politically cooked up then where we're toast and I think that would depress turnout\nLine I I agree with you I agree with you I just I I agree with you I\nDo I think if he got dance farm if he's yes if you have to learn that\nThat will mean in picture in pictorial form that they will be fights between Americans and civilians from Latin America\nAnd I think that will help us\nBecause I think people see that this is an invasion\nThey can see it the people who are going to cry\nBecause a couple of people show up at the border and a soldier pushes them back those people are already voting for the Democrats but I don't think it's going to be enough to get people to turn out\nFor for if weren't otherwise going to turn out this is a national impeachment referendum the less space has already fanatical they've got their their ... ready they're ready to go to the polls they've got their dead people registered to vote but what does all ready at its maximum frenzy\nAnd hysteria they've maxed out what the Kavanaugh hearings did was wake up the Republican base a wake up the patriotic Americans who say wait a minute this is their shredding our system of government that destroying an orange adjusted oh and now they're bringing in\nTo transform country demographically by the thousands and thousands and thousands know\nFrom your mouth to God's Ears will be back in ...

bishops and the leaders of the Democratic party and that's not just that they're often cousins of each other because it just Irish Democrats and pointy hats are not in pointing at I'm\nIn both cases they've given up on on the on the people who are already here the Democrat they've given up on the black community they've given up on large parts of the Latino community\nThey just want to win port new voters across the border who will take the place of the of the blacks and Hispanics who are walking away from the Democratic party staying home or even voting Republican\nBecause of the failed Democrat policies in exactly the same way the Catholic bishops have utterly failed in their job as stewards\nAnd it and a possible every last one of them with one or two exceptions should resign and get a job at the post office where I hear they're pretty good pensions\nAnd um it in each case they decided they were unhappy\nWith the people they're supposed to represent so they're going to elect a new people important new people from Latin America naive politically not politically uninformed people who who they think they can control through community organizers and federal money\nAnd and uh George Soros edge it prop organizations that this is not the model of America politically naive uneducated people being manipulated by wealthy\nPoliticians who live in gated communities that Mexico that's El Salvador and Honduras that's not supposed to be the United states so this is not I have nothing whatsoever against Central American people\nI like that might eat in their restaurants I I
