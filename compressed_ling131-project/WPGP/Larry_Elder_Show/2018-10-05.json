with Trump eat I guarantee you people in the White House have told him\nMr President we did it we did it or Mitch has lined up the votes the FBI report is in the first vote will be tomorrow friday and then the vote on Saturday chicken from words there Mr President uh sure um\nHow about at this rally tonight you don't really even talk about\nIf you want to say something nice about Brecht Kevin I'll go ahead and do it but please don't bring up Dr for don't ridicule are don't don't even get into it right 'cause 'cause we got this thing set up Mr President I guarantee you he's been told that\nBut now Trump willy willy listen who knows who knows your guess is as good as mine uh let me go to Jim Jim\nHey Joe how're you doing good brother\nHave one thing I Want to remind people is that the Senate Judiciary committee or the Senate isn't a court of law if doctors forged feel she's been wrong she can always press charges and the appropriate jurisdiction but let's get a vote done and you want\nA ... that's a good point and Jim thanks we are going to get a vote in and move on and the other you know it just hasn't been talked about in the media and the past week or so because the media generally has been against Kavanaugh up but the Judiciary Committee has\nIt's requested a number of documents from Dr Ford these last couple of weeks and especially this past week and her lawyers have said no\nBut I got to be honest 'cause I can only be honest I got real concerns because it's not just Republican base people who are fired up because of this cabinet thing\nA suburban women are fired up and don't forget this cease fire between Democrats up I mean gambling is going to be on the Supreme Court comes Saturday\nShe'll leave when the Democrats lose\nI mean that's just going to piss them off more\nThat's kind of anger them more imagine how you feel how angry you'd be if Kevin always voted down\nAnd I think it just intuitively makes sense that whichever side loses this weekend\nLoses this drawn out\nMost should know battle\nIs going to be even angrier than they are now\nSo I I think both sides get fired up and I think that hurts us in the house I think it helps us in the Senate\nThat's just my read\nI'm In Missouri as well or Republicans have closed the gap in some of the Senate races but in a number of these house races especially in the suburbs\n[laughter] um it has it increased the lead for a number of the Democrats that shit I mean that's just my take look both sides get fired up saying fully because our side needed something to get fired up\nAnd I just hope and pray again that after the weekend after Kavanaugh is put on the Supreme Court that our side or doesn't get complacent because we one let me go to Wayne Wayne\nHi Joe how are you to see them with my friend I have to make it different with you I did it with housewives it rained day in the suburbs and lotion leaning towards their ...

McDonald um jury could come back anytime could come back tomorrow could come back over the weekend will probably come back early next week maybe not may not take that law may take a few days who knows but when the jury comes back\nI Hope everybody listening to me right now says a little prayer for the city of Chicago that the city of Chicago depending on what the verdict is\nA does not burn to the ground we'll get into that and the second or attorneys today in the trial made there\nA final cases they're closing arguments in that twenty four teen shooting a police officer Jason Van Dyke and then the jury this afternoon began deliberating the prosecution\nOr in their closing arguments man they pointed to the video the video the video of Van Dyke shooting Laquan McDonald sixteen times\nAs the teenager stood there holding a knife in his right and the video\nA prosecutor noted that a Van Dyke had told detectives that look clown McDonald raise the knife\nOr that officer McDonald than backpedaled and that look climbed McDonald tried to get up off the ground after being shot the prosecutor today in her closing argument said none of that happened\nIt's not in the video you seen the video officer Van Dyke is making that\nUp now officer Van Dyke says attorneys in in their closing arguments their case was this was a police officer afraid for his life\nIn the acted according to his training defense attorney Dan Herbert told jury that that video that video of la climbed McDonald's being shot sixteen times it doesn't tell the whole story not even close\nUm the defense went on to say that Ben dykes partner that night\nUh also said he saw the clown McDonald raised the knife even though the video doesn't\nShow a and then finally the the defense noted that I'm\nBen dykes partner uh is one of three police officers charged with conspiring to try to cover up what happened on that night of October twenty or twenty four\nTeam trying to protect officer Van Dyke both defense and prosecution\nWrapped up their closing arguments today the judge gave the jury their final instructions south Chicago police officer Van Dyke is has been charged with first degree murder aggravated battery and official misconduct\nOr the judge didn't tell the jurors this afternoon that they have the option\nOf convicting the officer for the lesser charge of second degree murder first degree murder\nCarries a maximum sentence of\nLife or the maximum penalty for second degree murder is no more than Fifteen to Twenty years\nThe other point I Want to make is a Chicago police are have been done to prepare for any possible violence\nIn the aftermath of this verdict\nOr they've amped up patrols on many Chicago police officers have been assigned to twelve hour shifts and supervisors have canceled days off so they're gearing up\nFor potential violence I don't know how much you\nPay attention to the trial I tried to officer Van Dyke did take the stand during the trial he got quite emotional or and he said look it it's not the way it was on the video\nHe said look I I yelled drop the knife drop the knife le Kuan McDonald kept advancing he wouldn't drop the knife\nOr officer Van Dyke testified that were climbed McDonald's face had no expression his eyes were just bugging out of his head he had these huge white guys that were staring at me like he was on something or an autopsy by the way showed that look climbed macdonald did have PCP in his\nSystem his back never once turned towards me Van Dyke set but again the difficulty of this case and the prosecutors quickly tried to pick his ... a part of a Van Dyke story pointing out that the video shows Van Dyke actually stepping toward McDonald\nAnd shot him sixteen times he shot him after he was down\nTo pretty ugly case and I don't know what the juries can decide or the defense is kinda got like an all or nothing case\nLike if you can't convict this guy and first degree murder\nYou know forget about it but there's that video that is so troubling and you know that I uh I understand the numbers and I understand that in like Ninety eight percent of all police shootings or they are justified shootings\nUnfortunate tragic sad but justified shootings and I generally go out of my way to give cops the benefit of the doubt um but when you watch this video\nAnd you see this twenty fourteen shooting of ... the clown McDonald or you can't help but be troubled\nBy what took place\nA that this uh this black teenager was shot sixteen times and and sure he was on something and sure she didn't drop the knife he didn't follow instructions but when you look at the video he was in charge and toward the police officer\nAnd he was even shot more after he went down\nProsecutors pounds by the way on uh the fact that Van Dyke officer Van Dyke told his partner or before they arrived at the scene that they were going to quote half to shoot the guy\nUm\nProsecutors also did their best to try to cast a serious doubt on the credibility of some of the police testimony are accusing police officers of covering up for officer\nVan Dyke and prosecutors tried to make the case that Van Dyke and options that he chose not to employ a before he opened fire the defense they had\nThe aggressive case they said look you know who's at fault fairly quiet McDonalds it's his fault\nOr he was holding a knife that night uh it was a tragedy that could've been prevented with one simple step if he had dropped the knife to the floor if he had simply done what he was told and drop that knife to the ground he never would have been shot he be here today the defense set\nAnd the defense characterize these charges against rupture Van Dyke as trumped up by over zealous prosecutors\nAnd there are plenty of those so ah we we'll\nWe'll find out I don't know how long it's going to take pardon me believes the shouldn't take that long it is rightly difficult to convict a police officer of murder and I understand that\nAnd it shouldn't be difficult because police officers are out there doing their job and as troubling as videos may look and dance troubling as some of these shootings are um\nYou and I are not were not an officer Van Dyke ... shoes\nYou and I did not do would officer Van Dyke and all these other Chicago police officers do for a living having to make split second decisions to troubling case\nAnd brace yourself Chicago because final point the media has put out the assumption that officer Van Dyke so guilty of murder and if the jury doesn't come back with that verdict\nI'm telling you right now all hell is going to break loose in Chicago and I can sit here and tell you that's not right and throw them in jail anybody riots and moods and burns I'm just I'm just telling

you all the final word on this because this is a pretty emotional issue let me go to Rick hey Rick Iran man\nFisher I my father was a sheriff's deputy and I grew up around gesture physically ... if I was on the jury yeah I Would convict this mad at first degree murder there were other police officer standing around watching it on to his thing\nAs this police officers tribes gets out of his cart empties pistol into this young man so if we're not going to watch for not going to factor in the Chicago\nThat we shouldn't fast read any like race right now he's just kill the of making a horrifying ... bad decision he willfully made so that's that's\nHow I have a record which we you write you make a really good point what so troubling about this was you write all the other cops were just sort of hanging out there watching them go in there and then Van Dyke comes in like ... with guns blazing like all of a sudden\nIt's it's you know he had his mind made up and that is the absolute definition of premeditated\nThat's what I had a fit\nThat Rick thanks I appreciate it man thank you for your perspective think you're dead for\nHis service uh it is\nTroubling let me go to a let me go to John John you're on with Joe Walsh\nYeah Hey Joe I saw it was my thing first degree murder is if he were to go out there and wake up in the morning and say I'm going to go kill somebody to its premeditated you know that he has three murder that's not second degree murder I think it's more fit in here the ... he was still an officer in the line of duty a man was wielding in life\nNot like he was you know just sitting in his car and the officer went up there and shot the guy yeah the little bit different than I think I don't think he should\nBe able to spend the rest of his life in jail for a split second decisions you know out there and they're making you know\nJohn menu good call man you make the other compelling argument thank you man you're right\nI mean I Am so loathed to question split second decisions that cops make because I don't walk in their shoes when they make these split second decisions you're right you're right and here's a\nTo sunset their enrollment I. E. to send them back to their home country after a decade or two or three of living in this country\nWe we can't even do that a judge in America won't even let the Trump Administration do that\nYou ... here you've got a program that allows people to remain in the United states uh and apply for work permits if their home country experiences a natural disaster armed\nConflict or some other extraordinary event but they're only allowed to stay here temporarily but that's never how it works out and we have millions of these people who were brought over\nHere temporarily who've been here for a decade or two or three\nAnd now we have another judge blocking the Trump administration's effort to finally follow the law to follow the law this temporary protected status\nSo this will be another issue now that will be kicked up\nKicked up the road and this will now become another issue\nThat the Supreme Court is going to eventually have to address a spokesperson from Trump's Justice Department said in a written statement and I agree that this judge's decision quote you ... the role of the executive branch\nJust and I'll just closed with this because everybody missed this last night because all we're doing is talking about Kevin but just think about it right we we can't even we can't even enforce this program\nThis temporary protected status program big earthquake in El Salvador okay twenty thirty thousand you can\nCome over here you can come over here for a few months or a year or two and then they stay for a decade or two\nAnd we can't even move to return them to their home country they're not citizens in this country and here you have a judge who won't even allow us to enforce that there's there's something so wrong about that uh have Jim you're on with Joe\n[noise] gay man how are you good buddy\nGood I'm Glad that you're correct these programs are at ... however for those that have been lawfully for Twenty years I have two brothers ...\nYeah do they have homes there that got kids so that people here that don't have criminal records should be it in the program but then they should be given a\nPath to green cards that is because these people are kind of ... immigrants be ones that are productive paying taxes buying things consumers um you know I Know about your culture my address because Hurricane Mitch in through back in the ... like a nightmare\nYeah every year that ... that file their paperwork and things like this and so they're\nLiterally so if the programs that at all I agree with you but then the ones that have demonstrated a citizenship citizenship should be given\nA path to green card status otherwise honor back it'd be like so and so for counter\nPay me thank you thanks to my friend I appreciate the perspective thank you let me go to Greg Greg thanks for hanging out\nHey Joe I'm listen my feeling on this whole trial with the officer Van Dyke yeah is that the first of all the comments that he made when they were driving a car yeah about you know we might have to shoot the guy or something like that\nLook that he'd already heard stuff on the police radio I'm sure right right that's sort of similar to like if you're driving in the car with somebody and you hear that there's an accident on the Eisenhower right\nAnd you're not to the accident yet and you turn to them and say something like we're probably going to have to get off the freeway\nRight or get a hit some traffic he's probably just tossing out loud trying to imagine what is he going to be like when they get there that have you heard there is somebody who was high on drugs throughout the night and he was stabbed the cop car in the tire yeah probably thinking through these things and talking out loud to his\nPartner and secondly if one of my own blood relatives was high on PCP wandering around the street with a knife had approached a person who had to call nine one one\nAnd then when they encountered the police the police car and

nominating Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court as we've discussed and he will be on the Supreme Court\nAh when next week be against [noise] look\nI'm some campaign straight talk and I look I uh I I can just tell you what I think\nI can only tell you what I Believe\nI I Can't sugar coated there's always pressure in this business talk radio conservative talk radio to feed the listeners what they want to hear you see that I'm conservative TV and conservative\nRadio there really isn't liberal radio show but but you look you see the same thing on the other side MSNB it in and MSNBC and CNN both sides in the media and this is what they tend to do\nThey tend to give their listeners their viewers\nAre what they think they want to hear say tend to feed him feed him the red meat\nOr I Can't do that I won't do that I never will do that I I don't understand how to do that I just I mean I just say what I Believe I'm ... you look at like for instance Fox News\nFox News news that Ninety eight percent of the people watching Fox News are Trump supporters so Fox News is going to feed their viewers\nPro Trump pro Trump pro Trump no matter what pro Trump pro Trump pro Trump even if it's accurate pro Trump pro Trump pro Trump\nEven if the the talking head or the host doesn't believe it um I'll get to the other side and the second I just want make sure you understand this when you watch Fox News night after night after night your getting biased to news you understand that right\nNow I Hope you do it both sides guys when you're watching MSNBC every single night you're getting bias news\nBoth sides are biased now I'm harping on Fox News and conservative TV because most people listening to me right now are like me a conservative\nBut don't for a moment and think that Fox News is not biased absolutely they are there is no such thing there was no animal there's no such animal is on biased\nMedia unbiased TV that's crazy\nTalk there's no such thing every newspaper every radio show every TV show every network has a bias\n\nWashington Post has a biased the New York times has a biased the wall Street Journal has a bias CNN has a bias ABC has a bias this radio show right here the Joe Walsh show has a\nBiased and Jeff Fox News has a bias\nI just think it's so important for the viewer for the listener to understand that\n\nI I'm not saying don't watch Fox News just understand you're getting you're getting a side or they will slant their news they'll slant how they present it to you are in in in a pro Trump fashion because they know that's what you want to hear\n\nThey'll decide what stories to play they'll decide what angles and issues to emphasize\nAnd their goal Fox News's goal is to feed you red meat red meat baby stuff he'll eat up\nBoth sides knew what CNN does it they feed their viewers red meat they're red meat they know CNN knows that most of the people watching CNN don't like Trump\nSo you watch CNN all day all night you're going to get a steady diet of generally anti Trump food\n\nThe point that making to you my conservative fellow American is don't for a moment get in front of me\nAnd tell me that the media is\nBiased the media is all fake news except for Fox News Fox News's unbiased Fox News's and fake news [laughter] well I don't know what fake news is I'm telling you it's all biased\n\nAnd I'm why why am I bringing this up well because if I I'm an American\nAnd I've got my conservative beliefs like me I'm pro life I'm pro gun I'm anti government you know what I Am I'm pro wall I'm pro border I'm I Want to be as informed\nUm and as educated as I can be\nI Want to be well informed\nAnd if all I Do is watch Fox News and that's the only thing I watch\nI'm not getting the whole truth I'm getting a slanted truth I'm getting a biased truth\nAnd so then when the the truth is because there is truth out there there is a truth\nCNN gives you their truth MSNBC gives you the truth the Joe Walsh radio show gives you his truth Fox News gives you their troop there all giving you the truth is they see it the truth is a\nTruth that something different like like this notion of the blue wave\nA there there is a blue wave come and miss November thirty three days the only question is how big is it going to be\nBut for for for anybody on Fox News to tell you there's not going to be a blue wave 'em they're doing you a disservice\nThey're wrong um\nBut they're feeding you because you don't want to hear about the blue wave Everytime I blew a bring up the blue wave people get mad at me you don't want to hear about the blue wave Fox knows news knows that are conservatives don't want to hear about the blue wave\n\nSo they ignore the blue wave they tell you and that can be a big deal Republicans are going to do great there shouldn't be read and wave\nWell that's a bunch of crap\nBut see my fear is and this is where I'm from head and\nIf you watch Fox News every night and they minimize or downplay or ignored the blue wave\nAnd then election night comes and the blue wave comes and the Democrats take back the house and maybe the Republicans barely hang on to the Senate\nOr we're going to be a lot of conservatives out there a lot of Fox\nPeople out there who are going to say how how'd that happen Sean Hannity didn't tell me there was a blue wave come and Laura Ingraham didn't tell me there was a blue wave coming how'd that happen\n\nAgain if I Want to be informed and I want to be educated\nI'm not just watching Fox News I'm I'm I'm trying to get my news from as many different people as I can so that I'm [laughter] I'm not blown away by the truth [noise]\n\n\nTalking about a red wave oh boy\nDon't give that the time of day don't give that the time of day\nThat's just I mean I suppose there could be a red wave\nBob on the monkeys uncle can I still say that I Believe there could be a red wave but they're stuck on a ...\n\nAnd I just believe that anybody telling you that is doing you a real disservice\n\nBecause they're not giving you the truth\nAnd then you're going to be surprised and you're going to be disappointed come election day\nWhen there is a blue wave how big do no but there is a blue wave\nAnd you're going to wonder how that happens\nSo what's the answer [noise]\nWell the answer is if you want to watch Fox News watch Fox News but balance your Fox News viewing by getting your news from other sources as well\nAnd then you figure out\nKind of what you think that the truth is I mean I'm In an unusual unique situation because I Do this for a living but I'm I'm Watch and\nSeven eight different TV shows every day and night MSNBC CNN Fox I'm going on to Fifteen different websites everyday some conservative websites some websites in the middle\nAnd some Web sites on the left I'm trying to get a feel for how everybody's thinking I Want to know if MSNBC is telling me this and Fox is telling me that what does that me\nAnd I know that I I Know that MSNB sees given me the leftist slant the anti Trump slant and Fox has given me the pro Trump slant\n\nSo then it's on me it's up to me so what's the answer\nAnd I know look I Know most God love ya who's got time for that but you got time to be as informed as you can be and you ought to have a couple two to three go to websites that you can go to every day just to get caught up [noise]\nAre you ready to
