flush of patriotic resentment when I'm forced to use a translator to communicate with the guy fixing my car I feel a certain frustration so don't you think you should modify your statement that\nHis research shows native born whites feel a greater affinity towards immigrants who speak English how 'bout native born Americans feel a greater affinity towards immigrants who speak fluent English Obama is not white\nHe said he reads ... when a guy sixty my car requires me to use a translator because he can't speak English\n[noise] cold [noise]\nBut it's white people who want immigrants to speak fluent English unless your name was Obama no let's revisit this those who\nEnter the country illegally and those who employ them just respect the rule of law and they are showing disregard for those who are following the law\nAll Americans not only in the states most heavily affected but in every place in this country are rightly disturbed by the large numbers of illegal aliens entering our country the jobs they home I'd otherwise be held by citizens or legal immigrant the public service they use impose burdens on our taxpayers\nWe have to listen to the concerns that working ... hour for

on the need to better secure the border and punish reporters who choose to hire illegal immigrants so\nThat's why our administration is moved aggressively to secure our borders more by hiring a record number of new border guards by deporting twice as many criminal aliens is ever before\n[noise] moving forward [noise]\nWe issue the painters for illegal immigrants who are arrested for any crime watch and they wouldn't be placed into I mean ...\nWe will try to do more to speed the deportation of illegal aliens who were arrested for crimes to better identify illegal aliens in the workplace as recommended by the commission headed by former congresswoman Barbara Jordan\nI continue to believe that we need stronger enforcement on the border and at the workplace\nThat means a workable mandatory system that employers must use to verify the legality of their workers\nIf you break our laws by entering this country without permission to give birth to a child we reward that child with US citizenship and guarantee of equal access\nTo all public and social services this society provides and that's a lot of services is it any wonder that two thirds of the babies born tax for expensive country county run hospitals Los Angeles born to illegal aliens\nSo that's why we need to start by giving agencies charged with border security new technology new facilities and more people to stuff process and deport illegal immigrants\n[noise]\nThe pasta hey why why God\n\nObama says he feels some recently and when you use a translator to communicate with a guy fixing his car studies show that
