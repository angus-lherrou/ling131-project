R. Hawkins and I've been communicating during the break at the top of this hour he let's just say kids sport and X rays okay something needs to be taken care of that are more important than the program right now and we've just totally W. R. take your family comes first\nSo what we're going to do is we're going to be Johnny Rowe in back in ... we're going to do something really fun with Jon we're going to continue the discussion with him because we didn't have enough time in the first hour we never do\nAnd then in the second half where he and I together are going to start covering Breitbart News a W. R. Hawkins award winning journalist pieces for him and get commentary from the ... the legend the man Johnny rolling himself Johnny Rowe and welcome back to the director radio\nCross breed holster studio

great all the people that are in students in what we are doing\nAnd as many people as can we need to know about what we're up to withhold we're trying to make a difference for the future of our country in ourselves as gun owners and you're not the United states will mark and will you better there's you know there's never a better time\nThan males to stand up for our rights and to tell the truth as be counted and who is critical for the survival of our country so\nYou better believe it is let me since you mentioned that but let me get your opinion on this because you you you've been around you know these things and I know you feel this I I don't have to sit in and look at you I Know this through\nOf white minds I Know I Know how your thinking here because I Know what you're talking about it I I Want to get your opinion\nOn this because like you you probably feel it's a great sense of unease as we go into the midterm now the media is telling us that blew away let me tell you\nKnow it's not I'm going to tell you right now and I'm sticking to my guns house is going to pick up four or five Republican seats set it's going to pick up three to four Republican seats and that whole blew away you're going to have the same ... looking at what's going on after ... after Hillary Clinton were let me remind you\nTen days before the election the New York times and twenty sixteen had Ninety two percent chance to eight percent chance that she was going to be elected so don't pay attention to this garbage that you're seeing in the polls is just the media telling you what they want that's just may not where I Want to get your opinion of\nThose people who hate us those socialist who are now openly running as social to destroy this country and tear down its culture that we've grown up with that I Want to give to my children who hate Donald Trump and what he stands for because God Forbid somebody disagree with them\nAnd their ideology they're going to go nuts after the midterms because guess what's going to happen after the midterms Donald Trump is still going to be president and those next two years I think John you're going to be very very scary in America or you feel that same steps\nHe's well as a lawyer or a sure like the way you put that ...\n... from from the other side and literally that's what they do but there's nothing rational about the the ... you know when we have a perfect record of communism socialism destroying countries every every time it's ever been tried other ... percent\n... percent destroys the economy destroys the futures of oh the boat and the livelihoods of\nPeople hundred percent you know the communist China has adopted capitalistic qualities and look how success or it may have Trump has not been able to take the chains all these just loosened them and look at the\nProgress we've made here in this country gives them the women and he has a lot to say he's only Louis Freeh enterprises such an incredible system and and these people it you know it was still alive\nLong enough loud enough a big enough black\nPeople will believe me I'm fortunate\nUnfortunately we have a face to the educational system especially being so uh so cause them in so many areas in our country\nLook where we have [laughter] well yeah like generation but can't even though they're all know\nAnd these people are threatened enough to put the little mask all they've got you know they don't take enough votes to scare us you know it's what the go up with the comments that will only we tell you what very important more what you said ... we'll only lose\nIf we let ourselves lose\n... and you don't do that from your you\nKnow let me stop you there I I got to stop you right there for just a second they'll let you continue because David coterie a very good friend of mine prolific writer and think or he's just he's just a great intellect David ...\nDavid reminded us on this program a number of weeks ago Johnny ... would you just said it was what reminded me of when we take a step further to write to our firearms he said on this program he said mark\nHe says we can't have\nConfiscation gun confiscation in America it's impossible we have a Second Amendment right to own and keep and bear arms in America there can be no confiscation in America we can only willfully hand them over\nA year\nThat we were you just said that's what you just set so we in that same sense what they're trying to do is\nEnd run around the constitution Johnny is you know the courts to do it using ballot measures like they're doing in Washington state her down and talking about it I sixteen thirty nine and others\nAnd Arizona is about an issue can stay where you sit very volatile right now we discussed it last week in Arizona both on the Sunday monster broadcast and Monday and Tuesday in tombstone where you've got a possibility with duck and there is a demographic shift going on in Arizona\nYou think Arizona God love and freedom loving real deal\nDemocrats run and gun control here yes it can happen we have to stand up and fight don't we\nWell we really do because this is one illegal immigration salt they the the Democrats the socialist kinda the way on own points so they have to cheat so they want to bring in massive numbers of illegal and say look we're going to give you all\nFor your health we're talking people literally have been starving and some of these a socialist third world countries they said look come here will give you a home we'll give you\nFor your call we'll give you an Obama fall it's cetera and if you vote for us and we'll go ahead and ratio whether you're a citizen or not it's okay to call him and this is what they want this is the ... that was the\nPush result for open borders George for he but he bad guy George source you know just like this this caravan coming to our southern border nail somebody's paying their wife somebody's\nPlaying them and I guarantee if you do a little digging going to find the nasty fingerprints will source owner somewhere\nI notice that I think you're absolutely correct in\nYou know you deal with that illegal immigration there on the border in Arizona all the time in fact

Johnny about one more segment where I'm going to read you an email that's okay this is an interesting and\nLet me just up who set this up for a\nWhile I was in Arizona I was talking when I was at the ... this broadcast the monster broadcast Sunday broadcast last week\nIn Arizona at the Sheraton\nI was talking about how Arizona is widely regarded as the most gun friendly state the country and it is and that's because of the method of ... you don't need a permit you go to carry law binding citizen you go to Arizona carrier got simple as that carry your don't take it with you the Arizona feel free\nHowever but I made the comment I see more no guns allowed sides in Arizona on one trip that I see in Thirteen Years of living in Georgia\nOkay there's a reason now here's here's the email Matthew Murphy writes it marked tombstone is now Second Amendment city on yesterday's daily defense you mentioned that there were all kinds of signs around tombstone saying no guns allowed how can I claim to be a Second Amendment city when all the establishment to say no guns allowed now let me give you my answer they don't want to turn it over to you\nMatthew that's a great question I've heard it before here's why it's Arizona State law it comes from alcohol serving establishment predominantly I don't think I've ever seen a no guns side at a at a hat at a stepson or gift shop if you will it only seems to be in\nRestaurants that serve alcohol now those signs at Arizona do carry the weight of law\nWould I mean by that is if you walk into that establishment in violation of it sit at the bar and have a beer you can't be charged with criminal trespass immediately and the signage in Arizona doesn't have to meet a certain standard some owners of those establishment for whatever reason\nAs their owners have decided they don't want you when you can walk away now I have spoken and I won't name two of the popular bars in in doing so and I won't leading them by name doesn't matter Johnny but I've spoken to the owners of them on both occasions and both times I got the same response we would prefer you didn't but if you want to\nUh let us know and we'll check it for you\nKnow on the Arizona law ... if if if a business tells you and has a sign that says no guns allowed they by law in Arizona have to provide you\nA safe storage for that firearm while you were there most business [noise] believe it or not are not in compliance of that but that's why that is that the alcohol serving establishing Johnny you want to take that email from their\n... and you're right Omar pretty much and realized that uh you know we have people from all over the country over the world come to stall and as some of these folks are or not familiar\nWith guns and they they want to make a statement and it also you've got somebody will now there are just going to cause trouble so so what that is an insurance policy against someone told me and drinking too much and having a fire or maybe not knowing how to handle it again but a visitor someone that might not be familiar with\nWas just how this goes and and you know personally and the the law is that if you you can go if there's not a sign there you can take your gun on a ball places ...\nYour ... your but but you can't drink you've got to say a ... if you got you know drink and so that's that's how that works\nAnd how to end up you there too 'cause I got to throw this disclaimer into Johnny and that is Arizona is a constitutional carry permit let's carry state you do not need a permit in hand to carry a firearm in Arizona however in order to carry into an establishment that serves alcohol\nYou must have a permit constitutional carry his permit was Kerry is prohibited sea so\nMatthew I what I'm telling you hear is it's the it's really state law that's in play here and not every bar and restaurant has that side\nThat's right but there are a lot to do and and when you're in an area like Scottsdale combat which is lots of bars and great restaurants\nYou tend to see more of them in Arizona because state law allows for that and it does carry the weight of law you still have that title are people out there even though it's a gun friendly state so I Hope I answered the question Johnny did you want to put an explanation point on that\nI think he did really well and you're right and personally um I just prefer not to freak one of the places they'll go well maybe by ... on it\nHow do you live\nThere are simple but I'll go to where I can\nBecause again the the bad\nPeople to the criminal is not going to do the you

R. wrote this up on the twenty first which is today and I wanted to get your opinion on this with the last minute that we have\nGun control group urging people to Texas authorities and report armed citizen and the name of the group is guns down America let's see where they're at USA Today quota guns down America director I ... ...\nSay given the troubling political rhetoric we've seen over the last two years and the guns are far too easy to obtain this campaign will help the majority of Americans who believe that fewer guns keep us safe or\nFight back and cast their ballots free from fear of intimidation well you know I just read that for the first time here's what it ought to say\nGiven a troubling political rhetoric from the left that we've seen over the last two years and that does are far too scary for those on the left this campaign will help the majority of ... who don't trust Americans feel a little better my response to that is go to hell what's your response to that one\nWell I'll tell you what are we we have a special program and its coal adopt the plan if you have a go out there there's probably knew at home and and you feel like it's a problem because we have

out later that year and I've been coming back to the city every year since then I think about Eighteen months without a stretch and I got to tell you pulling into town today you have done in unbelievable job here at the place looks great\nThank you thank you are listening to you know it takes a lot of a coordinated effort with all of the merchants and the citizens to make the town look as good as it does today and uh you know and I'd like to talk about the citizens or\nYou know which by the way I don't know if you told your listeners but as of today you become a U.S on or a citizen of tombstone Arizona the town to to to die\nAlong with salad over here and I was a pleasure for me to be able to make you fellows both of you are on average citizens of tombstone\nWhile what I'm going to do is I'm going to shake your power right now and thank you because I Want to listen to his original radios theater of the mind we've got a couple of plaques here and I can't I Can't tell you it almost brought tears to my city of Tucson honorary citizen presented to mark Walters buys\nThem there and in addition to that you handed both Alan and I at golden keys to the city of Tucson and I got to tell you that to me is one of this is one of the coolest things I've ever gotten in my life thank you very much\nOr has been with my honor I Will tell you though a market it doesn't work on the job you can't\nGet on a job [laughter] I have absolutely no intention of finding out I Do know that they were hopeful over the next two days that were geared that will be able to talk with the sheriff was quickly because of your time is very valuable I Know you have another meeting used quite a history of Tucson you didn't just get here\nNo I'm actually force the generation native of tombstone migrate grandad came here in Eighteen Seventy seven it was a a reporter for the San Francisco chronicle doing a story about a boom in southwest and captured drowned them all\nAnd ended up the cap what you could move out to Eighteen miles west of here\nAnd they told him about a fellow man I met a chef and the big strike here he ended up over there become friends with him and it wasn't long after that to give him a contract to how timbers into the end of the new newly found mines and we've been here ever since\nYou know I Know I Know a lot of the history of the town so we and I've told my audience over the years the story of at shoveling and\nHow he was told how the town got its name that he was told by the guards at Fort which you can now that he would find as you know what are you doing going out there in the middle of the night and Apache cut you off what are you looking for he said he was looking for silver and gold east they told him and you tell me if it's true that all he was you'll find out there is this tombstone and that's how he named his first strike is that true\nThat's absolutely true we are actually the ... and ... and had a he had a unique way of name and his mind and claims and his first one called students don't they called a tombstone because that's what the soldiers out their temperature you could do that oh you're going to find out ... does your tombstone\nAnd uh and and believe it or not the next ah Siamese decked out what was called the graveyard\nOf what I think it's fascinating to me is that your grandfather your great grandfather knew him now after that strike he went back to Illinois which we will see from Illinois and he raised enough money with his brother to come back out and this is when king sol exploded from that point forward\n... much yes from that point forward or it wasn't long have you had a a prospectors coming from all over and uh all over the the country mostly read from Nevada um northern about in northern Arizona tombstone to stake their claims and that's how it started\nAnd now tombstone became and this made national news and I want to talk about it now it became the first\nAmerica's first second amendment city how how did that tell me about that\nWell you know it's it's only appropriate that a tombstone would recognize the second amendment since uh\nYou know we're famous for a lot of things that are mostly for the gun fights are but also were famous because we've always believed in having firearms to protect ourselves along the Mexican border and we're a and you know and I'm not talking about that about Mexicans are are Indian spoke we had to watch out for the Indians too so\nThe second amendment was important back in the Eighteen hundreds just as just as it is today well\nI often say use the phrase that the city not not just the city with state of Arizona real at America in general but where we sit now particularly was built on the guy on is that a true statement\nWell uh I I think that would be a true statement yes or\nNo you're getting ready to again because we have just a couple of minutes I Know you have another point but but you're getting ready now to celebrate Eldorado day here into stone that starts next weekend this coming weekend and it kicks off of course eight October twenty six as the virtue of the what\nThat was the gunfire to kick around\nThe big gunfire ... famous a\nWider the was successful in getting tore out about the gun fight when he moved away from Arizona into California and the you have to it's become very famous down worldwide\nNow is that a good thing for the city of Tucson that it's known for the gunfight at the OK Corral\nWell I you know if it's what it's a lot of folks\nThank the tombstone as the Old West is anonymous with with the tombstone\nAh that doesn't mean that tombstone supports treating people down in the streets right there just means that we know order history is now we know how important it was to have the guns back in the Eighteen hundreds as well it is today or in the you know\nWider and his brother actually what the brother perjure was ... was the actual Marshall tombstone\nAnd they actually tried to control the guns by making the guy's either carrier gunner or check it in a and they weren't allowed to carry guns in town\nAnd a lot of people don't realize I've talked about it on the show but this was early form of gun control by Virgil or it was not very successful in town was it\nNo it it wasn't and actually that law is on the books up until the seventies and somebody challenged it and said you can't do that that's against the state statutes in the constitution the second amendment and to the judge over ruled an overturned ordinance\nAnd did away with it so that you can carry a firearm anywhere in the city of ...\nIt is absolutely and I am carrying right I Hope that's okay right\nI'm going into some yoga okay good I'm good and things that you know it's fascinating because that the gunfight at the OK Corral of course was actually fought over gun control emerge or from the boys walked right down the street outside where we are now Fremont Street made a leftover by flash photography studio and said we're here for your\nGuns one of them went for it and ... said hold that's not what I Want that ... over\nGun control some threats by the by the folks who were actually violating the law right\nThat that's absolutely correct\nAnd I actually didn't start just that day they'd been wanting to\nThe crime or that you can share your guns in tombstone we've made the law and you're going to live by the law and ah that that that\nDay was the more than point where it probably blew over and and the ... to learn it you know I Wonder sometimes as many shots as they shot and there was only a couple of guys here and\nI don't know what's on your real quick and we've only got a couple of minutes but it was a if I'm not mistaken about thirty four seconds was the total fight summer didn't last thirty five sites too rapid fire shots when often succession of to this day we don't know who fired the shots is that right\nThat's correct the there's no record is there's no way to prove which who shot the first show\nWas your grandfather here and are great grandfather here in town at that time\nShe was do\nYou have any writings are stories I mean this is fascinating Alan Gottlieb is sitting across from me and he's he's grinning from ear to ear with each question with the thing with each after we've been a long time coming trying to get her when I talked to him shortly but does do you have any family heirlooms recollections or anything from that\nWhile I Will tell you that uh my grandad\nOr and my great grand dad were pro Clinton requires they were ranchers is that right and really Clinton had eighty some dollars in his pocket when he was killed over here in that eighty some dollars had been paid by my great grandfather for breaking some horses foreign so\nWow see I I'm just sitting here\nIs that is a fascinating story Mr Mayor were coming to the end of the segment I I could hear him talk for hours and hours and hours I Hope you get the opportunity in the future okay

privilege to downtown itself so that they are doing that first and then you look at the city I Can't wait actually for our ... you all get out on the street and take two in stone\nYou know as much as

S. could pull the mayor of tombstone do hereby proclaimed that from this day forward to some she'll be known as America's Second Amendment city in full support of\nDeclaration of independence and the constitution of the United states approved this temp day of January two thousand seven in\nThe ... or ... what he was sitting here made a comment that I've got to ask you about I didn't he didn't have enough time because I knew the response would be a little bit longer than he had\nHe mentioned that all went away back in Nineteen Seventy it's the talk about that was actually in this town by the ... seventies right\nBut you can carry it got anywhere in town now question for you there used to be some businesses in town and I won't name them although I Know who they are it used to be you could check your firearm and this town at the hat shop across the street from a couple of places\nIf you wanted to carry a gun in certain places and I have done that before and I think it cost me like six bucks and I got to be honest with you I thought it was kind of cool that I was checking my guns are tombstone\nThe only thing on cool about that is having to check your guns in tombstone you see right there how both of those can you can you can say one's cool ones not but it's cool but it's not at school to school but it's not really cool but it's cool but it's not\nDo those businesses now has there been a change since this proclamation that\nBusinesses allow UN with guns if it's legal in the state of Arizona am I making that did you\nIs that question to that come out right yeah that's fine or the most of the best of course I think all the businesses into some support or Second Amendment and this proclamation um there's some of them to still allow that um but I think the ones with liquor are that's an issue so they don't allow guns in an environment serves liquor like a bar of course is that Arizona law that\nYou can't have a gun in an establishment that serves liquor or is that their choice they just don't want it in there or can you go in with a gun and not drink liquor because there's a distinction there\nI Believe it's that the establishment choice and um but you know guns in alcohol don't always mix I think anyone would agree with that\nYeah and it's interesting and the reason I ask that is because I have contacted a couple of years\nBush mints here in town yeah again I won't name names or the ... greatest abolition solved and fantastic and ask because I was unaware and I'm going back a few years am I allowed to carry my gun in your ... and the response was under Arizona law you can and if you really want to you okay but we would prefer you not\nAnd you know I honored their I honored their preference so I I I think it's interesting because I Know every single one of them that I spoke to said we support the second amendment yeah and they do support the second amendment I Know they do but I just was curious if this proclamation\nChanged anything in town did anybody in town fight you want it did anybody say hey we don't want this or guns or bad I mean those people are out of there did we did you get any pushback to literally\nOut of a of a whole city town and uh but it did support people that support the proclamation and they did support our constitution and and I write in our individual rights yeah\nYeah because there's some there's one interesting politics in the town of ... done and I'm curious what did anybody push back hard that we did you get any particular level that you would in a you know in a place like Phoenix where you know you've got groups that would actually come out and at actually picket you or fight you you didn't get any of that and\nNothing uh nothing no demonstrators just just you know one person maybe wasn't happy with that but everyone else was a it was very positive\nGood it is positive thing I Love it now let's talk about some big names you got some big plans and I love the fact you said you like to think really big\n...
