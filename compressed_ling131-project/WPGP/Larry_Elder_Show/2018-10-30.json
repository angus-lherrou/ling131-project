getting political maybe rightly right now right both sides are getting political and everybody's talking about lowering the temperature and and and even after what happened last week\nOr the evil hateful acts that happened last week I don't think the temperature is going to be lowered on either side week out from these midterms is what it is but I'm going to do something a little different to start tonight I don't want to talk about the politics to start\nI don't want to talk about who's to blame to START I don't want to get into any of that\nI don't want to start a Republican Democrat fight after what the country went through last week after what Pittsburgh went through last week after what the tree of life synagogue went through this past weekend I don't want to start\nWith the politics politics doesn't matter to me I Want everybody listening to me right now to understand that these eleven lives\nLost these eleven lives gunned down at this synagogue in Pittsburgh I Want to

eleven victims in this and the guy Saturday when evil struck some of them were old enough to be alive during the Holocaust and this past Saturday morning\nThey were volunteering they were doing good in that synagogue\nWhen evil and hate entered that soon the guy\nAnd killed them\nI don't know right maybe it's not the most important thing in the world but I think it is this Monday Night the victims\nWe we tend to write when evil like this hits when hate like this hits we tend to gloss over the victims eleven people were killed or thoughts and prayers thoughts and prayers not what's Duke it out\nWho who's to blame oh which Trump sweater no which CNN who's to blame right away we get into that and we gloss over the lives lost shame on us\nI'm not going to do that tonight we have plenty

sick man walked into a synagogue in Pittsburgh earlier today and open fire murdering\nJewish men women and children while they prayed and celebrated a Britain and the law of Britain ... the Jewish ritual of circumcision was the first commandment given by God Abraham the first Jew end is typically a joyous occasion\nToday's Britain ally ended in senseless tragic deaths of Americans who happen to be Jewish who were just practicing their faith in their house of worship unfortunately\nHatred of Jews and our tradition\nOur traditions dates back centuries we have been thrown out of\nNearly every land across the globe over the centuries but America has been a welcome home since Columbus first landed on her shores we have survived and we have thrived and we've been blessed here in America by becoming part of the fabric of the business political an academic worlds\nHatred such as we saw displayed today has no home here in America I strongly condemn this violence against other fellow Jews and ask that all Americans stand United against the senseless murders as well as all other senseless murders wherever they occur across our\nLand so wrote my lovely Jewish bride Helene Miller Walsh\nSaturday hate anti Semitism\nCame together Saturday morning this past weekend in Pittsburgh the largest Killeen abuse in this country in the history of the United states this past Saturday the

Stutzman or just the tip of the iceberg abs is on guard all over America as new challenges pop up just listen to a BF senior counsel Jim Campbell\nYeah we represent a promotional print or in the state of Kentucky uh he was asked to prime messages that conflict with his religious beliefs and he declined specifically he declined a request to promote a a gay pride festival and he was sued for that and he had a local human rights commission that ruled against him\nAnd so now that cases all the way up before the Kentucky Supreme Court so far we've won that case but if they rule against him will have to ask the U.S Supreme Court to hear the case\nAnd there's the threat right there is the threat if it can happen to a print shop owner like Blaine Adams send in Kentucky a man it can happen to you it can happen to anybody\nThis is what we got to be on the guard against this is why alliance defending freedom is so doggone important dose of us who cherish freedom are troubled by the ongoing attacks by\nSecular forces on the most fundamental freedoms your freedom of speech and your freedom to exercise your religion and ... while alliance defending freedom supports its clients with free legal help freedom isn't free and we need your help right now\nTo grow up when it comes to guns in this country and I want to I'm going to tell everybody listening to me right now guns are not going away okay we are not\nGetting rid of firearms in America ain't never going to happen and it should never happen are Second Amendment are guns or gun rights are every bit as American as baseball and apple pie so guns are going anywhere all of you gun grabbers on the left\nSo what we as a country got to decide is All right\nAre we going to begin to finally defend ourselves how we can begin to defend ourselves lord knows our men and women and blue do the best they can are cops are police officers do the best they can but this is what I Know\nThis was true over the weekend this was true last week this was true three months ago this has always been true and it always will be true the only thing that\nStops a bad guy with a gun is a good guy with a gun and it's about damn time that this country understood that again and lived according to that again why was there not an armed guard at that send the gag in Pittsburgh\nBetter yet why weren't there are people in that congregation trained and

that that that targeting and killing of African Americans and ...\nDo you understand ... does everybody understand\nWe could have had another major mass shooting in America we could have had another a mass killing in America\nThere could have been five six seven eight nine ten eleven twelve Thirteen fourteen people or more killed Saturday Night at a Birmingham mc Donald's are you listening to me if not for a good guy with a gun\nIf not for a really brave dad who by the way he's walking out of the McDonald's with his son\n\nHere's shooting behind him turns around\nWalks back into the mix dials

synagogue\nThirteen people killed in a Birmingham mc Donald's do you understand America you'd had those dueling headlines without a good guy with a gun if not for a good guy with a gun\nTrained wish they'd gone with his concealed carry permit with a gun\nYou had another horrible incident in America\nNow that happens I don't for the life of me know how anybody can say good guys and good gals

and let's pray he recovers from his injuries what a brave man thank you sir\nYou're a hero but bring it back to Pittsburgh why wasn't there armed security bring it back to Pittsburgh why wasn't there an armed security guard in that seem to bring it back to Pittsburgh let me go to Ted Ted's thank you for hanging on\nA day off from Joe thanks for taking my call\n... take it away\nWell see what I'm a I lead a congregation of a Jewish and junk help people who are believed Jesus of asylum sort of Jewish Christian and a\nSmall place you know in the Chicago area and the first thing I Want to say is is that it's probably book politically incorrect but uh\nIf you want to understand what happened last week and all of those incidents was ... years go back and you ... three or ... I Hope that there are so upset with all your listeners read that but the other thing is I just from my life but life to me I Can't understand how the leadership of a place like that and it's the same thing happened to the church\nIn Texas for twenty six people were slaughtered yeah that you could not have a security plan and I I I remember presented to my board five years ago and I said what are you going to do with a guy comes in with a rifle you go through a Bible that um I mean that's not gonna work we know that\nYou're gonna wait for the police come God Bless the leash a yeah we pray for him every week yeah my place but\nThat's the word target and we're a target I think you should be ready to do something about it and so we just trained that people get training you know good very good training thorough training but we had people from the police departments around here volunteer\nTo call them who were trained in anti terrorism and they came when they trained us\nTen you do ... what do you do now in your place of worship well to not give away\nHe said yeah we just we have people one we cut down a lot of trees outside so that we actually oh we have a great vision of ... you can see everything coming right you have a person's stationed there all the time watching and we had several people trained and\nAre are good you know God Bless you it's sad but it's true\nNo I have said thank you thanks for waiting and thanks for calling for the life of me I don't know why we all don't do that look um we live in an open society\nThere are people who hate they're evil people bad people sick people\nWere not getting rid of our guns that's never going to happen in that never should happen in America so the country's gotta decide as Ted said the police do the best they can but why why doesn't every church and every synagogue and every mosque\nAsk people in those places of worship trained and armed to protect people same question we ask about our schools\nWhy don't we have trained and armed adults in our schools if we want to protect our children I I get and I understand how there are synagogues and churches that simply can't bear the cost of an armed security guard I get that well then people in the congregation should be trained and armed\nLet's protect ourselves less protect ourselves\nThere's no other reform and what happens Saturday you Wayne stop it\nSo outside of keeping our eyes and ears open and ... watching and waiting for the red flags and then reporting the red flags the only thing that we can do the as individuals in a free society doggone it is to be our first line of defense and defend ourselves\n\nNot a security guard we defend ourselves can't\nCan't depend on the police they do the best they can we've got to defend ourselves\nIn our churches and in our semi guy central\nFalls\nWealth said my friend Patrick wells said thank you I'm I'm just and I'll close on this and we'll move on I'm I'm just so\nTired of\nIncidents like what happened in Pittsburgh doesn't have to be this way doesn't have to happen this way look ... you've got if you've got an evil white guy who\nIs dead set on killing black people it's awful hard to stop them if you've got an evil black guy intent upon killing white people look in a free society hard to stop them if you've got an evil anti Semite intent\nUpon killing a bunch of Jews look in an open free society is damned tough to stop at the end of the day all we've got these us\nYou can't you can't put a police officer on every block you can't put a police officer and every church in every synagogue in every school in every library we can't do\nThat can't do that\nSo what are you going to do just going to wait until it happens again what are you going to do\nAre you going to prepare her there was a time and there was a day in America\nWhere this was not such a y wild way out there kind of an idea you're going to church on Sunday yeah they're going to be people sitting in those views who are packing and they know how to use those guns that that that used to be America back in a day\nNow it's like ooh that's a weird idea notes that no it's not at all\n\nI Love to say it and they'll close by saying it again I Love to say it because it is the ultimate truth and I love to say it because I Love to put this\nOut there in front of all those lives and all those people on the left who
