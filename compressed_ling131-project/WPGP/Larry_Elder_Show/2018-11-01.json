want to be honest right both sides do with\nTrump's doing it look Trump's making a big deal about the caravan because he wants it to help Republicans next week\nDemocrats are making a big deal about the pipe bomber and the synagogue shooter to help them next week I'm Sorry to be ... political and I can't be partisan right now because both sides do it\nI'm hoping you're smart enough to understand that\nSo when Donald Trump talks about all the bad people in the caravan he's trying to scare you but you know what you know what okay that's true but this is true to\nNobody should be able to come into this country illegally I don't care if you're marching with ten people or ten thousand\nPeople you need to be stopped you need to be stopped\nSo yeah there may be some politicizing going on with this caravan that's true but this caravan needs to be stopped in this country needs to get damp serious about our borders finally\nShow when President Trump comes out today and says you know what we may be up to Fifteen thousand troops at the border good whatever it takes\nFive thousand Fifteen thousand a hundred and fifty thousand however many troops it takes\nTo defend that border let's be clear people look at this caravan from different vantage points with different glasses or\nSome people see a bunch of poor desperate\nWomen and children who just want a better life\nI I see fourteen thousand people\nAre trying to march in to my front door illegally men women children doesn't matter you talk to these people are ... in this caravan you listen to what they have to say\nThey got every damn intention of just walking right into our country they there is a there's a sense of entitlement like I deserved to be in America I'm coming to America for a better life I yeah I I don't care what Trump says it sucks back home or going to go live in America sorry no\nHowever many troops it takes to keep these people out\nTrump today\nMay deployed Fifteen thousand servicemembers down on our border\nFive thousand ten thousand Fifteen thousand whatever it takes the president said ah he went out and said again and he said this before I'm Glad he's saying this I Hope he means it Donald Trump today nobody is coming in we're not allowing people to come in\nNow I don't care why Trump says that\nI don't care if Trump says that because he's trying to get votes I don't care if Trump says that because it sounds tough I don't care why Trump said nobody is coming in we're not allowing people to come in and I don't care why Trump said that it's the right thing to say and I hope he means\nIt I Hope he means that\nThese folks these people are not going to be here by election day you now know that right\nThere probably still two three weeks away\nAnd we don't know how many are going to come to the border we don't know how many will make it to our border but it's clear these folks these folks want to get here okay they've been offered every thing to say stay in Mexico and find refuge in Mexico they have no interest in that\nThey have no interest in that and enough with this baloney that the left keeps putting out\nThat out at least fourteen thousand people they're all

kidnappers balance are part of this fourteen thousand\nPregnant women and children\nYou know ... you got to get serious\nI'll give Trump credit politics aside\nAnd I'm honest enough to admit it's a little bit of both he's trying to scare people how ... got a good issue there is a caravan bungee illegals trying to get into our country if that doesn't rile up Trump's base nothing will so he's taken advantage of the jury is but you know what\nI'll give him credit because he's saying the right things put everything else aside\nAnd just be very clear and objective about what is approaching America tend to fourteen thousand people\nWho are trying to walk right through our front door\nPeople like Jose from Honduras a felon a murderer wants to come right into America seek asylum\n\nI don't care about the timing and I don't care about the politics\nThe right thing is to keep them out we have to keep them out and when this mid term comes and goes President Trump better continue sane what

right they typically walk across our border they raise the right hand and they they claim asylum well there's nothing saying we have to let them take\nThat step and come into this country I'll be the first to admit that ah\nI don't expect the Trump Administration to do that\n... a Trump was on with what Laura Ingraham last night on Fox and he was talking about sent setting up tent cities to house these people in America\nHe says that one moment in any says we're not letting him in the next so I don't exactly know where he is but I Do know this ah there'd be nothing wrong with not letting them

on MSNBC um ... show\nLook at me I'm the political editor for the Washington Post I'm In light and\nAnd then along comes Trump and Trump just wax 'em upside the head or John Stewart I'm former still comedian ... had had his show I'm On a few years back he\nTalked about this last night he was being interviewed by I think Christine I'm I'm\nI'm On the on the on the poor I'm among the poor\nAre and ah she asked John Stewart about how Trump handles the media and why Donald Trump is able to show easily get under their skin here's what John Stewart said give me Stuart\nThere personally wounded and offended by this man he ... them and they dive in and what he's done well I thought is appealed to their own or ... to their own ego\nBecause what he says these are the ... and the journalist Adam say we are noble we're out of ... and they take it personally and now she's changed the conversation to\nNot that his policies are silly or not working or any of those other things it's all about the fight he's he's able to choose now\nEverything else and get people just focused on the flight\nAnd by the way John Stewart is a man of the left he's a lefty he's the live he hates Trump but listen what he said right there Trump's able to bathe him Trump's able to get inside their heads because they've got such he goes right\nThese people who work in the media they've got they've got such narcissism\nLook at me I'm so noble how dare\nYou Donald Trump talked to me like that I'm the White House reporter for CNBC how dare you talk to me like that\nTrump hits them over their head and knocks them down because they're so narcissistic and I'll be the first one to admit Donald Trump is a narcissistic like nobody else you and I know that\nBut these people in the media tried to hide the fact that that's what they are as well\nThey've always been conditioned to believe these people in the media that they can say things and never be questioned\nEspecially by politicians elected officials no no I work in the media it's my job to question you man you can't ask me questions and then they get to a pie and just say what they want always on checked\nWhat is Trump done Trump's brought them down to his level by fighting them and you know most people in the media don't like to get their hands dirty they don't like to get down and dirty that's not who they are right\nThey live in their high rise apartments in ... they're whining endure above it all remember 'cause they're smarter than you\nAre there more enlightened than you they're different they're better than you\nAgain no reflection on who Trump is Trump has decided I'm just going to punch them I'm going to fight them\nAnd that's what he's forced them to do\nThere so we used to getting away with whatever they said Don Lemon last night did it again said something that went on question or or on an unquestioned in an exam in last night he has since been\nPounded upside the head by all of us out here for what Don Lemon said because he said it pretty racist thing but again\nYou can get away with it ordinarily you can get away with it people in the media have always gotten away with what they've said Don Lemon\nAnd with Chris calm on CNN they're talking about\nUh the caravan or the brown folk and the black folk part of the caravan coming up and Don Lemon doesn't like the fact that we're demonizing the people in this caravan they're not the problem we shouldn't demonize people that's what Don Lemon says he says we shouldn't demonize\nPeople and then down lemon last night said\nThis gimme lemon number one\nAt the stop demonizing people and realized with biggest terror threats in this country is white man most of them are radicalized ... up to the right\nWe can't demonize people and then he proceeds to demonize white men Devon play that again\nI have to stop demonizing people and realized the biggest terror threats in this country is white men most of them radicalized for up to the right\nYou imagine tried to uh if somebody on Fox News said the biggest problem in America's black man black men are the problem in America\nI can tell you that if somebody on Fox News\nOr any other network said that black men are the biggest problem in America I can tell you that that that uh that talking head would be out of the job\nYou understand that right black men are the problem we got to be afraid of black men\nBut there Don Lemon can say that white men are the problem in America\nWhite men not these people in the caravan you've got nothing to worry about Jose in any other uh felons in that caravan they're not the problem the problem is white men\nAnd see here's the media point nobody none of his peers has called him up or questioned him\nI I Know if I said on the radio right now black men the biggest problem we gotten America right now is black men or I Would be called a racist in every name you can imagine\nBut you can say that about white men and you're just fine he uh time you're on what Joe Walsh\nYeah Jo she said on CNN that we can't demonize people then he turns around and he demonized\n[laughter] yeah and you know what's funny Tom when you watch it he didn't even realize what he did\nIt was it was totally a ignorant yeah and especially okay we can't demonize people so I'm going to make a statement and demonize people\nI'm going to demonize people without lynching without even up cause I'm going to demonize people but I'm going to demonize white men\n'cause you can get away with that America's that's no big deal you can demonize white men you can demonize Christians you can generally demonize a white Christian men really easily\nBut there are certain people certain groups you can't demonize kitten immunized black man you can't demonize Muslims you get demonize gauge you can't demonize transgender\nBut every day every day it's open season on white man that's easy\nTo say whatever you want about white and I'm just I'm Joe\n[noise] fresh\nI I haven't seen evidence of that that people are literally dying all over America\n\nYou know the best ... maybe the best to things Trump is going for him it's Hillary Clinton Everytime Hillary speaks

arrested\nWay way way way way I think I've heard of this I'm towns out east whereas if you're over the age of Thirteen they don't let you trick or treating yet\nYou can either be arrested or find that sucks yeah that is going on around ... there's also a pig and going around saying that that they want to change the date of Halloween um she was the last Saturday in October instead of October thirty first in right now it's garnered about\nForty thousand signatures so people are trying to change the day what's the what's the rationale there do you know why I guess it's just easier or something where it's safer\nOr you know they're just trying to change the day but he will just trying to change things I guess has faith in the\nBay away your your your a lot younger than me I'm In my mid fifties you're like Nineteen or [laughter] what sure wink wink that judge when when you were a kid Halloween was still kind of fun what ...\nOh my gosh yes I totally loved Halloween I still love

kids would get ... and stuff like that and that was kind of call 'em or they have to look\nWe're polarized as a country\nUh and uh if you listen to me on a regular basis you know that I Believe we're going to be polarized for some time it's just the way it is\nI tweeted this uh this afternoon think about this if if you were ... and miss the if you're listening I Wanna I Wanna long discussion of this sometime maybe after the midterms\nBut if you took the United states as it is today\nAnd you were going to start over\nAnd you were going to start a country from scratch you with me you take the United states as it is today and you want to start over and you want us set out to form a country from scratch\nNo way on God's green earth would you make us all one country there's no freaking way\nWe'd be like three to four separate countries do you follow me like if you took us right now if you took the United states as it is right now and you said okay let's start over right now let's start over a ... form a country there's no way\nYou put us all in one country we'd be two three four or five different countries America's gotten too big and too diverse and we're just two different we no longer share a common founding\nPrincipal so we're going to be polarized for a long time ... it's not like the midterms are going to come and then all of a sudden we're going to be United again it's not like all of a sudden the twenty twenty elections going to come and we're going to be United again we're polarized and it's only going to get worse I'm\nSorry moms and dads this Halloween Night if you don't like the way things are politically in America right now I'm Sorry to tell you it's only going to get worse\nI Believe that but when you look at how polarized we are you look at our politics right now why why why why our politics wise politics so important\nWhy is politics such a big deal in our life why are we always fighting about politics right now\nJohn ... who I Love he's a libertarian free market libertarian he said hey you want to make politics less important shrink the state you with me\nYou want to make politics less important in America then shrink government wise

talking though the person that called and you're talking about racial issues and then we'll talk now the other but I was going to ask you one thing and that is a new election night CNN used the term white washing\nAnd then with Hillary Clinton yesterday of course making a joke and so there is the hypocrisy and made it but now with your current topic about how large government is yeah\nI think they just enforce the laws equally on politicians as they do on people that could go a long ways because right now there's definitely a double standard that permeates the legal\nSystem and so yeah that's causing a lot of problems out there I guess I'll be quiet and listen to what you have to say\nNo Ken that's a great point man thank you this Halloween for bringing it up that's a great point a an an absolute double standard\nUh like\nSo much [laughter] in our in our lives and it it feels to me like most of what I talk about every night is the elucidate in bringing up double standard look I

this\nA Wednesday thank you for listening follow me on Twitter out Walsh freedom or we are about four days or so removed from that horrible act of evil at that synagogue in Pittsburgh\nTo discuss that event I'm joined by Dr Michael Brown he's the founder and president of fire school ministry in\nConcord North Carolina He's also the host of the daily nationally syndicated talk radio show the line of fire\nHe's the author or more than thirty books including our hands are stained with blood the tragic story of the church in the Jewish people he's a national and international speaker on\nThemes of spiritual renewal and cultural reformation ducked Ron I appreciate you taking some time I'd like to start with kind of a broad question when you first heard of what happened in Pittsburgh just a few\nDays ago what ... what were your first thoughts\nWell of course you have a shock you know we heard of the shooting she'll churches we've heard this should go to school so it's all it's tragic but this was different because it was a synagogue especially that had that happen on this level before in all of American history\nAmerica has been very very friendly to the Jewish people\nOf that like this was a precedent to hear\nThat the guy shouted all cheers last July\nIt's strictly here we go again I just read an article a few days previous to that talking about Louis Farrakhan like you know she used the term lights what do you do with termites you exterminate the J shut the parasites that that's what they were locked the journal whether the term like and and for a Jewish person I'm a Jewish follower of chief just\nYou know that even though this was an unprecedented act of a Jewish bloodshed and alerted the worst we've seen it's always right by the surface in other words you feel like here we go again it's always ready to manifest its ugly head\nWell and actually a doctor brown and I'm so glad you said that because I read a piece you wrote\nA entitled when Jewish blood shed in seeing the guy and the one line in that piece that I still can't get out of my head as you wrote anti Semitism is never far away\nYeah and here's what's remarkable ... I've done the lectures on college campuses Gail Columbia other places with students faculty there and cut them to maybe resist layer repeatedly and and I explained look ... about just the world's longest hatred it's the world's most irrational hatred\nIt's the world's most widespread hatred it's the world's most violent hatred and and what other hatred you have over ... three hungry ears documented proof Greco Roman times ... specifically have this huge\nGo back to cook her best during the Bible puts like twenty five hundred years yeah you have it in Islam you've had it in Christianity\nYou have it in atheism you you have it in fashion you having all these different groups you have black supremacy white supremacist what they agreed on is Adolf Hitler was a great land and the Jews are equal so it's always choose what we Jews are rich they're evil when we choose to pour their evil\nWhen the Jews are in control their take over the world when the Jews are being exterminated they try to take over the world it's a rational it's ultimately demonic it comes through people but it would it defies destruction and like I said like repeating it's never far Kurdish her ...\nAnd Dr Brawley why is that I'm a Catholic kid I'm married to a lovely Jewish woman\nWhy is that hatred for Jews why is it had been there for so long why why is it so I'm the president\nYeah I I've been through the various explanations why chief scapegoat if the economic explanation political explanation to me at all Charlie has a spiritual explanation\nThat dog shows the Jewish people and through the Jewish people triggering redemption through the world through Moses through the profits ultimately treat Jesus do the less it spreads out of the Jewish apostles\nAnd there is a malignant evil force called say Jim Justice they're human evil their spiritual evil\nAnd she hates the Jewish people Jesus himself was Jewish if off for for profit church Jewish\n... is the Jewish people that brought the left Egypt the one to go to the world the Jewish people that brought the lessons at the ten commandments should ultimate authority ... and ultimately the message of salvation and that is hated by the devil and those are the lectures I gave it places like Yale Columbia and no one had a better explanation\nDr Michael Brown he is widely considered to be the world's most for most messianic Jewish apologist you said something a few minutes ago Dr brown that that jumps out at me and you write a black supremacist in white supremacist oddly\nA unite on this hatred of juice that's incredible\nYeah and in my book our hands ... which came out like Ninety two and it's been continuously imprint\nEver since and translated into more languages than in any book that I wrote I get quotes from every different side I I mean if you could you could change the hot the layers say go to the middle east now it'll change for the PLO to the Palestinian authority how you know for this group that the loss or whatever\nIt changed the players ... change the black ... white supremacists that generation it's the same rhetoric\nThe satellite I just got an email today\nFor the Christian political leader of North Carolina\nAnd she said how do I respond to this I Wish that this and it's about all the ... the lord and how to choose one kill all gentile I said this is Laurie ignore the person or the ... the website but it's the same stuff being on we cycled and all you need\nIs a little fuel for the fire\nAll you need is say a major Jewish leader over banks and that's the truth that Jews control all the money in the world you have a little scandal and the Vatican their shows are rational as it is so it's the stabilize recycled generation after generation\nAnd yet you said and I agree historically the United states of America has been somewhat of a safe haven for Jews has an\nYes in fact there's the famous letter from a synagogue in Connecticut\nCharles synagogue the leaders wrote to George, Washington at Seventeen Ninety it's after the revolution where now a nation and they just wanted to do I mean what's gonna happen to the gym and he said our country is not tolerate bigotry and it's not going to tolerate persecution or religion\nAnd he said the stock of Abraham made the children of Abraham live long and prosper here that's been his tone that's been sad so I Believe it's because America has had some strong Christian traditions\nOf the founders even look to America to be kind of a new Israel Seattle there was a steam for that a president John Adams had great admiration and respect for the Jewish people into the influence they've had for good worldwide is totally disproportionate just somehow there's been a ... and\n... and I believe it's one reason to ox had learned she had us with all of our failings just that we have been a friend of Israel Harry Truman\nShow up for Israel recognized it was the right thing to do even though it went against the grain of many of his his colleagues and advisors so we've had a good history there and yet there has been bloodshed there is anti Semitism\nBut many leaders like Dennis ... Shapiro who's Jewish leaders they shouted out that a country where so many Jews live this has been the friendliest gentile country\nFor large community of Jews in world history\nThey Dr Braun last question and I appreciate your time because I Know you're a busy man the future or do you anticipate things getting better or worse\nEye anticipates him getting worse in the last Christian leaders lead the way and standing clearly against these things unless they open their mouths I Believe what the device ... politics of the day with with the sides being taken in more graphic form where anti Semitism is just more in with the all\nRight well I think that will the President Trump has clearly spoken against each day and she's the first president have Jewish children Jewish and you're an shoulder\nSo that's major he's been a friend of Israel but forces that hate Jews are rising and the water sexual really make a difference I Believe are Christian leaders across the country though raised their voices and denounce anti Semitism and say we stand with a Jewish people in Israel and she will get better if it's gonna get worse [noise]\nDr Michael Brown he's a boy he's the host of the daily nationally syndicated talk radio showed the line of fire a fascinating sure keep doing what you do I I really appreciate you taking some time [noise]\nMy my joy thank you for what have you as well thank you\n[noise]\nBecause Israel is like this little tiny speck of good in a sea of of Islamic evil in that part of the world I did that philosophically because Israel is generally a free open prosperous country\n\nBut I also did what I did when I was in Congress being a very vocal supporter of Israel because I recognized that that's not what we had in the White House in Morocco bum\nAnd it was important to me almost every week to let Israel now let America still stood with her even if the president and us in\n\nThe United States Congress still stands with you Israel even if the guy in the White House doesn't and when I was there and Netanyahu came and spoke a at a joint session of Congress that was one of my greatest thrills\nWish to hear him speak in that chamber\nFive five six for two fifty six hundred eight five five six for two fifty six hundred it would be great one day to retire\nAnd die when I'm an old old man in Israel I Would have to talk to my Jewish wife into doing that I Would have to talk my Jewish wife into\nA living that far away from hopefully what will be grand children one day\n\nA man if you've never been there if you've never been to a beautiful Israel\nOr you're missing now\nIt is a once in a lifetime experience Christian or Jew really citizen of the world really citizen of or member of any religion that sacred ground\nUpon which it seems like the major religions over the world were born it's a special place Israel is\nEight five five six for two fifty six on for them to walk [noise] it is a Wednesday's Halloween things you so
