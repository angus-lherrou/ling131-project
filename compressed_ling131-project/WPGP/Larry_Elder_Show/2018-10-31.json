through on his pledge to place the military on the border to stop it because McConnell what percentage thought that Mexico will stop the caravan before it reaches our border\nYou're a Tea Party or you're a you're a Republican you're on the right in today's political world here's our problem\nThose of you who think like I Do and in today's political jargon I'm a conservative here's our problem the other side gets to create the narratives the other side has a monopoly on the media the left does\nThe other side the laugh they've got a monopoly on academia they've got a monopoly on popular culture they've got a monopoly in Hollywood they've got a monopoly when it comes to late night comedians all of that all of popular culture and the media\nIs pretty much all of its social media Facebook and Twitter and all the rest it's owned by the left\nIt's run by people on the left\nAnd they get to create the narrative they get\nTo tell the country well here's what happened and this is what it means\nAnd see the problem is one side typically traditionally one side in America gets to create that narrative not my side and I'm not whining and I'm not complaining conservatives zone talk radio conservatives have Fox News in a number of other outlets\nAnd I get that in the year twenty Eighteen right man we got we got to ... billion different websites and podcast and there's alternative media I get all of that but still\nThe main line the mainstream media the legacy media all the newspapers all of network TV all of the major news stations all of the comedians all of Hollywood all of academia all of the writers they're all on the left\nAnd they get to tell the country seemingly all the time\nHere's what happened and here's what it means and you and I have to fight back against it so you look at what happened last week you look at that bad terrible horrible week that ended with that bad horrible terrible evil shooting at the synagogue in Pittsburgh\nYou know what happened we talked last night about what happened and I'm not going to revisit the what happened in part of this what does it mean what does it mean well if you've been paying attention to what the media\nHas been saying these last couple of days if you've been paying attention at all to what popular culture has been saying about what that synagogue shooting and the pipe bomber and that guy in Louisville, Kentucky what it all means is\nThe narrative out there now thanks to the left thanks to people on the left the narrative is that people on the right hates and\nPeople on the right to kill and it's only on the right it's only on the right eye or you don't have to do this 'cause you gotta life thank God you have a life you got a family that job\nYou you you pay attention as best as you can my pre shake that in that respect that\nBut as part of part of my job here I got to pay attention to all of it\nAnd I can tell you that ever since that synagogues shooting a narrative the narrative created is there's a bunch of hate in this country and it's fostered by the right and the best or is on the right and it is the sold the meaning of the right\nOnly on the right do another right wing hater another right wing\nAnti Semitic see all of this hate on the right it's all they'd been talking about for two days\nIt's all they talked about after the shooting that's all they talked about yesterday Sunday it's all they talked about Monday and they're still talking about it today as President Trump and millennia visit\nPittsburgh the protestors out there protesting the president's visit to Pittsburgh but the last few days\n\nI look I I I push back against it the other people and talk radio push back against that Fox News push back the conservative media\nPushes back against it but my friends right most of America doesn't get their news from Fox News most of America doesn't listen to the Joe Walsh show most of America is still getting\nNews from shore says on the left the ABCs the NBC's The CNN the MSN B c's all of the newspapers that comedians\n\nAnd they're all chime in together to say\nWe have a problem in this country there's too much ... and it's all on the right and I think\nThis Tuesday it is so freaking\nIncumbent upon us\nTo push back against this narrative I feel like so much of a big part of what I Do on this radio show is push back against all these leftist narratives\nAny time something happens and then the left because they got the big megaphone they got the biggest megaphone and they explained to the country what it means what it means like like guns are bad we got to get ready to guns it is a combatant upon us to push back\nAgainst these narratives as hard as strongly as we can\n\nDon Lemon ah he's a a a live he's a lefty on CNN last night he penalized\nThis creation of the narrative there's something different about people on the right there at yeah you know what maybe there's have I guess with everybody but only people on the right to kill people there's something different\nAbout the right this narrative that Lehman actually pushed this last night\nDon Lemon actually said last night and make the made the point last night that well it's only Republicans who killed people it's only right wing or to kill people Democrats don't kill people hey dad gimme lemon number three\nThis guy has a right wing or who kill the people in the synagogue very I'm very right wing or sent 'em bombs to CNN and to Democrats [noise] I don't see Democrats\nKilling people\nNow um\nThat's just kind of stupid\nIn that's a stupid thing to say like right now\nAnd and a to point out how stupid that is in fact they have and I loved that can you give me that again a limited number three from last night\nThis guy is a right wing or who killed the people in the synagogue very um ... right wing or sent 'em bombs to CNN and to Democrats [noise] I don't seem Democrats killing people\nI don't see Democrats killing people\n\nDown lemon on CNN a ... and he's not alone you need to know that most of what I've heard the last few days since that synagogue killing\n... was pretty much this variations of this it's only the people on the right there are killing people\n\nNow if you are scratching your\nHead right now if you're rubbing your eyes right now if you're about to pull off the road right now because Don Lemon said that last night\nUh\nNot even a year after a ... a Democrat a hard core lefty a took a gun a firearm\nTo a Republican congressional baseball practice and proceeded to try to kill\nKill a bunch of Republican members of Congress that ... just stop for a minute now\nI I don't know Don Lemon I've been on a show a few times I don't know if he's a real dummy that's dumps\nStupid thing to say you you'd think before Don Lemon said something like that you'd think as he's like halfway through making that point I don't see Democrats killing people I don't see Democrats killing people you'd think somebody got shot body is getting a whisper into his\nHis earpiece excuse me Mr ... congressmen Steve ...\nOh yeah\nCongressman Steve ... screws lucky to be alive\nHe was shot by a Democrat\nHe was shot by a leftist an angry left is\n\nAnd there's a list beyond that\nBut to say something like that in a year after\nYou got what happened on that congressional baseball field in to say that I don't see Democrats\nKilling people [noise]\n\nPresident Trump and radicalized more people than an ISIS\nYes and and you just look at this ... this ... this political op\nUh the agenda uh it it just it it's absolutely it's just ... and ... and you know I I just I just pray that that\nThat conservatives Republicans whatever you want to call your stuff you get out and you and your vote this was the most important one week and the most important mid term of our of our life and we have a president that is Bill Bill promises and we need to support this right agenda\nHey mark a well set all good call man do it again you ought to call again\nThere said on the right in the left why is that so hard to say\nWhy is that so difficult to say\nOur problem is those of us on the right every day we're bombarded by the the left this narrative that day there's only on the right we got to push back against this [noise]\nEvery single day\nTo push back against this\n\n[noise]\nIt's time to check more freedom

brought this up to date because the Republicans are really close to losing the house of representatives and he's trying to get Republicans out to vote he's not gonna gonna um our law birthright citizenship via an executive order he's\nNot going to do that he just said he was to get you out to vote to get his supporters all wound up love ya love your show but this is a political stunt and oh by the way if Donald Trump tomorrow I tried to outlaw birthright citizenship via an executive order\nA about a minute after he did it he'd be taken to court\nAnd it would take probably a couple of years to ... work its way all the way up\nTo the United States Supreme court show we would go into effect until ... depending on what the Supreme Court said he can't outlaw birthright citizenship and I am no fan of birth right citizenship\nBut Trump can't outlaw be an executive order I I just think I I think you need to be smart both ... and everything that Trump saying right now and everything the Democrats are saying right now\nYou can't believe them because it's all about the midterms they're trying to blow smoke up here you know what because they want you out to vote so they're throwing their supporters what they want to hear\nYou want to have a serious discussion will we audio because the whole concept of birthright citizenship is really problematic it's not and you can ignore 'em ... they all work together and and they dominate our schools the left dies they dominate the media the left\nDoes they dominate big business they dominate popular culture and they work together and they create the narrative they tell us the lane which people can use in the language people can't use the same dictate the rules and ever since last week the horrible stuff that happened last week\nThey had been working overtime to try to get the whole country to believe\nThat there is only hate on the right and oh by the way right if I'm rapping Trump upside the head for a political stunt today bringing up birthright citizenship that's what it is look the media is doing the same damn thing the media wants to Democrats to win\nMidterms the media watch the Democrats to take back the house\nThe media watch the Democrats take back the Senate so they're going to put out the crap that will help that happen and the narrative they went out they went out there is a there is hate in the country and it's all created by Donald Trump period that's their message\nThat's their talking points that's what they're putting out and they look America\n... maybe before the weeks out will have a discussion on birthright citizenship I don't want to do it today 'cause this was just a stunt and I don't want to reward the president forced on but what look ... you want you want to change birthright citizenship in this country and I would like to\nYou're only going to do it constitutionally you're only going to do it by by a constitutional amendment if Congress passed a law next month\nOutlawing birthright citizenship would immediately go to court that law would not go into effect this has gotta and we'll work its way back up to the Supreme Court again but I Would encourage everybody to study the fourteenth amendment and I would encourage everybody\nTo learn the history of the fourteenth amendment Hey Mike take it away\nAll right brother I got two points actually called

simpler time you did too\n\nAnd here I go again right sounding like an old fart here I go against sounding like my dad but I grew up when boys were boys and girls were girls\nIt really was that simple it was that basic it was that easy\nBoys were boys and girls were girls you look at that now talking about taking the fun out of everything we we've we've taken a fallen out of in the name of

areas but you can't tell me it's all good\n... and you can't tell me that you just can't you can't tell me that sixty three different genders is a good thing\nYou just can't do that you can't tell me that\n\nBanning I I mean banning almost every Halloween costume in the name of political correctness show is that to offend people you can't tell me that's a good thing\nI mean bringing it back to Halloween what I told my wife or the other day that you know kids today are are there going to every kid is going to have to be like dress up like a a potato\nOr you can only dress up as like plants or vegetables\nBecause you can't you can't be people anymore you can't be like\nA a maniac killer or or the Lone Ranger you can't be a cowboy anymore 'cause that's insulting the Indians you can't be an Indian 'cause that's insulting the Indians ah you can't be scary figure a with blood coming down your face because that's like too violent\n\nAnd on and on and it goes you can't you can't you are aware of big some railroad cars that will be offensive to Latinos\n\nYou can't dress up as an NFL football player\n'cause that might offend everybody who wanted to be an NFL football player and couldn't wasn't good enough\nShow we've reached a point in America where how about everybody just be a potato ... who would that affect how about everybody just be a head of broccoli\nEvery kid should be broccoli for Halloween\nI'm trying to think of who that might offend\n\nMm and vegetables\nI don't think you could be fruit because that might offend certain people because the word fruit\nStill has negative connotations when you talk about certain folks in the world today so I again I don't know that you can go down the road I I don't think you can be a grapefruit or an orange maybe maybe just a vegetable maybe I'll buy that every child from here on out as a potato for Halloween [noise]\nI'm Irish that that would be\nThe one you're\nMakes sense Joseph cookies or senior dairy analyst or

to image is threatening\nA ... other countries by a enacting tear up\nWhen I don't know that Trump fully realized that he did literally enact terrorists\nUm and I get the argument that uh some of these countries treat us unfairly and ... and and what are you can do about that I\nUnderstand that most all of us generally believe in free trade because everybody benefits from free trade every American consumer pays less for everything they buy because of free trade\nAnd and I want you all the no we're not going back to the world where\nA a a you know we're building we're going to build
