Kavanaugh everybody\nI'll tell you what this issue I I don't like to listen to either side on this issue I don't want to listen to either side I just want you know what I Want the FBI just to do their stuff I Want the FBI to be done in two to three to four days and I want to vote on the floor of the United States Senate on friday I Want this done\n\nI Wish I could tell you what the FBI is doing right now found out a couple of hours ago that there are still interviewing mark judge allegedly the guy that was in the room thirty five years ago who knows\n\nThe White House is all over the map on this Senate Republicans are all over the map on this Senate Democrats are ridiculous they put a list of about twenty four people that they are insisting the FBI interview\nI don't care what the Democrats say they're done as far as I'm concerned\nThe Democrat stopped speaking last week they got their wish\nThey got their bone baby they got their FBI investigation now as far as I'm concerned the Democrats need to just shut the hack up and let the FBI do their work I Wish is well the Republicans would shut up to I Wish everybody would\n\nBut we can't you go on Facebook you go on Twitter everybody knows everything\nEverybody for sure knows everything\nDr Blasey Ford is a Democrat tool she's a fake she's a liar\nOr she is a heroin\nBrett Kavanaugh does not have the temperament to be on the Supreme Court\n\nOr he is mean pilloried in screwed like no nominees the Supreme Court has ever done in bed and been subjected to before\nYou decide we've we've we've drawn lines right we all decided we're we stand on Brett Kavanaugh\nAnd where we stand today is the FBI is doing their work they began\nA speaking to people over the weekend when the order came down on friday afternoon for the FBI to investigate the FBI began investigating friday afternoon that's how the FBI does things\nAnd that's what they're doing\nAnd there is confusion about again the scope\n\nMember of the uh the order on friday was current incredible allegations well is that is that a\nIs that just Dr Ford is that Dr Ford and and ah this woman named ... is that Dr Ford Gonzales and this woman named sweat Nick and again I got to be honest President Trump's all over the map on this man he let it ripped today\nHe announced his new NAFTA it's pretty much pretty damn close to the old NAFTA will get into that later but he was asked a bunch of questions at a press conference about Kavanaugh\nAnd he said a lot of what he's already said about Brett Kavanaugh\n\nBut I'll tell you what I I think I can say this word on the radio diarrhea can I say that Devon diarrhea\nI think I can say diary on the radio Donald Trump sometimes he just can't help himself he's got a little diary of their mouth and and he just he he talked about how maybe Brett Kavanaugh I you know poor guy maybe in high school and college he did drink too much\nUh he talked about maybe that oh sure go ahead and look at the ... the the ... the third woman in her allegations Trump was all over the map today talking about Brett Kavanaugh I don't think that's helpful\n\nThis FBI investigation should be limited\nPeriod\nIt should lash this week and that one day more Mitch McConnell\nAnd my a majority leader Mitch McConnell\nOn the floor of the Senate today said we're voting I'm Brett Kavanaugh of this week\nHe'd better they'd better\nBut see you're not going to know when we're not going to know and I hope you understand how this works the FBI is actively interviewing people\nRight now\nAnd there's confusion nowaday interviewing Brett Kavanaugh we don't know are they interviewing doctor for we don't know\n\nThe FBI is got to determine within their within their scope within what their broad mandate is who they are going to interview within that\nAnd then it's up to them\nAnd the Republicans and Democrats don't have to know and shouldn't know when you and I should know\n\nBut I get really tired of every buddy\nBree tending their the expert on this topic like a Rachel Mitchell she was the prosecutor member of the woman from Arizona who ask the questions of Dr Ford\nAnd Brett Kavanaugh during the hearing on Thursday well she asked Dr Ford the questions and then she started to ask a Brett Kavanaugh questions and Lindsey Graham and the rest of the Republicans in the Senate did really wandering asking any more questions so they started to do their\nOwn talking But Rachel Mitchell over the weekend put out a five page memo\nHer report\nUm that she gave to the Republican members of the Judiciary Committee five page report and we'll get into this too but she makes clear\nThis isn't even a he said she said\nA Rachel metro who's the prosecutor said there's no way I Would have prosecuted this case\nThis is not even a he said she said this is weaker than a he said she said\n\nAnd right away the Republicans and end all conservatives on Facebook and Twitter jumped on that she\n\nRachel Michel ...\nLooked at that that was a report that she gave me the Republicans\nShe didn't she didn't interview a Brett Kavanaugh\nThere are a lot of problems with that that will get into but everybody sees what they want to see and here's how I'm going to handle this week 'cause I can\nGuarantee you this will be the biggest story of the week again until this Brett Kavanaugh mess is put to bed this is gonna be the biggest political story in the country\nAnd I'm going to kind of handle it like I handled the Russia investigation okay I'm going to wait I Want this thing over all I Want is for this thing to be over I'm no longer listening to what any Republican or Democrat Senator has to say it's all this is a political football now\nI'm not listening to any a conservative on Twitter or Facebook or any liberal on Twitter or Facebook\nEverybody has picked their side\nAnd there were only reading about\nAnd following things that add bands what they believe in\nI ... I Believe Cavanaugh I don't believe forward or I Believe forward I don't believe cabinet and even this report that the prosecutor Rachel Mitchell poured out Republicans are holding this up like this proves Brett Kavanaugh's innocence Democrats are saying no wait a minute\nWait a minute that's a political document too\nSo I'm just going to keep my nose out of all of it\nI Want Brett Kavanaugh confirmed and by the way I think this is advice that you all we all would be well advised to take I Want Kavanaugh confirmed I Want that vote to happen by the end of the week\n\nI Believe most everything of what I hear this week is going to be a bunch of garbage on both sides because both sides are kind of positioning themselves\nFor this vote\nAnd Democrats do want to delay this thing they want to continue to delay this thing beyond the week that ain't happening\n\nI'm not I'm not paying attention to any of that and I'm not going to weigh in on what the FBI is doing I'm going to let the FBI do their job\n\nGive their report to the White House [noise]\nAnd then vote on this man who has been through\nI'm Joel also going [noise]\nIs just so just to point um I I I think we're going to do that I think it's going to go through this week but I don't think Kavanaugh it's going to be confirmed everybody has made their mind up already this is all just a big show and such but I I completely agree with you I'm staying out of it I'm not going in and this week\nBut it's going to be so bad 'cause I really believe he's not going to get in on\nAnd it's just a shame and I I watched what our senator from Illinois I did that and yeah and and I want to move out of the state I'm so disgusted by Senator Durbin and it was appalling appalling what he did\nAnd you know Eddie I agree don't move out of Illinois because the Durban do move out of Illinois because of the taxes that's much better reason look don't I I I agree with that do everybody um don't let this week the last week there's nothing more\nThat we can do and as far as the Democrats go guys\nThey don't matter here please know that I Want to say this again\nThe FBI's gotta week this week\nAnd they're going to come back and it's going to we're either going to be where we were at the end of last week they're just going to confirm what the Senate told us or there might be something new and it's world where we are at the end of last week all the Republicans are going to vote for Kevin Oh we do not need a Democrat vote\nThe Democrats\nNo longer matter in this process if the FBI just confirms what we know we don't need them if the FBI finds out that Brett Kavanaugh has been lion as I said\nAnd I hope and pray that that's not going to be the case but if we find out who's been line he doesn't deserve to be on the Supreme Court anyway the Democrats don't matter I'm Jewell wants to go anywhere [noise]\n[noise]\nIt's time to check more freedom voicemail when you're saying about Joe\nJoe off over first

let me go to Roger Roger you're on with Joe Walsh\nJoe thanks for taking my call I I agree with your advice about getting on with your life but I took your advice last week and I knew this was coming

just pray for the best that this man gets confirmed\nAnd we get on with the country's business\nYeah Roger will said man well said my friend most everybody that I read over the weekend\nBelieved\nYou know you know the FBI does all the FBI does is they interview everybody the ... and again they interview people like a lot of people can't interview people I I knowledge that but they're going to interview everybody and they're going to file a little report and they're going to give it to the White House they're not going to draw any conclusions\nThere I can say we think Brett Kavanaugh is lying we think he's guilty we think that Dr Christine Ford made up the whole thing that's not what the FBI does they're going to say here's a report here's what Dr Ford said\nWhite stars it was not the American flag not even close just a big lack a red and then a white stripe in the middle and then a blue stripes and there were some white stars nobody knew what it was\nThe uh the commentary on social media was hilarious the color commentator I guess on TV he said I don't know what flag that is I don't know what country that comes from but I'm not I'm not I'm not putting my hand over my heart for that flag that's not the American flag it wasn't the American flag\nAbsolutely crazy the Green Bay Packers issued a statement today that said the banner used during Sundays pregame ceremony supplemented the three us flags on the roof of the stadium\nAnd the flag carried by the color guard on the field\nWe've used such displays from time to time in the past\nWhen other pre game elements take up a significant portion of the field the Green Bay Packers announced they will never ever ever use that flag again because the Green Bay Packers caught so much grief rightly and they should have\nAnd I guess there was like massive confusion that limbo feel nobody in the joint knew what this what this flag was people were trying to figure out what country this flag comes from cut it out I'm not just telling the Packers now I'm Talking to everybody\nIf you're gonna if you're going to have a flag has a big banner on your field during pre game ceremonies it had better be the American flag I'm so damn\nTired off I'm so tired of\nPeople show any interest in this country will flex simply\nBe like being embarrassed to be proud to be American it's like it's like I guarantee you the Packers\nDidn't want to offend anybody by using the real the actual American flag what what were they thinking it would be like I mean can you imagine an NFL game pregame ceremony and they uh they they unfurled Mexican flag or the French flag they'd be run out of town\nOr they should have been run out of town Green Bay should of\nFor what they did yesterday just crazy check it out it it it is a flag that is on recognizable\nLet me go to Jim Jim you're on the show\nJoe I agree completely with what your uh opening monologue was that ah there's nothing we can do about it\nThey just sit back for friday my only concern is that uh we still have left us each state uh hasn't better completely purged from the ranks and rank and file above the rank and file I think are good but I don't know about a hierarchy of the upper echelon and my concern is that\nSomething might be called like it did on ... with General Michael Flynn where the uh FBI findings were correct\nBut then they were a must represent to the public\nAnd he was hard to drive for something he didn't do\nA yeah let me ask you a question Jim you and I probably disagree on how extensive the deep state is Christopher Wray who now runs the FBI he's Trump's guy Trump picked Christopher Wray or do you trust Christopher Wray\nAt this point I don't know who to trust frankly ... he's the unknown to me uh I it's just a show me just say yes let's run out and we'll are judging by his actions\nGym that's actually probably a pretty good attitude look this is this is again why this is such a dangerous topic to talk about ... and you hear people on conservative talk radio and Fox News tell you\nThat the other witnesses that we're supposed to be at the party refuted what Dr Ford said in fact\nBrett Kavanaugh said under oath that the other witnesses refuted what Dr Ford said\nThat's not true every single witness has said I don't recall the party I don't remember that party I don't remember being there\nNow they may not be able to cooperate or story but none of them have refuted that none of them have said that party didn't happen\nNone of the witnesses said that all they've said is thirty five years ago I don't remember that party there is a big big difference isn't there between saying I don't recall the party and the party never happened\nNo no witnesses refuted what she said\nThere is no cooperation\nYet

today but there's no ... I I guess here's my my my issue [laughter] President Trump is called NAFTA the worst deal in the worst deal in history\nSee if you can follow this one so President Trump has called NAFTA the worst deal ever made in history\nSo today what President Trump did was he made a few teeny little tweaks to NAFTA changed its name and he called this the best deal in history\nAnd John gene by what a lot of people are saying and conservative media this is the greatest steel in the world when really all Donald Trump did was make minor tweaks to NAFTA trade agreement by the way that has needed up dating for a long long time\nIn before we get into the deal that Trump announced today\nThis is the bigger issue with me so many people have stopped thinking I saw this happen with Obama whatever Brock Obama said people just ruined and failed to their knees and borrowed and said you're the greatest my leader\n... leader leader lead me guide me you are the best\nPeople stopped thinking anything Obama said they believed they bought hook line and sinker and I criticize that you criticize that I made fun of that you made fun of that these past eight years when Obama was president\nAnything and everything he said his his supporters bought it makes me sad because there are too many people on our side doing the same damn thing\nDoing the same damn thing Trump comes out today and he says I just signed the greatest deal in\nHistory and a lot of people by it and believe it without even knowing what he did\nTrump comes out and says that and all of his supporters they get down on their knees and they bought when they swim without even understanding what Trump did today\nHe took in agreement that has needed updating for a while\nRight in agreement that Trump has said is the worst deal in history and all he did was kind of maybe short a little bit change I mean he didn't even change it he tweaked it a little bit so how do you get after a couple of minor tweaks and you change the name\nHow do you get from the worst deal in history to the best deal in history\nHow do you do that\nSee the problem is though Trump can say that at a press conference and all of them not get crowded they go you're the greatest\nOh my leader\nOr a few minor changes automobiles and by the way automobiles what Trump signed today is going to make it more expensive to make automobiles here\nWho get into that later but in order to qualify for zero terrorists bottle autos will have to have more of the manufacturing done by high paid workers a little tweak dairy Canada is going to have to accept a little bit more of American milk and dairy products\nCopyright candidate will extend determine the copyright part of NAFTA or from fifty years all the way up to Seventy years\nDispute resolution ah there's\nA provision in after that allows investors to challenge the decisions made by the government's ... as part of these trade agreements um those\nAre disputes will be resolved by a panel of a members from the three countries Mexico the United states and Canada and then a new name\nTrump just gave it a new name it what is it called now it's now called the helped me helped me helped me I'm going to find it it's now called the instead of NAFTA it's now the oh come on\n\nIt's now the uh the\nUnited States Mexico Canada agreement\nOr who's clock so he changed his name couple minor tweaks to NAFTA\nAnd ... and the name change and this is the greatest deal in history by the way if you liked NAFTA\nWell I guess you'll be okay with this new trade deal because it's pretty much NAFTA if you didn't like NAFTA if you thought NAFTA was a bad thing well then you're not gonna like Trump's new trade agreement\nBecause it's just a little bit worse than NAFTA and oh by the way a none of this will go into effect if it does go into effect until twenty twenty because Congress has to approve this in Congress by the way the legislative the legislatures and all three countries have to prove these minor tweaks\nCongress won't even look at this till next year I just worry so much that we have people who\nFall in love with an door\nWorship politicians be they Reagan Bush or Obama or Trump\nAnd they just stop thinking\nI'd be willing to wager and in fact I Will wager most everybody listening to me right now has no idea uh how Trump today changed NAFTA\nYou may be saw the headlines that Trump Trump makes ... makes a big deal\nTrump shines new trade deals with Canada and Mexico best deal ever many of you probably have seen the headline like that and you don't know at all what was done today I I Would advise you and suggest that you do look into it\nBecause it's pretty much NAFTA let me go to my friend Sean taken away bug Joe\nAnd that because what within this bill\nWithin this bill is a guarantee in an agreement\nThat the foreign labor will cost more exact do her all the propaganda of it helping the American worker it's trying to protest the American worker by making devalue go away from saving on labor in foreign country so it's an extremely pro union bill\nNot only that it adds a tremendous layer of bureaucracy because some moron with a calculator in his pocket protector ethic calculate what my side of the car it's made by American companies doing business in America ... ... ...\nAnd then I'll let you have the final word just so everybody knows so this was one of Trump's minor tweaks\nInstead of sixty two percent of the parts in that car have to be made in North America now maybe Seventy five percent might be have to be made in North America which is stupid to begin with go ahead shrunk\nBut here's here's where he sets it up beautifully could fail and they blamed the foreigner\nBecause what he does as you said something very important the other Congress is half to agreed with the president still write laws we just we we are relinquish power not right and we let the president like a dictator so all three countries have to have the Congress agreed to it\nBut what do you think the American money is going to do in Mexico the lobby so that the Mexican Congress doesn't increase the cost of the American companies doing business yeah\nIt's so cheap but it doesn't really exist behind the scenes that same American Company everybody that they're going to lobby to crush the deal because it's not about freedom it's about control why don't we want freedom\nShawnee thank you man you're spot I'm a I'm sure will still go anywhere [noise]\n[noise] [noise]\n[noise] [noise] [noise]\nPerson they have and they're lying person that they had in their

he had one of those down from free ... free wheeling press conferences that I generally like\nI don't know why he doesn't hold more press conferences because I think he actually does pretty good with them and I think he actually handles the media generally pretty damn well uh but Trump said something today\nThat you would say\nHe said something today that I have said and I would say even if I was in Congress or not he said something today that no other elected official would say he said something today certainly that no other president would say he said something today in fact it it it's it's because of\nLike what he said today things like this\nThat I still believe got Trump the nomination a couple of years ago because you remember all those other guys running against him that Ted Cruz's of the world they're Marco Rubio's of the world none of them the other sixteen would have ever said\nWhat I'm about to play for you by the way we would have ever said what Donald Trump said today\nNow that said that that's not it's not always good Trump set a couple of other things today that were just damn stupid but this\nRight here ... your congressmen your United States senator all these other presidential candidates they're all like politicians and they're also damn careful about what they say\nMaybe that's how come I only lasted two years because I wasn't careful but what I say Donald

um that ... that he knows of a United States senator\nWho has a horrible drinking problem and that this United States senator has been in compromising situations frequently\nAnd then he refused to

dot com slash\nPodcast um look it's a free country\n\nAh I I Believe people can say whatever the heck they want to say\nI'm not like all of our our our friends on the left\n\nAll of these people on the left to try to shut down speech I don't believe in that I don't believe in safe spaces I don't believe you can be protected or shielded from speech that makes you uncomfortable I don't believe any of that\nI never want a shutdown speech I I think [laughter] boy never ever ever want to go down that road I I Want people to pretty much be able to say whatever they want to say about Obama about Bush about Trump doesn't matter\nAbout Republicans about Democrats doesn't matter about Muslims about Jews Christians\n\nWe live in the country well we live in a world\nOr that\nHas a increasingly difficult time\nOf dealing with free speech\n\nIt's fascinating but it's real ... there are there are formal tools starting to come to America They're already in Europe\nGovernment actions legislation and they're making it a crime to say certain things\n\nHate speech my God what the heck is hate speech there's just speech\nBut there is an effort in the world today and here in America\nTo try to restrict speech that people find ugly that people find vulgar that people find offensive that people find politically incorrect speech that makes people uncomfortable\n[noise]\nI I'm someone who\nBelieves in on\nSaturday speech I Would never\nTry to stop somebody from expressing his or her opinion I Would never try to shout down no matter how offensive\nSomebody's ability to speak\n\nAnd this is what the left does make clear this is a fundamental difference right now\nBetween those of us on the right and those of us on the left there's plenty of speech that you and I find the ... uncomfortable or offensive like when these crazy people on the left say horrible things about Trump\n\nI'm horrible things about Republicans\n... speech or ideas declarations that that make you and I squirm ... horrible horrible stuff but\n\nI've never and I doubt you have ever tried to take away that crazy person on the left try to take away his freedom to say what he feels about Republicans are Trump\nWe don't do that we're not the ones on college campuses screaming at\nSome invited speaker who makes people on that campus uncomfortable you and I don't do that\nThe other side does the left dies\nThe last five six seven eight years have been full of examples\nPeople on the left trying to shut down speech people on the left\nI'm\nGetting to a point where where they try to intimidate speakers\nWho espouse viewpoint they don't like people on the left or in auditoriums in classrooms chanting and shouting down to the point where\n\nThat speaker is forced to stop\nAnd of course it's bad enough isn't it that the college university allows this kind of behavior that's just terrific that's horrible they're not teaching these kids a lesson that all go ahead and do whatever you want right engage in that kind of behavior\nThat truly mature yeah that's a great lesson to teach these young kids if you're bothered by certain speech go ahead and shouted down\nRight\nEight five five six for two fifty six hundred\nThat's what they do we don't do that and that is a fundamental difference\nAnd let's be really clear there's offensive speech across the political spectrum\nI I Know it's a popular these days since Trump got elected\nTo think that all that hate us on the left there's plenty I hate to go around\n\nAnd the only people saying nasty things ugly things not just on the laugh guys it's all over it's on the left them it's on the right it's all over it and sell it it's in between and in in remember let's use beyond this\nBoth sides have their crazies there are nuts some both extremes they're bad people\nOn the far left in bed people on the far right there are racist on the far left and racist on the far right\nThere haters on the far left in the haters on the far right\n\nBut it it comes down to this word in tolerance\n\nLike you and I even if their speech we don't agree with we can tolerate it\nWill allow it\nWe will try to stop it or block it or getting away with it like again in a way of it like if if somebody's coming to my town and and you know some crazy or antifa or black lives matter person's coming into my town to speak\nUm I'm not going to organize a group to try to get that black lives matter antifa person shut down\nAnd if I Can't get him or her shutdown that I'm going to get twenty or thirty people were going to go to the event or going to shout him or her down you\nKnow if I had somebody come into my town\n\nFrom like antifa or black lives matter you know what I Do [noise] I wouldn't go [laughter] I just ignore it big deal out of ignore it and I suspect that's what most of you would do\n\nBut if there's a hardcore conservatives somebody on the right more often than not come and somewhere to speak well then the people on the left\nAnd you see it vividly on college campuses whether it's everywhere\nThey try to get the invitation to speak or taken away get that person decision by the end if they can't stop the event than they organized a big group of people to protest in riot or\nIn fact to try to shut that speaker down there not tolerant of other viewpoints\nYou and I are you and I we don't agree with those viewpoints but we understand in a free society we must tolerate opposing viewpoint you and I understand that people on the left don't get that they really really don't understand that [noise]\n\n\n\nThis doctor Christine fair she's still up on Twitter\nShe still employed at Georgetown by the way it's not the first time Dr fare has used her Twitter account to post a bunch of bio
