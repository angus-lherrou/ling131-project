tell you something or just so we're clear it may be you know something I don't know we don't know who's behind all these bombs\nRight I Want to make sure we're on the same page nobody listening to me right now no issues behind all ten of these bombs\n\nAnd I know nobody at CNN knows I don't know [noise] so that's where we are\nOkay that's where we are right now is I come on the air with you right now this Thursday uh again that's the latest more packages discovered this morning\nA but we ... and the FBI and the authorities in law enforcement the N. Y. P. D. they are all over they're investigating we're going to find out sometime pretty doggone soon who's behind all of this but we don't know now\nShow show show that's where we are so all of last night and all of today\nMember we don't know who's who's done this yet we don't know who's behind this but all last night and all today CNN has displayed cry on\nYou don't want to cry on his it's that like it said headline at the bottom of the screen when you watch in like\nThe newscaster or you're watching the talking head and at the bottom of the screen they've got some wording that says something some sort of key point that they want to get across will all night last night and all day today\nCNN has had the same damn cry on up the same damn headline up and it says the following word for word\nQuote Trump has no plans to claim any responsibility for inciting the serial bomber\nCNN has put those words out there on screen ever since this story hit Trump has no plans to claim any responsibility for inciting the serial bomber\nToo which I say why the hell Sunni why should the CNN you suck let me think about this right now we don't know who did it\nCNN right there with that headline they are implying no you know what forget that word imply and they're saying that Trump's behind Trump is responsible Trump is responsible for these ten bombs now these ten packages\nThat's what that headline is saying ... I mean Trump has no plans to claim responsibility why not\nClearly CNN\nDemanding that President Trump claimed responsibility for inciting the serial bomber\nNon stop a minute why should he\nSaid you don't have to be a fan of Trump to ask that question you don't have to be a fan of Donald Trump to wanna watch CNN upside the head right now why should Trump claim any responsibility for the serial bomber why should he\nWe don't know who did it we don't even know yet who did it why why should\nPresident Trump claimed responsibility for something he knows nothing about he doesn't even know who that guy is none of us do\nI mean we don't know we don't even know if this guy who did this is a Trump supporter we don't\n\nWe don't ... and I get mad at anybody right or left who says I Know who's behind this I Know it was a Trump supporter no you don't I Know Joe this was all false flag operation no you don't\nBut I don't want to get into that again I Want to hammer CNN upside the head they're demanding that Trump claimed responsibility for this we don't even know if the guy who did it's a Trump supporter\nWe don't know if the guy who did it there's just some crazy whacked out dude who doesn't even know who Donald Trump is we don't know ... understand the point I'm trying to make here CNN is so damn biased\nThey're criticizing Trump before they even know who's responsible for this\nI mean I can see you know if it turns out that this guy was a rabbit Trump supporter and he ... he was glued to every single word he a Trump said and and and he took Trump literally when a Trump said that uh uh uh Joe Biden's bad dude and John Brennan's bad dude and Eric Holder's bad dude we\nDon't know any of that yet\nHere would be one thing if CNN waited before they demand that Trump claimed some responsibility we don't know yet if this guy is a Trump supporter we don't know yet if this guy is just a crazy whacked out dude and we fundamentally don't know if the guy who did this was\nActually incited by Trump at all we don't know my God you know I wrapped Trump upside the head\nBecause you should never called the media the enemy the people but man you can say until the cows come home that CNN sucks in so many of these media outlets suck and and I I Would love to and I know you wouldn't want to do this I'd love to\nI'd love to sit Anderson Cooper and Chris Cuomo and Jake Tapper and all of them down for like an hour and just show them this and just ask them the question why did you put that headline on your TV screen all night last night in all day today demanding that Trump claimed responsibility when we don't even know who did it yet hey guys\nDon't do you understand why so many Americans no longer like or trust a damn words you say do you get it\n\nTo get it now\n\nThere were plenty of examples last night and today plenty of examples of people in the media and people on the left\nAssigning blame the President Trump for what happened yesterday and today and for all we know there could be more bomb packages found tomorrow\nThis one here though stood out and I think it\nIt typical size in in real stark terms the bias\nThe ugly biased the dangerous bias of the media and I want to tell everybody listening to me right now who doesn't even like Trump and you don't support Trump I Hope you can understand how unfair this is like again if we find out everybody\nThat the person who did this was a big Trump supporter Andy did it because he was inspired by Trump will then that's one thing then you\nKnow CNN puts up their cry on their headline hey hey hey now that we know this guy was inspired by Trump is when is Trump's going to claim a little bit of responsibility I still have a hard time with that but I understand it\nBut to put this cry on up\nOn your TV screen all day before you even know who committed this act\nYou are revealing CNN how dangerously biased you are the fact that you have so little self awareness\nThat you can't see that there's a problem with this demanding Trump claims responsibility\nBefore we even know who did it have what will happen do you think to CNN if\nIf it turns out that it is some crazy leftist who did this if it was some sort of a false flag operation right to make the right look bad who knows right how how how bad in stupid and silly is CNN and all the rest of I'm going to look [noise]\nLet me just say one more time because it makes you feel [noise] CNN [noise]\nIt is Steve they keep it up all day they keep that up at the bottom of the screen all day they do that for a reason people turn on CNN people walk by TV people are at the airport people airport walking you know walking through a walk\nInto the gate and they look at the ... up at the TV and their CNN on and they seem to cry on at the bottom of the screen they don't really hear what the talking heads saying but they see at the bottom of the screen Trump has no plans to claim any responsibility for inciting serial bomber there is a reason why\nCNN puts up there and keeps it up there like that\nLook\nYou can't say enemy the people but I Will say and I've said it a million times before the best thing Trump has done is exposed the media I really do believe that's his greatest [noise]\n\n\n[noise]\nIt's time to check the more freedom voicemail when you're saying about you oh my God I Know [noise]\nUh yeah Joe on the side go\nDemocrat to send all these so called expert a bill bombs expert build things bombs well you know it's still it's still asked well what you know if it was All right Joe it mildly gone off\nBut it's still have to they don't want to boil anybody up\nYeah I Love all these people\nAre still some to bombs and uh the addict is going to go on and on and on and you start arresting these people who are in shining these people who are finding the money you know I Can't go out just paying all watch people mind for\nAny reason whatsoever I like to see what the IRS thinks about that\nBut the fact is is that we got to go to the core till we get there and find out who's orchestrating this\nWho's financing this we get a handle on it\nUntil when it goes on banks Joe [noise]\nWould use for the five

devices sent to political leaders be\nCaused such actions represent a clear and present danger to our political system correct but you know what\nThere's another danger lurking on the horizon horizon involving our religious freedom\nOur founding fathers recognize that all people have in alien ... writes that flow from the creator however as secular forces chip away at our nation's Judeo Christian roots are religious freedom is increasingly threatened which is why\nFor our friends at alliance defending freedom offer such a vitally important research to people of faith all over America ATF spot Trent says\nSeemingly small ways are religious freedom is infringed upon can quickly ballooned into huge legal challenges and false charges of intolerance\nWhen you have these conflicts that become between the algae beaches community and people of faith and people say well can't we all get along well that's not what they're looking for what they're looking for is active support active participation I Will come and find you and even though there's another fifty bakers or fifty forest that'll serve me for free I Want you to do it\nAnd the fact that you have a religious belief that marriage is between a man and a woman is unacceptable so it it\nSo we got what ten eleven twelve Thirteen fourteen thousand people\nA walking making their way up to our southern border and actually some some news was made today but\nIt's it's news with some caution\nI got to be honest because we'd been here before we haven't had a caravan vis big but we've been here before they're been caravans last caravan was at the end of April early may about a thousand and you know where those thousand are now those thousand that came to our southern border back in April May there in America\nOkay we've\nBeen here before we got to change the way we do things but a couple of pieces of good news when it comes to this caravan the Trump Administration announced today that eight hundred a active duty soldiers will be sent to the border\nThe troops will be sent to the border or via Fox News ... ... troops number one\nWas that secretary law that says expected the sign deployment orders later today authorizing hundreds of additional troops\nTo the southern border these images show some of the national guard troops pet earlier that hair by the president and U.S officials tell facts at least eight hungry in additional active duty troops are part of the new forces heading to the southern border their quest for assistance from VHS came last night that request\nSets in that line of October thirtieth\nSo eight at least eight hundred troops by October thirtieth will be put on border or they're not infantry but there'll be down there for a reason gimme troops number two\nThat composition of the trip to Spain determined as we speak by the giant staff here at the Pentagon they will not infantry transcend will only be armed for self defense\nAnd who are they and what are they going to do ... troops number three\nThey are engineers lawyers and medical personnel according to a Pentagon official and will be there and Leslie to support the customs and border patrol\nThere'll be down there these eight hundred and some are active duty soldiers there'll be down there to assist homeland security on the border there'll be down there to assist don't forget we got about Twenty one hundred or twenty two hundred and National Guard troops down on the border dumb gimme troops number for\nNot immediately clear where the forces will be going along the border but we'll be providing a supporting role they will not be making rats on the border\nThis is a good move this is an important move it's a necessary move see what we have to try to do and I'll get to the other piece of news today in a second\nWe have to try to do is keep this caravan from getting to our border\nLet's be honest and let's be real the thought of the image of ten eleven twelve Thirteen fourteen thousand of these folks at\nOur border or is it an image that scares the heck\nOut of the Trump Administration and it should because again remember this past April you just had almost a thousand of them camped out on our border\nAnd then the TV cameras descended on them and then you had the women and children and then you had these babies crying and you had these folks given their their their their legit sob stories in before you knew it the Trump Administration backed down\nThe thousand or a migrants were led into America all to claim asylum or to seek asylum and they've been here ever since the Trump Administration is scared of that image those images imagine fourteen thousand of them\nSo to say you know what we're putting troops on our border yeah what will the troops do on the border that's not the point we're putting troops on the border so everybody in this caravan knows and show Mexico knows we're putting troops on the border as a way to try to\nDissuade them from getting to our border\nAnd then there's the president himself who came out\nThis afternoon in a tweet and tweeted and I quote to those in the caravan turnaround we are not letting people into the United states illegally go back to your country and if you want to apply for citizenship like millions of others are doing\nTwo points on this tweet by the president again same strategy as with the troops this tweet is meant to prevent these folks from getting to our border the Trump Administration is going to try to do whatever they can do\nWith Mexico without Mexico to try to get these folks to turn around now to make sure they won't get to our border and and I'm sure you will see and the next week or two so a more\nA respectful but tough warnings from the president to these people turn around and I heard somebody I mean I don't know what network\nOr who said that that tweet of the president's was heartless and cruel\nYou kidding me yeah are you serious\nOh what did he say again here's what the president said word for word to those in the caravan turned around we're not letting people in the United states illegally\nWhat's called an heartless about that somebody tell me we're not letting anybody into this country illegally what's cold and heartless about that\nGo back to your country and if you want apply for citizenship like millions of others are doing what's cold and heartless about that\n\nIf you want to come to America apply to be a citizen what's wrong with that\nWhat you mean about that\nNot a damn thing by the way not a damn thing this is what again this is what I Want my president conveying this is what I Would like my president communicating to the whole world by the way really that tweet this tweet should go out to everybody around the world\nDon't want in America now new rules new rules nobody can come into this country illegally\nIf you want to come to America God Bless you do it the right way\nApply for citizenship like millions do every single year that is the message that is the only message when it comes to immigration that the president of the United states should be delivering I'm ... I'm I'm Glad the president delivered it today\nAnd he's going to have to deliver it again because I'm telling you in in a few weeks if you get ten eleven twelve Thirteen thousand at our border it's going to be a PR nightmare in one more reminder when that last caravan was heading up our way\nAbout a thousand or so and by the way you do know that there was another smaller caravan from El Salvador that's making its way up here\nFifteen hundred to two thousand so there's another caravan on the move by the way we'll get to that in a second this is why you can't let anybody in 'cause if you let everybody from a caravan in what do you think's gonna happen another caravan back in April you may not remember this we didn't put troops at the border but back in April\nThe president of the United states put out a few tweets\nTelling the migrants to turn around\nTelling the migrants that we would not let them in you need to know that you need to know the whole truth the president's done this before he did this before the last caravan he warned them we would not let them in they didn't listen to that warning they got to our border in California\nAnd the president backed down and they were led him to seek asylum and they're all here\nWe can't make that mistake again I'm Glad the president is sending this message again but they pay attention down there\nIn Mexico and Honduras Guatemala they pay attention to what a president does more than what a president says and when they saw every buddy from last caravan pretty much get into this country\nWhen they said to themselves you don't need to listen to what that man says let's get up to the border let's find a CNN camera and before you know it will be in America\nThis time if if there is a this pac man this president has to back up\nEvery single word he's tweeting right now and when he says like the president said today we're not letting people in to the United states illegally\nVoice better carry through [noise]\nAs\nMany less fourteen thousand of them in you're going to have a thirty for six hours which is\n[noise]\nOh sure they got some pretty big front yard where you say about Fifteen refugees for reform minded

you go on websites you're probably going on Fox News and and conservative websites I think you should go on a few websites that represent the opposition I think it's good for you I think it's good for

fourteen thousand people heading toward our southern border\nI Know what I Believe I knew what I think should be done but to make sure that I can make the most compelling case I can make\nI Want to be aware of what the left believes we ought to do about the caravan\nWhere's their head on a on this and by the way I've been watching a lot of CNN and MSNBC\nAs they've in the last few days is as they've talked about the caravan\nAnd what's really interesting is the left than Democrats they don't have a position they're struggling\n\nWith their position with what they think we should do see that's a clue\nThat\nIs good\nBut I wouldn't have known that unless I paid attention to them our site it's pretty cut and dry here excuse me\nI'm don't let them in the country turned them away that's where I Am all of them by the way the left is really struggling\nOr do we do\nHow do we take care of them who do we lead in how many do we lead in where do they stay do we how some which really interesting is on this one issue\nThe left is struggling to find a position and I hear that every day and every night when I go to my left is Web sites and my leftist TV\nThey don't know how to respond to this\nAnd they're they're trying to feel their way through various stances\n\nNow that's pretty cool\nOr it's pretty cool that I Know that that I've found that out and I've found that out kind of paying attention to them it's like I've gotten inside of their uh their war room\nAnd I'm I'm I'm paying attention to the left\nTrying to strategize on how best to fix this problem this issue they don't have a fix but the point is the point I'm trying to make care before I Move on this\nI'm inside their war room\nBecause I watch MSNBC every night and CNN every night\nI've got a decent idea of how my political enemies think because I go on a number of lefty websites\nEvery day I've got a decent idea\nOf where my political opposition's had his hat\n\nAnd see I Want to defeat them

conservative talk radio and don't just watch Fox News that's what I'm saying [noise]\nBecause [noise]\n\nAnd boy I I I've spoken to\nThousands of people over the last few years on this very issue
