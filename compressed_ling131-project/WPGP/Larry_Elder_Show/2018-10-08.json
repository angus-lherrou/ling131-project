I'm also going where a political hat for Second Amendment organization where I recently as you know took the position of executive vice president over there\nAnd that's where it came it makes it a way\nYou got it on the training is that first of all what this guy does he takes a loaded gun he's taken some selfies obviously excited to be there and you know the firearms enthusiast I don't know if he's on everybody's happy to be there as you do you asked about it walks in probably doesn't realize\nThat someone I think his friend that stand there next door has a loaded gun and left it on the counter or in the copy hold there any indoor ranging reaches down that little counter top cable\nPicks the guy that puts it against his chest pointed against what's probably a bullet proof while definitely a violation of range\nEtiquette and safety rules as he's probably been briefed on but the ... so it wasn't quite sure what's happening 'cause he's on the other side of the wall jelly starts paying attention this guy takes to sell the if the guy holding the gun in front of his chest\nThen he turns the gun and points it directly into the face of his friend that's all sorts of standing in that ... the whole lean in this traditional indoor rate instantly UCD are so come around he reaches up touches him first with his right hand with on the gun in their hand pushes it away from the guy's face painted it to the table\nTakes his left hand puts it on the guy's cakes the guy the guy's hand polls and back from the ... lead a guide protest he says something course we don't have audio\nOr this guy's name is Scott it's at the top gun range and kudos to Scott that he did an amazing job of controlling the gun control in the ocean eating checks began finds out exploded immediately leaves the gun on the table takes the two gentlemen and starts to escort them immediately from the range from the area of live fire\nAnd it was great from ... my training at first one of us network at this guy did amazing job and I every instructor every hour or so every range facility and by the way every certifying agency out there\nTo ask yourself or your people and argue as individuals if you put yourself in that role prepared physically control someone in an emergent situation like that far too many aren't\nAnd quite frankly far too many of these uh you know entities that certify instructors actually have a really hard rules they spend more time telling instructors not to touch students without asking permission and eat you know very aware of liability or looking thing awkward or uncomfortable if there's a you\nKnow inter gender relationship kind of thing if it's a woman touching a band and touching a woman there are so worried about the political correctness of it that one of my fears is that they're not reminding instructors and all that so that you very well may need to go hands on\nTo protect yourself and to protect others and that's what this are so his name I only learned off Internet his name is Scott gain a great job up\nSo that first for the ... were real quick route route for listeners for your benefit ourselves range safety officer Rob go ahead please\nYeah that's absolutely so you've been there you took this step as a as a customer you arrange to intervene but you didn't have to go hands on you felt like a verbal you know hey by the way buddy that's not okay probably at an earlier level or at a lower level of risk of course that's the way to go you know we don't want to touch people and we don't need to we don't want to physically control people we don't need to but\nThis are so solving need now I'll tell you been on you know well you know fifty sixty ranges this year probably then on I don't know if I had to guess three hundred four hundred right around the world in my lifetime he did the right thing\nFrom the political side here's what I saw on the Internet all day long those guys should be banned those guys should be kicked off those guys especially that guy shouldn't have guns that guy should not be allowed back on that range\nI Hope he was banned I Hope that I never see him and the other end video\nAnd I have to ask myself now going to Second Amendment organization putting my political ad on is that the right message\nLet's think for a minute if the if bay the anti gun or is it the other side see that the vast majority of dirt orders us all our hey guys are going to have a gun\nAre we undermining the credibility of the argument that we shouldn't have mandatory training obviously I don't think we should have mandatory training do I think we should encourage trained right we should encourage have practices again but I think we can require it in the public space of it as an indoor or outdoor gun right absolutely\nBut what we need to do for a guy like that he died quite frankly that should be and arrange it needed to have your problem that he is a maturity problem that he has a mental ... intellectual property of understanding ... some sort of gotten absolutely but that's infringement right that's an infringement of a second I'm All right\nLet me let me stop you there let me stop you there for a second I tell you why because at first I'm thinking\nYou know I I can see the emotional response get those guys the hell out of there they should be banned permanently but what you're saying is what I Want you to understand listeners wait a minute that's not the guy that needs to be bad that's the guy that has a ... he's just he's a lawful gun owner\nHe's got terrible technique in bad faith the habit that's the guy that needs to be corrected that's the guy that needs to be on the range taking training that NASA being taught\nSafe gun handling don't take him off the range put him on the range and fix the guy's broken problems at the same time I guess what if you try to but you can't ban him banned from the race but you can't ban it from owning a gun and if you're bad and get better promoted a God and he still has a God he can't go to the rage that we still handling guys like that\nI'll stop go ahead you gotta buy\nThat you're spot on you you you channeled the rest of my uh my rent it out because I watch the entire day\nPeople saying ... this guy off the rain he shouldn't have a gun I wouldn't let it my class hey educators a second a minute right advocates\nWe need we need to grab that guy and and maybe he should be banned from down maybe there's an intellectual or mental issue ... each day a draft\nBut it's not and I don't think honestly what I've seen I don't think so I think the guy that had no idea what he's doing didn't understand the risks probably hadn't been formally trained we need to go back I\nCatered we love the fact that you like yes we love the fact that you're taking selfies yourself on the range you're trying to spread you know responsible use a firearm\nLet us so that was it it ... Rob pink you've got a credible information real fast where can people go to watch that\nVideo\nOr they might say stuff would you go to Rob in his pro Facebook dot com slash Rob Pincus pro I posted it early this morning for consideration and also go to a ... or\nAnd have dinner or when you real quick to buy my dinner deer PC two weeks ago Tom Gresham when I sat down without and his wife and had dinner talk about a great time good habits\nIn the company of greatness company of greatness just I'm just really something\nCan't tell you about the conversation yet but I Know I'm going to be able to [laughter] you won't be too long I can promise you all good it's all good but Alan Gottlieb he just brings it he just brings that simple as that\nAnd a quick rundown next week I Will be in Phoenix, Arizona the value of a sudden my favorite place on earth my front license plate says desert rat and it's got a picture of the Arizona desert in the sun going down and just beautiful people look at the truck all the time and so you're a desert ... so you're saying\nIt's got to love it hadn't back up the weather's cooling down out in the desert and be in the high sixties at night and I'm going to do two days into stone and you will probably get one broadcast at least from tombstone Arizona for the daytime show what will be Monday one\nWeek from tomorrow we'll see how that new technology works with some of the\nSome of the systems out there into some but I broadcast it from there before it's an awful lot of fun so Saturday if you're an Arizona easy CDL meeting I Will be there at the Sheraton in Phoenix you can check it out an easy easy easy CDL dot org\nFind out by ticket show up come shake pause you bunch of us there it's a great organization doing that Saturday Night broadcasting Sunday from Phoenix\nGetting together with my good friend a W. R. Hawkins\nFor dinner on Sunday he might not know that but he just found out now because he's listening and then going to do Monday and Tuesday into stone and broadcast from all over the beautiful desert southwest let's go to Mr AWOL Hawkins right now and I'm going to put the notes away for a second because I Love having conversations like this listen I Want you to walk\nWith me here me you and a W. R. Hawkins are sitting down at a restaurant table getting ready to watch the Atlanta Braves and the Dodgers game and talk about guns and stuff with a cold beer and some chicken way that's what you're going to hear now what you've come inside this conversation with the aid of you are welcome in how you doing\nDoing great great to be with you\nOr I pull up a chair you got that you've got that theater the mind visual right yep\nLet's talk Kavanaugh for just a second I got my notes put down I got your your work put away for just a second I Want to get your overall assessment now that this man is confirmed\nAnd sworn in I Want to know what a W. R. Hawkins thanks from the word go from the moment Kavanaugh was nominated to right now today hey W are tell us what you wish you were thoughts on this process\nProcess will surrenders and or the Democrats are shameless what Chuck Schumer spoke yesterday and he said that\nYou know he said Republicans are the ones who came in with an agenda that a short cut this they vilified that they did it he was a lot the Democrats did all those things that Democrats\nDid everything short of the salt and uh it's fun it's unbelievable what I think with those things said and I I Can't say anything good about it except a credit to Joe metric for voting for him I Will say that but\nUh\nYou've got now you have a Supreme Court justice will show that he will not wait for the one that whether under pressure will have a tremendous justice maybe the most conservative justice on the court says Thomas and Thomas is still there or Scalia so it's just like ... that that vote\nAnd check into that we now Republican Party that's fired up I mean Lindsey Graham has been better that easy for me and a lazy Graham what he did Trump showed the way but he missed it\nAnd then suddenly it Donald on and get it any corrected his air and the way is cheap or ... people\nCast off the politically correct chains and the law that you do that but less power over they have not when you cast them off you suddenly realize why these people can do to me they've just been forcing me to calories corner and as soon as he cast them all he turned it\nA mockery of the very people who used the crazy\nAnd so it I think we as we have a justice was going to be unconditional or in his love the second amendment and we have Republican Party it may have finally learned how to fight and if that's true and if we have those things under President Trump then Katy bar the door of here with a\nBoy I tell you a whole lot of meat in that let me let me take let me take two things that you that you mentioned that were great import all of it was and you're a student of the stuff that's why I wanted to ask you this I Know you study this you read this you watch this you ingest it you inhale it you breathe that I mean I Know this is who you are\nSo let's let's sort or another round of beers here and some more chicken wings make mine hot please and um another cold glass a W are you just mentioned mansion and you said God Bless him for voting this way let me throw something else that you and I want to get your comments on this\nThe hell with matching mentioned needs to go mansions not a man mentioned couldn't stand up mentioned had to wait to see how Susan Collins voted before he could vote now the reason I say this is because West Virginia you're listening right now\n[noise] why couldn't man should have said that before Collins voted because magic is playing politics with this vote\nHe had to wait to get political cover so he could show it was okay with Schumer that he could get away with it because once Collins said I'm a do nothing could hurt mansion at that point in other words I'm telling you mentioned playing you for a damn fool tell me if I'm wrong W. R.\nAlthough you're right on that I Would I Would suggest that but I'm just saying I Am glad he crossed over the call right now on Cathy Griffin road map on Twitter which she can't quit doing\nUh she's just angry I think she's angry at how she looks at it wouldn't be I think she's angry at how she sounds like she's angry at our careers\nDo and when she does that you can tweet or say you wasn't great that that he was concerned with that part is they'll never be able to take that away from\nThat right about you're you're right you're absolutely correct about that I had to throw some devil's advocate out there I I got to be honest with you mentioned I think West Virginia it's time for you to wash your clothes you need a conservative in there you don't need somebody that you need somebody that's going to stand up and say you know what\nI don't vote lockstep with Chuck Schumer you know what you need you\nNeed you like Murkowski on your side of the fence or at least\nGet right I'm going to change it all at West Virginia have the votes for Morsi there's no doubt about it yeah I'm not suggesting otherwise it's just that they should think otherwise I'm just saying\nWhat mansion dead and I agree with your carpet political what'd you take a position on sale I knew that that decision wouldn't hurt him politically but but what he ended up doing is giving us the opportunity to look at you described it and he's free and say hey it's great that he was ... ... or ...\nOr you're absolutely correct you're you're correct and I wasn't insinuating that you are suggesting otherwise I just wanted to throw that out match 'cause he's so easy to Iraq I'm going to go into him in the next hour when I'm On my own and have some fun with them now Graham oh boy you know we talked last week about gram off there\nAnd I think that Lindsey Graham is woke to use the Urban Dictionary term right I think he's woke\nWhat I Want to know from you is what took so long why could you I and others in gun owners who don't own a real conservative see this ten years ago and he couldn't or others couldn't where McConnell couldn't or other Republicans why and you've got about a minute\nI don't know I have thought on this as part of me thinks and I'm just this is only my opinion they think that the influence of McCain work that great on him because he and McCain were that close that really that's really all I can come up with me number I but\nI'm going to tell you what it don't matter what it was I loved the Lindsey Graham obscene right now and I made it uh the guy is awesome\nAnd he you know I Love when he ran for ... when he ran for president under way on but I Love when you said we need the bomb these beliefs I Can't use the word I don't think our regular radio he would talk about how bad we needed to bomb a ISIS and the other people and what he was going to do to them there's always been a fireball\nHe's just been too moderate in true true held back and now that he's let go everything woke as you say I Love the guy just love it\nI I agree with the last twenty seconds before the break I I'll up I guess I'll just kind of put a period on that and say that I Believe that Lindsey Graham\nAlways believed or wanted to see the best in the other side and I think it took this and McCain that I I think you're right about that to wake him up and say you know what these people over there and not my friends they're not my friends if they would do that to justice Kavanaugh they would do that to me\nAnd I think I think he realizes that and that woke him up to the point where I don't believe you can see Lindsey Graham\nPlay nice nice anymore for the remainder of whatever career he has left in the Senate well I'll be back with a W are Hawkins right after this great conversation I Hope you enjoy that we'll be right back [noise]\nTo sue protect does everything has a purpose it's not it's not wider than a normal host or because they're sloppy it's not taller than another host or because they're sloppy or didn't plan it out it dissipates the president and later that gun and when you put that ... on you will forget you're carrying a gun\nAnd uh you know I don't mean that at a reckless fashion obviously that's the kind of ... we're talking about I found that same comfort with the snap slots\nYou know yeah and the outside of the way span it's it's really true

Jackson Wells Fargo agent in an Eighteen fifty four letter to his father\nBecause they carry the most valuable assets of the west these dirty boxes of ponderosa pine ... and I are more and more prized by highway banded than anything else I'll listen to this\nBut the real security of the treasure box is came from who was guarding them the Wells Fargo shot gun messengers\nThey were quote the kind of men you can depend on if you got into a fix unquote according to Wells Fargo detective Jim him if these were foolhardy enough to try and steal a treasure box in transit they would find themselves staring down the barrel of a sawed off shotgun loaded with double what buckshot possibly held by wider up himself\nDespite these efforts there was a mass highway man who managed to Rob twenty seven states coaches the infamous black bart Wells Fargo detectives eventually caught up with him he served his four years in San Quentin and then disappeared forever this is A L lost three is wonderful

course they're going to lead the gun industry some money good heavens what's that you you say what what Sean you said\nA bank rhythm you back with them yeah yeah I've got some business interests with them over there a little bit All right let's go back to somebody I think I just think that's fascinating stuff and I appreciate your writing about it in the history of it is it's fascinating to me\nAll right we've got the armed customer over there we talked a little bit about him I you know I got to go to a this guy is Seventy four year old Vietnam vet\nWho ...\nWhat is this this guy shot seven cops AWOL Hawkins seven tops\nBut killed on wounded six\nAll right do we know anything about this at this stage of the game\nYou know uh you know I I'll probably know in the morning a Kevin all just sucked up the air so much\nFriday Saturday ... it's it's certainly did that I could go ahead\nBut yeah this uh\nThis is a weird situation they were going to that house search warrant it is very upscale neighborhood or it was not for the Seventy four year old Vietnam that it was four twenty seven year old male and the house or in the war was on suspicion of child molestation or or child sexual assault something like that\nJust so weird to me that\nThe person who was not the target of the search warrant open fire on the place and uh you know there's there are dogs to be connected here but um\n[noise] that's one of those stories it's how news works one of those stories it happened\nUh it just happened to happen the day before the Kevin out just suck the era of the room and uh so everything everything other than Kavanaugh was get no get so let's just put it that way and so uh I'll Try to do a follow on this\nI'd be curious to find out about what some of those dots are it's a very strange story and we've got seven police officers in South Carolina that was shot one killed one of them Thirty years on the job unbelievable I don't want to find out what happened there All right I'm I'm just curious or Russia collusion more oh where's that Ben\nHaven't heard back to bring that back and\nNow the cabin though you know once they get ... get it done standing in the kitchen or wherever they are and and you know whipping themselves with all changed and whatever else they're doing once they're done with that\nThey'll go back to Russia collusion and all the stuff that's not real or just to try to keep it going but you know what I'm going to say more do you remember during Sandy Hook a ... that you remember I I hate to use the word but there was a fear on the part of gun owners that they write you know there was another one\nWho's going to push through gun control but they they overreached as usual and they showed their hand there are probably figured out hold on these people are in Africa also make a difference there just after more control\nI think\nThey did the same thing with what they did the Kevin though and I believe that when they circle back for Russia now than when they circle back for all the other things now they're going to have a lot of trouble getting any kind of sympathy especially the ... they weren't getting maybe say even six seven weeks ago it's over\nThere and I I think their credibility proven they're they're just a bunch of animals that's all well\nAnd I think their credibility I think they've shown that their credibility as I've talked about it and you know that you do too I Know you talked about it on your podcast and the two of us has spoken about with Curt Schilling on his show we've discussed it here on this program over the last couple of years\nAnd that is that the Democrats and the media in particular has shown that all they're doing is driving and pushing a narrative they they're they're they're they're shaping the news the way they want you to get it then they move away from it they don't cover it any more because they choose not to and then all of a sudden they're going to try to go back and I think what's going to happen is\nThat the rest of America who doesn't have their head and neck deep like we do every single day is going to look back when they circle back around to it and said well wait a minute here\nUm\nWhy is that news again their credibility is in the toilet and I think it'd be very difficult for them to drudge that back up and I'm sure Miller a mother is probably real ticked off about that because his Fifteen minutes are probably about up\nRight so here's your ears are they going\nTo it for those who are paying attention not only really to say it but I'm the say it anyway council winter Trump on election Trump got Gorsuch on Trump got Kevin on Trump cut our taxes truckers build up the military too unbelievable unbelievable strength levels on and on I like to\nGo use everybody mocked him when he tried to use tariffs oh he doesn't understand economic and then what happens\nNow he's got a deal Canada and Mexico and China's coming around but he doesn't understand anything say so Trump is a winter and I think that combined with the fact that the Democrats just show themselves the Dell destroy a good human\nTo achieve their agenda I just think that they're going to have trouble getting anybody's order them now\nThey W. R. hockey's I'm going to have dinner with you Sunday night in Phoenix and beautiful Scottsdale, Arizona and I can't wait my friend I Can't wait to see out there in the valley of the sun God Bless you for everything you do at Breitbart dot com lots to talk with you about next week by the way\nAn hour or two they bring it don't do they always do let me tell you something just gets lost on us a lot I think because we begin as I Know I Do as a human being you probably do as a human being you begin to take certain things for granted Alan Gottlieb and W. R. Hawkins are two of the best of the best at what they do\nAlan Gottlieb is by far the single most important single most important\nLiving breathing fighter on behalf of the right to keep and bear arms then there is anywhere else on planet earth today no one else is more important no one is more important than Allen got leaving we're proud to have him as a regular contributor it W. R. Hawkins also with Breitbart News award winning\nPutting out the facts counterbalance thing and it's not just stayed W are there are many many many writers out there for many organizations many outlets and all the good conservative writers out there but I W our\nFocus is unlike the Rashed strictly and purely on the right to keep and bear arms and we have him here also as a regular political column a political analyst every single week here on armed American radio very proud of that these guys do this on their own time\nAnd they can bring so that they can bring their writings in their words of wisdom and their information to you to help act as a counterweight to all the garbage that we hear so obviously these two guys meet a lot to me let me tell you a little bit about\nWhat's happening next weekend I Will be at the Arizona citizens defense league meeting in Phoenix on Saturday and on flying out\nOn friday and just about five or six days\nFive days and so that's assuming that the newest tropical storm looks like it's going to be way past me by friday anyway but nonetheless you never know\nHopefully everything works out okay and I get out of here on time where I'm going with this is I I leave for Phoenix friday mid morning get out to Phoenix late in the morning\nAnd I have some meetings scheduled for friday afternoon radio station in a number of other a number of other things I've got a couple of while I'm Out there quickly and then Saturday I Will be attending the Arizona citizens defense league meeting\nIn the morning most of the day anyway it's a bunch of meeting this thing is unbelievable you're attending this if you are listening now in Arizona in any station that plays in Arizona where you're coming out to that ... that meeting and beautiful Phoenix I look forward to meeting your first time\nI've been asked to speak at this meeting I Love it I kind of invite myself I'm a ... I'm a lifelong member or a lifetime member of the studio and I really look forward to this grassroots meeting this is one of the organizations\nOutside Georgia carry maybe vc CDL\nVirginia students in the the the L Virginia ... easy CDOs that caught myself with this\nBut the the the the group at Arizona citizens if that's like fights a legislative battle expertly unlike any other group I've ever met except for maybe Virginia citizens defensively and Georgia Kerry\nAnd to be honest with you I think all three of these organizations have that off of themselves now on Saturday when I'm Out there I'm bringing a surprise with me to the meeting that's all I can tell you if you're coming and you're listening to my voice now\nYou'll want to be there and you want to come up and shake my pie I promise you the [laughter] that much I can tell you but here's what's fun\nAbout going to Arizona next week I have an opportunity next week to use the new technology really attached I gave it a I gave it a work out at the gun rights policy conference and was able to get\nGas on the program by taping them live\nAs they were coming off of the stage at the gun rights policy conference and then bringing you the interviews the next day on armed American radios mobster broadcast I Am going to attempt to do the same thing in Arizona\nWhile I Am there on Saturday there ... there are just some amazing people who otherwise I Would not have an opportunity to bring on this program\nFor lots of different reasons that I Will be able to sit down with face to face and the beauty of it is the new technology I'm referring to provide incredible studio quality audio on site\nUsing simply my laptop and a couple of little very cool gadgets\nAnd some of the the of course the professional studio microphones that we utilize\nBut by ... by by taping this deal is I don't need to worry about using the studio in and bring ... signed by having them contact in the studio were able to do this one on one it it opens up tremendous possibilities\nFor me and the program down the road to bring you a lot of guest appearances that we might not been able have been able to make to work out for example\nNormally to taper broadcast which we don't generally like to do if I Want to tape it a specific interview to bring to you because maybe somebody can't be at a certain time and can't be on the air with me at a certain time we're able to tape that segment\nThat requires an individual to be in the studio in Dallas that requires me to be available and it requires them to be available at a certain specific time everybody scheduled to have to be expensive and it's time consuming\nWhat we have at our fingertips now you gotta love technology has the ability to eliminate having to utilize that studio and now bring that studio directly to my laptop and enabled me to bring you studio super high quality\nAudio worthy of a national broadcast on two hundred plus radio station we would do it no other way and why we haven't done it unless we had the studio available to us we can now do these things so I Am hopeful\nThat really what worked out for CGI our PC we're going to elevate that\nTo the next level out as I'm Out of the Arizona citizens defensively meeting here's the fun part of absolutely no idea who I'm going to bring to you one person in particular works that room like a champ and I hope to bring to you would be of course Allen Corwin I Will be spending some time with Alan Corwin at\nThe Arizona systems defensively meeting he's very busy working in stable doing his thing as you can imagine he's very very popular at the studio meetings and at the gun shows the crossroads of the west coast\nBut I Am hopeful to be able to bring Allen Corwin to you among many others while I'm Out there for the Sunday show yeah and that's the fun part I don't even know now I'll start working on progressive\nBut right now I don't even know there are so many amazing voices and I don't even know yet who some of the special guests are\nOut there who are going to be some of the keynote two or three keynote speakers are going to be I'm One of probably thirty people that will be taking the stage out there I'll be given about ten minutes\nBut I'm there to be the keynote just like everybody else does and I don't know who's going to be at I'll find out tomorrow when I started doing some more research I haven't had time to really dig into that I'll be looking into that this week but whoever it is\nI mean I've sat next to you know she's a former state's attorney general out there at those launching meetings before who are nationally known that worked in presidential administrations et cetera state senators\nOr you know Congress people are so who knows I have no idea Arizona citizens offensively is a powerful organization that makes waves across the country and then listen let me tell you something I could you not want to tell you that they are at the tip of the spear\nIn this fight against Michael Bloomberg New York's obnoxious multi billionaire gun grabber and gun hater who surrounds himself with private security armed to the chief\nWhile he cries your right to harm us\nOh to defend yourself and your family hypocrite is does the word that doesn't even guts satellite radio moment word is what I Would have to use to define Michael Bloomberg at that point but AC DC deals at the tip of that's beer they have taken some preemptive strikes in their\nLegislation in with legislation\nIn our state legislature over the last couple of years because they know that Bloomberg has Arizona in the cross hairs coming up in twenty eight team through twenty twenty and a lot of it is going to be dependent on what happens in Washington state was sixteen thirty nine the ballot initiative up there because Arizona is also a ballot initiative state\nAs Florida you have got to be paying attention if you are one of the Twenty one states across the country\nThat has a is that is a ballot initiative state you had better be paying attention Arizona knows they're dead center of the cross hairs and they've been working to for Bloomberg in advance of what they know it was coming for the previous two years\nSo I'm fascinated to find out more when I get out to Phoenix this coming weekend so it's going to be one heck of a show out there at easy CDL and I'm looking forward to bringing you some voices that don't generally come on this program but this new technologies and I have\nEnables me to bring super high quality high definition audio to you as if you were sitting in a studio with me or calling into the studio in fact it's even better because they're my up with me so it it just is is top of the line top notch stuff cutting edge and I'm proud to have it at my at my fingertips for you so\nAh next weekend that's what's happening coming up in the next three quarters we're going next three segments I'm Sorry for that three quarters of an hour we're going to go over what happened to the previous week and talk about just how important it really was but I Want to get a little bit personal\nWith you in the next segment because this weekend marks one year at armed American radio ranch when I sat\nDown with you and opened up with you about a very emotional topic that was going on in our lives particularly my wife and my family here and it has been exactly one year this weekend so when we come back I Want to kind of use that as a reminder as we segue into the rest of the program\nIf you have questions if you want to talk with me about if you want to to correspond with me about it and the things that I went through as a as a husband has a father I more than happy to open up to you reach out to me\nLeave that market armed American radio dot O. R. G. as many many many of you have and I'll be more than happy to help you in any way that I can you help me and trust me I've got your back on this one I bought my whole family does so\nHard to believe that was a year ago that we were sitting around this very weekend waiting for the worst news of our lives it was just\nAwful but the best possible outcome and that in large part because if you will thank you All right\nOh but I did mention in the in the previous segment it was exactly one year ago that I spoke with you it was and I we when we found out what was happening at armed American radio ranch it was about three weeks later when we knew of course of treatment when we knew what we were faced with\nEt cetera is when I sat down with you and I talk with you about it and I'll tell you why I did that I'm going to remind you of that again\n... was one year ago this weekend we got the news or were awaiting the news that the news on Tuesday it was about three weeks later that I opened up to you to tell you what had happened and here's why\nAfter my wife and I sat in that room at the radiologist scared to death knowing something was coming back not knowing what it was\nIt was easy to say this can't be happening is this just cannot be happening is just not happening to us\nAnd I had to remind my wife during a conversation when she said this was in a quota she said this is a nightmare it's just can't be happening is you know that\nIt is happening\nAnd it is happening to you and it is happening to us and if you and us and we as a family are going to defeat this we have to accept what's happening you cannot refused to accept the situation\nThis is the same exact concept that we speak about on this program together every single day even if we don't have to touch on it as a topic\nYou cannot begin to take your own personal self defense seriously if you do not first except that evil exists you must accept that evil exist and evil takes many forms we've discussed it over and over and over again\nAnd it's easy\nJust as you hear someone say I cannot believe that this happened to me that my house got Rob that I was a victim\nUnderstand that the first step in defeating evil is accepting its very existence then and only that can you give evil what it needs and that's a good solid butt kicking and you can but first\nYou must accept that it can happen to you we found out at the ranch [noise] and that's how we defeated it with a lot of help your back after this [noise] [noise]\nWell that's already News I'm Rhonda rock strip\nSenator Mitch McConnell says the fight

S. we can only willfully give them up\n\nThink about that very profound words from David ... and he's right let's go back to two big New Jersey here eight to Seventy six one New Jersey anti gun governor freak show Phil Murphy signed into law because he doesn't like Fifteen rounds you it's okay with that because he said you could\nGive 'em up destroy him permanently\nRuin them and keep them from doing what they were supposed to be done in the first was oh don't think that's not going to use any job we are right somebody she's Fifteen round holes in 'em ... she's Fifteen holes in the back of your magazine\nIn a state like New Jersey oh you're going to jail broke it won't matter if you modify it we've seen what they do we've seen what they do to ... Brian ... we've seen what they do to me now than there are others they don't care about that you\nLive in fear in New Jersey if you're a law abiding gun owner even if you follow the law and calls them for advice on following the law like Brian ...\nDid you still get convicted of a felony you still have to seek a pardon from a governor you still have your life destroyed because of these freak show gun haters so the bigger philosophical question is what do you do\nI just told you what I'm doing I own this bump stock I bought it legally it fits in my home lawfully and I'm not giving it to anybody\nBecause no one can tell me that what I purchased lawful you have to ... and own now makes me a criminal it's just a piece of plastic\nI didn't become a criminal overnight because of something I don't think about what I'm saying you because of something I lawfully owned today does not make me a criminal tomorrow\nSo it remains to be seen what Trump was talking about we have a lot to go on in the coming days and weeks with that is going to be grandfathered in I don't care if it is or not I have it it's fine I own it lawfully come and get it\nHere it is I'm not giving it's\nThese are the greater philosophical question this is why Kavanaugh's nomination and Kavanaugh's subsequent confirmation\nAnd swearing in was so vital to each and every one of us we will have more to talk about later in the week I Hope to see you next week on the monster cats if you're gonna be out in Arizona I'll be there until we meet on the radio again tomorrow as I tell you every\nI was just sent a tweet sent out by an MD\nAnd I won't even mention her name because I don't want to give her publicity\nBut it is it just fascinating listen listen to this I reading I missed the producer you you won't believe this\nReady\nBoobs are baby milk vending machines adult men who find boobs sexual Oregon's need psychological help\nSue sent out by an M.
