birthday party to celebrate somebody's thirtieth birthday\nAnd that that limousine or carrying Eighteen people Seventeen people\nA failed to stop it and the intersection upstate New York was driving way too fast Corrine down the hill struck a parked vehicle or killed two pedestrians every body in the limousine was killed everybody in the limousine was killed\n\nWent through an intersection didn't stop was going about sixty sixty five miles an hour down a steep hill speed limit down that steep pill was about thirty miles an hour\n\nCorinne didn't do another vehicle killed two pedestrians in that vehicle and everybody in the limousine was killed young couples or two or three of the couples were newlyweds married just this past summer\nOne father lost four\nOf his daughters\n\nThey were heading to a brewery in Cooperstown again to celebrate a friend's thirtieth birthday\n\nThat friend and her three sisters and their spouses were all killed\nThese were all young couples\nAre local police said these were all young couples most of whom had just got married and they had their whole lives ahead of them\n\nOne gentlemen last four daughters just a horrific scene and even a\nLaw enforcement and transportation officials who are familiar with crashed sites and scenes like this are said this was just terrific\nUh never ever have they seen a ... an automobile accident like this with so many people killed\n\nAnd then it turns out that the um\n\nThe limousine or was not in the best of shape to lose the limousine had problems one of the passengers in limousine\nTexted her friends moments before the crash and said this limo was Iraq\n\nThe limo failed inspection just last month the driver did not have the appropriate license it goes on\nOn\nA professor and his wife were killed when the limo crashed into them\n\nBut everybody on that limousine all young lives the ages of twenty six to thirty for\nUh Eighteen young lives in that limousine gone like that\nThere will be an investigation\n\nAnd Governor Cuomo and and the politicians are already on the scene and again it looks like this limousine service this limousine company is going to be in a lot of heat\nA lot of hot water are\nNot appropriate paperwork not appropriate license that they didn't pass inspections the list goes on\n\nBut I just keep thinking about how uh\nWe're what we're twenty eight twenty nine

we go to our corners and we wage war\nWe wage war about guns we wage war about mental health we wage war about arming teachers we wage war about Muslims we wage war\nThere's no reason to wage war here\nThis is just a plain\nJust a plain terribly sad tragedy twenty lives lost and I just think that uh just pause yeah mechanism that can get all goofy and you're just pause and I'm sure you did I'm sure you did if you saw the story over the weekend and Americans spend any more time on it\nI it's just so startling twenty deaths in one limousine it's just so startling in upstate New York twenty young lives it's just so heartbreaking so\nWhoever you are wherever you are politically whatever you are politically wherever you stand on Brett Kavanaugh however you're going to vote in the damn mid

locker room during the anthem\nAnd I have a right to turn them off\nAnd I are proudly exercise that right\nIn that first year I boycotted the NFL\nAnd then in year two last year I boycotted the NFL again because that issue\nKinda resurrected itself\nAnd even though it's not really an issue this year is it I think there have been just a few\nPlayers who've taken a needy or raised their fists during the anthem\nBut it's really not an issue\nBut\nI have no interest in watching the NFL and again maybe I'm like a lot of you\n\n[noise] I mean the NFL TV ratings are down a ticket sales are down

of men like\nMe who would boycott because of the anthem crap\nAnd after they boycotted for a while they realized you know what life goes on wow\nLife goes on on Sundays and\nThe NFL has been deathly
