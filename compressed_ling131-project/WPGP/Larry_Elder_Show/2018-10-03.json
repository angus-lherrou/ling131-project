everything that's come out about Brett Kavanaugh a came out about Brett Kavanaugh if he wore a leftist Democrat judge you and I know\nWe know the media would not be trying to take him down like the media is trying to take Brett Kavanaugh down you and I know that\nThat's what makes us angry that's why that's why we're fighting so hard to get this guy nominate to get this guy on the Supreme

me last night Joe I don't get it why why\nAre you guys like hanging with this guy Kavanaugh why ah\nWhy you're trying so hard to get him on the Supreme Court why didn't you just jettison him\nAnd nominate that uh that that female judge or get another good conservative but this guy Kavanaugh's got problems man he was a drinker and high school and a drink or in college\nHe got aggressive he got belligerent man or there there's like a case against him Joe why are you conservatives fighting so hard for this\nGuy that's what my liberal friend asked me last night\nAnd you know what I said to him\nI said to him it's because of the double standard that's why\nThat's why we're fighting for better or for for for Brett Kavanaugh\nIt's because the hypocrisy of the media\nThe double standard misuse which made us angry for so long\nBecause we know we know we know that CNN and ABC and NBC and CBS and all of them the Washington Post the New York times the LA Times all of them if this were a Democrat judge a nominated by a Democrat president\nBush would not be a story or stick it that CNN and all the rest are only going after Kavanaugh because he's a conservative judge nominated by a Republican president\nThat's why right there I told them and I didn't raise my voice like I'm raising now but right there that's why we're fighting for this guy it's not fair\n\nWe've had to live with this double standard for years it's not fair that's why we're not going to let\nBrett Kavanaugh go down because we know I told my friend last night we know he's ... Kelvin all were Democrat he'd already be on the Supreme Court with CNN and all the rest because he's a conservative they declared war on him\nAnd you know what we got an example right in front of us we've gotten example right in front of us how many are you know who do work is\nCongressman Beto O'Rourke democratic congressman Beto O'Rourke he is the Democrat running for the United States Senate down in Texas against Ted Cruz he is a Democrat Beto O'Rourke is he is a progressive I mean he's way out there on the left\n\nAnd did you know that if we ... it it came out\nA within the last month that wouldn't be no or war crews like what in his mid forties right now early mid forties when beta or war or was twenty six years old he got drunk\nGot behind the wheel of a car and rammed into another car and according to the police report when he was twenty six or right drinking and driving ... he tried to flee the scene he\nTried to flee the scene of the crime according to the police report back when he was twenty six years old he tried to flee\nHe tried to escape and the only reason I bring this up is because the national media has ignored that story\nAgain I'm not I'm not telling you that that is something that should be looked at or not right I'm explaining to Ali Ewan every Democrat and leftist who's listening to me right now\nYou want to know why us conservatives are so angry and are not going to let Brett Kavanaugh go down it's because of this\nThe national media has pretty much ignored the ... or story twenty six years old get strong he's driving crashes into another car\nTries to leave the scene tries to get away according to police report he's twenty six years old the national media has barely mentioned that story in in in Texas local media\nNot much of a story why\nBecause he's a Democrat beta or why because he's a progressive Democrat why because he's running against Ted Cruz\nMedia hates Ted Cruz\nI I mean I I mean just flip it around imagine just mad Jim Wright miss you get and you want to get outside our hedge you want to understand why we are fighting so hard for Brett Kavanaugh those of us on the right because just imagine\nImagine that story came out about Ted Cruz that when he was twenty six years old he got a DUI crashed into another car and tried to leave the scene I'll tell you what if that happened to Ted Cruz if Ted Cruz did that\nWhen he was twenty six years old ain't no way Ted Cruz gets reelected ABC and CBS in CNN they'd be all over that story it would be one of the biggest stories in the country\nIt would be right up there with Brett Kavanaugh it would be right up there with the Russia investigation I'm telling you CNN ABC CBS all the rest if that were Ted Cruz getting a DUI at twenty six getting into an accident trying to leave the scene the national media\nWould declare war on Ted Cruz\nAnd would do everything they can do to make sure Ted Cruz loses but because that happened to be to work because ... or ... who's a Democrat\nA lefty did it it's not much of a story and here we got Brett Kavanaugh who what excuse me he drank a lot of beer in high school that's a big story he drank a lot of beer in college that is a story\nNo no it's a story because he's a Republican it's a story because he's a conservative\nThat's why it's a story\nI I'm not getting down into the weeds here\nI'm not talking about you know the particulars of the event of thirty five years ago I'm not even getting into the weeds about how much he drank in high school or college I'm just telling you this I'm just put this in front of you right now if Iraq Obama nominated Brett Kavanaugh and Brett Kavanaugh wore a Democrat judge\nDish would not be a story\nAnd it's that double standard that those of us on the right to\n\nRefuse to accept and that is why I told my friend last night we are fighting so hard\n\n\nBut you look\nAt what the media has done outside of that allegedly incident thirty five years ago you look at what the media has\nDone to try to destroy this man\nLooking into every aspect of his life when he was sixteen Seventeen Eighteen Nineteen years old\n\nI said to you the media wouldn't do that if if Brett Kavanaugh or some leftist judge they wouldn't do it\n[noise] hey Jim you're on with your walls [noise] job ...\nThank you um [noise] my question actually first of

kind of flex your religious liberty model a little bit and there is this is totally constitutional just simply bring your Bible to school and read it during free time not during instruction town of course but any free time you have you can pull out your Bible you can read it at school and nobody can take it away that's\nOne of the great things about living in America but oftentimes a school administrator or a teacher will come up and say hey you can't do that it's illegal right have a one sheet from alliance defending freedom you have\nA people can print that at the website they give it to the teacher and I go oh okay it looks\nLike it's a way to go ahead and that's typically have the big goes in and they're not in your face thing these now\nAre are usually pulling together a little table talk Bible study at lunch at school they're reading the book uh John or something if yeah self directed yeah so they do whatever they want to do but at the website bring your Bible dot org we

Rourke is don't you he's the Democratic congressman who's running for the United States Senate down in Texas against Ted Cruz\n\nAnd I don't know for sure that you know but I'm going to make sure you know\n\nThey don't Rourke who now is in his mid forties\n\nAgain just to show you the double standard\n\nBeta Rourke when he was twenty six years old got a DUI\n\nDrunk driving and in the police report the police report at the time twenty some odd years ago the police report says\nThat twenty six year old bait or tried to flee the scene of the crime\n\nAfter he hit another car while under the influence\n[noise] now\n... bagel Rourke is a Democrat\nIn fact he's a a he's a progressive he's a far left Democrat now on this issue\nBagel roared back when he was twenty six a DUI hit another car and then he tried to flee the scene\nA\nDebate O'Rourke were Ted Cruz\n\nIf this came out about Ted Cruz\n\nTed Cruz did the same damn thing when he was twenty six DUI tried to flee the scene of the accident\nTed Cruz would be done Ted Cruz would not get reelected the national media\nABC and CBS and NBC and CNN would declare would have declared war on Ted Cruz and they would make it one of the biggest national political stories in the country in fact\n\nThey were to put it right up there with Brett Kavanaugh they would have put it right up there with the Russia investigation if that had been Ted Cruz\n\nWho when he was twenty six years old got a DUI and tried to flee the scene\nIt would be a huge story and for all intents and purposes Ted Cruz's um\nReelection bid would be over\nBut because beta O'Rourke is a Democrat a progressive Democrat the media generally has kinda ignored it barely made a mention of it\nI'm Talking about the national media\nYou know in Texas again you've got different newspapers in Texas some of made an issue out of it some habits haven't I'm Talking about the national media\nAnd Brett Kavanaugh nominee or to the Supreme Court ah drink too much in high school and college they say\nOh my word stop the presses we got to do something about\n\nHere's Beto O'Rourke a United States Senate candidate down in Texas\n\nObviously drinking too much when he's twenty six years old that's not high school that's not college\n\nAnd it's barely covered it is the double standard that sends us over the edge\nIt is the double standard that\nOur side must\nNever ever stop railing about as long as I've got this microphone I'm\nGoing to continue to talk about it and more seen it up close and personal with Brett Kavanaugh right here I Know you know everybody knows\n\nThat what we call you know the Democrat media\nCNN and ABC and CBS and NBC and MSNBC and CNBC and PBS\nAll of them Washington Post New York times all of them you know the biggest networks\nOutside of Fox the biggest cable networks the biggest newspapers in the country the way that they have been covering this Brett Kavanaugh case they would not cover it this way they would not even come close to covering it this way\nIf Kavanaugh\nWere nominated by say Brock Obama\n\nAnd for those Democrats and left these listening to me right now\n\nYou can disagree with me if you'd like I'm explaining to you\nThe feeling that my side conservatives in this country have had forever I mean a long time before Donald Trump Trump is just the first Republican candidate for president and then Republican president who has said\nI'm not going to ignore the double standard I'm not going to ignore the bias I'm going to call it out\nI'm going to call it out\nEight five five six for two fifty six hundred eight five five\nSix for two fifty six hundred\n\nIt's so fundamentally wrong\n\nAnd as long as this double standard exists\n\nWe conservatives we libertarians are will ...\n\nIt's time that he's getting his\nEight five five six for two fifty six hundred eight five five six for two fifty six hundred you would be stunned\nUm you you really would be stunned if\nYou knew how many Americans\nAre really did hold that\nThat that are all these women have to be believed\n\nI mean my word my lord if we ever get to a point in this country where\n\nJust an accusation an allegation\nCan put somebody away where just an allegation an accusation a determines guilt\n\nI I don't care what skin color you are and and I don't care\nWhat race you are and I don't care what ... are uh\nWe we can't get\nThere we should never be there\nAnd I want to believe that uh most Americans regardless of race or sex\nAgree with that understand that because if we set that precedent here if we do away with that basic fundamental we over used that word but that fundamental\nPrinciple of American Justice presumed innocent that not innocent until proven guilty not innocent until proven guilty presumed innocent\n\nThere's big difference there but if we do away with that if we toss Brett Kavanaugh aside no matter what you think of Brett Kavanaugh no matter where you are politically\n\nIf you let that go here presumed innocent until proven guilty if you let that go here you're not getting it back\n\nAnd and you on the left in Democrats you're going to be bit okay there's going to come a time there's going to come a point in the not too distant future\nWhere ... or ... one of you will get tossed to the side of the road for him to sue the guilty just based on
