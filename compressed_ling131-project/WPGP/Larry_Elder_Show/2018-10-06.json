V. appearances right the back and forth every single day up and down every single night today at three o'clock it came down\nTo Maine Senator Susan Collins who\nAt the end of a fifty three minute speech said the skinny columns number a\nFire\nAnd that was it about two minutes later but Joe mansion came out of some room and said okay I'm a yes do boom done so now the votes have been secure or this or deal is over\nI Will play for you some more of what Susan Collins said enter fifty three minutes speech because\nIt's a pretty important speech and you need to hear some of it and we will as well tonight\nGet to the other major story of the night Chicago police officer Van Dyke found guilty of second degree murder found guilty of sixteen counts of aggravated battery we'll get to and cover\nAll fat too big Chicago's story it's a big national story\nWhat we ended up I fled she didn't know this we ended up this afternoon with Susan Collins\nIn her fifty three minutes speech we ended up\nExactly where we started a couple of weeks ago and oh by the way number we ended up exactly where we left off the day after that hearing last week\nThe calls for the FBI investigation\nAnd the call so many people in our site angry pissed off sad come on Joe the Democrats are just playing games we got to let this thing wide for another week\nWe ended today as I told you we would in the exact same place we were a week ago Susan Collins said\nIn her fifty three minute speech she pretty much said the following Dr Ford the accuser something happened to her she was compelling she's a survivor\nOf a sexual assault but there is no other evidence to corroborate her assault there's no other\nEvidence there's zero\nEvidence is zero or the evidence\nFor what happened to her thirty five years ago so Susan Collins said today what we've been saved for the last two weeks I get it right I get it something happened to that woman I understand it something compelling writes something real she's a survivor of some sort of sexual assault but there's no evidence so low\n\nYou cannot set this precedent wherein uncorroborated allegation takes an otherwise good man down you can't\nDo that America we can't do that Republicans and Democrats you can do this man you can't say that that just an allegation a thirty five year old allegation is going to end or the career of a of a Supreme Court nominee you can't go down that road and that's\nWhat Susan Collins said today\nAnd that's what so many of us\nHave been saying for the last week and the last couple of weeks and look I get it I get it right many of you didn't find Dr Ford credible many of you don't believe something happened to her that's fine I Do on both counts but I hold right exactly where I was a week and a half ago yes\nSomething happened to her but during new one of the rabbit ears\n\nSue you can't block somebody who's been a damn good judge who for his entire adult life nobody as anything negative to say about it\n\nAnd that was Susan Collins verdict today which is why she said\nI Will vote to confirm Brett Kavanaugh and I want to remind all of something it's better that it happened this way this week with the FBI investigation this FBI report this extra week has been better for the country it's been better for the Republican Party it's been better for Brett Kavanaugh\nBetter today than a week ago he's going to become a Supreme Court justice tomorrow and with everything we know [noise]\nThat's a damn good thing [noise]\nThat's a damn good faith [noise] I'm sure most of them\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYeah you're on the CIA Walsh show a couple things one suicide and cows dignified formation yeah Rahm shined both of them kudos to both of them yeah and\nThat the Democrats are going to be loaded for bear the mid term elections pat yourself on the back to night Republicans and conservatives\nBut then you better get down and work because they're still a big job to do\nBecause unless something dramatically changes right unless something dramatically changes the Democrats are on track to take control of the house not the Senate before this cabinet stuff\nIt was a fifty fifty deal with the Democrats take the Senate after the cabinet stuff that looks less likely I think the Republicans are going to hold on to the Senate but I said last night I think it's going to be more difficult now\nFor the Republican so hold on to the house but it's going to be really difficult if Republicans pat themselves on the back the next two tree weeks and think she got November made I'll I'll just put this in front of me again they lost those people the Democrats in the left\nWho did not want Brett Kavanaugh on the Supreme Court this was a this was an incredible flight this this paralyzed the country for three weeks it's was Ali Frazier ... but for like thirty rounds\nImagine maybe I'll I'll I'll put it like this to you\nThose of us who wanted Kevin on the court and we're happy now that Brett Kavanaugh is going to be on the Supreme Court imagine right now if I'm coming to you tonight\nAnd Susan Collins said no and Joe mansion said no and Brett Kavanaugh doesn't have the votes she's been pulled he's not going to be on the Supreme Court imagine I'm coming to you tonight with that message\nWith that news imagine how angry you be mad Janelle pissed off you pay if after all of his cabinet goes down\nI bet you'd be every bit as angry as you were eight nine years ago when Obamacare was shoved down our throats and I know eight nine years ago when Obamacare was shoved down our throats to Tea Party really took off and the Republicans the Republicans were so pissed off\nThat the Democrat shoved Obamacare down our throats the Republicans and conservatives were so pissed off that we took back the house in twenty ten I Know that 'cause I got elected in ... and only because they show\nBomb a care down our throats our side got passed and the Republicans took back the house eight years later in their eyes my friends\nIn the Democrats eyes what we have done and we will do this weekend is we have shoved Brett Kavanaugh down their throats\nThat's how they will feel and that's how angry they will get a I don't want to I don't want to record buzz guys\nBut I'm we're still in the same place we were three weeks ago three months ago if our side doesn't find a way to match the other side's anger\nWe lose in November we most certainly lose the house and we lose a seat or two in the Senate\nThere is no better motivator to get you ... get you off your couch and get you out to vote than being angry their side just lost an Epic Battle they're angry let me go to Jeff Jeff\nHi Joe how you doing buddy I'm good my friend\nHey ah you know so many times over the past couple of years we've always been complaining about all these rhinos yeah lake flake or for McCain rest in peace but uh you know what does this was her idea all along they just selling a sword on our behalf so they can fire up the Democratic base\nAnd not so much the Republican base\nMuch a Jeff that's an interesting thought let me ask you a question if choosing count is Susan Collins and flake had come out against Kavanaugh and taken him down that would have pissed off our base right\nOr it would have but I don't think to the point of\nYou know that's that's two out of out of many right you know yeah Blumenthal yet find signed me at all these I mean we we know that they're just shady and that Schumer yeah Jesus\nBut you know the he had all these other backdoor rhinos like Paul Ryan who knows who knows what's going on in that sense and you know and hey we can throw the fight and we'll end up losing anyway but will still be in control and still have our power\nInteresting stuff Jeff thinking man all I Know is this I'm a pretty simple minded guy the other side was angry a couple of days ago they're going to be more angry the Morrow\nOr we need to match that anger in for two days\n[noise]\n\nThis is the ... over half of the show last former Congressman Joe Walsh show off his job

Jean J. A. C. uh hey may is my friend thanks for taking some time\n[noise] hey thanks for having me I appreciate it more when they tell you I Am [noise]\nGimme gimme your uh when when you heard this verdict\nWas [laughter] how I I'm I'm gonna tell you that I feel like it was one of the very first time and I'm gonna I'm gonna take a page out of my shell Obama book so they\nCan be an American Jew or I mean I Am [noise] and I for one of the very first\nBeginning this is the first time I just\nWork in our favor in a very long time [noise] particularly here in Chicago and so while that there is a collective sigh of relief and frankly some celebration I think I'm going to go out\nHey Mays were you surprised\nI don't know what to say yes I was surprised that it was in ... case I thought that when I saw a video\nI think that there was any way a black person I don't see murder or you know I was twelve twelve years and you know not being black I just want to hold out\nReally [noise] and and to see why they did it really is one of my favorite finally baby's body can understand the pain that black people as we continue to see these murders by by police officer\nOr the charge me today explain exactly what a second degree murder charge me\nFor money and you can get his degree murder among each and every now and then all of reminds you know my family are going to rain it's just not going to be very\nVery number two on what needs to hear that\nIn the room or in the combination of the room or\nOn many meetings\nSo the judge me basically explained that second degree murder is first degree murder which some sort of mitigating factor does it matter to use the whole first degree second degree things\nDoesn't matter you know I think quite frankly as a police officer there was a mitigating circumstance where Carl is seen as a officer but instead of being a police officer he decided he wanted to be a jury and [noise]\nUm but I think that as a police officer and I think this is like [noise]\nUm and I guess I'm actually glad that they made a distinction that he had to play the game exactly or the police officer [noise] I think that was a real factor and I'm Glad that it was rock I'm Glad that it was a\nMaze what's interesting is a number of the jurors have spoken out a jury emphasize amazed I guess when they were deliberating they kept watching ms menial over and over and over the video was powerful when\n[noise] I mean Joe I'll never forget the very first time that I saw that video and the thing that it was it was I mean 'cause you know fall oh we're so shocking about video where their fall off of the body as his\nBody were lying and they kept popping into that yeah the radio was powerful but it also communicate is Jason and I\nCan assist with what the video he was trying to sell or don't believe airline\nHe said he was treating the video shows him or are you saying that one like that or a current and raise their life stories of any of it actually it was a true lie because they were right down on\nIt it certainly sounds like a a whiskey from the jury and that's why when like the defense came out this afternoon and attack the video it's just it just didn't resonate gimme number four and like\nMany over to the U.S\nBased on the NASA moving in and\nSee it may just that's fascinating because the jury or the jurors have said the exact opposite I mean what are you going to believe your eyes or what [noise]\nYou know why so many cases in so many cases we have seen for murder black people camera video and scale walk away\nTime was one of the very first time that we follow the law and she was serving for say yes but the Jerry said you know the wrestling jurors\nOf all races and you know I Am the killing of chop it up and saying black people white people and I am going it was one of like the very first\nTime I saw that one time why empathize with black people I might tell you when you say he was a murder while we're on a plan right now by firing me off guard [laughter]\nFind out why why why people\nWho saw a murder too and and again it's it's again about having those conversations I'm so glad that I just signed a listing the jurors afterwards because there are definitely B O L white guy the\nGuy the guy was the first time I felt like there was some empathy between\nI Want to get your reaction to one thing that the prosecutor said today that I saw was fascinating Devon gimme Van Dyke number three now if someone was\nYear for personal in less than ... coming in and he goes on the line\nNow means to use them for a mission to mom and\nYou went on to say maize that he didn't take the time and the jury a maze today said that over and over they said he should have waited\n... minutes or ... and this is something that you know\nWhere that has been ... lives matter this was the prosecutor and the jury offensively saying that black life matters right it was essentially one of the very first time\nBecause it's good to chase them and I pulled up and say well guess what got killed\nAs a matter of fact not kill 'em but shoot him as a matter of fact\nJoe so many times I think what that communicate what we feel is black folks is that there is no value on black life when that police officer rolled up on the scene\nIt didn't take him six seconds to think about anything about McDonalds he saw a black kid with dreadlocks and wrote a role in the script and decided he was ready to in the stores\nAnd and and that essentially that the prosecutor I'm going to say you Joe I think that they were speaking directly to black people not just in Chicago but across the country\nWho have seen these murders ... Italy and feeling like they got you know just it was actually the prosecutor saying that black life does matter\nA maze what will be the immediate reaction in the black community in Chicago\nYou know I think that we've ... we ... I think it has been an exhausting three year practical jokes yeah first thought that they I think it is a day that we can take a collective sigh\nBrief pat ourselves on the back for maybe Fifteen seconds and then we got to get back at it because we feel are battling right now with the Chicago um fraternal order of police over this belief contracts and they're still trying to figure out what they can kill people\nIn writing you know we still got much work to do what what I Love about\nYou and I as you can say something as outrageous as that but I Love having young\nBecause you speak your mind and I got so much respect for your brother may see action everybody watched him every morning on WVU and amazement man thank you\nThank you and thank you to your audience for having me is always\nA pleasure you gotta I'm Joe Walsh don't go anywhere\n\nFor Adler [noise] and I literally cry hitting over that [noise]\nHey I I I I so appreciate your perspective and tell your daughter thank you for her service will do thank you Joe okay thank you thank you for your thoughts and your opinion I\nI ... I'm ... I'm sad about it too because\nLook I think the reactions going to be stupid I think the reaction on our side uh I I got all the respect in the world from east Jackson and I I understand that the reaction in\nUh the black community in Chicago they're going to feel good about this I get that and I understand that\nUm but like like the Brett Kavanaugh fame was not about the me too movement and it's not about all women it was about did Brett Kavanaugh do this or this officer Jason Van Dyke thing is not about a\nShooting black men and black violence in the city it's about did officer Van Dyke commit murder that saw justice but we want to create and blow out of proportion all of these other narratives that fit where we are politically this is a sad day\nFor me Kate I think a lot of people it's a sad day as well I'm not because I disagree with the verdict\nI just think it's a sad day for cops\nWill continue the central Los don't go anywhere [noise]\n[noise]\nTime to check to wash freedom voicemail when you're saying you know [noise]\nIs from Cleveland, Ohio\nAnd I love hearing from ground I just want to tell you some old expression goes like fifth\nWords like bullet one fare fired they cannot be called\nThis is what I think the left town they they work things out and they're destroying our country and I wish it would use a phrase frequently on your\nOwn radio program it is worth their like bullets monster fire it they can be recalled I'd want to hear program thank you so much Joan having good evening [noise]\nHas been reloaded and you're listening to the Joe Walsh program on the radio and that's [noise] [noise]\nWith us or news on Gordon Griffin Senator Lisa Murkowski says that she opposes Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh\nBut we'll ask to be recorded as president during Saturday's confirmation vote to accommodate another GOP senator\nWho will be at his daughter's wedding in Montana so there's often partner like that to allow an absence without affecting the outcome the Alaskan Republican was laying out her reasons late friday for opposing cabin opt this isn't as she calls agonizing a man in Utah has been charged with threatening to use a biological talk to them as a weapon by sending letters to president Donald Trump\nAnd other leaders containing ground Castro beans assumptions which rice and is derived charging documents filed brought in us district court say thirty nine year old William Clyde out on the third return address was found in the ...
