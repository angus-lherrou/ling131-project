up that I Believe this great good decent country that we all love\nAnd and I know almost all of us do love America right\nI get that we got ... jobs in whack jobs on both sides of the political spectrum but no matter where you are all of view damn near all of you listening to me right now\nI've never doubted that you love your version of your vision of America we all love this great good decent country but I've been telling you\nWhat I Believe for the past eight nine years we are divided this is a divided nation we are a house divided and I've been telling you what I Believe that I don't believe\nThe United states of America can never be United again that's just my opinion we are divided\nTerribly divided he will vote ... divided\nBut we're not just divided over like what a myth that the the corporate tax rate should be or\nHow tall the wall on our southern border should be or\nUm uh what are the budget of the E. P. A. should be we're not divided about little things like that were not divided about basic things like that no we are divided over fundamental principles we are divided\nOver the very principles this country was founded upon were divided over the big stuff\nBig stuff big questions in big issues\n[noise] we are divided but my word I've got to believe\nThat everybody listening to me I got to believe or United on what I'm about to say this beautifully divided country I've got to believe that we are you now you did in a green with what I'm about to say\n\nI've got to believe that we all can damn what happened today\nI've got to believe I Want to believe that Republican Democrat conservative liberal independent whatever the heck you are\nI've got to believe that we all condemn this growing political violence all of it on both sides I gotta believe I Want to believe that we all were United we all condemn\nWhat happened today\nHomemade pipe bombs sent to\nThe Hillary Clinton Brock Obama\nJohn Brennan at the CNN at CNN or George Soros yesterday Eric Holder Maxine Waters\nHomemade explosive devices about six or seven of them sent to those individuals now thankfully nobody was hurt\nThankfully those homemade explosive devices\nDidn't get to bill or Hillary Clinton didn't get to Brock Michelle Obama didn't get to anybody at CNN did not get to George Soros did not get to Eric Holder and did not get to Maxine Waters that's that's the good news\n\nBut you talk about an act of evil you talk about an act of political chair and that's what this was today don't hide don't hide behind that don't call it anything else what happened today this looks to be like a coordinate coordinated act of domestic political terrorism\n\nThat I Want to believe as we get into this this evening and as we talk about\nWhat happened today again I'm going to want to believe that we all will condemn what happened today\nBefore we go back into our political corners Thirteen Days from the mid term election\n\nThis is one of this was one of those days\nEverything just stopped everything just stopped and paused\nIn one after another this morning news came in\n\nA homemade bomb sent to the upstate New York home bill and Hillary Clinton\nAnd then Obama to a homemade bomb sent to the Washington addressed to the Washington DC home of Iraq and Michelle Obama\nAnd then in another within another twenty twenty five minutes a whole may ... the entire Time Warner building in New York City was evacuated the exact same home made explosive device found in the offices of CNN\nAddressed to former CIA director John Brennan by the way these three a homemade explosive devices mailed it to these three individuals are all in one day after the exact\nSame home made device explosive device was sent to the home of George Soros\nAnd then reports of other suspicious packages and then report solve the shame homemade explosive device sent to Eric Holder and then a reports of the exact same\nA homemade explosive device sent to the office of the congressional office of\nA congresswoman Maxine Waters\nAnd as we come on the air this evening the authorities have made clear\nThat all of the devices were identical one cent to Soros in Hillary and Obama and CNN appear to be set by the same individual or individuals\nCount Eric Holder's a is Eric Holder in that as well authorities saying the exact same device that were sent to everybody else was sent to Eric Holder or Maxine Waters as well authorities also reporting that uh these were rather sophisticated\nUh explosive devices\nMay not have been mailed or sent in the most a sophisticated fashion but the devices themselves the authorities are saying we're sophisticated in nature not done by some amateur\nAnd we'll talk about this whole night this crap Scott to end this violence has got to end but it won't it won't on both sides it won't\nAnd we'll talk this evening about the reaction right to this who's to\nBlame right I mean in a nanosecond immediately ... without any facts you immediately at people out in the right saying hey Joel false flag operation\nAnd this was done by Democrats and liberals to make it look like somebody on the right did it and ... in a nanosecond you had people on the left blaming Trump specifically laying the blame for homemade pipe bombs at the feet of Donald Trump\nBefore anybody knew anything before any facts were out there you had disgusting idiots on both\nSides trying to score they're cheap political points so maybe I Am naive\nWhen I think that the country writ large the country all of us at least on this we can agree\nIt's wrong for George Soros to get a bomb in his mail\nIt's wrong for it it's just plain wrong for Bill and Hillary Clinton to get a whole made bomb a pipe bomb in their mailbox\nThat's just wrong it's wrong for somebody to send a live homemade bomb into the CNN mail room that's just wrong\nI Hope and before Tonight Show is over I Hope that I can believe\nAnd know and realize that at least on that we're unified that what happened today is wrong this growing political violence\nThat we've seen now for a few years that has gotten worse the last couple of years uh it's wrong on both sides it's wrong\nI'm not saying it's going to end because I don't think it is [noise] but it's [noise]\n\n\nTell us all you know look guys I Know we're Thirteen Days from a big important election and we're all into it and we're all trying to rally our side and get our voters out but what happened today is wrong right it's good that we disagree on issues it's good that we debate issues it's good that we fight politically but this violence things got an end\nWe got to stop this we're better than this\n\nGod Bless America I I just think the country would be much better served\nIf instead of going to Wisconsin in a big old arena and getting all political and wound up like he does not tonight\n\nThe president of the whole country tonight what happened today wasn't good uh and it could have been a lot worse and I'm going to believe in imagine that there are Americans out they're pretty shaken up by what happened today\nPresident Trump ought to give

this question who's to blame for all of these homemade bombs being sent\nTo all of these a well known individuals who's to blame\nFor this I asked I asked this question because\nPretty quickly\nOnce this thing came down this morning and everybody found out that in George Soros had a bomb delivered to his house and then Hillary and then Obama and CNN and then Eric Holder and then Maxine Waters\nPretty quickly\nPeople on the left and the Democrats right away blame Trump\nRight away blame Trump for what happened today\nA Joe Scarborough Morning Joe he's got the ... he's the guy with the really big head he said the unrelenting hatred churned up by Donald Trump for the two years following twenty sixteen is dangerous a Washington Post columnist is dead and progressive icons are targets of bombs\nHe's blaming Trump or Jennifer Rubin she writes for the Washington Post I'm I'm ... I'm picking a few of them but this has been pretty much in unison song on the left today\nWe are not saying Trump causes bomb threats we are saying that his rhetoric is unlike any of his predecessors it does damage to our democracy and can motivate fringe characters to behave violently he systematically destroys comedy decency and rationality\nWho's to blame for what happened today\nHarvard law professor Laurence Tribe\nEvery single recipient of the bomb packages today so Rowse Obama Clinton Wasserman Schultz folder CNN\nThey've all been a target of Trump's vicious comments at his rock his rallies he didn't like the fire of course and he's condemning it but he brought the can lean and the matches\nAnd on and on it goes another liberal reporter if law enforcement wants to warn for future ... bomb targets all they need to do is check Trump's Twitter feed and played back tapes of his campaign rallies\nAnother liberal activists less than forty eight hours ago Trump told the crowd chanting CNN sucks that I don't like them either end in sight today lock her up chants\nBoth CNN and Hillary Clinton or targeted by mail bombs within thirty eight hours and on\nAnd on and on it goes or the right generally right away all yelled false flag but people on the left I'm interested in this question of blame who's to blame for what happened today these six or seven homemade bombs\nEverybody on the left blaming Trump\nNow I asked this question because I don't blame Trump um but I I've got an issue and I've got to confess about something because I got in trouble about three years ago\nMy timing could be off but I think it was about three years ago you were a member windows five Dallas police officers were gunned down do you remember that\nUm I think about three years ago maybe for\nA and I immediately went on Twitter and I immediately went on the radio when those five Dallas cops were killed by a black lives matter cop hate or and I immediately went on Twitter and I went on and on Facebook and probably on the radio and I blamed Obama\nI said I said President Obama you've got blood on your hands\nFor for six years you have not stood by our cops for six years you said cops are to blame for six years you said capture the problem for six years uh uh you you said cops need to be trained for six years you've said capture racist\nYou've got blood on your hands that somebody was listening to you and they went out and they shot and killed five Dallas police officers\nAnd I got in trouble for that\nUh and I got a bunch of threats for that and I went into hiding for a little bit but I'm thinking about what I said\nA few years ago when I placed blame for the deaths of police officers at the feed a Brock Obama I Believe that and I believe now Brock Obama is an old friend of our men and women and blue I still believe that\nI believed then and I believe now ... do it with our cops whenever there was a cop shooting he always blamed the cop\nAnd I believe them and I believe now that Iraq Obama contributed to a climate\nThat enabled hating on cops\nBut I said a few years ago that Iraq Obama had blood on his hands and he had some responsibility for the deaths of those five Dallas police officers and I'm thinking to myself that I I ... that I I don't believe that's true that's probably one I'd like back\nBecause if I'm consistent right like like Brock Obama a spoke\nHarshly about our cops and then somebody in Dallas goes out and shoots a and kills five cops if I'm going to blame Obama for that well you got Donald Trump or calling\nCNN the enemy of the people and hitting on CNN if somebody goes out and shoot somebody who works at CNN some journalists because Donald Trump says the media is the enemy of the people if I'm consistent then don't I have to blame Trump\nIf if it turns out that some madman here went after all of these people who some madman who's a Trump supporter\nAnd he went after all these people who are Trump critics if I'm consistent just like I blamed by Obama for the cap shootings well then I Would have to blame Trump partly for what happened today\nBut I don't because I Believe at the end of the day the person to blame for what happened today is the person behind these homemade bombs and yeah I I Will criticized until the cows come home or Obama's rhetoric about our cops\nBut I was wrong when I blamed literally blamed Obama\nFor that guy shooting does Dallas cops the guy to blame for shooting those Dallas cops is the guy who pulled the trigger\nI Can't blame yeah does Donald Trump lead the coolest rhetoric yeah does Donald Trump need to clean up his ... little bit yeah just out front and need to dial down the temperature a little bit yeah does Donald Trump need to try to do just a little bit better of a job trying to unify us a little bit yeah sure but\nIt's Donald Trump it all the blame for what some mad man did today hell\nNo hell no we got to be really careful about that\nIt's just like we got to be careful\nAbout our language and the public arena and we all do myself included the members of the media we got to be careful blaming\nPoliticians and people in the media and you know that guy that shot up the uh the baseball the Republican baseball players last year he was a big Bernie Sanders fan you know why that mad man shot Steve ... and the others last year\nBecause he thought Republicans\nA favor the rich he was a big crazy Bernie fan\nYou gotta blame Bernie Sanders for what the heck I did on that baseball field of course not of course not\nIf you do if you blame Obama for that Mad Men shooting the cops a few years ago if you blame Trump\nFor what this bomber did today if you blame Bernie Sanders for what that Bernie fan did on the baseball field last year\nWell oh my gosh you got problems in a free country in a free society because Bernie Sanders has the right generally to say what he believes Donald Trump has a right to say what he believes ... Obama has a right to say what he believes\nYou can't build blaming these people for the acts\nThe evil acts the sick acts\nThat individuals do to me that's a step\nYou can't take I took it a few years ago with Obama and I went too far you can blame Trump for contributing to an environment where\nMan we are like politically man we're we're in each other's face yeah you can blame Trump for some of that you can blame me for some of that you can blame blame Nancy Pelosi for some of that\nSure sure sure I get all of that sure we we live in an ugly political climate right now shore but then some mad crazy man does something steps over the edge and kill somebody you can't blame below sea Walsh\nOf Trump's that who's to blame for what happened today I'm Joe Walsh [noise]\n[noise]\nUm [noise]\nYou know but I'm everything goes through or two years now or a little longer I don't blame them one bit\nAnd Dave thanks um\nThis she ends up the bomb that was at CNN it was reported to be a alive device it did not go off it could have gone off um the other devices\nIs the one guy to George Soros his residence\nOr the again the the the one down Maxine Waters and Eric Holder and Brock Obama be\nYou know they they don't bronco bomb and doesn't go out and get his mail every day uh they they they go somewhere else where they're screened a first and that's where these devices were found\nOr just to kind of be technical on\nThat point um\nLook we live in a divided country right now the rhetoric is heated right now I think it's going to get more heated right now um and I think this is just the road we're on a I think it's imperative that we all condemn violence or as much as we can\nAll violence I'm Joe Walsh [noise]\n[noise] it's time to check more freedom voicemail when you're saying in my job [noise] [noise] [noise]\nSo why are you\nTrying to talk people end up coming to your little cookout to go out in the hand out ... and stuff to get the Republicans get people to vote for the Republicans in Illinois where do you do that\nBecause every time you open your big mouth criticizing Trump undermining Trump all you're doing is undermining all your other people running for office that are Republicans the churches too stupid to understand that you just give bullet after bullet\nTo the Democrats it's no wonder you're not in Congress no more they had to run you out of their Republican Party probably help to help them change your district thanks for nothing [noise]\nShelter would use\nFive five I'll show five\nJobs [noise]\nRevolution\nHas been reloaded [noise] you're listening to the Joe Walsh program is on the street from radio network [noise]\nWith us for\nA news off after ... confirming the two additional suspicious packages addressed a representative Maxine Waters have been intercepted that are similar to parents to five others that were received President Trump is condemning the threat of political violence in calling for unity\nPresident Trump says he's trying to be nice says he criticized senator Tammy Baldwin at a Wisconsin rally Mr Trump's as Baldwin is a radical far left opponent\nWho wants a socialist takeover of healthcare Saudi Arabia's\nCrown prince Mohammed bin Solomon\nSays the killing of Washington Post columnist ... show the will not drive a wedge between the kingdom in Turkey the ... six or eight points to twenty four thousand five hundred eighty three as the ... games were raised for the entire year came to the world series ...

fifty six hundred um we are a Thirteen Days out now Thirteen Days out from the midterms\nThirteen Days out from these elections and the people who are experts\nDo care about the people who are experts well the experts say ah that the Republicans will hold the United States Senate\nAnd the experts believe that the Democrats will uh just barely take control\nOf the Illinois house she's from the Illinois house to the house of representatives the United States House so that's kind of the expert or the the expert opinion out there\nRepublicans hold the Senate Democrats take the house\nI I Know you don't pull over these things you should you have a life thank God yeah the life dog gunner you have a wife I'm Glad for you you have a life or what what part of my job is to pour over this stuff\nThan as I have pored over this stuff the last few weeks I think\nYeah I I I think it's almost impossible nothing's impossible but it's almost impossible for the Democrats to take the Senate\nUm it's the worst map for Democrats in a hundred years or do I mean by that I mean that\n\nMost of the seats up for a reelection are all Democrats seats many more Democrats are running this year than Republicans in the Senate and the vast majority of those Democrats are running in red states\nStates that Trump won Montana North Dakota Indiana West Virginia\nOr even Florida um show the battle in the Senate is being fought on Republican turf so Bahrain Texas\nBarring a\n... a blue ... right I mean off the charts Democrat here\nLike we ain't never seen barring that I I think it's\nPretty safe to say the Republicans will keep the Senate they might even pick up her seat or two\nThe house of representatives\nThat's a different story it's a whole different story and it's being played on a\nDifferent battlefield whole different map\n'em you you've got you've got most of the house seats being fought in suburbs suburban areas or where Trump's numbers are not as strong\nRemember the Democrats only need a net what twenty three seats there are sixty some seats set her up for grabs\nA I often say that when I got elected in twenty ten and the Republicans took control of the house\nWe one sixty two seats in that Tea Party red wave here of twenty ten\nWe one sixty two seats\nAh that's not going to happen this year\n[laughter] ... even if there is the biggest blues tsunami wave ever the the map\nThe congressional map is much more gerrymandered\nAh and and Republicans\nThese past eight years controlled\nMany more governorships\nAnd many more state legislatures\nThey've drawn favorable maps right you know every ten years we do the census and then we draw the new districts well when we did that in a in ... twenty ten\nOr going into effect in twenty twelve um Republicans drew some really nice district so the the map is more gerrymandered than it was for Republicans nationwide than it was in twenty ten\nAnd by the way\nI'm a I'm a I'm a partisan I'm a conservative I'm a Tea Party conservative\nOr the way that we gerrymandered these districts sucks\n\nRepublican Democrat in control doesn't matter\nThe way that we draw these districts who's horrible\nUm partisans in charge like I come from the state of Illinois\nThe Democrats run the state of Illinois show the Democrats get to draw you know I may get to draw the districts to eight years ago they drew the districts and they pretty much true me out of the district\nIn other states that Republicans control they got the pen they get to draw these districts I I don't like any of that\nI don't believe in any of that I I don't think that\nPoliticians I don't think that it should be left up\nTo politicians to draw these districts\nAnd I know most of you agree with me even if you're a partisan Republican or a person Democrat I Know most jubilee agree with me because the polling shows most of the American people\nConcur\nOr that this redistricting nonsense these ugly convoluted gerrymandered districts uh this gerrymandering that goes on we gotta we gotta stop it there's got to be a better way we got to get this process on their hands politicians\nSome sort of non partisan her bipartisan process now there are some states like Iowa\nOr that and do it different and they've got like a commission or a bipartisan commission that draws the districts\nOr a nonpartisan commission there are ways you can do it\nThere are ways you can do it you can use a computer I mean other states are exploring other ways of drawing these districts the point is the way we're doing it now\n\nLeaving it up to politicians to decide who your congressmen Kennedy who your state representative is going to be because remember they draw the state legislative districts as well\nThey draw the federal and they draw the state every year and in most states it is politicians doing this map drawn\nTo state by state thing there are movements within each state to take this power away from the politicians\n\nA long time coming now\nAnd I don't expect great changes eight five five six for two fifty six hundred but be that as it may ah there were many more states back in twenty ten\nOr who were under Republican control and our under Republican control right now so those Republican\nGovernors and Republican lawmakers or drew some pretty damn safe Republican districts there by making it much more difficult\nFor say the Democrats to flip like sixty two seats remember though the Democrats only need to flip twenty three twenty three seats net twenty three\nTo take back control of the house\nMost experts believe they're on their way to doing that now by lot\nYou know maybe they'll net thirty seats maybe they'll ... thirty five seats most of the estimates I've seen are right in there anywhere from thirty to thirty seven seats\nBut either way it's control [noise] not a done deal not for sure thing but it's looking like [noise]\nYou're\nThey got a lot of stars lined up to help him\nBut it ain't a done deal yet it's not a done deal by any means a lot of the seats that the Democrats have to win\nA right now seats held by Republicans are in many in like suburban districts\nAnd these Republicans are putting up really good strong fights\nAnd these races are like\nA lot of them are within the margin of error\nSo you see it I mean it's really it's really really close\nFinal point though on control I'll get to that right now um\nIf the Democrats take over the house\nLife's gonna change pretty dramatically\nYou're giving power to the Democrats\nYou were giving subpoena power to the Democrats\nThe Democrats will try to investigate President Trump out of existence I I don't know you know for sure whether they'll move to impeach him\nBut they will most certainly try to investigate\nInch of him and that's what the next two years will turn out to be\nYou know putting aside just putting aside the fact that the Democrats\nWill stop Trump's agenda\nOr many pieces of which are our agenda building the wall getting tough on the border tax cuts for Americans\nOr the Democrats will stop all of that\nBut they don't want to stop there they're really intent\nOn see when you control the house you control everything\nYou control every committee you have subpoena power you control any bill that's going to be brought to the floor to be voted on that sure that the party in charge controls that\nEight five five six for two fifty six hundred eight five five six for two fifty six hundred so keeping the Democrats from taking over the house\nIs a really really really feel
