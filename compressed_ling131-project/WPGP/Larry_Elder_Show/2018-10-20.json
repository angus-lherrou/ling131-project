have said\nBut I'm not talking about any of that right now I'm not no no and what about what is right now no\nRight now this is a time for you when I to be on us\nRight now this is a time for every Trump supporter for every Republican for every conservative to be honest when it comes to what the president did last night to be honest to be decent\nAnd honest and say that what the president ... ... at a rally in Montana last night was just plain wrong\nAgain I don't care about Maxine Waters and I don't care about all the aid on the left and the violence on the left I'm Talking about President Trump the president of the United states what he\nDid last night at a rally in Montana is dangerous and wrong just stay stay with me\nIt's for the president of the United states to praise and I'd call went against journalists Wong just said that\nDon't be afraid to say that like you say it it's wrong for the president any president\nTo praise God or encourage physical violence against journalists\nAgainst any member of the media\nIf you can't say that if every single Trump supporter can't say that in heaven help us hands in the morning noon better than these violent songs on the left\n\nNot understand what the president did last night you need new ... you need to remember\nExactly what happened in this state of Montana a year ago white before a election day last year twenty Seventeen a special election\nFor a congressional seat in the state of Montana and the public and candidate Greg GM forte\nAbout a day or two before election day with public and candidate for Congress in Montana\nHe swam a reporter and punched him a reporter\n\nHim to the ground and punched him now that Republican or a\nCandidate for Congress he did get elected and at first he denied that he did anything but it was on tape so we had to stop and he was arrested\nMisdemeanor assault charge and in lieu of going to jail for six months he was ordered a ... to pay to serve forty hours community service twenty hours anger management and pays a journalist a bunch in restitution\nHe was a west did he committed a crime he said physically assaulted a journalist simply am a question\nYou may recall that that's what happened a year ago in Montana so fast forward a year\nThe president of the United states in Montana at a rally in Montana last night and he starts to talk about that incident that happened last year\nWith congressman now congressman Greg gene forte\n\nAnd the president United States says this ... number one\nI don't know I\n\nMean Trump number two and I heard about it that we endorse read very early but I had heard that he body slams\n[laughter] and he was up and I said oh this is only open the election or it's just me and I said oh this is terrible elections and I said well\nI Know Montana pretty well I think\nThe president of the United states last night\nApplauding praising a congressman committing physical assault against a member of the media\nThere's no way to describe it\nThe congressmen who physically picked up the journalist\nSwam to the ground jumped on top of the journalists and begin punching them that congressman was arrested he committed a crime here there's the president of the United states last night\nGoing on about what a great thing it was did you see it he body slammed him boy it's my time to buy my kind of guy what a great thing\nIt won him the election do it again baby that's awesome\nI guess just straight up question to start this Friday [noise] is it okay for a member of Congress to physically assault a reporter who asking the question\nIs that okay\n[noise] is it okay for a member of Congress\nTo physically assault a reporter who asks him a question\n'cause if you're gonna defend what Trump did last night if you're going to defend what he did praising and a sliding physical violence\nPhysical violence against a journalist then I'm going to assume that you think it's perfectly okay for a member of Congress to physically beat up a journalist for asking them questions and then if you're cool with that\nIf you're OK with that\nIf you approve of what the president did last night well as far as I'm concerned I don't want to hear you complaining are crying about Maxine Waters I don't want to hear you complaining are crying about violence on the left\n[laughter] I don't want you to moan about Hillary Clinton who said uh the days of being civil or over here you got to ... states baby encouraging physical violence against the media\nJust say it it shouldn't be hard just say it's wrong\nNo matter which is linked to CNN no matter what you think of the reporters no\nMatter what the soldiers on the left to do\nJust say it argued decent enough to say it it's wrong for the president of the United states any president\nObama Bush Reagan Trump it's wrong for any president to encourage and applaud and praise physical violence kill meeting a physical assault\nAgainst a member of the media and again this note she'll friday if you can't say that if you can't say that then heaven help us as a country and all bets are off then\nAnd then I don't want to hear you ever recall in on my radio show and complain about anybody on the left getting violent I don't want you to do that\nMan hey hey no more no more calling up into moaning about Maxine Waters encouraging people to get in the face of members of Congress to know that you can't cry about Maxine Waters anymore not on my show if you're not going to\nCall the president of the night is safe houses is shame on\nAnd your walls [noise]\n\n\n\nLet me

apologizing for raising\nA relatively Dan and they're still doing Hillary it on you know people like that hey Dan bounce all over to Dan Dan it's all night long isn't it physical violence correct\nWill sometimes that lead it wait wait wait or self wait wait wait but if if if a reporter asked you a question and you pick him up and from the ground in punch him that's not appropriate right\nSo that was appropriate but no doubt that camera Trump area\n[noise] okay good I think we made some progress there it's not good [laughter] it's not good when somebody on the left gets violent hand it's not good when a Republican gets violent\n\nAnd I don't think it's good when say somebody on the left ... violent and then Maxine Waters or Nancy Pelosi says yeah man I Love that did you see that that in ... uh punched Ted Cruz that was awesome\n[laughter] that would be a horrible thing for a Nancy Pelosi or Maxine Waters to say just like it's a horrible thing for Donald Trump to say did

from the left already you know at what point you know do you not that back anymore especially at the violence I laid back on the last even more\nGood question can we agree that violence is wrong to begin with absolutely OK okay ... and and it's it's actually Scott it's a really good question because there's been more violence on the left and so like what the president did last night applauding

criticized Trump too much call in and way and yell at me if I spend too much time criticizing Trump that's fine\n[laughter] disagree with me\nWhen I criticized Trump that's cool but don't take the leap that and say well Joe you're not a conservative Joe you're carrying water for the Democrats there are plenty of people\nOn our side Tea Party people and conservatives and I I think really what it is you got two kinds of people right now on our side in this Trump world you got some people who um\nAre Trump supporters are and they can never and we'll never criticized\nAnd that's cool I disagree with that but I respect that opinion might Gallagher he's got a TV show by the way you're going to see my a TV show he's got a radio show all of the country you're going to see Mike Gallagher at

disagree with that but I respect my Gallagher I respect his opinion that's not how I could do radio\nYou got two kinds of people Trump supporters who believe\nTrump can do no wrong and they don't want to ever criticize him\nI disagree with that but I respect it and then you have the other kinds of Trump supporter\nPeople like me and others who\nHe does wrong we're going to criticize them and when he does right we're going to praise him\nBecause it's always been because of the conservative it's always been about the issues to me\nI don't believe in ...\nIt would I Would be lying to you if I came on the radio and praised Trump's terrorists [laughter] I don't believe in big omnibus spending bill that bankrupt this country\nIt would be dishonest to me for ... to come on the radio and praised Trump when he signed that big omnibus spending bill I Can't do that\nI think will make our way through this I think it's perfectly fine for all of us who call ourselves Republicans slash\nConservatives slash Tea Party patriots I think it's fine for all of us to disagree on Trump around the edges and to disagree with Trump's with each other when it comes to how we handle Trump\nI think that's like a natural and you got to decide what you want to listen to you if you only want to listen to somebody who will tell you what you want to hear and they'll never see something bad about Trump's then I'm not your guy\nBut let's not get to a point can we not get to a point where\nEven though we may disagree with aspects of Trump we question who we are politically I'll never ... if you call me and tell me you're a conservative and you support tariffs I'll never quite how disagree with you on tariffs but I'll never question that you're not a conservative\nI mean come on you yell at me till the cows come home because you think of to refine Trump absolutely\nBy the way I think that makes for interesting radio but don't call me up and say I'm not a conservative please don't do that that's just that's just not true\nIt wasn't true when I was in Congress and home my God it's not true now\n[laughter] most most of my Republican friends are they still think that's crazy Tea

winning\nFor the religious rights of men and women just like you but as you know and you do know we are living in a pretty dark time right now often the rights of individuals\nFrom flower shop owners and bakers all the weight of the respected\nNominee used for the Supreme Court can be put in peril\nBy accusations that must be defended in the public square and in courtrooms and see the costs of defending religious rights man\nThose costs could bankrupt the average citizen [laughter]\nThis is where alliance defending freedom comes and they were recently recognized as the most successful law firm to argue for your First Amendment freedoms at the U.S Supreme Court in the last five years and\nThe most exciting part is they fight for your freedom without charging you a dime they don't charge their clients any legal fees but they can't do this without our help\nThis is why we're raising money for alliance defending freedom they rely on the generosity of donors to fight these pivotal and expensive legal battles like jak Philips to Colorado Baker targeted for refusing to create a special cake for a same sex wedding because it violated his religious beliefs\nAlliance defending freedom fought all the way to the Supreme Court and won a seven to decision for jak\nOr Saudi Arabia is general prosecutor an now or early Saturday morning Saudi time\nThat we've seen journalists two mile can show me is in fact dead and they actually put this up on Saudi TV and here's the story right you they they needed to come up with this story because we know the truth\nOr this was a team of Saudi assassins lay in way in that\nConsulate in Turkey and when Saudi journalist entered the consulate\nOr they tortured\nAnd killed him and dismembered and we know the truth that's the truth\nAbout what happened so I guess this is a big step\nThe Saudis admitted within the last hour that he's dead and see it within the last hour that he was killed by the Saudi Government or their story their version is that Jim ... show me or that Saudi journalist\nHe got into fights with people he met\nAt the consulate in he's in a little turkey and then you know unfortunately in the middle of that fight son of a guy and he died it was just ... one of those things right and you and your buddies out at a ball game there's a fight and something bad happens\nThose things happen in the Saudis are blaming a top level Saudi intelligence official\nA or a cause show these death so they needed to find somebody that they could claim they're signing pin this on him because Saudi Arabia there'll probably be a public be heading\nOf this top intelligence official this announcement today comes more than two weeks\nAfter the shooting was last seen in public\nAnd terrain that Saudi consulate\nThe journalist was a frequent critic of Saudi Arabia's royal family and he wrote columns for the Washington Post is Killeen as captured the attention of the entire world\nAnd in fact the Saudi kingdom this afternoon fired\nThat high level intelligence new deputy chief of a general intelligence on not been assigned a series you don't want to be him right now so that's the best you're going to get\nA yeah he's dead he was killed a but it was an accident there was a fight don't you know at the consulate and or the poor guy died that explanation by the way the Saudi explanation that\nHe's out just within the last couple of hours I'm a goes against every report out there\nGoes against our intelligence goes against Turkish intelligence goes against the the audio evidence and ... if [noise] I\nHope you know there there is there's audio off his show he's killing and its audio that we've seen\nIts audio that our secretary of state Mike I'm pale as listen to his probably Ali audio ... that President Trump is less than two audio evidence that proves without a doubt that when can show he entered that consulate\nTeam was immediately rabbi about six to seven Saudis they threw him in a room they torturing him\nThey cut off all of his fingers while he was alive they tortured him rudely and then they killed them ruined early and then they be made him and dismembered him call carried out by a team\nOf Saudi agents look it doesn't matter what the Saudis said you know\nOr will it change anything now or the world will move on and the United states of America that\nI have no doubt that when my pound pale flew out there last week I Know ... it was a good guy is a tough guy I have no doubt that when the pound pale met with the crown prince he said uh listen I'm On my blog ... and my friend are you guys need to come up with something\nThere needs to be an announcement\n\nBy you need a story you need to tell the world what happened and you don't have a lot of time on pay issue that threat earlier this week he told the Saudis you need to put something out we know the guy was killed we know you will kill them there needs to be a story you need to put something out\nAnd here we are at the end of the week with their story\nAnd look if you're disappointed in pound pale and the Trump Administration for not being sufficiently outraged by what happened to this Washington Post reporter\nI\nA Trump\nIs doing with Saudi Arabia what Obama did with Saudi Arabia what George W. Bush did with Saudi Arabia what Bill Clinton did was Saudi Arabia what George W. Bush did with Saudi Arabia ... while ring and it was Saudi Arabia here's the deal right we we ignore\n[laughter] and so many people don't realize how cruel and oppressive Saudi Arabia is\nYou know we think alike or Islamic countries and Islam is one countries and you know we we we are we think vice is and and and al ... these terrorists organizations we think of Iran we think of them are in Saudi Arabia is always overlook and people don't realize how evil and brutal\nSaudi Arabia is what we do business with them they're a business ally ... because of that and generally because we've needed their oil that's the bottom line\nWe even desperately need their oil we've let them do what they do we overlook a lot we've overlook the fact that Fifteen of the Nineteen nine eleven terrorists were salaries we overlook a lot\n\nWe we we purposely the United states does what Trump in the last couple of weeks that's not unusual that's what every American presidents done\n\nOverlook and not make a big deal about how\nEvil the Saudi royal family is we overlook that is really to do business purposely for their oil we\nOverlook purposely and the fact that Saudi Arabia is is basically one of these Muslim countries that still living in the seventh century\nRight again I Know they don't they don't get the rap like Iran and everybody else does and all the all the Muslim terrorist organizations out there running around out there when you know you know that Saudi Arabia leads the world and beheadings every year\nNot even close Saudi Arabia be heads more people than any other country or terrorist

knocked off people are brutalized in tortured in Saudi Arabia all the time you can't be a dissident in Saudi Arabia you can't be cars show me and criticize the royal family in Saudi Arabia or you're

can we punish the Saudis\n\nAs a as as my friend economists Stephen Moore said drill baby drill\nRight [laughter]\nWell let let's make sure we're not dependent upon their oil let's not by their oil let's make our own drill baby here we're energy independent now let me energy dominant that's the best way to get back at the Saudis\n\nBut by the way we're not changed you know we're not can reform Saudi Arabia we're not going to pull them up into the you're twenty Eighteen we're not going by the way we're not going to reform the Muslim world most of the Muslim world is still living in the damn
