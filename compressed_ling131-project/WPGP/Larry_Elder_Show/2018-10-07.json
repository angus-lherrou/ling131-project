devoted to the belief that having a map is useless unless you know where you're going\nYou know exactly where you are but if you don't know where you're going it's useless so what is it all about what are the big issues that's why it's the ultimate issues that we're after all\nSo sometimes something in the news provokes a subject on the male female our or for that matter the happiness or for that matter the ultimate issues out and that is the case\nToday so\nI guess it's ... it's a multi faceted question but it revolves around one issue and that is\nIf you are middle aged adults\nIs it important in assessing you how you active in high school it's obviously based on the Brett Kavanaugh nomination and that's the question you're how old is he exactly fifty four fifty three fifty four or whatever you're so you're in you're almost mid fifties\nIf you let's let's let me put it to you this way if you\nHad an important position in Europe business where your school\nAnd you had unanimous agreement that man had led a remarkably good life as an adult another words from the age of Twenty one\nSo for thirty five thirty four years is whatever has been a remarkable human being contributed to his community a family man\nAs a churchgoer which to me means something to many doesn't\nWould use and what do you pursue allegations of misconduct in high school\nThat's the question I wouldn't if I were hiring for ... for you and I and\nI'm not talking about hiring a twenty two year old the where the proximity to high school is a few years I'm Talking about remember I'm Talking about the age of Brett Kavanaugh somebody applies for a job at ... university is unanimous wanna find human being\nFamily man community man this person has been and then\nUh some charges are brought up about what he did in high school or even the exact same chargers\nOkay I Would ignore them\nIt is clear what type of adult you would have been I Am I'm not going to look at what you were are alleged to do in high school\nSo that's the question that's the it's in how important in assessing a human being is their conduct in high school and high school alone\nNot not not a thirty twenty five but in high school\nOne aide Prager seven seven six eight seven seven to for three triple seven six\nNow\nI don't have I don't have a vested interest in this argument okay I I actually was a good guy and high school and I let an anti cheating on tests campaign that was elected the graduating class president I I was a bird was a good guy basically\nBut I'm I'm sure that you know things could be brought up I mean that I don't even know about\nOr is that didn't happen which is I think is a possibility or in the case of Brett Kavanaugh but happen or not happen [laughter] they\nAh they were kids in in high school who were uh near two wells and who ended up fantastic adults\n\nSo who cares who cares and in effect now I care about how my kids act and high school I acted in high school of course you care about how your kid acts at the age of five that's a separate issue you because you you want to form a good\nPerson as early as possible I I agree with that but in ... in in the perspective of a life and in retrospect\nBut how you acted in high school should have no bearing in undermining once assessment of this person in middle age that's my position do you think do you think it matters that's the question\nOne aide Prager seven seven six\nEight seven seven to for three triple seven six\n\nBig stuff big stuff that people left to answer it's hard for me to believe that anybody listening even Democrats\nHiring a person for a an important position in their business who knew what a terrific person misses and then charges arose from high school within say no I'm Sorry\nIt's clear what type of adult you've been but in high school are you ah you you robbed a a candy store All right that's pretty serious not not not simply\nNot simply shop lifted some candy bars but you threaten the owner and and you robbed\nBut it is obvious you turn your life around ... otherwise what is what one is saying is people cannot turn their lives around we won't let no point to acknowledge that you've turned your life around\nThat's why religious Jews and Christians find this notion particularly offensive because they're both Judaism and Christianity so rooted in the importance\nOf penance of forgiveness\nOf tissue vi and in the Hebrew of of return or that's ...\n\nThat is this famous Hebrew statement that I'm ... I'm literally translating from the Hebrew where a penitentiary stands the most righteous person cannot stand\nYour a higher level if you turn your life around the person who never turned their life around and it's been good the whole time\nThat's how that's how and and of course obviously in both religions forgive right forgive us as we forgive those who trespass against us the whole the whole notion of Christ dying for people sins and forgiveness\nAnd uh\nThe uh Judaism holiest days the day of of of panic tense day of atonement Yom ... so religious Jews and Christians understand of course people can turn their lives around\n\nSo uh I emphatically endorsed the notion that when you were all rolled running in middle age and the lead a good life that's all that matters I have no interest in what you were like in high school\n\nAnd ... where's your cutting cutting off line is el is elementary school right well you know elementary school well yeah but that's what people said until recently about high school All right when a Prager seven seven six\n\nAnd let's go to will in San Antonio hello will Dennis Prager\nI gotta I [noise] [noise] well I guess\nI could just tell you a little story um\nI was a high school through college uh you know did you know living in California there the whole thing the whole party scene and you know pot and coke and everything\nAnd uh it was later arrested for a dealing and went to jail and uh it was kinda funny 'cause when I before I got you know before I got to that's at our website to get away from that it was a navy\nAnd um when I pulled away and pulled out and I kind of caught the last second you know and a ...\nThat food you know about five six years of my life after that word just impossible and very difficult\nBut you know work hard and you know turned my life around ... or um I've been married for twenty five years I've raised three great kids uh one's graduated from college works for major tech company one is a prime your last or the other one is just a sophomore in college\nYeah so the Iraq you're perfect living example of what I'm Talking about the dentist Springer show from the relief factor pain free to the\nOkay\nSharon in Dallas either Sharon\nHi how are you real well thank you good\nOkay oh am I run the same page I never stopped creating and um I have five away some of them were really good in high school some of them I prayed maybe close to God [laughter] all of them\nWould be great yeah just so you know I'd I'd make it you know that the big lie in the media\nIs a shattering thing isn't it if it doesn't matter how you've led a whole adult life that's what's being that in the United states of America\nThen I worked at a school and I was so sad when people see I just ...
