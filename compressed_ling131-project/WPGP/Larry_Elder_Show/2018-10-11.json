tonight and I'll give you the results tomorrow\nPresident Trump's presidency is now almost two years old if you voted against\nTrump argued pleasantly surprised or you bitterly disappointed you have two choices\n\nThere are really a couple of ways to approach it\n\nA couple ways to approach these midterm elections if you're in the conservative media world right now\n[noise] something's going on\nOkay like everybody in this business knows that the Democrats are fired up\nEverybody on Fox News knows the Democrats are fired up and they've been fired up for a long time every conservative talk radio person who you listen to they know\nThat the Democrats have been fired up ever since Donald Trump got elected they're angry there fired up ready to go vote we all know that\nAll the data shows that all the evidence shows that\nSo we can either tell you that\nOr we can ignore the the the the blue wave because we know most to you don't want to hear about the blue wave I mean look I I've got everybody most conservative radio shows they've got people from across the political spectrum who listen\nSo I got Democrats I got independence I got liberals conservatives that got Republicans I've got everybody in between who is listening to me right now but most of the people listening to me right now are Trump supporters most of the people who listen\nTo conservative talk radio they are Republicans slash conservatives\n\nAnd if you're a conservative radio talk show host\nWell you've had to make a decision are you going to be straight with your listeners\nAre you going to tell them that the evidence is clear that data is clear Democrats are fired up their voting at a much higher percentage than Republicans have been voting in every special election and in every primary election students since Donald Trump became president am I going to tell my listeners that\nOr\nAm I going to ignore that and kind of jet Li lie to my listeners 'cause I Know they don't want to hear about the blue wave\n\nNow speaking for me it's it's easy\nIt's it's a it's a decision I never have to make because I just tell you what I think I ... that's the only way I Know how to do radio I tell you the honest to God truth as I see it which is why\nSo many of you now that we're three to four weeks away from the mid term so many of you have grown very tired of me from the beginning\nTalking about the blue wave I didn't want to fool yeah I didn't want to deceive view\nOr shall I start talking about the blue away from the very beginning because I saw the way from the very beginning by the way let me interject here everybody knows a blue wave is common\nThe question is how big is it going to be is it can be big enough to take back the Senate is it can be big enough to take back the house and if not how many seats in the house is the blue wave going to produce everybody knows that a blue wave is come and the question is how big is it going to be\n\nBut see I've had another motive all of these days and all of these weeks talking about the blue wave I talked about it because I Believe it I see it I've seen that for the past Eighteen months\nBut I talk about the blue wave as well I talk about how fired up and angry the Democrats are as well because I Want most of you to get fired up\nI I Know that most people listening to me right now like me you're a conservative like me you don't want the Democrats to take back the house and Senate\nSo I've been ringing the siren\nEvery day every week I've been Paul Revere\nEvery day every week the Democrats are common the Democrats are common because I Want you to rise up I Want I don't want this wave however big it's gonna be I don't want this wave to defeat us I Do not want the Democrats to take control of the house or the Senate\n\nAnd so I've been trying to wake people up to the fact that the Democrat vote is up overnight\nIn the four percent\nThis primary season over twenty fourteen the ... midterms the Republican vote is only up twenty percent that's a big difference Democrats are fired up and they'd been voting\nAnd if our side doesn't get fired up and come out and vote on November six we will most certainly lose the house\nAnd struggle in the Senate\nSo look everybody else you listen to on TALK radio and everybody you watch on Fox News or they got their own reasons for doing what they do for telling you about how fired up Democrats are or for ignoring that 'cause they know you don't want to hear it\nAnd feeding you the bull about the red wave she knew that smoke about the red white and look\nI've even heard guys like candy and I and other people on Fox News who have been poop pulling the blue wave up until about two weeks ago and now all of a sudden you've got Hannity talking about oh my God we got to get out there and all your data yet about there's common these Democrats man they're fired up\nSo even Hannity even got people on Fox News or who who have done their level best these last Eighteen months to ignore what spin in front of them because they don't want to turn you off\nNow even they're forced to acknowledge the reality that the Democrats will be coming out in droves this November\nOnly question is will\nRepublicans will conservatives again this is a\nThis is a really easy decision for me to make\nBecause radio is really easy for me to do all I Do I got this this microphone and all I Do is say exactly what I Believe every single night\nA writer ... every word I order through this microphone is what I Believe them when you just say what you believe it's really easy you don't have to think about what you're going to say right\nYou don't have to calculate you don't have to strategize oh my God what am I going to what am I going to say to my listeners today how am I going to present this no it's easy I just say what I Believe every single day\n\nAnd I believe in my head and I believe in my heart that the Democrats are in fact a\nBurning for war and they're going to come out and vote this November in droves\nAnd the only question mark is will Republicans will conservatives\nNow I understand something um what Hillary Clinton said yesterday that the days of civility are over and a lot of people on our side got bothered by that\nUh I mean the play you a little bit of Eric Holder from the other day Eric Holder was at a campaign event in Georgia\nAnd he pretty much said the same thing and I'll play that for you in a minute Eric Holder told a room full of Democrats baby uh when when when when when it's time for the Democrats to be like the Republicans it's time for the Democrats to kick\nA and steel and do whatever we have to do to win\n\nThat no no no more this when they go ... low we go high business a thank you very much Michelle Obama Eric Holder told the Democrats when they go low we got to go lower I played that for you in a minute and Eric Holder\n\nIs sort of getting abuse from our side like Hillary Clinton got abuse or from our side yesterday when she said you can't be civil anymore\n\nI don't know what the big deal is this is just further evidence\nThat the Democrats are fighting back you understand that our side one in twenty sixteen right our side we got our guy in the White House our side controls the house our side controls that the Senate we just got to good conservatives on the United States Supreme court ah we've been fighting\nAnd we'd been winning and the only thing that's going on right now is the Democrats are fighting back what's the big deal about that\nThere should be nothing surprising about what Hillary Clinton said yesterday or or Eric Holder said last night\nThe Democrats are fighting back as well\nA reminder\nOf how fired up they are and the question is\nWill our size be fired up enough\nTo see\n[noise]\n\nAnd I I Would just argue I put it in front of you again everybody\n\nThere is no better motivation in the world than anger\nAnd the Democrats have it and\nWhen Eric Holder said what he said and Hillary Clinton said what she said forget about what they said look at the reaction every Democrat\nSaid hell yeah when they go low man we kick them when they go low we punch a\nDemocrats are fired up make a make no mistake about it let me go to Chris Chris\nWell Hey Joe first of all thanks for taking my call they let her and I walked away from the Democratic party and if any Democrat tries to kick me I happened to be going to take my conceal carry class this weekend I'd say bring it on but in in regards to the door right being\nUpset about what Hillary and Mr holder said over the last couple of days yes it is what I'm gauging from this isn't so much that gr anybody's irate but they do take some ... with the fact that they're\nThat they're saying that uh they\nThey're somehow they previously some helping classy about the situation which they clearly have I've never seen anybody on the right encourage us to go out and harassed people in public places are abused people which is they been doing for an extended period of time all of a sudden they're saying oh we're going to do this right well\nYou haven't done it right up to this point so forgive me for not buying or be asked\nNo no and Chris I'm not saying that they've been saying just before this all I'm saying this Trump is no saint Trump is now of course now Trump's Trump's not a civil guy he is and that should be and\nI just write voted for exactly and all I'm saying is the Democrats have reached that realization that they really need in SOB to even try to compete with them and and and\nAnd and that's absolutely the truth but they when they tried to say that they've been there they're trying to pass themselves off as having previously been saints which clearly\nNot to do there are a Chris thanks there are no shame on either side [laughter] and let's be real guys there's very little civility on either side this is what a divided country looks like [noise]\nHas been reloaded

I don't know what that means I can tell you a fair colder runs for the Democratic nomination Eric Holder is going to be in that show beat the Democrats believe that's what they have to do to be Trump let me go to\nEd Ed Joe either I'm here man you return\nSo I think you're confusing or to record the older worker you're actually saying is they're telling the population at large liberal\nLeft wearing population at large to go out and fight to get her faces of cabinet members politicians\nAny other Republican to disrupt them out in public they're not they're not\nSame Hillary and Eric Holder or not saying hey we're politicians really to get up liquor that's what you're saying you're you're\nAnd knowing and believing that the Democrats are coming out and vote and and going to vote in huge numbers maybe that will get us fired up to do the same it should be easy but we got to get our folks out the data so far since the whole Kavanaugh saying how to summarize it it's fire Republicans up\nAnd it also fire Democrats up its fire both bases up\nSo what you are seen is you're seen especially in the Senate most people believe that Kavanaugh saying we'll help the Republicans keep the United States Senate and may help the Democrats take control of the house because the base that Kavanaugh facing\nFired up the Republican base and most of these critical Senate races are in red states where you got a lot of Republican base voters so you're seeing states like North Dakota and Tennessee\nAnd Indiana are beginning to come home Republicans in base voters begin to come out\nThat's a good thing\nNow the flip up that is you're seen in a lot\nOf ... in a lot of house races especially house races in the suburbs you're\nSeeing that thing to more blue because you've seen a lot of women a move away from Trump since the Kevin offing let me go to mark hey mark\nI'm good man and one thing that I'm three years old and I I never uh\nAnd I'm a pilot and I've never seen a president after an election go through like a checklist and and and just pick up things on at the end of the rent or his campaign\nAnd that ... thing everybody at the last card at about like buying the Republican Party but for me the solidarity that known to go to school to support 'em\nA sport or have an ... yeah the ... and basically the law is he that's going on that laugh\nYou know I feel it is like a duty and I'm not a political science I've it there's a reason why it election April don't go out and play yes it is the one time we can't do it because they were called artist or a link to get out there on our legislators and we don't end up with the matter ... generally end up with\nIt certainly is a man mark amen and complacency is the key now look typically in mid\nTerm elections Republicans vote in greater numbers than Democrats do\nDemocrats tend to do better in presidential elections\nSo\nFar at least in all of the mid term primaries\nThat's changed\nAgain I just want to put it in front of every Republican and conservative this primary season this mid term primary season\nThe Democrat vote was up Ninety four percent over what it was the last midterm the Republican vote was up about twenty percent\nThat's a big difference right so all look this isn't complicated\nWe know the Democrats are going to come out in record numbers for them for a mid term we know that\nWe don't know what Republican turnout is going to be if Republicans do what they should do if Republicans do a little bit better than they usually do for a mid term election\nWe should be fine but the point I'm trying to make is don't don't sit back and think\nThat the Democrats are not coming out that's a given they will I promise you I promise you the Democrats will come out in record numbers I Know that it's on us the the issue is us hey Eddie Iran man\nThey do a man I'm a Republican again a black person in America or something like that they are coming out they cover it up to that yeah I mean ... they are they got all these young people registering to vote like you can't believe\nSo you can go and he got me 'cause even in the economy being well and the fate of email me well I'm a lot of Trump supporter yeah probably yeah but if he just slow down and just relax for a couple of months\n[laughter] maybe people will just not not liking him a ... like a you know that's

mob\nBehavior on the left behavior that the left won't really call out gimme lemon number one\nI'm willing to admit that I'm waiting for liberals and you know intellectually honest liberals to admit that when you harassed Ted Cruz at a restaurant that is also mop like behavior\n[noise] I don't know why this is even a debate but listen to their stats Matt Lewis saying you know look I'll call out my behavior on our side but when you were rash Ted Cruz and his wife\nInside of a restaurant that's mob behavior and then Don Lemon said this\nPoint I Can't make it gave it up to me up but you know you're you're making a point are you the moderator or the host or are you are giving a liberal moderate or and the host of this so I can tell you that you're giving up\nOn it saying that I'm like look up the word mob and the dictionary\nDon Lemon then proceeded with this\nBy definition you're up the word modern the dictionary you should also as a Republican look at a concert and look at the ... or whatever it is you are whatever it is you are look at the constitution of the United states and it gives people the right to protest\nYeah it it doesn't say where you can fans will will you\nPlease let us\n[noise] and then finally Don Lemon\nAnd you can do whatever you want and you can leave the show if you want but let me finish that well maybe my point okay well then shut up and let me do it\nAll right thank you very much in the constitution you can protest whenever and wherever you want to tell you that you can't do it at a restaurant it doesn't tell you that you can do without a football field doesn't tell you that you can do it on a cable news shows\nAnd you can do it wherever you want them to call people mobs because they are exercising their constitutional right it's just beyond the pale\nThis is really important to understand\nAnd you need to understand this Don Lemon on CNN he's a man of the far left and last night on his show he said that people have a right to harass other people in restaurants\n... a a a dime Lehman said that uh\nYou can chase people into a restaurant and you have a constitutional right to do that a Don Lemon said it is not illegal to protest in restaurants\nDon Lemon said the constitution doesn't say people cannot protest in restaurants\nAnd I want you to understand this because this is how they think the wrong okay you can protest America is all about protests but you can't protest anywhere and everywhere ... member ... ... what\nI what I Want you to do here is understand their mindset and the left believes it's perfectly OK to walk into a private business to walking to a point even establishment a restaurant and protest\nNow that's wrong and every buddy listening to me right now should know that that's wrong yes hello yes you have a right to protest in America but you do not have a right to walk into somebody's business\nAnd protest inside that this is you don't have that right uh you're breaking the law that's called trespassing you will get arrested and the fact that this on CNN Don Lemon does not understand that\nShould concern everybody the fact that Don Lemon\nDoesn't understand that yeah you got a right to protest um what\nRestaurant owner has rights chew and everybody eating dinner in his restaurant they've got rights to\n\nI Want to tell you something what Don Lemon said last night\n[laughter]\nThat it's perfectly okay for a\nGroup of eight to nine and teeth are left is to walk into a restaurant in Washington D. C. and harassed the customer the fact that Don Lemon believes they have a right to do that\nNow that damn scary the fact that he believes that the fact that the left believes that\n\nIf you are a Democrat listening to me right now\nI Hope you understand the difference\nI Hope you understand that you got a right to protest outside that restaurant but you don't have a right to walk into that restaurant and protest and if you do you're going to get arrested in you should get arrested you've broken the law you trust better than\n\nThe people inside that restaurant have rights\nBut we're we are right now that's the lesson today where we are the left either doesn't understand that or won't recognize that this is a guy who's got his own show on CNN\nAnd he doesn't understand the constitution and he doesn't understand the law\nAnd look you and I don't watch down limit on CNN and generally conservatives don't watch Don Lemon on CNN but a bunch of lives do a bunch of left these do and they they they all ... their head they all heard last night that it's perfectly OK to follow a politician into a restaurant and chew harassing\nThe constitution protects my right to do that [noise] that's a skill stuff\n\n\nThe problem Steve is nobody called the police\nAnd so crews and his wife left but yeah hey thank you brother yeah no need for a new law [laughter] there's a lot in the box\nYou know that I Know you know that Steve there's a lot of folks if I don't want a restaurant if I got a restaurant you know nobody can just caught me inside my restaurant and protest I'm On the tops and you're getting your ass or did\n\nThe problem is we're not fighting back against this crap\n\nAnd I would tell every business owner listening to me politician listening to me\nThey crossed that line\nThey crossed that free speech line they crossed that freedom of assembly line\nNehalem call the police\nThis will continue to get increasingly dangerous\nWe got three to four weeks to go before the selection don't know what's going to happen this election and then there's going to be a walk his presidential election two years later this country's divided ah we're not United baby were divided and we're going to get more divided by the day the week the month a year\n[noise] better ...

allowing North Dakota to enforce their voter ID laws\nAmen amen\nSuch a common sense issue right such a doggone commonsense issue if you want to do something as important as voting in this country you ought to have a photo ID show that you can prove you are who you say you are it's\nIt's just that simple the Supreme\nCourt yesterday um refused to toss out a an appeals\nCourt order that allowed a North Dakota to enforce its voter id requirement during the twenty eight teen elections or the request to toss out the order\nCame from a group of Native American residents who are challenging the new state law the new state law in North Dakota requires voters to prevent identification that include Jake current residential street address\nThe challengers to the law argue that the new rule disenfranchise has a disproportionate share of the population because many Native Americans live on reservations with out standard addresses the district court agreed\nAnd then temporarily blocked the north Dakota secretary state\nFrom enforcing the new voter id requirements [noise] during the primary elections um\nBut the eighth circuit court of appeals flock that court order last month\nThe challengers then went directly to the Supreme Court in an urgent request submitted the justice Neil Gorsuch to toss out the your eighth circuit stay arguing that it's left thousands of Native American voters unable to cast ballots\nBut the Supreme Court are denied that request the courts newest member of Brett Kavanaugh did not take part in the decision or are being gee Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg uh obviously filed a dissenting opinion joined by justice Elena\nYeah I'm not [laughter] I read the Bible I see where the evil go yeah\nAnd so it wasn't a surprise to me but at the same time it's like\nIt's still kind of amazing how this bounces off of people's heads you know it's like you know the uh you know whether they're all for it you know that's the real ... and then there are those who don't know but you know are willing to you don't have an open mind about it you know that's one of the things that keep walking them I met a medical here like we can get it\n[laughter] it's God's Nell the movie opens October twelfth so detective star give me give give our listeners a little inside info about him what happens to him in this movie\nA detective stark is is loosely based on a an undercover police officer okay oh that's in the film detective James Woods is is is the main police solve anything he did some undercover work is up and and uh you also some of these characters are kind of blended into each other you know writers to be able to tell a story\nBut really I think I think the most creative liberty that the uh the two it was probably in the creation of the check to start right of [laughter] it fails or if it's it's a it's a pretty much true to the accounts\nYeah ... yeah what job do you are you you're out of the closet in Hollywood so to speak I I yeah honey you [laughter] you are an independent conservative some people call you a Republican I'm ... that's not always easy is it\nDefinitely not definitely not you know and on your main thing is I'm a Christian person yes my my my conservative and me being a Republican is based on that and that makes it even more to it it it can make ... ... ... in Hollywood very lonely a\nBuddy a deal is that how do you do how do you deal with that\nOr I read the word man yeah you know it's it's a you know Jesus said hey they hated me first they don't have to yeah and uh you know I just got a river ... minutes America

it's discouraging it's hard it's devastating you know my livelihood right but you know it it could be a lot worse man and I just try to you know just keep myself ongoing\nAmen do do do you find and I hear yeah and that makes all the sense in the world but do you find the in in in your world there's more antagonism against Christians or or politically against like Republicans or conservatives or is it like a wash\nUh it it it it has its difficulties um uh to different degrees on different angles yeah\nUm you know Republicans are going to have you know one of the eighth or your Republicans I I think a lot of times they make they're a little bit of their own trouble absolutely\nYou know because you know you were were Republicans and conservatives to enable Christians I think one of the problems that they have is that they keep trying to define\nWhat these things are on their own terms yeah you know if I wanted to I I think our own into our our ... and this is me too man I got it for myself and an extra on a call this out yet you know we were we we have a sometimes we're we're too individualistic to own peril we want to be individuals you know and\nAnd I and I I appreciate all that time in doing that we're trying to find things all on terms\nWe end up losing the standard even though we keep talking about having a standard\nRight right hey I wanted to ask you about this and I don't know if it's true but somebody told me you you were supposed to host like screaming event or for the movie uh but but Planned Parenthood like did something to shut it down\nBut that really that are my in my ...

of a radio show every night to talk about alliance defending freedom I appreciate everybody who stepped up with the contribution but do you ever wonder why I'm so strongly urging you to help\nIt's because of alliance defending clients like Calvin Cochran the Atlanta fire chief who lost his job for a starting a men's Bible study in his off duty hours in his voice you can literally here\nUm his strength of character\nI Would gladly lay down in my life in service to save another life\nBecause that's what firefighters and do the one thing we should not have to sacrifice is our God given freedoms the freedom of speech and the freedom of religion these freedoms for which so many in our nation have sacrificed suffered and that we shouldn't be forced to surrender\nI Know you agree with chief Cochran a and alliance defending freedom is fighting on his behalf but alliance defending freedom is providing free legal support\nTo chief Cochran there defending in there fighting for him for free and they do this with everybody who's religious beliefs are under attack\nWe're at the midway point in this week I Hope you're doing well hope your week is going well thank you so much for taking time out of your day out of your night\nTo listen to this radio show I really do appreciate it um\nSomething made me angry earlier today and I want to I Want to tell you about it and I don't know maybe it will make some of you angry as well um member with me it's just all about the issues man\nOr the issues are more important than any politician\nThe issues are more important than Trump\nOr it's the issues man I Want to live in a free country again man I Want a country with a border I Want a country with the border that's defended I Want a country that does not lead anybody into this country who aims to do us harm\nI Want a country where we get to keep them there all the money we make I Want a country where I get to carry a gun wherever I Want to go in this country I I Want to be in charge of my own health care I Want to be responsible for my own family I Want government to stay out of my hair it's all about\nThe issues with me and I will call out\nAny politician Republican or Democrat that\nObstruction blocks or is on the other side of the issues that matter to me\nOkay it's all about the issues and one of the issues that I care deeply about is the border our southern border or call me crazy but I Believe if you are going to call yourself a sovereign nation you've gotta have borders\nThat just seems pretty elementary to me right or that seems to me to be the whole definition of sovereignty\nIf you are going to be a sovereign nation you have to have borders\nAnd and and again color me purple but if if you're going to call it a border or it's gotta be secured\nDefended or it's not a border it's like just a line\nIf you're not going to bother to ... to to defend the border\nOr secure the border\n\nIt's not a border it's just a law now I Want a wall on our southern border I've always wanted a wall no that's actually not always a\nBut certainly the last few years I've wanted a wall on our southern border and the reason I Want a wall on our southern border again is pretty elementary I think walls work hiding walls work I think walls keep people out I think walls do what they are designed to do keep people out\nThere is a reason why she\nCome on now life is really show simple politics so simple\nThere's a reason why you lock your doors to your house there's a reason why you put up a fence around your property\nThere is a reason why you put a gate on your driveway there's a reason why these rich Hollywood celebrities build a big wall around their state\nKeeps people out it works\nThere there's a reason why we have we use walls gates fences um security systems security guards are there's a reason why we uh security cameras there is a reason why we use all of these things\nTo keep people out who don't belong on our property\nRight show the same applies to a country just makes all the sense in the world shame applies to a country if you want to keep people\nOut who don't belong here\nAre then you have to have something on your border you've got to have manpower a you've got to have tanks you've got to have men with guns you've gotta have drones you gotta have technology ah you got to have a wall\nIf you really want to keep people out\nI mean if we didn't want to keep people out of our homes we wouldn't lock our doors hack if we didn't want to keep people out of our homes I Would we even had doors\nWhy do we even have doors\nSee I think it's simple I think it's simple and I think it holds if if we as a nation believe\nThat nobody can and should be in this country illegally\n\nThen we as a nation have an obligation\nTo make sure we keep 'em out\nNow I I'm sure there are people and and even some people on our side or libertarians on our side who believe in open borders ... we know the left in America believes and open borders we know they exist these open borders folk\nAnd is if you want the country to engage in a discussion and the debate on borders then bring it on\nHave that debate let's have that debate\nBut as of right now by the way we'd win that debate because look eighty percent of the American people\nOr do not support open borders the but this has been an eighty twenty issue forever in America thank\nGod eighty percent of the American people recognize recognize a ... that borders are important if you're going to be a sovereign nation\n\nAnd what's interesting about this even though many on the left\nMany Democrats\nEven though they really don't want to have borders and they don't want a wall and they don't want us to secure defend those borders\nThat is not a position that they're\nComfortable taking publicly\nI mean they'll talk about abolishing nice and they'll talk about oh it's terrible that we separate kids from adults at the border they'll get into a lot of this kind of stuff but have you ever heard of a a Democrat politicians say that\nAre just Chuck the borders altogether get rid of the borders altogether no you having\nMe even whack a doodle Bernie Sanders Nancy Pelosi even even though those on the the the far left they're not doing that\nThey're not saying that\nBecause they know what I Know they know what you now know\nEighty seven percent of the American people do not support open borders showy Dana winning position and I guess all I'm saying here is we're we're living kind of\n\nWe're kind of living a lie here in America are because we generally don't do a really good ... we say we want borders and we say we want to secure those borders but we really generally don't do\nUm a a really strong job in fact of securing those borders\nHence the problem that we always seem to have almost no matter who was president\n\nUm I I Want my border secured and a part of securing the border is building a wall because walls work every where they'd been tried around the world\nWalls work they keep people out now coming up\nHere in a second a Republican in Congress today said something\nAbout walls\nA wall on our southern border that just ticks me off a little bit of it into that show\n\nIf that's what she really wanted\nTo eight five five six for two fifty six hundred I don't buy it\nI don't buy it I I think maybe I here's what I think I I think it's a way maybe to try to get Republican voters\nExcited about something so they'll come out and vote\nI think that the Republicans know\nThat the other side is still a little bit more uh enthusiastic than Republicans are\n\nSo McCarthy puts set out this morning a we're going to we're going to get the wall funded we're going to introduce legislation to get the wall funded\n\nAnd they do that so that you and I will say oh hey Joel arch awesome look those Republicans man we're finally going to get the money for a wall we're finally going to get this wall built\n\nEight five five six for two fifty six hundred I'm Sorry guys I'm I'm not buying it don't want to be a Debbie Downer I don't want you to think I'm a Debbie Downer but I'm not buying it\nI'm not after Twenty one months\nNot after Twenty one months of having the Republicans all of them the Republicans in Congress and the president of the United states or a waste opportunity after opportunity after opportunity\nTo build the wall to begin building the wall after all of that but let's just say I I'm just\nI'm not buying it like like I told you a while back um the walls more important to me than than than Trump and I I'm no longer going to listen to the Trump Telhami Telhami he's going to build the wall I'm gonna wait\nTo see if the wall gets built that is what I'm going to do from now on that's where I'm at and and I suggest that's where you should be as\nWell for much more ... it'll make life much easier to\nJust wait to see effective\nAre you ready [noise] throw up
