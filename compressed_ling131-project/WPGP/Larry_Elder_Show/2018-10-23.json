including every Democrat running for office I'm including President Trump and every Republican running for office come on now open your\nEyes every word they order these next Fifteen days it's all about control of the house in control of the Senate and look you know where I stand to have this\nOkay shut the border to build the wall shut that build that wall lock the door shut our border nobody can come in this country illegally end of story there's no it's like I look at this and I'm I'm Wondering like what's the debate what\nIs the issue no seriously I look at this caravan of seven to fourteen thousand people from Honduras Guatemala and Mexico\nI I look at them walking up to our southern border to ring the doorbell they're not going to ring the doorbell they're just going to try to walk through the door I'm looking at this and I'm I'm I'm trying to honestly figure out what is the debate\nWhat's the discussion nobody can just come in\nWhat are we talking about nobody can come into the country illegally I don't care if you got ten people marching up or ten thousand people marching up\nThese Americans these hours our citizens\nI mean my God you know that in Chicago this afternoon six people were shot leaving a funeral outside\nOf a church leaving a funeral six Americans were shot this afternoon way to go to Chicago hey everybody given that Chicago at hand right Democrat Ron gun control rule Chicago\nThat's our problem that's all of our problem to violence on the south side of the city\nI I don't understand is why the these are a bunch of ... look\nI I don't know these people I I'm sure most of them these Hondurans and Guatemalans I'm sure most of them are good people who are just trying to do whatever they can do I mean this to get a better life\nBut what what what's what's the issue\nIt's not our problem\nDon't call me mean spirited don't call me cold hard and it's not our problem\nNow look I Know politics is politics so you got a caravan of ten eleven twelve thousand people marching up to our border it's a political issue I get it but to sit in our problem\nTo sit in our problem I mean think about it in two to three weeks fourteen thousand people are going to hang out outside\nYour house our house excuse me choose me\nCall the place I mean if if if if two hundred people hung out outside your front door what would you do you call the police right in about two to three weeks we're going to have ten fourteen Fifteen thousand people hanging out outside of our border right on our border where do we do\nThis is why we have a military this is why we have a border patrol\n\nThis isn't our problem this is an issue\n\nNo body can just walk into this country no body can invade this country\n\nThis is going to grow weirdly politically\nBoth sides want this caravan issue to grow politically\nThe Republicans think they got a winner\nTrump and the Republicans think they got a winner it's all about the border and national security and by the way Republicans you haven't started to build a wall right what have you done Democrats think they have a winner\nRight the old uh most of the American people are humane and compassionate and they're going to see these women and children at our border in two to three weeks and man that's been a move their votes and this is going to grow as a political issue\n\nBut just give me the facts just give me the facts\nWe have anywhere from ten to fourteen thousand people\nRight now as you listen to me right now this number has grown it was seven thousand people this morning estimates now are somewhere between ten and fourteen thousand people don't you\nTell me that there's not some coordination going on don't you tell me that there's not some organization behind a lot of this don't even do that man\nAnd you've got a lot of people just like jumping in like this is a big parade you got people you have people in Guatemala you got people in Mexico and just jumping out to be part of this caravan coming up to markets coming up to America\nIt'll probably grow some more\nBut the facts declare facts\nJust because you have ten or eleven or twelve\nThousand people from Honduras who are looking for a better life okay I hear ya I get it I feel for you but that does not mean you have a right to come into our country illegally\nIt doesn't mean you have a right to come into America period\nI mean my God what's the number right how many billions around the world right now would love to be in America right for a better life that's not our deal\n\nPresident Trump this morning threatening to cut off financial aid Honduras Guatemala and Mexico if they don't stop this caravan\n\nAgain I don't [noise] you know full disclosure I don't believe anything the president says but that's a good idea especially Mexico we ought to come down like a ton of bricks I'm Mexico right now stop these people\nAnd she think about this\nThey're being cameras in front of these folks right because the media loves this the media wants these people here\nAnd it's only gonna get worse and it's only going to grow the closer they get to our border but most everybody when the cameras put in front of their face they all say the same thing they're looking for a job they're looking to improve their financial situation they won a better life economically excuse me\n\nThat's not a reason to seek asylum that's not a reason to be approved for ... for asylum\n\nPresident Trump rightly talking about engaging the military I Want to tell you something if two three weeks from now we got ten eleven twelve thousand people pounding on our door at the southern border damn straight we ought to have the military down their\nDamn straight we oughta we cannot make the same mistake we

definition of sex the Trump Administration is Dee humanity or did you manage dehumanizing thank you\nTrans gender Americans transgender activists lamb US government plan to define gender male and female and an actual headlines said horrible\nThe Trump Administration wants to define gender as biological sex at birth that's horrible\nTrans genders could be defined out of existence under Trump transgender will be erased under Trump\nAnd on and on and on and it went all because of a memo from the U.S department of health and Human Services that argues that\nSaid are you sitting down 'cause this is like monumental this memo from H H ass argues that\nFederal agencies need a definition of sex and gender that is defined are you ready on a biological basis that it's clear and grounded in science and objective\nAnd administrative all the Trump Administration announced that they are moving forward with efforts\nTo define gender on the basis of biological sex [laughter] and all hell broke loose on the left ... now you need to know again with the Trump Administration is announcing that they are intending to do\nThat's got the left all a Twitter and Democrats are all a Twitter and the algae BP Q W X Y Z community all a Twitter is to say that that section gender is based on biology\nNow that may seem pretty obvious to most of us but\nThis decision by the Trump Administration will reverse or the Obama administration which said that which allowed individuals to choose their own sex for federal government purposes\nFor programs and education and set aside the Obama administration announced that anybody can just be whatever sex or gender they want to be off for the sake of any federal government program\nAnd the new Trump Administration memo making clear no no can't do that can't do that uh we got to base it on like um um science like biology and by the way isn't is always the damn this thing that you and me\nAre and those of us who are not like a crazy about climate change they accuse us of being anti science but damn when it comes when it comes to gender insects or it it it is the law\nThat just doesn't believe in basic things like a biology this is a big deal by the way it's a good thing it's a very good thing with the Trump Administration is doing because it will impact\nOr because of what the Obama administration had done under title nine of the timeline section of the Nineteen Seventy two law that bars sex based discrimination in federally funded education institutions in federal programs\nUm the Trump Administration now making clear\nThat these decisions on sex and gender are going to be based on biology the left is outraged um uh they they they think that uh the words man and woman\nAre are are much more nuanced\nAnd not quite as clear as you and me think like you're either born a male or you're born female you're born with male equipment or you're born with female equipment that's kind of how we always used to do things\nBut the Obama administration expanding tanks and told everybody around the country are made it a recording done it for for federal government program purposes or anybody can just choose their gender\nAnd be their gender\nAnd not have to prove they were born a certain gender\nNow I I Need a stay at the outset here as well that this doesn't mean that if you identify out there is a transgender assist gender or whatever it's not going to second a defined you ought to be existence you can still call your ... and you can still call yourself whatever you want to call yourself\nYou can label yourself whatever you want to label yourself\nWith the Trump Administration will who will do this new memo this new edict reversing the Obama administration what it will do is it will allow

certain number of sub contractors on some sort of project or have to be women run businesses\nWell\nThere needs to be a definition of what woman is\n\nJust cracks me up this is a this is a story in this memo came out earlier today\nOr that the Trump Administration is going to move in this direction\nFor federal government purposes now there will be a clear objective definition of what man is and what woman is and it will be based on biology and it will be based on science it it it just amazes me\nHow the left in show many Democrats have run wild with this and are having such a problem with this\nWhen all we're trying to do is bring some sense into a crazy world that has a lot now like sixty three or Seventy two different gender pronouns\nWhat this move would all will also do this move

especially again when it comes to when it pertains to or the federal government federal government programs education programs\nScience biology just cracks me up the\nSimple fact do here is let's get back to the fact that\nThere's no compelling scientific basis upon which to believe that a person can just change sexes now while a lot of people believe you can do it that's that's what it is it's just the belief\nBut many don't share that belief\nBut but uh for seeing that belief that anybody can be whatever sex or gender they want to be for seeing that belief on the federal government and the implementation of their programs\nWill that's wrong so some good Trump today this Monday bring in a little sanity to the whole sex gender thing a reverse seeing the Obama administration\nPretty soon no longer right for the federal government no longer can anybody just identify as whatever sex they want to identify as hey a John you're on my friend\n[noise] Hey Joe a great fan of uh well ... ...

got to put up with us when they're in public getting in their face\nBut there are Americans as well and they've got rights and you don't have a right to push them you don't it if you see Mitch
