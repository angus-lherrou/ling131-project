presidency he's now almost two years old if you voted against President Trump or do you present presently surprised or or you bitterly disappointed Mr McConnell what percentage of people said that they were ... pleasantly surprised versus bitterly disappointed\nFifty seven percent\n\nActually closer to Seventy percent said that they were um personally surprised only three percent said deeply disappointed\nAbout that now and antifa a group of antifa protesters in Providence Rhode Island where I went to school down as a journalist with well urine\nI mean every single day I come into the studio\nOr in the last month or two\nAnd this will probably continue these final three or four weeks\nBefore these midterm elections and and I'm trying to find out and figure out what I got more than what I can put in front of\nA every Republican and every conservative and every independent and every Trump supporter who's listening to me or that that that I can put in front of the wall that can convene shoe\nOr that we're in trouble this November unless we get off are asked is and we got to get up up off our backsides now because there's something coming\nAnd and I don't know that I've done a real good job I don't even want to say the words blue wave tonight and I'm not gonna\nBut I'll tell you what if this doesn't\nMake you sit up and think oh wow there is something going on this November we better get going we'd better get moving we'd better get work and we'd better get boat and I'd better get everybody I Know up to vote if\nIf this today tonight doesn't get you doing it I don't know what will but I'll I'll Try to come in tomorrow with something else uh is Scott Scott Walker that in my mind are the most successful Republican governor that we have in this entire nation\nAnd I apologize or if I'm offending any other Republican governor throughout America but Walker would be at the top of my list Scott Walker right now Republican governor of the state of Wisconsin right now\nMany of you may not realize it because you know everybody's focused on Trump and we're really focused on the house in the Senate in D.C can we stop the Democrats from taking control of the house and the Senate and it's going to be a battle especially in the house but you need to know\nAs you're heading home tonight\nOr you're still out on the road the night and you're still working the night whatever you're doing you need to know that uh\nThe the most successful if not one of the most popular Republican governors in the entire country right now as we speak is in the fight of his life and when you look at the\nPolls right now the Pauline right now coming out of Wisconsin right now if you're a Batman Governor Scott Walker's knocking when Governor Scott Walker believe it or not is down he's losing to somebody nobody's ever heard of Democrat candidate named Tony Evers\nDoesn't matter it doesn't even matter who Scott Walker's opponent is\nWhat you need to know in and this might surprise some of you\nKnow down down here in Illinois you know we we we have a Republican governor who's way down in the polls and there are Republican governors all over the country who are struggling to get reelected in this difficult year\nBut this ought to put this ought to put\nSome meat on the sandwich for you Scott Walker right now is down\n... unless something changes these final three or four weeks Scott Walker's probably gonna lose Scott Walker Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker he's been a damn successful governor he's got an unbelievable record\nAnd the state of Wisconsin may vote him out a couple of polls out today one poll NBC Marist Poll shows Walker down ten points\nAnother pull the Marquette polls show Scott Walker down a point in all the polls I've seen seven eight nine ten eleven the last seven eight nine ten eleven polls I've seen\nHave all said the same thing the racist clothes and Scott Walker is a little bit down I never look at any one poll you should never look at any one poll I Try to look at all of the polls the average of all of the polls and right now Scott Walker is down by a little\nBit and that might surprise a lot of you but it shouldn't if you're paying attention right now\nPolitically to what's going on in this country\nIt shouldn't surprise you it makes all the sense in the world we won in November twenty six team we won we won\nOur guy punch them in the face knocked them out we won\nAnd the other side [noise] still\nThe other side has not gotten over that\nBut the other side has spent the past Twenty one\nMonths regrouping and reorganizing and figuring\nOut how to fight back and they're doing it and they're doing it again\nI you look at polls all over the country what's happening to Scott Walker is happening to Republicans Republican members of the house all over the country and Republican governors all over the country this\nSenate I think in large measure because of what happened to Brett Kavanaugh it looks like a number of the\nSenate races are coming home Tennessee and North Dakota and even Indiana a number of these are coming home but still some tough ones in the Senate\nBut when you think about a guy like Scott Walker\n\nYou think about all he's done staring down the unions all he's done when it comes to education reform all he's done when it comes to welfare reform and amazing record financially fiscally\nIn the state of Wisconsin Scott Walker he's had an amazing run the last eight years\nAnd in an ordinary year\nMost common sense people in the state like Wisconsin should look at Walker look at his record look at the quality of the guy he is\nAnd you should get reelected but this is not an ordinary year and what is happening in Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker's down right now\n... Wisconsin is kind of a purple state\nA balance of Republicans and Democrats and independents\nFor walk her to be down that means one thing that means the Democrats are more fired up in the state of Wisconsin\nPlain and simple that means more Democrats are coming out to vote than they typically had come out to vote in mid term diesel poles of likely voters that means Democrats are coming out and they're coming out in the state of Wisconsin in pretty record numbers it's it's almost not even a reflection of Walker\nHistory tells us\nThat this first midterm uh is a tough mid term\nFor the president's and for the president's party\nOn average the ... that we lose on average I think in this first midterm after a un president is elected you lose like ... on average thirty house seats and four or five Senate seats on average got nothing to do with Trump\nBut then on top of that you put Trump\nAnd the the the feelings rehab for Trump\nDe ... you have for Trump the strong belief you haven't what Trump's doing right you're fired up you're fired up you're fired up okay good\nBut the other side is as fired up in opposition to Trump\n\nAnd in the last Twenty one months they've been coming out to vote more than you and I have\nIn this this doesn't change a good man\nAnd a really good governor like Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker is going to lose I I wanted to put this in front of everybody listening to me tonight because I'm hoping it might jolt you all a little bit\nIf if Scott Walker's in trouble\nIf Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker is going to lose well then a lot of Republicans are going to lose ...\nWake up Wisconsin Republican's wakeup Wisconsin conservatives and independents who believe in fiscal sanity\nYou got three four weeks to try to save Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker\nYou you've been warned\nAnd all of us outside of Wisconsin should take this warning and do what we can in our respective\nAreas [noise] to make sure we fight liked it it can get your public insulin [noise]\nI'm Joe Walsh show going [noise]\nAnd the other foreign in this according to the recalls looking at\nThe big picture that helped Trump was the agricultural community\nBut with the terrorists now in China hurting and the Democrats have banging on the door with these these terrorists and they gave specific examples\nYeah the tractor dictating how do we how do these another one having a big menu and they're they're being ... out of European China because terrorists and people that that means that hitting that and the guy and thanks for listening to me I really appreciate you got a great show\nThat the metal thank you man thanks thanks for checking in let me quickly get to Bryan before I hop hey Brian you're on with Joe\nHow's it going I'm good man okay so I'd have to say that it's a combination of Republicans that being strong enough right now and\nDemocrats are fired up yes here in Illinois most certainly around or has it been as weak as anyone can get and that's why you see J. B. Pritzker almost twenty ... had to have him\nYeah you know Brian suffice to say we have our own unique issues and problems here in the state of Illinois that's why I wanted to put Scott Walker in front of everybody Scott Walker right now is in the fight of his political life\nUm that should wake you up to the fact that our side had better get moving we got three to four weeks to turn this thing around we can do it [noise]\nBut you can't be blind to what's going on\n[noise]\nTime to check more freedom voicemail when you're sitting in my job [noise]\nOn your favorite fast time has

this Thursday I I Want to thank everybody here at the outset because look we've uh\nWe've been working with alliance defending freedom all month so far this month of October we're wasting money that's what we're doing we're raising money for alliance defending freedom a great non profit organization that is out there defending on the front lines defending\nReligious freedom for Americans and we're taking time away I Am from my radio show to ask you to make a contribution to alliance defending freedom [laughter] I'm so grateful to all of you who are already over already made a contribution\nAnd you're helping us helpless outstanding organization continue the battle\nFor religious freedom all across America there are\nPlenty of things that continue to need our attention we're we're praying for the folks down in Florida Georgia and the Carolinas they're still cleaning up from\nHurricane Michael and they will for a long long time there's this most important mid term elections coming up and just twenty six days\nBut the battle to preserve our right my right injure right to our religious freedom goes on year round in every corner in America and uh that's why\nAlliance defending freedom ah\nThat's where alliance defending freedom comes in its second to none again you've heard me say before there's no other group in the country that defends religious freedom like alliance defending freedom does and they're winning cases cases before the Supreme Court [noise] uh but they provide free legal support\nI Will say at the outset or what I Believe and maybe it'll get me in trouble one day again if I ever tried to run for office but I'm going to say uh because I Believe it um I\nI think we make it too damn easy for people in this country to vote\nOh there's a commercial right there right that there that will be a commercial against Joe Walsh I think we make it too damn easy\nFor people in this country to vote I think if you want to vote you got to get off your ass and go vote\nI think if you're not registered to vote I think you got to get off your ass and go get yourself registered to vote\nI mean is is that is that asking too much that that you ought to have a little bit of skin in the game but we can continue\nTo make laws to try to make it as easy as possible for people to get registered to vote and then devote I'm telling you what there's going to come a day there will come a day in America\nI don't know how how far we are way from this but it's coming\nThere is getting a common day in America where you will not have to leave your house on election day you can sit on your couch somebody's going to wring your doorbell they're going to bring your pizza and a soda and and they'll come to you you won't have to leave your house to bring your ballot\nPizza and a soda and you can just sit there and vote in your own home I Swear to God we're making it so\nDamn easy for people to vote I think people should have to show some effort I Want people to show some effort I Want it to mean something to people\nFirst of all to get themselves registered to vote and then the boat and if people can't get off their rear ends and go vote or get off their rear ends and go register to vote I don't want 'em boating these these motor voter laws ...\nStates like California where where the state\nAutomatically registered to vote when you go into a DMV when you get your driver's license or when you get your driver's license renewed automatically if you're not registered to vote the state will automatically registered to vote I don't think the states should be able to do that I don't think government should be able to do that\nAutomatically registered to vote what if you don't want to be registered to vote\nAnd again if you're gonna get registered to vote go get yourself registered to vote you remember ah what was it early September\nA California which has the motor voter program um you you enter a DMV you get a driver's license you get that license renewed you're automatically registered and in early September a came out who write books\nOr California found that over twenty three thousand people were wrongly registered to vote\nAt the DMV\nWrongly registered to vote when they when the department of motor vehicles over twenty three thousand people\n\nCalifornia are delivered that groups in early September just two days ago California said whoops we found another\nFifteen hundred people that the state of California wrongly registered to vote\nSo now we're up to almost twenty five thousand people and I guarantee you in another week or two or three it will be the same thing over more people bright right here in California other states have this in California the state automatically registered to vote\nAnd California is the knowledge in just in this last month they acknowledged two days ago that Fifteen hundred more people who went into the DMV\nWere wrongly registered that number's going to keep going up to your registering the state is registering people to vote who are not eligible to vote\nIllegals people in this country illegally and others ... ... and is it is it any surprise that this was going on\nWhen the government automatically registered to people to vote is it any surprise\nThat the government's going to make some mistakes\nAnd register people to vote who are not eligible to vote and then if you play it out with me is it any surprise that these people vote isn't any surprise right that there's voter fraud in California other states around the country would you would all be surprised that people who are in this country illegally and there are a hell\nOf a lot of them out in California who are in this country illegally and now we're finding out there are a hell of a lot of people out in the state of California who are in this country illegally who have been\nAccidentally registered to vote\nWhen they went into a DMV not not a surprise\nBut again California like the state of Illinois like other states around the country now give people in this country illegally driver's licenses so would you be surprised\nRight you've got a system like that more than a million and a half illegals in the state of California have secured California driver's license\nYou not do the math for me right about a million and a half illegals in California now have driver's licenses\nAnybody in California who goes into a DMV\nAnd get your driver's license or gets their license renewed is automatically registered to vote\nDo the math do the math add that up data\nSpelled voter fraud for me please\nSpell people voting who are not supposed to be voting I mean that's what California acknowledged again this week when they\n[laughter] confessed to finding just two days ago California confessed to finding another Fifteen hundred people who are registered to vote\nWho shouldn't be registered to vote\nI guess in the internal audit was done of the department of motor vehicles this isn't a surprise and it shouldn't be the case but when you allow the government do I don't know\nWhen you allow the government [laughter] when you allow the government to give id and or driver's licenses to people in the country illegally you're gonna have fraud you gonna have problems\nAnd then when you decide that the government will automatically register anybody who gets a driver's license to vote automatically will register them to vote whether they want to be registered or not whether they're eligible to be registered or not\nYou're gonna have problems and California's having problems right now\nAnd and they're just fessed seen up to finding maybe twenty five thousand illegals and others who [laughter] who the state automatically registered\nAnd I don't know right if you're in this country illegally if you're not eligible to vote but you get this thing from the government that says you're registered to vote I don't\nNo I Can't imagine some of them are gonna vote\nWe make it too easy\nNot now again I could spend two hours just telling you philosophically why I don't think we should make it easy for people to vote\nBut look at the problems look at the corruption look at the fraud\nAnd I'm just picking on California today\nI could do with this with any of the states\n\nThis just seems like such a common sense issue to me and this just seems like an issue that Republicans ought to be hollering about every day\n\nI I don't know why some Republicans are afraid to say what I just said\nYeah I mean it goes against my libertarian principles that we allow the government to automatically register people\nGet out of my business get out of my life if I Want to register I'll get myself registered don't you government automatically registered me\nBut California\nIs registering a whole bunch of illegals to vote and I can guarantee you\nWe got a lot of important race is a lot of important congressional races in three to four weeks in the state of California in fact many of these house races in the state of California will probably determine who will control the house I can guarantee you\nThere was fraud and there's going to be big time\nVoter fraud in state of California is guaranteed I'm Joe Walsh of\n\n\nWill stay on the line resting and I'll give you the final word\nThis is a tricky one because and let's talk about California in general\nMy solution would be to reverse what California did so I don't believe in motor voter a automatic registration I don't believe the state should automatically register anybody devote so that would be a solution I\nDon't believe the state should give people in this country illegally driver's license is so my solution rusty and I know it's that can happen in California is I Would a reverse uh what California has done the last couple of years I'll give you the final word\nThat's fair enough I have not found much why what I mean if you're if\nYou're like well but rush the ... and I admit you got me on this one because you and I know it's not going to happen\nUh it's not going to happen in California thank you brother thanks for checking in a ... it's it's a good question rusty what is my solution right and again my flip answer is the solution is don't do a California did don't do it Illinois did\n\nDon't make it easy much my solution don't make it easy for people to vote in this country don't make it easy for people to register to vote I'm not saying don't make it I don't want to make it difficult but don't make it easy\nAnd and for heaven's sakes do not give anybody in this country illegally government issued id but data that that horse left the bar and a few years ago\n[noise]\nTime to check more freedom voicemail when you're saying about you [noise]\nWe don't have
