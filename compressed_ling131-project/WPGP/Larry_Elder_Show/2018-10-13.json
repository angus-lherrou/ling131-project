especially rough on the price of them\nAnd we went back and forth for about twenty twenty five minutes\nAnd he was the one then that eventually said look\nI don't trust the man\nHe said this to me I don't like him I think he's kind of a son of a gun I think he's kind of a jerk\nBut you know what he's doing and I believe in God pay him to run this country\nNow\nThat's odd people before God has people of questionable behavior before\n\nHe ended the conversation was sad\nYeah whenever you think it's wrong Joe I just I think look I I think he's using chosen to leave this can be lead this country right now I think God picked him I think God brought him to us\n\nAnd I have spent most of the day in over in that\nIn many regards it makes sense to me yeah God God takes all kinds of interesting people to do interesting things\nGod picks all kind of all kinds of people with problems in his shoes to lead at various times in the history of this world\nBut if I pick controlling almost two years ago\nTo become president of the United states then I'm assuming got picked Obama as well\nRight\nI mean you you can't get away from that\nAnd I know I've got everybody listening to me right now people from across the political spectrum listening to me right now people of all political beliefs people of all religious faiths and I generally hear from conservatives\nThat notion that

time\n\nAnd when I think about that I always try to immediately throw it right back at them okay I Believe that but thank God did pick Obama too right God pick for Rocco bomb it to be president United

like to kind of launch on this no chill friday that discussion do you believe God picked Trump\nOr as flawed as he is\nGod picked him to leave this country at this moment in time and if you believe that than God picked Iraq Obama in two thousand and eight and son of a gun by a guy decided to have block Obama re elected in two thousand and twelve I don't think\nYou can tell me that got picked trumpet he had nothing to do with Obama that was like one that snuck through God didn't see that one comment [noise]\nI I I I I Want you to answer that I Want to drill down on this\nAnd maybe you don't believe even if you're a God fearing man or a God fearing woman maybe you don't believe that God did\nPick Trump end or all by the American people did\nBut I don't think I don't think you can separate it and this is what I've been wrestling with all day\nI I'm not looking you know me I I Am still where I was I I'm Still today where I was\nA two years ago almost two years ago when I voted for Trump when I voted for Trump two years ago I said I don't like the kind of person he is but I'm voting for him 'cause I hate Hillary\nAnd I want a Supreme Court justice or two and I want a wall on my border and I want us to get tough with Muslims who are trying to enter this country\nI voted for Trump because of the Supreme Court he wouldn't Hillary and maybe one or two other issues I voted for Trump not really like him who he was and I still don't light curry is\nI haven't changed at all\nBut it's an interesting notion that even if you believe Trump's not\nReally a good guy\n\nWell God has picked men and women\nThroughout history who've been great sinners so it's not a stretch is it and it's not a reach is it that God picked this guy was that hair\nAnd he said I Know you got issues Donald Trump\nBut you are gonna kick this country I Want you to kick this country's political system in the by right now you're going to be president but see my issue is my problem is\nI I've heard from many of my my my fellow Christian conservatives who loved and get on that soap box right you loved me you love to get in that alter and you love the saying God picked Trump Trump is chosen by God but then what about Obama right and and you have a hard time with that\nWell you don't want to go there\n\nGod wanted black Obama to be president his country to in fact you want to block Obama so much you want to block Obama reelected in twenty twelve\n\nI I think it's either both or or God had nothing to do with either one but you can't cut debt cake\nYou can't tell me maybe you can and if you want to try please do that and God picked Trump but he had nothing to do with Obama because uh she never pick somebody like Obama\nI I don't know how you wrestle there with that one\n\nBut I Apologize I'm been pondering on this all day and so this note chill friday I wanted to start here give me a call\nDid God pick Trump warts and all to run this country right now\nAnd they see did [noise]\nHe

don't chilling friday [noise] see coughing up every day you are saying cops every day and [noise]\nWith our men and women in\nWhy don't conservatives\nOr teach\nIt in academia\nTrue if you look at pretty much any school\nFrom grade school the high school college eighty Ninety percent of the teachers and professors are on the left\nThey're all lives\nThey were all rock bottom a supporters they all voted for Hillary Clinton\nThey generally all believe in\nGovernment run health care\nIn a pathway to citizenship for illegal so they're on the left\nPeople on the laugh teach in our schools you know what\nYou've ... you've heard about it you've seen the polling you've seen the data\nYou raise your kids you experienced it first and\nMost teachers are Democrats\nWhy why is that\nA friend last night asked me that\nUh he's got younger kids grade school and high school\nMine are all grown up beyond college\nMan he's experiencing it right now\nHe's frustrated with a is\nA kid's a child's high school teachers and his children's grade schoolteachers\nAnd told me are the ones in high school is Russia\nThey can't stand strong\nAnd a according to rate is on\nThe voice their displeasure of strong\nI'm more than your side of the nation in the classroom\n\nAnd his kids are these kids grade schoolteachers\n[noise] he laughed and he just says are like hardcore left the ...\nAnd he asked me was that the case I said he says it's probably an easy obvious answer but how come\nPretty much all teachers are Democrats not all pretty much all\nWhy is that\nI told them is the answer is pretty simple\nConservatives don't get into teaching conservatives generally go into business and want to make money\nThat's yet and that's not going to change to people\nWho are on the right side of the aisle side that they want to teach\nMe never change\nThat may never change\nThat's the short answer\nConsumed conservative generally don't go into that field\nAnd they don't go into that field is generally\nA because they'd rather make more money\nAnd I got no problem\nI mean are lips lips tend to go into teaching\nConservatives tend to go into business\nThey want to make money lips or don't want to have to compete and they just kind of want to do move or whatever\nThat's the short answer\nAny I mean he promised me a little bit on come on why don't it's not just among the why don't conservatives\nGet into the teaching profession\nI said I it is primarily financial\nOutlook back on my experience and I look back on people I knew\nAnd it was pretty clear like high school and I especially in college\nOr people who fought like I did uh the the major and in some sort of business field\nOr they were going to go or law school or they were going to go to business school\nOr they were going to go work on a board of trade they're going to be a traitor they ran beyond us true they were gonna they were going to go into business\n\nAnd the few people I knew were hardcore Democrats\nWell you saw them\nMore like a liberal arts stuff\nUm [noise] to teach to study\nTo go to graduate school and get a masters in a PHD in history\nTo be a social worker and those sorts of fields\nGenerally a track track it and still attracting flies to laugh and that's that's what that's what we're up against how does that change\nWhy I I don't know that it dies\nOr unless the\nFinancials\nAcademia change\nI think it's always going to be the case that Seventy eighty Ninety percent\nOf people in teaching profession are gonna be the last summer\n... you it's it's not\nEnough of a free market\nWhere you can go into those professions in those fields and make a decent amount of money and make it worth it\nSo I don't see a change Jean and I'm not necessarily saying that\nI'm not gonna try to\nYoung conservatives from going out there and this and this and making a killing trying to make a lot of money\nThat is the American way\nThe only way it does change is is\nTeaching job has become more competitive\nMore of a market\nUm thereby\nDrawing more people from outside into that profession\n\nBut I don't see that happening\nSo\nWhat are we left with them\nWhile we're left with\nThe situation that my friends and um\nAnd then many of you have banned in and out I was in one of my kids were younger\nGiven\nYou know what the journalists right\nYour kids are going to be taught lives by people in the last to given\nAnd so you've got to do the best you can do\nTo kind of try to balance or\nOr to help your child work through that\n\nUntil your child then goes off to college and get some on the same\n\nAnd then he or she got to figure out for himself himself or herself\n\nBecause that's not going to change and um we're talking about teaching but look most people in the hour [noise]\nMusicians and actors in the rye or some comedians something they're always going to be more left of center people left of center are drawn to those professions\nNow I hear you and I hear others are on the conservative side\nAge old socks on my kids' teachers are liberals why I don't\nI don't listen to the complaints as much as I used to\nBecause people on our side on our team are choosing\nTo go into teaching\nSo if\nIf you're not going to go teach\nI mean you've got a right to do whatever you want but if you complain about\nOn the left face and in the teaching profession I don't know but I'm going to listen to the U.S [noise]\nKnow that I'm going to listen and watch anymore to have you\nOn to the larger side decides to get into that profession then that's not going\nA five five six for two fifty six hundred\nUh it is up to a U.S as parents\nUm to do a better job of\nRacing Arkansas\n\n\n\nWell it's made it possible for us not to be so dependent\nUpon a few sources and those shoes sources always were traditionally leftist\nLeft of center\nNow the danger and there is a danger\nIs that we've become so Balkan eyes that\nWe we don't share\nCommon set of facts\nLike if you watch Fox News\nYou will get a come lately\nDifferent news\nThen if you watch MSNBC every night\nNot just a different spin\nNot just the different biased to a different angle you will get a completely\nDifferent news you will get a completely different set of facts\nI Know this because I Do this\nI Will watch Fox News for an hour and then I'll flip over and I'll watch CNN for an hour\nAnd I'm telling you\nThey're talking about two totally different things to come sleep lead different topics\nAnd if there ever talking about the same issue forget about it\nYou have no clue that they're talking about the same issue\nBecause you get a completely different set of facts you look at like uh this this Russia investigation and Mueller investigation\nPeople who watch Fox News\nOr being told something\nCompletely different\nAbout some older investigation night after night after night after night\nThan people who say watch MSNBC I mean completely different\nCompletely different basic notions\nOf what the Mueller investigation is\nThat can present problems\nRight\nAnd and most people don't do this and we'll never do this but I
