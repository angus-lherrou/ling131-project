what you stand for what you care about that's why I Believe if we are fortunate enough to win back the house hand or the Senate that ... can start a band\nYou cannot be civil with a political party\nThat wants to destroy what you stand for Hillary this morning you can't be civil man with the Republicans they're trying to destroy us she set can't be civil man nope just got a pound of just got to go to war can't be civil camping nice can't be respectful\nAnd even the media class\nWent oh real horrible thing to say what a horrible thing to say and so many Republicans and conservatives today\nA gas that what she said offended by what she said there's Hillary Clinton basically saying you know what a it's open warfare with the other party don't even try to be civil\nI gotta tell ya I gotta tell ya I find that pretty comical nice to hear me out guys hear me out I don't like Hillary but when I hear people on our side when I hear Republicans and conservatives condemning Hillary Clinton\nFor ... and really what it would include Hillary Clinton just recommend Democrats do their abandon civility that's what she said a band in all civility all he who enter hear\n\nRepublicans and conservatives are offended by that they took her to task for that today\n\nCome on now seriously seriously you're going to get on Hillary Clinton\n\nFor telling Democrats not to be civil\n\nWhen you've got Donald Trump in the White House\nWho let's be real if you want to be honest are you ready to be honest or not\nWrite a Trump's got a lot of strength she's got a lot of flaws baby but a civility is not something he leads us how 'bout that\nI'm trying to be diplomatic right Donald Trump did not make a name for himself being simple Donald Trump did not get elected president he didn't win that Dan gum or a nomination and then when the general election bean civil\n\nDonald Trump doesn't believe in civility\nSo all the ... if there is any real if there's any Trump supporter who's offended that Hillary Clinton says no more no mosque baby can we be civil and and you support Trump\n... and if you're honest and I know it's hard to be honest but you know Trump's out of civil guy that's not what he does that's not what he leads with man he leaves with insults he leads with punching upside the head Donald Trump has no interest in civility\nAnd most of us most Trump supporters have been just fine with\nIt in fact I'd argue it's a key to his success I just don't want you complaining about Hillary saying the same thing there's plenty to get angry about with Hillary\nNot this

to the corner that life is going to spend anything they got that say back on you and there'll be their fault but they're in that argument or in the first place\nA lame at at all I ... it might be great call thank you brother I got nothing to say I agree with everything you just said\nI I agree with everything you just said I Want to say this though Hillary Clinton's getting a lot of crap today for saying that we need to get rid of civility in our politics\nI'm Sorry I got no problem with that that's what Trump is done for two years if you got a problem with it then you should have a problem with Trump's not being civil I got no problem with anybody being not civil we are a divided nation we are a nation at war\nOr we are in an IT logical more here we are having a fight over the very essence of what it means to be America okay things are going to get ugly things are going to get violent things are going to get messy\nWe're not going to be civil for probably some time\nI I don't want it to sound like I'm defending Hillary I'm not\nI'm Glad she's speaking\nI think he can rip her for a lot\nLike when she talks about how Republicans went after her when she defended her husband rapist right that that's all good that's all fine\nWith this one now that we should just say I'm Joe Walsh don't going [noise]\n\nWell hey Jason you make a great point and I agree with a lot of that it's kind of what we wanted we wanted a ... on civil jerk doesn't that make sense Jason\nBut doesn't make sense that the Democrats like Hillary saw that and now they're saying you know what to be Trump weren't going to need and um civil SOB as well doesn't that kind of makes it\nSo that I never I never looked at it like that before that's interesting\nYeah maybe maybe they learn Jason I really appreciate man could call call again I look at this and I think the Democrats are just learning from Trump look guys don't don't life is too short just be honest Donald Trump has been on civil SOB\nYou know that even those of you out there that worship him you know that\nWell he's been pretty damn successful show you that that's all Hillary said you're the Democrats what's what is she saying what is she telling her fellow Democrats you know what done or done being nice the only way Democrats can win is if we have our own on civil SOB\nThat's all she said I got no problem with it I don't like Hillary but I got a problem with that and and you shouldn't either\n\nBut don't tell anybody that I kinda sorta complimented Hillary 'cause I don't think I did [noise] I don't think I did

conservatives\nI Know you're tired of me you're tired of me already aren't ya there's a blue wave coming wake up Republicans\nI've been on this kick a pretty much ever since the president got elected\nI Am on this kick because I Do not want us to lose the house or Senate this November that's why I'm On this kick that's why for the past year and a half\nI've been talking about the blue wave that's why for the past year and a half I've been talking about how angry pissed off and fired up Democrats are\nBecause I'm trying in my own little way it's all I'm doing in my own little way I'm trying to wake up our shot period that's all I'm doing\nI voted for this president I'm Glad he won a I I I I wanted the disruption I wanted a lot of what he's brought 'em but I've watched that\nEver since Donald Trump raised his right hand and was sworn in and became the Ford or the president United States\nI've seen on the other side something pretty dramatic happening I've seen the other side fired up [noise]\nLike I haven't seen our side since two thousand and ten right when\nOur side was angry and fired up because Obama was president and they shoved Obamacare down our throats and that kind of anger that kind of fired up miss a help get guys like me elected and gave a the Republicans the house of representatives\nAnd I've watched over the course of the last year and a half in every single special election or the Democrat vote way way way up the Republican vote just kind of hand\nAnd then I've noticed in all of the primaries the Democrat vote is up over Ninety percent\nFrom the last midterm twenty fourteen Republican boat up about twenty percent Democrat vote up over Ninety percent this primary season\n\nAnd I'm thinking to myself I Know because I recognize that there's something going on I'm thinking to myself look I get it\nThe other side's angry they're out of power I get it right our guys in the White House they're angry we know what that feels like don't we right when I went\nWhen their guy was in the White House when Obama was in the White House remember how angry we were remember how angry you were when Obama was in the White House rights member that anger\nThat anger is an incredible thing do you remember what that anger cause you to do\nRight that anger you go back to two thousand and ten you go back to after Obama got elected two thousand and ten two thousand and fourteen we pay take back the Senate you remember what that\nAnger caused our side do we made great strides\nWe made great gains and in fact I Would argue that anger with where America's that man that that came out enough just enough barely enough but it came out\nIn twenty sixteen and it helped get Trump elected\n\nSo by a fellow Republicans and conservatives\nDon't pooh pooh angered don't dismiss anger anger worked for us anger against Obama works for us anger against the elites the system works for us in twenty sixty\nAnd what I'm trying to impress upon everybody on my side is our side is the other side has that anger now\nPlain and simple the other side has that anger now\nAnd and that's a fact okay that's just a fact\nWhat's going to come of it well the Democrats are going to make gains in the house especially is probably not who knows\n\nBut the ... the Democrats are going to pick up seats in the house is the anger enough to give them the house don't know\n\nBut then this goes to why I talk about the blue wave so much\nBecause\nIf our side doesn't rise up to meet the anger\nThe Democrats finger will then yes most certainly the Democrats will take back the house of representatives of that I have no doubt\nMhm that's why my siren that's why I might call every week or two\nThe Democrats are coming the Democrats are coming wakeup grab your

you worry to a degree and you should be\nAnd I I I Would just say\nThat they don't the anger is not exclusive to them they don't have to be the only ones who are angry the Democrats\nMean angers a great motivation I I think if if Brett Kavanaugh had gone down if he had had the pool his nomination or he was voted down\nI Believe that would have let the anger fuse in most of us\nThat would have been okay All right now\nYeah\nMy worry is and I'm so glad Brett Kavanaugh is on the Supreme Court\nYou know that\nBut my worry is okay [laughter] just the latest example of we won\nWe won that battle we got our guy on the Supreme Court so then the day or two or three later the Democrats they lost that battle\nAnd they're really angry about it and it's added to the anger they already had in our side why get angry we won\nKevin uh one\nUh you know rejoicing celebrating is not celebration is not the same\nMotivation that anger is an anger is behind this blue wave don't ever ever forget that
