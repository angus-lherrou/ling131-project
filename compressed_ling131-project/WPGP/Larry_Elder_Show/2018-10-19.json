they still somehow we have enough money [noise]\nLike different like ...\n... what part of like not who are\nAlive today\nBut we're still going to support abortion yeah yeah when I'm On the right word or other ... and get them to actually get the light on there like\nAn ally as there was tremendous purchaser of not only military equipment but other things what I went there they committed to purchase four hundred and fifty billion dollars worth of things and a hundred and ten million dollars worth of military [noise] those are the biggest orders and the history of this country\nBut I'm confused gets somehow the presidency become a a sales broker for Lockheed mark Martin for Boeing for weapons menu for I'm confused on that because in the same breath\nIn Fifteen minutes later we're going to put tariffs on China because it's six hundred billion dollars of merchandise so so what is it\nIs it that we only are interested in selling things for Strategic companies or is it that we have an ideology that we stick to his Americans because here's the problem I have and I've had it for decades if not truly not about Trump\nIt could go all the way back to the original Bush but the funny facts that what's this love affair with the royal family who has no problem\nA telling women can't drive running the country with an iron fist in fact it's one of the only countries where slavery is wide open and accepted and it's just part of the culture\nI don't understand why we have this ideology where Saddam Hussein who was a bad guy okay I get it well he looked like an altar boy compared to the royal family\nAnd what is the thing with the royal family what do we know about these people all of a sudden we like the ... why do we like uh oh he's going to let women drive that seems okay he looks up his cousin and he seems to shave off whatever money you watch any run the country like at that spot\nBut now they're our favorite because they buy weapons from us\nOr do we stand on principle here's the other thing I've got a call is already and I love it when we get callers on the line by the way they want to participate you know the number\nIs it about that they purchased weapons from us or is it that we use Saudi Arabia to fight a proxy wars in the middle east which one is it because sometimes there are a friend but when you look at who they give money to\nHow are they are friends they give money to a lot of our enemies they give money to Syria they get money to Afghanistan they give money to Nigeria they give money to Egypt they give money to China right we all have China they give money to Jordan\nTo Tanzania they give money to virtually all the places where radical Islam seems to be stoked seems to be popping up so it was Saudi Arabia that these are guys now listen\nI agree with a lot of callers on the line well there's this other guy we don't know much about him no we don't we know it was an American a naturalized citizen we know he lived in Virginia right we know that he see what else is in Virginia Langley it's right CIA isn't probably coincidence probably a coincidence kind of what\nA came and went as ... as he wanted to um hit a lot of access seems say I've known a lot of the CIA guys to 'em and then he disappeared and and I understand he was killed in a horrific way that it really has no bearing on on my problem with it\nI have a hard time being spoon fed propaganda whether it's economic propaganda or whether it's Saudi propaganda and one thing that seems to be a common denominator in a lot of our problems in the middle east Saudi Arabia\nAnd work to believe the royal family that practices all kinds of atrocities in fact if you look at what's been going on in Yemen for over two years now it would make Sherman blush\nThe fact that we just had a school but they they just said a school bus what a month and a half ago forty kids four hundred thousand homes blow it up\nAnd all with American weapons and do we know why you think it has to do with oil transport through the through the streets I have budget does\nWhy are we picking winners and losers not only that why are we not recognizing this country is funding\nForeign aid to our enemies yet we're fighting for them because they buy weapons foremost I'd like to know if you really broke adults are we learning on the money to buy the weapons from scratch my favorite ... what's our foreign policy to Saudi Arabia solid I'll tell you what we're going to go to line than we've ever give me Candice where you live on\nCampus thank you for calling now show\nOr whoever that's OK migrant\nCalled me baby what you mean you're not ready you got to be less of Joe Walsh program I promised I wouldn't break it\nDown I have an actor I'm having a hard time but okay my gripe is that that happened with that\nSaudi guy oh we get in the sky\nIs that a Saudi guy he's an American citizen either died and turkey now I'm not by the way he landed at all this\nChorus line we get this course mine oh you have to do that you know this way you know the president has to do that in my opinion Muslim Brotherhood ah you know\n... it seems very coordinated slowly and and I really don't care what happened to him by real look at how they treat their people when we worry about that oh wait a minute we who look how who treats people\nI'm Talking about the middle east\nThe Saudis see because you're getting another chorus line and you're not talking about\nTurkey or non look like I'm a journalist in jail and we're worried about one guy\nWell all I I'm Sorry I I tend to kind of agree with the basic point but if that's if you and I agree on that why do we also agree that we should give Saudi Arabia a country that is known that is known to be ruthless to have sleep I own country why are they are ...\nI Know why there are pounds under Trump ... against the Muslim Brotherhood why they're that's as the lion\nThe alliances the Muslim Brotherhood is good the theocracy right because that's what you say I was actually ... bad but instead we're going to accept the pretend royals the inbred rabbit dish wrap wrapped in a tape across these guys are our friends by the way the guys who tortured kill as many people as they want without question\nThe guys who right now you really believe that Iraq down the street you can't drive down the street and Saudi Arabia\nI don't think they use our friend ...\nEnglish done and what I Want to know who Trump you want to know what I Want to do\n... I Want to break them economically because here's the other thing they're threatening Trump I don't know if you if you're caught that it was on a it was all over the new CNN as we're uh I saw the article printed it was also in Bloomberg Bloomberg\nThey threatened him with four hundred dollar oil see this is the only thing we made Saudi Arabia what uh what it is today we did our Sherman anti trust back with the with the center Rockefeller and all the other oil companies to the middle east\nWe have discovered since then oceans of oil under our own country we don't need to buy an ounce of it from anybody\nWe that's how we could break the middle east\nBut for some reason we don't do that\nFor some reason we let Saudi Arabia dictate the oil price\nFor some reason we sit idly by and they decide how much to pump went to pump it what the price should be that price fixing and whose price fixing it the guys who are really our enemies\nWho tend to tell us they're our friends and and no one investigated all of the people that attacked us on September eleven oh have they have it's a common denominator there they're all salaries\nBut I Know there are friends crazy to me give me a tough\nTopic is so much for calling the Joe Walsh program when we got a couple of minutes so give me\nHit me I'll Try to be quit\nThe reason for my call is this during the campaign Donald wrote basically campaign rare in one and two brothers one was the Mexican wall in one was the Muslim the Muslim the Muslim okay now I find it very interesting that he's taken office\nAnd all of a sudden we got the trouble with the Saudis which is there's a relationship that goes back here\nWhich is why I'm not blaming Royal Air is why I'm not blaming Trump I'm really not this goes back like you said for fifty years for fifty years they've been undermining us for fifty years they smile at our face and stab us in the back for fifty years we loan the money that we pretend they buy our products from\nSo this is beyond from\nThis is an issue of our policy and who knows this benefit it teach these wars going you know I'm going to have a guest on uh\nAt five thirty five and I'm going to ask a window supporting your ally ... over to a proxy war because the ... yeah go ahead\nWhat my ... like it's very complicated is a lot of moving parts but the notion for my call was all the quote unquote Trump's Thursday voted for him two years ago now are totally in bed because the quote unquote arms sales because the oil yeah God says it's a good thing that the reason for\nWhat I'll tell you what I think you're a little biased because you're an anti I get it I don't like a lot of his policies but this is mine is that an issue with Trump if you listen to how Trump brand he ran right he wanted to get us out of their older certainly when we're not going anywhere not only that we're fighting proxy wars this is bigger than a president\nThis is a policy that controls who saw this is a policy that is steeped in corruption steeped in collusion this is the biggest scam in the modern day my name is Shawn tested it for Joe Walsh we'll be back after this\n[noise]\n\n\n\n\nThe point is to recognize that this ideology itself is our enemy to break the middle east by becoming completely energy independent which we could do overnight\nAnd we refuse to do it why because there was a money flow to politicians from the Saudis there's money flow from the OPEC countries there was money flow from the European Union it's about enriching the politicians who pretend to be representative when they are not\nThe represent themselves like give me a gym we got one last call will clean it up before\nJim thank you so much for calling to show how are you sure\nYou're thinking yes\nI spent a little time in the middle east mostly in Saudi Arabia and all my\nBack in eighty four eighty five eighty six\nI was there in\nMiami Vice President Bush\nFor a visit to the Saudis he was doing all their you know they were doing all the oceans whatever while they're there the Marines are garden all that caused by material ... pretty nice house and this palace there's gold everywhere\nSure\nOkay the only games it's about four or five days after the whole thing which leaves all the secret service guys when the guys that don't travel with him yeah they stay behind the what's called the wheels up party oh\nSo they're all standing around with his party and now you know Saudi Arabia's dry unless you're on the compound share\nLike Atlantic sit on a regular Joe ... and I get you go ahead exactly uh-huh so\nWe're now we're packing up all the stuff with this palace that we're in and I would yeah I get very high member of the royal family and we were coming to see all the time\nAlready got it all that I'm In an area up I'm dying to hear up\nBeing watched over in the middle East Bay but not all\nFully stocked huge far\n[laughter] it's good to be a king baby that's morally that's really that's great well the hypocrisy doesn't stop there the hypocrisy\nWhen you look into the Saudi Arabia and when you look into the money when you look into the price controls in oil the hypocrisy is all around us\nWe need we need representatives to do just that represent the American people become energy independent we have oceans of oil under American soil let's break them financially my name is Shawn top soon as the Joe Walsh program I promised I wouldn't break it I'm just loving it off a little bit we'll be back after these my\n[noise]\nRevolution\nHas been reloaded you're listening to the Joe Walsh

to get within the same room as you and another another twelve months so I'm going to take this opportunity to pick your brain and good let me ask you the question is way Saudi Arabia I have never been fooled by them I have seen them using us to price protect oil\nTo militarily protect their country as a run pretty much\nA certain kind of despotism that is only handed down through a phony blue blood inbred bloodline and I noticed that they keep giving money to a lot of people that don't like us\nThey keep giving money to ah Afghanistan they keep giving money to China they even give money to North Korea and I don't believe that they're a relationship with Iran is is icing as they as the press wants us to believe am I wrong now I realize this is a Muslim Brotherhood guy that they chopped up and to tell you the truth\nI don't like them either but my point is I Want America to be energy efficient\nI think we could economically bankrupt them well benefiting the world through very low oil prices because we're sitting on the oceans of it\nAnd I think we allows them to do this because we want to fight proxy wars am I wrong\nWell I I agree with you as far as that it would be better for the United states to become energy and and then especially with the fracking revolution\nOr which routed to the enormous potential that represents for her you know basically breaking ourselves free from these at your desk like Saudi Arabia and others are I totally agree with that here's\nThe thing but in the meanwhile the United states is bound up\nIn an alliance structure in the middle east we have our friends there and we have our enemies and\nFor a number of reasons and I think they're good ones as serious on Saudi Arabia as troubled San jose are as a load some and a despotic as they are and use that and as as a\nMischievous as they can be nevertheless there are friends in the region are among our friends the other ones include Israel Jordan Egypt um and the ... we want to make sure it's it's in the u._s. interests\nFor them to remain in our orbit if we're a power that wants to continue to shape the middle east or protect our interests and\nI there are and not in not allowed to become an even greater threat that that region is today\nAnd they let OPEC which is really a cartel\nDictate how much oil is because they like high oil\nThey love when oil is eighty dollars a barrel you don't want George W. Bush was president\nIn two thousand when oil got above twenty three dollars the world stopped and they would say how could it possibly be above twenty\nThree dollars a barrel we have an oil man and the White House it's not that long ago in February when the war is almost as long as old as that it's not that long ago and the reality is we've been lulled into it into a stupid fights\nA position where the citizens just not there had like sales and the reality is we need to Iraq and you have to break the trend\nNever forget your gas taxes are percentage based\nSo the higher the gallon of gas is the more money to state makes them more money the county makes them more money the municipality makes\nSo it's really the position themselves words government against for citizens they know I get high because it guarantees their prices that's why they like it Hi John thank you so much for calling the show All right though as a color myself I have a tendency to love the colors I Do I Know Mr

people\n... let me ask you are quite well I I I actually did in ... in and what you've seen is that China since we've been dealing with them has really kind of changed the way they deal with their people it's an economic boom right now but that's a side to point minus ... if you listen to what I said I'm not blaming this is bigger than Trump\nThis has been here's the other thing your your quest for Republicans who spends the money pet\nRepublicans took the house Joe Walsh the show you're listening to we want to two thousand and ten who spends the money Republicans we've had him for as long as they could see since Trump on two years ago who spends the most money borrows the most money and creates the most that coup Republican\nI don't know I I Know that he has invited over there it's a real touchy deal what's going on over ... you know a lot of times we we as a child\nNo you know people around you know I think that we know what's best for the country when they've got good advisers I

knew dealings with China and you know they don't treat your paper right over there to stop dealing with them because of that\nWe in fact you say aren't we do we deal with them because they are treating people better that threw out what do you mean it's an economic boom town just just look at what's happening in China\nChina how do you well how do you know I Know because I watch the news how do I know I mean it's it's like having an argument with my Boston Terrier for God's sake or I go to ... g's beds\nSean do much for calling the show buddy Yeah Richard trying to listen to you want to

nine of what goes on oil just burned mommy I'm telling you that is up your your abs so I'm just saying that because it's a fact\nAnd and the fact that we're complacent and we buy this much talking points that what's the last election I Am telling you that until we demand that they do what we want him to do it's going to be slow loss you want to lose you know it all\nThey're all they're all stuck with this government shutdown I shut the government now and I are under her hey we're going to go or do what was the lecture shut it down\nAnd I are on the same page that's right Vince shut down because you know what happened\nLet's get Don on the Republicans are going to get all that now\nI'm going to tell you something a traitor to my beliefs is worse than an opponent because you said you were on my team and stabbed me in the back and I'm Talking specifically to the Paul Ryan Republican\nOr that John paint a Republican you scoundrel that you're not allowed to pretend you're on your on your a capital right out he's a lobbyist All right just a lobbyist that K Street is John painter campaign or\nWalk in rye under Clinton you know you've got to be I now they go to the real money as it is yeah now they go to a real money is there a lobbyist why be the ... when you could be I mean why it would be the\n... they go from from politicians a lobbyist and they make ten times the money and the other thing is nobody talks about the money they make now why do they all\nPosition themselves in stock stock markets there all have bigger portfolios and the best trainers on Wall street everybody hates well three oh to Wall Street's bad and listen I don't like bail out Wall Street either\nBut why don't you hate the politician that is a mess some incredible amounts of money either through extortion through holding back laws and regulations or throughout right using the information to enrich themselves\nThis is a position where we're pretending there's there's different sides of it ... there was a good side versus the bad side when you have had Republicans in the house the actual house that spends the money for eight consecutive years and that that has doubled\nStumbled under Republican\nSo the argument to Vince is I prefer an opponent to a traitor throw the trade routes or he's never going to have the right way and then when it gets terrible and ... and the socialist implodes everything the way it should be when they can hide ally anymore then we come back in and do things the right way because to pretend you're winning when you're really losing just makes it look stupid\nI've shot Thompson in for Joe Walsh three one two six for two fifty six hundred I Am so excited about the guest I have coming up because Jonathan ... actually got to ask Peter Navarro appointed question and guess what Peter Navarro ... that's what he did in there\nHe ran like a little girl because he had no answers because he's a Republican who's been controlling and deceiving the American people I Want to be up but I Want to be\nFor a reason when for principles for lose and pretend you got shot pass it in for joining us we'll be back after the\nNot only that we're going to make sure that there is no real restrictions and variances in different things other people have to do it because we are going to make sure you come here because we want you to create jobs\nBut when you do the math what you saw a crappy that Illinois\nHas subsidize any pretend growth there is no real growth there is only the illusion the the a Potemkin growth that Illinois pretended has because of its fail you failed policies people who can do and they leave\nThe other people are tethered here through love and affection and family obligations and they can't leave\nBut how does Illinois it proceed and and fake the the the the pretend illusion that it's a it's a state that's running okay they give money to targeted industries in people\nThat's why if you're an independent taxpayer you want to get your taxes lowered cheesy called the right call\nCall up the right call go to a burger quota might Madigan hire their law firm and you can get it done and that's the thing to remember is that failed socialism is the most corrupt of all governments because it what it does is it takes those politicians and it makes them guides\nAnd that's why they sell it when you say you can't be that all these politicians can't recognize this oh no no no no they recognize it and they like it\nThey recognize it and they want to put Mussarat if they love it because it makes them gods and it makes you slaves that's why if you read one book in your life make it the road to serfdom by Hajek because what he warned about Seventy five years ago was what you wake up to in the morning\nHe ... he warns you do not glued with socialism for it is a cancer that metastasize as of which no host can survive none not the Soviet Union that Venezuela not Chicago 'cause that's the other thing recognized we

confident for Joe Walsh the Joe Walsh program now how do you fix it now here's the beauty of it it can be fixed overnight overnight through really doing what threw implementing were built the country and this isn't just going to be a tirade rant about capitalism\nIt's going to be a tirade rant about what is freedom and how to use ... do you correct it in the first thing is you recognize the failure now here in Illinois we have a particular failure and that particular failure is the astronomical spending and failure of the government\nIllinois is the is the truly the petri dish of corrupt\nWait till you play music so talk show for God's sakes\nI'm of course [laughter] politics because it feeds on itself and we pretend it is in there and when we send people to correct it\nThey do with the Trojan Horse of failure Bruce Rauner did which is pretty much implement their agenda and keep the party chain of corruption going and as we know when we turn on the television or the radio were inundated with commercials\nAbout how they're running as if there it's the first type forget about the fact he's been there for four years and what did you really do what is your main accomplishment\nAnd when you look at what they mean accomplishment is its failure\nHis main accomplishment is fair so we have a choice to make a as Illinois it's now some of us can do with the smart people doing that for either move or make plans to move but other of us can't\nBecause it ironically the very policies even implemented have destroyed the biggest asset we as citizens accumulate for the most of it that's our home\nBecause they they have now a policy in Illinois where it's almost refreshing that they admit you're being taxed not on the value of your property but on how bad the state is wrong\nI mean it it's it's absolutely mind boggling that we have candidates come on and on and we interview 'em and they say well we're gonna we're going to attach a tax increases to inflation but wait a minute you're admitting that you're going to make it grow you were admitting that I Will no longer be\nTaxed on the value of my property\nBecause this is the system in place see it is twenty Eighteen we not only can spot hair pieces in bed day jobs on men we have the access to information that can give us per minute the price of our real estate\nThat there is no need for a bureaucracy in the middle called the ... office none zero does it need to exit\nTariffs money is flowing into the treasury that taxes paid by some of the people who can least afford to pay him and

only battled Democrat because Democrats are going to say oh come on if you look for one or two percent you could afford that not a Republican Republican oh come on it's just a little bit more you could afford that you're absolutely right at those who can least afford it or the extra taxes ... is\nOr tried to pay for it and I'm sure we're already seeing it in something like washing machines that was one\nOf the earliest era that the president goes on and report a washing machine prices are up you know between Fifteen and twenty percent how he's talking about ... four hundred five hundred dollar I you know what I look I have money and that's a lotta money\nLet's do the Jesse Livermore and step back and take that one example that you just pick so the washing machine goes up all who who goes to laundromat put the poorest the people behind us around us so now when the laundry on the machine goes up what does the laundromat do it raises its prices\nSo your literally pass through in an increase to people who are struggling minute to minute not only that you may be preventing\nSomebody who's poor from getting that new item now you force them into a laundromat\nSo just that one single item what I hate about people who are at least people around us that are telling a story this is a good policy they're ignoring the ramifications of these terrible we all know where this lead to set Nineteen Thirteen anymore we know what's gonna happen\nYeah yeah and and you don't need to go to black history and Shawn let me just go back to two thousand two that\nYou know President Bush tried bitch tried it an import tariffs on it or are you in a looming or ... what was what he found was that unemployment decrease unemployment slow for a period of time but they didn't stop at all and in fact there was tremendous job\nLoss and all those other ancillary or in an industry that you said and it really it it it comes down to like any intervention in their free people's lives and ended up hurting them making cars more expensive to\nKeep out stay out keep a free people free and stop manipulating with what we buy and and where we shop\nAnd you know what's funny is you pick that example what was Wilbur Ross doing during that time Wilbur Ross was the guy who had the aluminum had the steel he's the guy that was guaranteed profits through his connections to Bush\nRight so there's a corporate ... there was a diabolical thing nature to this this isn't patriotism to me this is a diabolical corporate ... this is where the true\nSpecial interests love these policies\nIf Americans feel what's the first thing they did after Trump or is this ... are are implemented terrorists they raise the prices in fact they get afford to shoot commercials now for God's sake how are you watching the ... and and and why aren't the American people you realize when we're talking like this you have any idea you know I'm In a tough position filling in for Joe Walsh she tells me don't run the show\nI got people calling me up on your show down for the Republicans are the good guys it's the election season and to me when you lose your principles your ear off your addressed\nIn a sea of deception and this is to me what's happening when good people who are conservative you on Fox Business for God's sakes for the most part uh the guy who's show you around he supports these Sarah Varney loves these things\nYeah I mean I think there's a lack of basic knowledge on basic economics you know I mean you're showing your ear or background of the financial services that you know they used to say oh well this is Fonda had\nSort of low polish you know low for that to me the right\nConditions so tariffs it's kind of a nice way of saying you know it's it's it's tough to ensure that you said there is so much to cheer about its companies like Facebook Like waiter like Netflix company that can only be created in America at a free society but\nUnlike America that only comes through I fear that power this economy alone and and as you said a lung them come government and said you know we're going to tell you you could trade with I could shop in it for some reason you should feel bad for buying a total world instead of our Hershey bar it's a free country\nAreas or whatever you want the capitalistic Jonathan Honig I'm so glad to have your thank you so much for being a guest and what he's telling you also is that it can be fixed a lot faster than it took to break it it can be fixed because we the citizens demand freedoms demand property rights demand liberty\nShops and filling in

rights and it's cheap and the fact that you as an as a citizen or not bound by legacy of who you're born to but you're bound by your own principles your own fundamentals your own ideology and I think this is crucially Americanism\nAnd um that's how I base my opinions\nOn things and um one thing when you have that fundamental belief of liberty and capitalism and property rights you tend to reject the lives that politicians sell you because if it's one thing we can all agree on whether you consider yourself a Democrat or Republican at Trump being whatever you consider yourself\nYou can agree that even when you like them they're lying to you\nAnd it is through this that I'm hoping we can have a common ground to do with America is supposed to be which is to put the restraints on politicians\nInstead of allowing politicians to put restraints on citizens now whether they do they do this through taxes they do this through uh their pretend to virtue of a social engineering program or they do this to weaponize law\nAnd regulations which are hidden laws are giving bureaucrats the power to seize our property I think it is important that we as citizens recognize this discuss these talking points dissect them and reject them\nAnd then to that and that's the moral of the story and to prove my point\nI'd give you today's Republican\nAnd today's Republican nausea to me and I'll tell you missed the you know we're talking primarily to Republicans yeah but there's one thing you can't hide from and that's the reality of our history and if you go back through history and you look at it explodes our national debt\nWhich is the most pervasive undermining current against freedom there ever was it's Republicans whether it's the Obama Republicans who complain about how much money Obama with spending but we gave them the house ... which is the Congress two years after we won\nSo in two thousand and ten we central Walsh there are very proud of that right Tea Party people from around the country we got up and we sent guys like Joe Walsh who were speaking about freedom and restrain on government of capitalism we said you go do your job you're a citizen governor we want you to be part of the government and we sent them there and all but a handful\nStabbed us in the back and it's undeniable when you look at the explosion of spending after two thousand and ten to the present day these are the Republicans at that\nAnd it's absolutely disgusting\nSo I like see here's the thing I like some of the Trump stuff but I reject the part where it's government spending or hit in government spending now one thing I like about him is he'll he cut bureaucracy mhm let's give this guy credit where credit's\nEngland or in some not like eight hundred somebody regulations he's a ...\nAnd and for that would have been great Mm but I call them two steps forward arming two steps backward and wants to forward because that's great when you do that stuff but when you add a tariff Mm the greater regulation in the world\nBecause it is it is during the American people you're preventing them from opportunity in value and the problem is we tell ... politicians your leaders and I think they're not supposed to be\nSeeing the way if you read the founding documents they're supposed to be followers not supposed to be leaders how did this happen to me where is the jujitsu of my freedom\nBecause the reality is they're supposed to be represented this is we live in a Republican or when you hear these people is a democracy I don't know because I'm guaranteed I Will not be a victim of the tyranny of the majority\nThat the smallest minority is what this country's built around the individual mhm and in order for that to be honored it has to be we have to be a republic\nSo sometimes a politician said when's the last time this happened this was a great question for I I don't know if I'll ever get to talk to a politician ... way is the last time a politician wanted\nTo vote one way for his own opinion but for the betterment of his citizen\nOf the person you're supposed to represent he voted another way when's the last time that happened\nAnd I don't know when they can ... who can you think of one politician that said that I Can't\nThink of one however I can think of probably several that would say that they vote in the interests of the uh the breeder majority like the interest of the people and they're you know and and their constituents but really they\nDon't you know when they when they say it it is is now election that this is one to frauds combat\nAll their girlfriend in Washington all the bar tab go down in Washington they come home they rekindle with their old lady that they abandon back in their home states and\nThey uh they come back and tell us how they you know they just they try their best they fought for us I Know they didn't do what we want him to do what they really really try and we go through this cycle of pretend conservatism every two years and all but a small minority are actually those people that govern the way they run out\nAnd one thing that I've noticed in this change we'll get back to this after the break one thing I've noticed in this changes that Republicans have now seized upon the\nI'm going to make sure you have affordable health care the biggest joke of tyranny the biggest success of the pirate is Obamacare socialized medicine which affects each and every one of us from cradle to grave they got us and the reality is they're not letting us go\nAnd what you're seeing as you were seen a paradox or a dime shift where Republicans now are are chanting against\nFreedom in choice of healthcare they're guaranteeing we're going to make sure that it's just like Obamacare which can call it something else and what happens when that happens is that you and me lose\nAnd I don't either hard pressed to pay attention ladies and gentlemen and your own home states pay attention to the to the commercials they're running on the same thing Obama preached when he passed Obamacare\nAnd that's when we all live I'm Sean ... will be back after these left [noise]\n\nI Lived in a community called ... Park Illinois mhm and most particularly why was it was one of the first towns where I'm at that time illegal aliens Mexicans in particular case\nThere was a small community Mexicans and they were welcome there and we welcome them there for the most part and they came but one of the things that we saw happen was that all of our documents started to have to be printed\nIn Spanish mhm and it was a tremendous cost of this little community and we saw all of the things exploding the cost of\nSchools the cost of healthcare but one of the things I recognize that a young kid\nIs well that shouldn't exist anyway so I don't want to use immigration as an excuse to protect American failed socialism there shouldn't\nBe public school I'm Sorry kidding [laughter] I Know a lot of people out there are benefits but it shouldn't exist your neighbor shouldn't pay for your kid to go to school and if you believe in freedom any believing liberty you would have rejected it at a premise because it's also hard to argue while your neighbor shouldn't pay for your health care we should pay for your kid's school\nAnd I would just interject by saying especially these days you know going back to what you're saying earlier about socialism being taught\nWhere do you think these kids are getting these ideas are getting tight like that you know capitalism is right there was just a recent article coming out up I'm teen vogue magazine talking about the end world poverty you need to and capitalism yeah stuff is being taught in school which is exactly you know in these teen magazines apparently now\nI'm so when if I ever have kids do I want to send them to a public school where they're just going to be indoctrinated with basically socialism\nNonsensical let me tell you why do we have kids I have two teenagers ... my wife and I was I'm a regular guy real estate broker type of food on the table\nAnd one of those cigarettes are but I Am a real estate that was hard sometimes sometimes I'm leaning moms we have never never taken our kids and put them in a public system of anything we pay that extra money you wonder if she'll complain about\nAn average it's when they went to grade school was like seven thousand a year and a lot of money yeah but you want to know something the public school waste twice that\nBecause they don't waste their money they waste our money it's always easier to spend somebody else's money than yourself if you have kids I got news for you out there you have an obligation to that kid set your old neighbor who already raised his kids he has nothing to your kid so let's not use laws a weapon to extort him\nUm and that's the problem so when you argue about immigration do it on an intelligent level where you're not arguing to protect American failed socialism your argument on principles and when you\nReally dissect it should be a principal American [noise] my name is Shawn Johnson in ...\n[noise]\nAre you ready to throw up the free ... enjoy your show last
