were taping this to bring all these wonderful people to you that we could never ever ever get in one room accept the gun rights policy conference so\nWe're kind of back to back there but we've got a whole different crop in for a whole different reason actually believe it or not so let's get going here on segment for from the cross breed holster studios to knock out this hour of armed American radios monster broadcast from Phoenix sitting to my left the only individual\nWho I've named the segment after over all these years you know him as the Allen Corwin experience it as a pleasure and an honor to be here with\nThe how are you good to actually see your face mark what a pleasure almost ... no it's a pleasure it's\nStill too that's okay I found a rock out in front of my hotel last night I and I know there's a lot of rocks in Arizona and it\nLooked like a lever right you know what you do with a lever I yes as a matter of fact I Do but tell me your throw it over your shoulder and you'll leave or right here 'cause it's worthless yeah that's right I'm a rock collect so many years ago now I Know that\nWas but as a geologist here in a very highly miner allies state\nWe go rock collecting with kids and we teach them about nature and they learned about geology and the planet and it's really wonderful and some of the rocks you find or leave or right leave or right they're leaving rather others are very valuable for collection teach you a lot about science geology chemistry physics things you don't get in school\nAnd the fun part is you teach kids\nThere's lots of other things you can teach kids about two and we just had a a a veteran a mark Boston was on from Vietnam that it was wonderful ...\nWho's out there trying to teach kids in high school about some of the things that you and I have worked together on for many many years that's right now you're going to talk today and I love listening to you speak as you're you're a huge hit here your band plays here this is a wonderful meeting and I'm proud to say\nThis time when I speak with third time I'm not a life member of easy CDL congratulations though it's really fun to be here this is family to me and you know how much I Love coming here\nI Know it and this is the sixth year in a row the guns enamel magazine named Arizona as the number one of the white for gun ownership and gun used we have constitutional carry a term that came from Arizona and all sorts of laws to protect your rights like nowhere else just a pleasure or a gun here is like a book\nWritten by it and sell it among your friends you can carry it without much concern there is some prohibited places but they make sense give or take\nWell you know but there's crime that comes with that Allen and I'm surprised that Arizona right isn't their crime that come\nNo more no more than anywhere else you have criminals they operate in their criminal umbrella and then there's the rest of us and\nWe found out who she will carry Arizona would still be the quote unquote wild was of course I'm being sarcastic\nNo but criminals operate on the constitutional carry anyway says simply carry guns and it's illegal and sometimes it gets stop sometimes they don't that used to be an honest person carried a gun and got stopped oh my God this is bad and it ruins your life\nBut it's just possession of personal property and you bring up a very important point one of the laws were going to start going for a nationwide\nIs discrimination against civil rights\nBased on firearms the banks are trying to close down companies trying to deal with firearms that's discrimination it's discrimination based on a civil right you can't do that and the hotels to any argument is well a hotels are private place so we can do that\nYou can't see this is private I don't Lenin blacks I I don't let engaged fat people women Jews that civil rights and civil rights are and in the constitution if you've noticed but firearms is right there it's an explicit expressed Sprite\nAnd banning it is illegal and this is a civil rights battles that we have to start operating on that way\nAnd something tells me that you personally are going to be at the tip of the spear that fight here in Arizona\nI'm drafting the bill on with the infringement law infringement is banned if you try and take a firearm from somebody who legally owns it\nThat's infringement by definition the people who do it should be held accountable and your firearms should be immune from confiscation now how\nAre we going to get something like this is Alan ... behind the previous segment we're talking about Arizona being ground zero and it is on two fronts All right\nIn the Senate of course wrestling for control the Senate I never would have thought we'd see red Arizona wrestling for control the Senate wants the state Senate or the federal federal ... okay this is a big fight as we know McCain has passed away flake is out of here big fight going on right now the polls are showing this neck and neck give or take one percentage point Democrat could win here\nAnd I can't imagine a Democrat from Arizona voting against anything pro gun either doesn't voting for anything grown for anything or anti God that doesn't seem to make sense in the from the\nBlood of the state of Atlanta's at Arizona is going through some change Californians are abandoning that state because of the California policies and they're coming to Arizona where the property is better and the rights are better taxes are lower almost everything is better here except for the beach front we have a lot of beach no water\nAnd so they come here just can't see it\nYeah it's all the way it will be over there like right after the earthquake will have to be trust 'em so they come here and they bring their California ways and it is affecting the voting body and it has the potential to change the legislature\nBut Arizona is about as hard core pro America as there is in America\nTold me about the state level and I'm gonna move kind of quick because we've got about three and a half or miniature state legislature here versus federal state legislatures pretty solid is it not\nIt's solid but it's not great some of the Republicans are kinda rhino and they're running as Republicans and they're not strong on our issues we managed to get most of the bill through in fact I saw a list of bills and went through this year pro gun bills it's about Fifteen of them are Eighteen I had no idea I just checked the legislative website\nAnd the the guys at this conference here this is an open carry banquet with over five hundred people carrying openly safest room and tells the safest hotel and feel though I'll tell you this I'm going to open with this when I Do my little ... feel up there\n[noise] listen guys up a fight breaks out don't shoot there'll be so many guns going on just ducking like duck and cover you don't want to shoot a rule like this everybody's getting a\nCan and you know I'm Carrying a glock in in a a cross breed holster outside the waist down and I love it and they don't shoot yourself there\nNo your mood or what have you got whatever sport coat so I've got to say you're carrying crossroads where I Am it's a little easier on my back and you know one or two on and you can do it and it actually made we we we may not be just a kind of make statements over here as well to write so everybody's got to actually say their best posters on everybody's\nWearing their best leather and they have a gun and as a hogs leg in there and\nWhat's wrong with that nothing of course not absolutely nothing ... hotel discriminate against people based on the property they own that's bad seat this to me if you're wearing I'm wearing a sport go this is an unnatural lotion reaching for fire on with your right arm if you carry strong side\nThis cross draws a much more natural motion\nBut it's up to the individual\nAnd I don't expect to have to draw in this room I don't\nThink you're going to have you if you have to we got a bigger problem on our hands and we're thinking of right now so tell me with with the remaining time that we have this is an organization that's award winning ... this is the ... of course Allen was reminding us grassroots organization of the year again that the gun rights policy conference\nYou guys are at the tip of the spear your right at the tip of the tip of the spear here's what's your involvement in easy CDL in the legislation that you're talking about writing you've been working with disorganization Jews were preservation of firearm ownership ... many years\nBut the second front we have there's not just the Senate but the second front here is also Bloomberg money to battle ground that we're in within I Know it's aggravating but I got asked that question\nAnd now here from the state where Bloomberg's wanting to dump money because you got the ballot initiative Arizona's a ballot initiative state the man sitting to your left is fighting vehemently in Washington yeah he's got SawStop that ballot initiative and they know when we know when you do that if they're successful they're they're coming here what are we doing preemptively ...\nKnow well maybe you don't if you're just joining us I Am I have moved the cross breed holster studios\nOut west to my favorite part of the country that's Phoenix, Arizona the value of the sun\nWhere we are broadcasting from the Arizona citizens defense league annual meeting and I tell you what this is an award winning organization grassroots for a reason and I am proud to be this year third time I've spoken here and been just been treated water if we all family to me\nBut now I speak here as a life member and sitting to my left is the president of the Arizona citizens eventually they caught Davis a pleasure\nTo be here is you know every single you're always a pleasure to see you at venues around the country we just spoke and met again at gun rights policy conference here we are in your neck of the woods\nBrother you got a lot going on here ... ... where you've got everything I was speaking with Alan Gottlieb in the previous segment our previous hour about what you got going on in the Senate\nMcCain of course out flake out\nYou've got to fight a battle royale going on over here with about a one point shift I see there's a potential\nFor US Senate seat here to flip blew that blows my mind and Arizona then you've got the state issue here with Bloomberg you personally if it out front of this I've listened to what you guys have been doing here legislatively I say we because I'm a member also and boy I'll tell you what it it's it's an uphill climate is that a safe way to describe it\nOh yeah well you know will you be known as ... ... ... ... the fight never stops it never ever stop so we go on and\nDid you know no go ahead go ahead and\nYou know we we go on and and just just keeps going you guys like Bloomberg keep pouring money into everything ... pouring millions and millions and millions of dollars into the legislative elections now a federal and state\nWell he's pledged because I Love being able to sit here where you can have a natural conversation and I don't have to worry about a delay on the phone the millions and millions and millions you're talking about his over one hundred million pledged he just added his you know\nAnother hundred million I'm Talking about every town for gun safety and the rest of those wounds he's added another hundred million to the fight for control of Congress right so this man is a quarter of a billion dollars if not more into this fight is that is that right\nWell and you know\nThe only way we counter that because we don't have that kind of money and none of us\nTo I have volunteered to be the billionaire that funds that I'm Still if everybody wants to get to go find me page I Want to be the billionaire that funds are fight so have you can help me make it work please let me know what to do it ...\nIt but we don't have that kind of money we just we never will\nHow do we compete with it you guys have got dumped so magic out here\nIt's the only way we do it is to show up and you know you've been a member for a while you know how it works we get our email lists to W. W. W. dot ABC deal dot org getting our email us join up\nWe send you alerts anytime there's anything moving the Arizona Legislature that you need to be aware of it whether it's a committee hearings or whether it's legislation of war as those go into the governor or whatever it is good or bad will tell you about it you send your emails\nWhy do why do I care as a Georgia residents about what happens here in Arizona why do I need to be why do I need to be concerned was I live here man it doesn't matter to me I don't get up in Arizona put my boots on in the morning I mean I Do in my heart and every day\nBut in ... but it matters doesn't it of course the dominos all fall I this is ground zero ... this is the center target for the anti gun establishment the professional gone prohibition of and then we'll talk about it but they know you know I Know this was this entire organization those\nAnd the man to your left Mr got leave knows that if they can get Arizona fall just what happens next with gunshot state Florida fall we've already got difficulty at Florida right now we have a lot happening down there I never thought we'd see and the quote unquote gunshots they ... so when you add all of this up\nThe dominos do fall and what happens here boy I'll tell you what is going to be a model Nevada to bordering state another tough battle another tough fight if they can bring and you've won now six years done some ammo has got this state\nFrom ... just told us doesn't em all ranks out ranks Arizona number one ship what six years running securing the room so so again\nEffectively tell listeners in Kansas listeners and Minnesota Michigan Ohio I Want you to pay attention Pennsylvania they're working on anti gun laws in Pennsylvania now day to make it a felony to carry a gun loaded on your vehicle they just never stop mhm\nBut from the big time here they can they can nail Arizona Bloomberg wants to southern ... oh yeah yeah okay and\nYou know in your and my dog is your PC one of the big things they've got going now is the gun violence restraining order and they're pushing that real hard they got Republicans on their side\nYeah and it's just another step another another brick on the wall like the song says and\nThen what else can they get well they've you know you're right and that's a great way to ask if they can because here let me ask you this rhetorical sarcastic nonetheless by still want to ask even though I Know the answer this question of you\nIs it ever enough for them no absolutely not so when it was if we give them let's just say it hypothetical we give them\nAll expanded background checks because we're sick and tired of listening to Shannon watts talk about it we're sick and tired of watching all this a mulatto talk about it let's just give it to him and shut them up we already get a background check to buy a ton right so let's just give it to him will they dry up and go away\nWell you know it goes back to ... you know I'm a ... in our personal stricter goes back to the same logic that they use when they say well you know bad guy comes and you want something from you want your wallet he want your money what you would ever\nJust give it to him and he'll go way more if you want your life you're going to give that to\n... believe it or not sadly there are people out there that think well that's not going to happen to me and if it does [noise] guns aren't the answer is well and we see that right\nBut it's our answer our answer is no we are not\nHappy the lowly correct absolutely correct so let's move to another one let's move to assault weapons ban ... because we've got a really bright kid named David hog\nOut there who was apparently a master of everything now he knows everything about everything so at first I was ... he tells us that if you've ever followed his tweets it's quite astonishing\n[laughter] of course I'm being sarcastic but I haven't talked to laugh like David August the ... of the world's for something else but David hog now doesn't want to take away her God he just want to take away our fifteenth so let's say we're sick and tired of David hog on the news all day every day and we say you know one fight\nLet's shut him up unless we don't need these we don't need to say are Fifteen let's give them to him will stop all shut up and go with no\nNo one else actually went nuts because you know somebody some years ago wrote an article and I don't remember who was about ... gun control and he says you know one is never enough you know is it to heart or is it too soft you at some point you get to that realization that they're never going to stop and so it was going to be something\nAnd that's the assault weapons just to put in the door once they get those are they going to stop course now than they are going to come for something else\nAnd this is exactly the logic that we need to remember is always in play they don't stop they never stop\nThey've gotten bits and pieces over the years they've gotten machine guns and you know and they managed to outlaw those and so now we can't own machine guns new manufacturing there all the only thing you can buy now is the stuff that's already on the registry and it was closed in a ... so they keep going up there not been up and you think of ... of course now\nSo and you know what else is ... that's a that's a great question because now we got due process on line you're talking about the ... extreme risk protection orders for example to a great example to talk about due process we're talking about a fundamental tenet of our judicial system we're talking about innocent until proven guilty but wait a minute\nI just watched the Kavanaugh hearings and I never saw a Democrat concern one bit\nNot one bit on that panel did I see a senator on the left concern about Kevin ... rights to due process did you or am I missing something okay so if we see them at that level\nThey really don't care about my due process do they\nWell and this is the thing you know you actually had Democratic senators during that hearing saying that you need to prove to us that you're not guilty\nAnd they find out that it that that is a quote yeah you're not you're not ... that's not the south paraphrasing that was actually set\nYeah and I mean somewhere along the line somebody from their constitutional law class\n[laughter] so I don't know that they've taken one of you know I have a copy of constitution sitting over here with me okay and I know a lot of people in this room have a copy of the constitution with them [noise]\nYou know I go over and read the constitution and my kids we actually talk about these things we put them in perspective at home and my my kids are super bright and some of the stuff they don't know anything about at school yeah we live in a really nice area\nIn a really conservative red area with really good schools but they're public schools you know\nThen ... this is this is a big concern with the next one minute that we have left what direction are you taking easy CDL forward now\nWell you know we've got a governor that's pushing these extreme or protection orders like you mentioned ah we beat him last year he's ... he's going to bring it back so we're fighting we're fighting to stay in place at this point we're going to try and move anything good that we can but right now we just want to make sure we don't get bombarded with that\nA Z CDL dot org is where people can go to join I'm a life member it's easy to become a member of this was the best group of people and an award winning organization for reason thank you for everything you're doing it for your dedication to the cause of fighting for our freedoms in our rights that they've caught the president of Arizona\nCitizens defense weak and by the way thanks for welcoming me back and re I Love it it's an awful lot of ... armed American radio monster broadcast from Phoenix, Arizona their share it and at the easy CDL meeting will continue right after this we're going to take a quick break don't go away\nHere in Arizona we're in very good shape um we've got a few districts that that lean Democrat and we're making some inroads into those districts\nBut uh as far as our state legislature they understand that gun voters are very important to them and we are are in good shape to get those people elected and ah I'm feeling good about the way our local elections are going here in Arizona\nAlthough I I lost a city council race by eleven votes are in in the primary election one of my candidates so it can be really heartbreaking\nTo no question or no those let's use the state now you feel comfortable about the state\nI'm pretty comfortable about the state yeah we've got a good solid Republican majority I Believe that the governor is going to win again I I'm not a big fan of governor do see but he's way way better than the alternative\nYou know you would nobody was a big fan of a lot of people weren't big fans of Donald Trump but he was way way better than the alternative absolute I'm a big fan of Donald Trump loved it and called the election and the night of the election on on my radio program I said go to bed tonight knowing Trump plus three hundred electoral votes will see in the morning\nThree hundred and ... I still have people and I'm proud of this asking me to pick their lottery numbers for him so All right let's go now let me segue to the to the federal election I've I've talked with my previous guests over the last hour an hour and a half here\nIn the Arizona as in a strange place very when you're talking about the U.S Senate Arizona is actually look I mean it's a one point race right now today as we sit here at the at the easy CDL meeting ... it's a one homeless effort found that\nIn bright red gun toting gun loving history of the gun states Arizona [noise]\nHere since ... who is the Democrat running for the Senate\nUm has painted herself as a moderate Democrat and she's done a pretty good job of it uh although a lot of her history is now finally coming out and people are realizing that she was a a a Democrat socialist green extreme\nRadical leftist before she started moderating in order to be able to be elected to office\nShe's like Mike Bloomberg becoming a Republican he didn't become a Republican because he believed in Republican values he became a Republican because they already had a Democrat candidate and he wanted to spend enough money to get elected in ... when it can you stay here with me for one more second sure you're very\nGood because that we run out of time is it the shorter segment of the program of the hour what I Want to do is keep your carry on this

D. to eight seven to two please don't do that while you're driving\nAll right well let's get this cross breed holster studio here in Phoenix fired back up again Jeff noxious staying with me this conversation is too important to let go\nOh boy some of the best radio Jeff I've said for years this radio that the listener Mrs during the breaks because our conversations you know I mean I just said well stop because if we let it out now we're not going\nSo to bring it back to the Mike and it was a fascinating when I was hearing you say so let's go back into what we were talking about during the break I'll let you take it away go ahead\nAt the national level right now the and I just wrote a column about this for em on land is is the cabin I'll bump going to be enough a lot of Republicans and independents and and even some Democrats were very angry and upset about the attacks on\nBrett Kavanaugh and the way that circus was run and they were angry and Democrat numbers fell and Republican numbers climbed and and I call it the cabin on bump\nThe question is is the cabin I'll bump going to be enough to see us through November the six meaning getting enough of us to the polls enough of us to the polls because frankly\nAnd my organization I Try and be a nonpartisan organization but the Democrats have decided that that I'm not allowed to be nonpartisan that that I'm not allowed I Can't endorse a Democrat um because endorsing a Democrat voting for a Democrat and everybody needs to really be clear about this voting for any Democrat\nIn\nThe in the federal elections means that you're supporting Chuck Schumer and Nancy\nPelosi okay no no you you're not saying that that's what that's that's the actual reality that's where you're going to have three hours I have to take you here for second I've been very hard on the Democrats for years I've never backed out mhm and I've asked the question because it makes for great radio and it's quite provocative honestly\nCan a Democrat be a pro gun activists my answer to that is no absolutely not what they can be it's Democrats who like guns for the time being\nUntil whatever it is a real issue that makes them Democrats comes along guns becomes a secondary issue so they can't be and you are absolutely correct no one on this show including myself is that it like you just said the Democrats have seen to that mhm and that's bad for those gun owners that are Democrats because that is just more proof positive\nOf what I've said over the last couple of years that the Democrats have the party has left us that we used to have pro gun Democrats we used to have that many more senator\nDennis ... from Arizona dad used to get in trouble because he supported senator Dennis ... Miller in Georgia Zell Miller changed party he came to our site but\nHe can see after the Keating Five thing I think it was actually a penance that he had to pay to the Democrat Party because he carried the water on the assault weapons bill\nAnd I believe that that that was why they said we'll let you off the hook on this Keating Five things but you have to quit this pro gun stuff and quit being a friend who the n._r._a. fascinated and there you go but right now what we've got\nTen and here's the thing the cabinet bump up because Kavanaugh was eventually or a confirmed\nThere are going to be a lot of people that said okay yeah we won that and sit back down in front of the on the couch and we can't have that you have to stay active you have to stay involved\nAnd so I think that the way to do that that what Mitch McConnell could do tomorrow to ensure that that Kavanaugh bump lasts on through November the sex\nIs bring the sheer act to the floor of the Senate for a vote is everybody what it is it's been passed out of the house it's sitting in the Senate or whatever committee but the sheer act is an omnibus\nDoors hunting fishing land access bill but it also includes the I'm hearing Protection Act\nIt also includes the a lawful purposes act which I think is critically important if you don't know about lawful purposes act you need to look it up that's that's a great bill and I've\nJust got out on the ... you know ... something else he told me if I'm a because you're right Mitch Mitch McConnell's not going to do\nThat probably not he can although they promised that they would they promised a lot of things yeah man that's the biggest Republican problem is that they make promises that they don't keep and our guys say\nHell with them they don't do what they promised to do\nMitch McConnell could bring up concealed carry reciprocity if you want it to absolutely he could do it today and it would have the same effect springing up to ... he couldn't move that over if I'm not mistaken could he not bring those two could you reconcile those two together\nActually the I Believe I don't know from a vigil standpoint if I go to ... I'm trying to remember whether that was incorporated into what was passed out of the house I don't think it was but and and even\nOne of the tactics when you get into inside baseball one of the things that I suggested was bring the national reciprocity act into the sheer act and then negotiate it back away again\nSo that you get the sheer act because you say okay I'll tell you what will drop us hockey you'll give us that and and then we can come back and get that again\nYou're talking procedural strategy is too far above our heads in D.C at the stage of the game you know why and I said I mean obviously Mitch McConnell knows what he can do [noise]\nHere's the problem that we have right now you bring guns up right now the liberal heads are going to pop like that yes right now they'll go absolutely crazy and you know what that would do is more than likely I Believe Mitch McConnell might think this was just up there ... even more which could be\nObviously we'd be straddling a very fine line there obviously if you're going to do it I don't think conceal carry reciprocity would be the way to go there are going to come after that and not see gun bill but the ... is is absolutely brilliant idea a\nWho do you write who do you call let's tell people where to go to get that done at least ask\nWell you need to call your your senators both of them in ... off the call McConnell's office um I used to know is too old to\nTo to now I'm not going to do it\nI was getting a as you can remember that here on live radio sitting at a table it easy CDL you're you're more of a patriots and I thought you were I read it off it to your\nPC last year or just in an impromptu speech and I rattle it often somebody checked me and yes I was right but I'm not going to take that chance right now but just look up a congressional switchboard right and you can ask for whoever you want to talk to at the congressional switch board and they will route you there\nAnd um that's that's worth doing send them an email they've all got their messaging apps you just look 'em up and and send them an email\n'em but tell them we want to gun vote bring the gun vote it could help people like like a Jon Tester in Montana as well if the if tester decided well hey I've got to vote for this it could help him survive\nBut at the same time it would keep Chuck Schumer out of the majority leader spot\nApps and on the critical now we're talking about the ... the incredibly fine tactical nuanced that's involved here\nThat what you just mentioned you know it could help Jon Tester survive but it could do this to Schumer\nWe're we're in we're in a scary place in American politics today are very dangerous place in American politics today\nThat if America itself as a nation doesn't play cards right\nI I fear for what's coming down the ... are standing on the precipice we we are I don't have the rocks are falling out from under our feet you know I spent the last week on armed American radio daily defense going back in and talking about Charles Sumner Senator Charles Sumner that can Eighteen fifty six K and on the floor of the Senate by a loony Democrat\nCan't say there's enough about the man mentioned it\nLast night I Believe in the third of our of the show when I was just kind of recapping a little bit of\nOf what we heard from himself and for me to be ... but I got to tell you this because you need to know this Alan Gottlieb is the single most\nInfluential and powerful man alive\nToday in the gun rights movement\nThat's a bold statement to make it's also very very true if you listened to him yesterday whenever you hear Alan talk you have to dig a little deep and pick up on some of what he says because sometimes it just goes right past you like when he said yesterday on the broadcast and our one\nWell I I talked to the White House about okay he talks to the White House\nAbout the Supreme Court that the White House\nUses him for counsel on Supreme Court picks think about what you heard him say yesterday since we were talking to here\nThey seek his guide when it comes to selection of a potential justice\nAnd with Alan Gottlieb tells you that he's content with the other names on the list you can believe that I mean you can absolutely take that to the bank um ... when he's confident I'm confident I Want you to know that\nBecause I Know you turn to this program and to me to hear some of these things and I want you to know that when I hear him say that I'm confident and if I'm confident I Want you to be confident it's very very important\nBecause the enemies of our freedom are not going away anytime soon\nI've got to pull this up for you this just absolutely drove me crazy I Believe this was on Drudge Report in fact I Know it was I'm going to pose up for you right now\nColin Powell rich Trump on immigration NATO anti press rhetoric the world can't believe what's happening he was on CNN with that goof off for ...\nAnd his other panelists was Madeleine Albright ... what does that tell you right there\nCan you take this guy serious at this stage of the game I don't think so you heard what Colin Powell said during the twenty sixteen election\nYeah he was all took a shirt because George Bush and the Bush's were being hammered and and Jeb Bush was being hammered and I don't think Colin Powell like that very much too bad for Colin Powell\nColin Powell puts himself out as a Republican what Colin Powell is is an establishment guy\nHe is a flat out moderate establishment guy can flip either way with the wind blows he's just this political animal of a bygone era let me let me give you some exact details as to what I'm Talking about here very important I you know when you read these things you got to understand that stuff\nExample power Republican was maintained a low profile during the Trump Administration\nCalled out quote what we are not doing as the United states of America First of all I don't recall anybody asking him but he said what are we doing we're walking away from agreements were walking away from alliance why would correct Colin Powell\nWe're not walking away from agreements were walking away from bad agreement or as Trump would say bad deals walking away from them we are fixing them\nNumber one number two he says we're walking away from alliances were not walking away from alliances we are reshaping our alliance as we are fixing our alliances in large part we are fixing alliances that's understandable why he's upset\nBecause he put together some of these alliances years ago he's watching them unravel because they were bad deal\nTwenty Thirty years down the road this stuff becomes obvious things need to be changed Colin Powell doesn't like that his name is on some of these things so it's understandable why he took his hurt\nMadeleine Albright same thing going back to the Clintons these people put together a lousy crappy deal that have been cautioning America hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of billions of dollars over the years\nWe've been screwed because of some of these deals and let's give them the benefit of the doubt maybe it was a good deal at that time\nLet's just leave it at that ... was a good deal at that time was I read a good deal no I mean I don't I'm not sure what Colin Powell was talking about here but we all know what Trump is doing we're walking away from agreements what does this have to\nDo with this had everything to do with got this guy puts himself out as a Republican he's an establishment guy\nHe's an establishment guy that would come after your guns in fact well okay I I really don't have a whole lot of time to go into that but let's do it right now Colin Powell well let's talk about Colin Powell in two thousand Thirteen on meet the press shortly after Sandy Hook\nColin Powell was asked by you up though\nOn meet the press that uses the bass of objectivity Colin Powell was asked to get this I Love these left leaning questions right just how they hit you from what what kind of further restrictions wash must we put\nYou see your show obviously the basis is we have to have further restrictions what kind should we have that was the premise that was the basic question was asked\nWhat further restrictions do we need to have an input\nColin Powell did his typical hey I'm a I'm a Second Amendment guy\nI support the second amendment I'm I'm well studied on the second amendment he said he understands the well regulated militia and he's a gun guy himself every but we should be able to have done\nBut he said he saw no reason for an American citizen to own a Bush mass to remember it was a Bush master a are Fifteen that the lunatic who murdered his mother and went into the school used to murder those twenty plus kids and teachers\nColin Powell saw no problem with registration and why can't we register\nHe saw no problem with testing\nFor both commercials sales and private sales he has no problem restricting you are right you can go watch that video on YouTube I'm not going to pull it off and play it I did go through it when I was doing some research with the show earlier this morning and it's Colin Powell views on gun control go quota Google it up you'll see him\nOn meet the press telling you everything you need to know about\nWhy this has everything to do with Don remember Colin Powell is irrelevant now\nWhy are we even talking about him\nHe's irrelevant yeah we're talking about him today because the left dug him up\nAnd we have to we will not let these statements go unchallenged we can't other shows do other shows blow right past the stuff I tried this up together for you why because it's on the head at some of the ... of smack in the center column and the Drudge Report today\nWe have to talk about it and talk about it we will we are going to go back through some more of a show remember it all started with we're walking away from agreements\nNo we're not we're fixing agreements as Trump would say we're fixing deal we're making new deal because deals you made suck\nThat's why that's what we're doing well of course she doesn't like that we're walking away from alliance snow or not the alliances you made suck we're fixing those alliances it's understandable why he wouldn't want to do that\nHe was asked by a car you do you think this president can be a moral leader for the world and LBJ said I don't know that he can do that because right now that is not the way he's acting recently it has become me the president as opposed to we the people\nThis is Colin Powell lecturing us today\nDonald Trump\nAnd here's what Paul said we're gonna talk about this for a while I'm going to go into this little bit longer than I anticipated because it's way too fun and because it has everything to do with your gun this is a problem with this part of the establishment in Washington\nPost of just fun to talk about on a Monday\nHow can a president of the United states get up and say that the media is the enemy of uh of Americans he said he asked hasn't he read the first amendment you're not supposed to like everything the process or what anyone says that's why we have a First Amendment to protect that kind of speech\nI Hope the president can come to the realization that you should really stop insulting people Powell set\nI use this two years ago when I said I could not vote for him in the twenty sixteen election why get this just weren't going to break down and the next segment\nHe insulted everybody he insulted African American he insulted women he insulted immigrants he insulted our best friends around the world all of his fellow candidates up on the stage during the debate I don't think that's what should be coming out of a president of the United states\nBut I don't see anything that's changed in the last two years\nAlbright added that Trump's rhetoric about America being a victim is so not true the world is watching pile said they cannot believe we're doing things like separating mothers and children who are trying to get across the border from South of our border they can't believe we're making such an effort to seize immigration coming into the country\nIt's what's kept us alive I'm going to fix this guy as far as his comments like a chicken wing [noise]\nThat's what Trump is fixing today\nBecause Powell and his cronies he's un global lovers who grew everything off and shipped millions of jobs over this is what Trump is fixing\nThat's why he's acting the way he's acting to use house terms\nRecently it became me the president as opposed to we the people that's not true we the people are the American people not we the people of the global world of earth\nWe the people Powell means us America\nAnd pow says and you see things that should not be happening how can a president of the United states get up and say that the media is the enemy of American because the media the enemy of American coal and you don't like a year that\nI've been the you know I Wonder if Trump got that for me yeah right bowled ball question huh I've been calling the ... the grave threat to Americans for years on armed American radio\nAnd it's great to see Trump rip them apart because they are\nHe's metaphorically speaking how not an enemy on a battlefield but a battlefield of ideas metaphorically speaking you understand that\nBecause they are the enemy of half of this country probably more than half\nBecause of their left wing propaganda their gun grabbing gun hating for example for the purposes of this show I can immediately points that as an example\n\nFor their propagandize again weaponize in\n\nWhatever topic it is that they choose to use against us whether it's Christianity whether it's gun right I could go on and on but again for the purpose of this problem is is armed American radio would it be difficult for me to point out to you\nHow much the press you want me to go I don't have enough time in a year to go over the anti gun stores I've been covering them with you for years\n\nThat's why he's doing it Colin Powell half and he read the first amendment you are not supposed to like everything the press says or what anyone says that's why we have a First Amendment to protect that kind of speech it works both ways\nBut last year that establishment guy\nGood habits were going to have oh I'm going to just go oh I'm going to keep going through this this has everything to do with your guns back after this [noise]\n[noise]\nWell that's\nOur News I'm Rhonda ... more major players in international finance and

Hawkins believes and he's he's just an example of how we're rounding third going you know abusing him as an example keep this mud\n\n\nHello everybody I'm Dennis Prager this is the ultimate issues our [noise]\nThe great issues of life the third our [noise] of my Tuesday show [noise]\nReally really important our\nI\n... it to having a map and you know exactly where you are\nBut you have no idea where you're supposed to be going the ultimate issues hours about where we're going\n\nAbout about the map of where we are although that too I guess\nToday is going to be a little more political than most are not in the sense of direct politics but the subject has political direct political ramifications I have a\nHave a sad realization that I'd like to share with you\n\nOr better maybe I shouldn't put it is sad realization I have a question to\nPose\nAnd by my earlier statement that said realization you'll have an idea of what I think the answer is but here's my question\nDo people prefer liberty or to be taken care of\n\nSo you know my you know my answer even if you have never heard before just by the fact that I said said realization you know what I Believe I've come to the conclusion that most people prefer to be taken care of and lose liberty\nThan have liberty\nAnd not be taken care of and have to take care of themselves now obviously up to the extreme that you you can find a doctor you can't find a hospital you can find a policeman obviously there's we're talking about within certain bounds\n\nBooked a that is how that is how people think\nI Want to be taken care of and if I lose liberty and the process that's OK America was founded on the belief of liberty\nAnd I think most Americans assume for a while I don't know I take that back I think a lot of Americans assume that that was in a chord with the human the universal human desire freedom\nBut it it it is it do you know the New York times are you ready I'm telling you this is going to shock you\nShock you in terms of its stupidity as much as in terms of its politics the New York times had an op ed piece in the last few days\nI did not mention it but I read it and I have to clean it up I mean there wasn't it wasn't that all profane but you know kids listen to this and I'm aware of that\nThat but also put it in their very general way and somewhat opaque adults will understand it was an article about women who have lived under communism\nAnd then lived under freedom so his East German women\nAnd then the wall was torn down and they mail had freedom no longer living under communism the article was a serious article you must understand this is not all lampooned this is not from the onion it was a serious article claiming\nThat women under communist Germany living in communist East Germany\nHad a more fulfilling sex life than women in a West Germany\n\nYou read that correct now the argument was they were show taken care of that the absence of the freedom to even speak did not trouble them as much as they felt rewarded by all the benefits of a communist state\nThis by the way a series of articles in the New York times about how life in less free societies can be better\n\nSo then there was another article just the let's see what today Wall Street journal what's weeds give up for free money\n\nI moved to Sweden for love or money\nBut I was happy to learn that merely living in this social democracy also entitled me the paid parental leave benefits who could object to free money handed out by the government all Swedish parents then I became a father\n\nAnd he talks about the you know everything free health care subsidized housing paid leave out employment benefits job training pensions\nAnd you know he said this system of internal laced welfare programs is the government's attempt to realize the political and social ideal that has seemingly universal\nAcceptance among sweet tooth as noticed three get T R y doubled G. H. E. T.\n\nRight so it's it's to feel so comfortable and secure everything is taken care of\nNow\nOne of the prices you pay is that you know pretty much have to think like everybody else you know think out of the box\nAnd you just in my life becomes this is me I'm not reading from the article life becomes I've often said about Western Europe life becomes really a debate about how many hours I couldn't get off how much vacation time I can have how much I can travel\nAnd it sounds awesome it just I mean what could be better at work less\nI'm taking care of this is utopia\n\nLet me continue six months ago my two year old niece broke her leg the physician who treated the girl told my brother in law that his daughter would be given a full body seat the scan to which you might say huh\n\nShe broke her leg and the doctor wants to give the the girl a full body see the scan\nThe doctor insisted that procedure was mandatory but not for any medical reason I Wonder if a single one of you listening knows the reason the doctor ordered a full body seat the scan of a two year old girl\nThat's a lot of radiation by the way a a two year old girl gets a full body C. T. scan for a broken leg\nAnybody I Know the reason you don't think there's anyone that I couldn't guess I was thinking why she's getting a full body see peace can write\nThe doctor insisted that the procedure was mandatory get it mandatory he had no choice\nBut not for any medical reason rather the Swedish social services administration\n\nRequires such scans to look for evidence of child abuse\nWhile the doctor did note that the broken leg was the result of an accident\n\nHe told my brother in law the matter was out of my hands that is the doctor saying that it is out of my hands I I have no say on whether your daughter\nGets to see peace ... when the girl's parents refused to subject here to this unnecessary procedure the hidden machinery of the Swedish welfare state spring into action [noise] my\nBrother in law and his wife were required to attend multiple interviews with social workers\nAnd to submit friends and neighbors in in their small town for questioning social workers even inspected their phone\nSuddenly decisions is benign is why milk to buy seem potential evidence of parental deficiency my inlaws feared that there are two children might be taken from them\nIn Sweden the state reserves for itself ultimate responsibility for children's wellbeing\nAs appear at my job is to give my kids the to get that that Swedish term for this great all the developing security necessary to become productive tax paying members of Swedish society that is why I receive financial support a medical benefits\nThe state is paying me to be a parent this is the key here\nI Am in effect an employee\nWhy people are home schooled their children are look that very often negatively but a lot of other parents the states should teach your children who the hell are you to educate your own children\n\nSo this has been a revelation in my life is the ultimate issues our because this is an ultimate issues do we do we want to preserve liberty number one or take care of people\nBy take care take being taken care of now obviously there's there's got to be an element of being taken care of we we all understand that but an element is the dominant which is dominant liberty or the other\n\nEven being taken care of to the point where I don't want you to have the liberty to speak because what you say\nMay offend me\nThere's another example of liberty\nBeing downgraded on behalf of being taken care of I I don't want to hear anything that may hurt me\n\nOkay\nAh let's go to a are too doesn't agree so he gets on first hello or doesn't agree Allentown, Pennsylvania high\nHigh I think they want to be ...\nI mean in the plane\n[laughter] she talked about they get the everything is like a teenager that culture rated the jury when the teenager even

parents ever did\nSo the question of two things one is we want to make like I Am\nAnd the second thing is what was the man is a crime in our culture\nAll right I don't know where we differ but uh I
