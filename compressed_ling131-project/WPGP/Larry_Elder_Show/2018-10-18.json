B. Pritzker democratic candidate for governor and his campaign\nThat these ten to twelve black and Latino campaign workers were quote hurt it into race specific positions\nThey received less favorable treatment than their white counterparts are counterparts while also enduring over and envious racial discrimination\nThe female a campaign workers allege harassment again these tend to what is it ten or twelve\nThese it at least ten at least ten black and Latino campaign workers\nCould be more alleged gene\nShocking behavior\nOn the part of the Democrat candidate for governor ... campaign staffers complain in this a lawsuit\nThat they were discriminated against on the basis of their race that they were forced to perform racist tasks such as quote go round up forty black guys for an event\nThey were stationed in minority neighborhoods they say sometimes in unsafe areas ah they were denied resources given to white campaign workers stationed in white neighborhoods these campaign workers go onto a ledge\nOr that when they asked why J. B. Pritzker refused to make an appearance at uh the campaign office on Chicago's south side in a neighborhood that had seen a wave of violence they were told quote he'll visit when they stop shooting\nThey're asking for seven point five million dollars in damages they're asking for personal recommendations for each staffer and they're demanding that the J. B. Pritzker campaign hire a\nChief diversity officer and mandates sensitivity and inclusion training of all campaign employees\nDid I tell you that this a lawsuit\nHanded down earlier this week is three weeks from election day so here you have the Democrat candidate for governor did I mention that the Democrat candidate for governor being sued by at least ten black and Latino campaign workers\n\nThe lawsuit says J be ... for governor has a serious race problem contrary to the candidates many public vowels rather than working demeaning fully address discrimination racism is perpetrated condoned and ratified\nBy the Pritzker campaign the lawsuit was filed a October sixteenth yesterday\nIn Chicago federal court and again specifically alleges that black and Latino campaign workers are packed into majority minority neighborhoods in unsafe work conditions and they're denied benefits\nGiven to white colleagues one two three four or five yeah at least ten plaintiffs ... at least ten campaign workers\nNamed in the shoe I've never seen\nAnything like this in a campaign now the Pritzker campaign J. B. Pritzker himself came out and said forcefully denied the claims\nAre in an interview with the Chicago Sun times today calling the employees allegations quote just not true his running mate Juliana Stratton or a black female called the complaints baseless and offensive\n\nHere's the problem though right for Democrats and here's the problem for J. B. Pritzker three weeks before the election\nIt's the Democrats who\nAre tell us that\nEvery allegation needs to be heard and in fact it's the Democrats who typically tell us every allegation needs to be believed every allegation of harassment or discrimination right it's always the left\nAnd the Democrats who say you got to believe I mean my God why would think about this for a minute\nThree weeks from the election why would at least ten black and Latino campaign workers sued the campaign three weeks before the election\n... why would they do that\nAnd don't put this on the Republicans I don't know don't put this on governor Bruce Rauner in his campaign I don't know I mean the boy I'll tell you what they should be incredible work if they were able to round up in the lineup lineup and round up a or at least ten Pritzker campaign workers\n\nThe Illinois GOP issued a statement\nThe lawsuit filed against Jamie ... campaign is simply the latest in a long line of incidents that prove that when it comes to the African American community ... actions don't back up his words here we have his own staff first\nSeason political operatives alleging racial discrimination and harassment\nIt will be interesting\nTo see how big of a story this becomes\nAnd again to be careful of this was a lawsuit filed yesterday\nAlleging racial discrimination within the GB Pritzker campaign we're not talking about one two three or even for minority campaign workers we're talking about at least ten black and Latino campaign workers\nAlleging horrible and discriminatory work place practices alleging harassment staffers allege that they were hired to fill quotas and they were tasked with racist jobs\nYou know\nThe Democrats have a problem here not only again post Kavanaugh hearing right where you got to believe we got to believe every allegation I'm a every woman needs to bully be believed these these a black female and black Latino\nCampaign workers um I ... they've been telling us we got to believe right you got to believe the allegations Jamie ... I mean gee the Pritzker has been on record that when a woman comes forward man the woman's got to be hurt well then I assume that these allegations then this lawsuit needs to be hurt\nI mean you you you're three weeks out from an election\nYou got the Democratic candidate for governor in ... Illinois counting on eighty to Ninety percent of the black vote right because the Democrats are always believed that blacks are just going to vote Democrat no matter what they always line up no matter how much Democrats take advantage of blacks doesn't matter the Democrat Party believes the blacks will always lined up\nTo support the Democrat candidate in this case the Democratic candidate for governor\nWell what if\nWhat if the Democrat candidate for governor and his campaign has been practicing wide spread\nRacial and sexual discrimination\nOn that campaign\nYou would think that that should matter a little sick to\nTeen shopping [noise]\n\n\nA black families white families the up any family you've got to feed their family they got to take care of their loved ones they go to work they do everything else everybody else does so yeah I just think unfortunately a as a group\nThey up and pander to and sold a bill of goods and it's just not the most the ... just for them\nI hear you have any by by the way I mean think about this again I Want to emphasize this point\nThis lawsuit was filed three weeks before election day\n\nBy at least ten Pritzker campaign workers I can see you know one disgruntled employee maybe a couple disgruntled employees but ten ten taking that very difficult steps\nOf filing this lawsuit right before the election\nUm what's their motivation\nAll ten of them like kept all ten conspired to try to all all ten of these black and Latino campaign workers they've all conspire to take down the Pritzker campaign that doesn't make any sense at all\n[noise] Jamie's got problems\nThis just want to travel [noise]\n[laughter]\nIt's time to check their shoes real voice mail when you're sitting at my job and I know [laughter]\n\nThey didn't get to me I just hear what Joe ... stay on the radio about in ...

know his story he was fired for his religious beliefs um after he wrote a men's Bible study on his personal time but\nWhile she's Cochran prevailed if his firing could happen in the Bible belt of the south man it could happen to you where you live where you work and there will be more battles ahead according to alliance defending freedom senior counsel David\nKaufman I Do I see more challenges in the future and I think the reason for that is and it's quite ironic it happened\nIn the chiefs case and then all of these other cases you know we hear so much today about tolerance in a coup city it was the exact reason the city of Atlanta gave for firing a chief and it's quite ironic that we're being inclusive and tolerant by firing someone who disagrees with artificial views that that's what actually\nThat's why it's so urgent that you help us support alliance defending freedom you know the drill a we're taking time out of our radio show every single night were on the fundraising campaign

seeing this play out in Europe or seen play out here in America\nThe government trying to get in this speech the government trying to get into religious liberty I'm just so afraid of that I Believe generally people should be able to say whatever they want to say\nWhatever they want to say\nAnd I generally believe like on Twitter like on social media I ... if if Twitter war mine\nIf I were in charge of Twitter man I'd I'd my policy would be pretty much anything goes I generally let people tweet whatever they want to tweet\nI I don't want Twitter banning certain speech banning certain offensive tweets I don't want to go down that road I wouldn't if I were the king if I were the king of Twitter I wouldn't go down that road at all Louis Farrakhan he is an anti Semite\nLewis Farrah Khan hates Jews\nLouis Farrakhan doesn't like white people he's a racist he hates white people he believes white people are inferior man that's racism he believes that Jews are the devil man that's anti Semitic\nBut in my world the fluids Farrah Khan wants to go up on the Twitter and post something hateful\nAnd defensive about Jews in my world the freedom if I were in charge of Twitter let him do it so when Louis Farrakhan yesterday sent out a tweet\nComparing Jews to termites ...\n... if I if Twitter were mine he wouldn't violate any policy as long as ... I mean I look I Believe that is a that is offensive that's beyond offensive to believe that Jews are termites or but again if I were king of Twitter\nFerret ... got a right to tweet that\nAnd in fact he did not the first time he did but yesterday Louis Farrakhan tweeted that Jews were termites compare Jews to rats and compare Jews to termites\nIn Twitter announced that that tweet of Louis Farrakhan yesterday was not in violation of their quote de humanizing language policy\nAnd let me say for the record again if Twitter were mine there would be no de humanizing language policy but Twitter Scott it they have a policy against the humanizing language\nNow for the record to compare Jews to termites to say that Jews are termites\nI'm\n... pretty deep humanizing that right there that language right there that just the human eye she\n\nAgain I don't believe in a ... policy a dehumanizing language policy but Jews are termites Jews are rats yeah I I think if you tweet that ... she\nWith Twitter announced this morning that that tweet of Louis Farrakhan ... did not violate their policy\nHere's my problem and here's my problem with Twitter and here's my problem with Facebook and here's my problem with Instagram\nAnd here's my problem with CNN and here's my problem with NBC\nAnd all the rest you and I know I Know you and I know\nThat if I sent out a tweet and I said Muslims are termites Muslims are worse than termites you and I know that if I sent out a tweet espresso machine\nDe humanizing language against\nMuslims you and I know\nThat that would be flagged by Twitter you and I know that that tweet in mind if I went after Muslims if I insulted Muslims you\nAnd I know that Twitter would strike down that tweet would ban that tweet and we'll probably suspend me from Twitter telling me that I violated Twitter's nice humanizing language policy\n\nBecause you and I are aware of chewed damn many instances of people getting booted off of Facebook and booted off the Twitter when they go after Muslims when they go after 'em Democrats when they go after women\nWhen they go after uh the transgender community when they go after gay people\nBecause there's a do it\nThe standard for Twitter there's a double standard\nYou can\nInsult Jews and you won't ... violate Twitter's policy but insults Muslims you're gone can't do that\nYou can in Salt and then Christians on Twitter\nOr Facebook until the cows come home\nBut you say one bad word about a transgender you say one thing offensive or insulting in about a transgender on Twitter my God you're gonna be bad\n\nIt's the double standard it's the hypocrisy in the same thing we see in\nThe media media same thing we see in the CNN's or the world great Li Wei is given to people who offend\nMuslims are gays or minorities or blacks or Latinos but go after white people and that's kind of fair game you go after white Christians that's really fair game\nAnd unfortunately you go after Jews you're given a lot of leeway\nI don't believe in a de humanizing language policy\nI Want to live in a country where I can tweak something offensive about Jews or I could tweet something offensive about Muslims my problem right now\nMy big problem right now is I live in a country where I can tweak something offensive about Jews but I cannot\nTweets something offensive about Muslims it's said level standard

um if you do a search you'll find that the CIA invested in a company called inserts which became\nA the Mormon for Google and if you look deeper you'll find that intelligence agencies through I cutie that or a public venture bond funded by taxpayers that the best in these companies\nUm they invest early they have\nA large degree of control over what's happening and I'm Wondering should the taxpayer benefits when somebody like like you see that or what just the investment venture capital arm of the CIA that's their only customer yeah they invest in Facebook or Google\nThey actually can control and censor and collect data and when it goes public\nWho gets all that money should go to the taxpayer so it's a different twist I don't like censorship\nBut I can I Would ... where it can work does all that profit go\n\nUp I think that goes to overthrow other governments and I think that the intelligence community as part of a deep state\nAnd they show it goes right in the government keeps it\nWell as the taxpayer money\nThat's what I'm saying that yeah it shouldn't and we don't have a minute and the profit should be going somewhere so the taxpayer benefit not just the deep state

to stay on the board or that would be a ... villages are Barrington hills what kinds of north parents in lake burnt an island lake in Lake County like damn for thank you for joining me I'm\nYour campaign in hard uh you are a Republican I tell everybody how important I think it is to vote Republican state and local this year you're running against a Democrat why when you go to the door why is it so important that somebody like you get elected\nWell joke affects a lot for having me on and and thanks for the question ah you know Ninety five percent of the doors that I knock on people I talked to in a district or or just I mean they they've had it up to their eyeballs with uh our high property tax write offs and something has got to stop as I like to tell people\nProperty taxes that the engine that is pulling our economic train out of Illinois and if we don't get a head of this thing oh you're going to see a lot more people leaving the state yeah um\nSo I have taken I think strong leadership stances on\nDealing with this issue I'm proud that we just finished an ice sponsored a resolution on Lake county board\nTo actually have placed on the ballot this November for every single Lake County voter a ballot referendum that simply stage show the states or show the Illinois euro simply amend the state constitution to\nBan the creation of a new state wide property tax and everybody should be voting yes on that show I Know you know there's been a lot of voters dumped\nA couple of months ago the\nReserve Bank of the Federal Reserve bank of\nChicago recommended\nThat state of Illinois Institute and\nAn additional one percent state wide property tax on the value of our homes and businesses and the reason they want to do that is to pay down that two hundred fifty billion dollar pension debt have hanging over our heads and our kids' heads and that's what they want to use that money for\nAnd we need to tell them no more\nA boy I'll tell you I'm so glad you brought that up and like the fourth everybody might be in fourth or he's on the lake county board he wants to stay in the lake on board he's a Republican district Seventeen that would be the lake county parts of Barrington hills what kind of north brings in like ... an island lake\nSo this referendum like that you were instrumental in getting on the ballot or the vote is yes please again just because this is really important explain this to our listeners in Lake County why this is so important\nNow we're a last question Arizona I Know that Trump is coming in I think before the weeks out how does Trump play in a state like that\nI think that's actually a tough question I'm a I'm a little bit surprised to see him going out there where you are but I Do think at the same time there have been some victories and I thought they like order security the president could in fact the motivating for a lot of Republicans who feel strongly about that issue\nOr maybe even a lot of a wall get built at NPR who again don't like Jeff Flake and then those could be Trump Republican so\nWhat a a ... I'm hopping Alexandra but it it just your your quick take on the house control of the house um I I think the conventional wisdom still is the Democrats are the favored to assume control but\nThat's no sure thing is it\nI don't think it's a sure thing and I kind of buy into that conventional wisdom for the most part but I Do think if you look at the enthusiasm gap I'll be going into a lecture and first term president\nThe momentum was very much on the Democratic side I think it is but to me I think that the whole cabinet confirmation fight the extent that it's still on people's mind I think that at least has helped a little bit and you're out there and there's the asthma gap and get more Republican\nA little bit more revved up and they might otherwise be especially if they're happy with that sort of President Trump status quo might be staying home I think you might see some more of those voters turning out and then maybe suburbs I'm In certain places that might end up ship can't up all of those races back that your pie\nI Know you ... and if it feels like a lifetime ago already to Kevin hearing and I know you\nCovered it extensively I mean we're twenty days away from an election in maybe this is a stupid question if it is I Apologize when most people go to the polls in twenty days are they still going to have the whole Calvin on mess on their minds do you think\nI think that's I think that's most important question right now honestly because it is if it is on their minds I think that'll be intensely motivating after Republican voters and to me\nIt's less about what those voters are thinking once they get to them owning your birth and much more about is that if you're going to be important enough to drive them to the polls because again the status quo for Republicans right now probably happy with the economy for the most part happy with the president out or at least the policies that we've gotten lost junior\nMight not really feel or the emphasis to get out and vote but in the states like Indiana\nMissouri North Dakota places where there are democratic incumbent\nPeople who voted against a Brett Kavanaugh I think voted Republican voters might be thinking to themselves\nHey look I Know Trump's it off it but I I don't want my democratic senator and there anymore this is that bad I got to do something\nWhat ... what this this whole notion of this gender gap ah there's this chasm between with women those opposed to to Trump and wanting to vote Democrat because they opposed Trump as as to those who support Republicans it's huge the gap is pretty big why is that\nI mean there's no question that that gap is there that and I think it not I don't like the fact that oftentimes the electrical treat women at the model that started I think conservatives really need to take seriously the fact that that gap is there and I think to me I my read on it is that the president has a a certain style of a certain kind of rhetoric that\nI think perhaps turns off women more than anything look at the other day I called the ... what about yesterday likewise but uh things like that again it's not about the policies are conservative women I think try to focus on policies and that's why they can sometimes still support at the G O P and the president but for a lot of women that kind of stuff is intensely alienating and understand\nAnd and so again conventional wisdom told me if you buy it or not because of that outside of the conservative women all the other women in the country or most people think that's gonna really impact a lot of these house races\nI think that's right and I ... I'm not sure if it will have the same way in the Senate races which is where a lot of buy coverage has focused but I Do think\nIf you have your sort of standard route of the male Democrat running in a suburban for example a district and you have the sort of you know ... suburban soccer mom type but people are going to tend to to shy away from Donald Trump even if they have voted for out of milk test Republican country club Republican in the past they might thank you know I'm ready for a change\nA Alexandra last question on the Senate again is ... is is there a surprise you're looking at what race do you think uh could could most surprise us on election night\nYou know I don't know if this would necessarily be a surprise but I feel pretty strongly about my ... on each Joe Donnelly and I I think that as a surprise right simply because I think it Under Cover yeah stated obviously extremely under old and so it's hard to really get a read on it but\nI was out there last month I'm working on a profile right now a Republican background and I think out you know that the Trump said at the ... really in a lot more trouble than people are talking about\nGreat stuff Alexandra and just say just she writes for the national zoo a Alexander thank you so much for\nThe rest of the show last fall the Congressman Joe Joe shape [laughter]\nHappier for my shiny or don't care after she had really know what it was a lot\nShe is a hundred and five lean pounds of shiny moved happy dog for life\nShutting it stopped itching and stopped since two thousand and one\nWe've helped more than a quarter million dogs get over their nutritional deficiency misery and saved our customers zillions and ...\nEverything we tried failed except died of come to a diner by crowded and I'll be I Can't [noise] if you like a duck and how are you gotta pay the bulk of how I\nGot three fatty I think a digested any viable that are cooked out regular dog diner fight is Tricia dying to fight for life\nDon't let your dog itch scratch stink or shed like crazy come to China for help\nEight five nine four to eight one eight five nine four one K.

individual rights thanks to our friends at alliance defending freedom\nYou know the story we talk about it yesterday the city of Atlanta\nHas agreed to pay one point two million dollars to settle a lawsuit brought by alliance defending freedom on behalf of former fire chief\nCalvin Cochran you know his story he was fired\nFor his religious beliefs\nUm after he wrote a men's Bible study on his personal time\nWhile chief Cochran prevailed if his firing could happen in the Bible belt of the south man it could happen to you where you live where you work and there will be more battles ahead according to alliance defending freedom senior counsel David\nKaufman\nI Do I see more challenges\nMe in the future and I think the reason for that is and it's quite ironic it happened\nIn the chiefs case and then all of these other cases you know we hear so much today about tolerance and inclusive and it was the exact reason that the city of Atlanta gave for firing a chief and it's quite ironic that we're being inclusive and tolerant I firing someone who disagrees with artificial views that that's what actually happened\nThat's why it's so urgent that you help us support alliance defending freedom you know the drill a we're taking time out of our radio show every single night were on the fundraising campaign with alliance defending freedom or they are the group like no other group in this country that defends\nFreedom remember if you miss a show please do catch the pod cast Walsh\nFreedom dot com slash pod cast I got to bring this up again because I had\nA number of people hammer me\nWhat was it a two days ago we got the report out that the federal budget deficit for this past fiscal year that just ended a September thirty\nI'm Donald Trump's\nA first full fiscal year the budget deficit\nOr jumped up to Seventy seven hundred and eighty billion dollars a a Seventeen percent increase over the prior year are the highest budget deficits since two thousand and twelve\nUm and I I remember this story broke Monday the same day that everybody and their mother was talking about\nElizabeth Warren in her DNA results saying how much of an Indian itchy and how much Indian blood does she have dinner\n\nAnd and this was the topic did you are on\nConservative talk radio and Fox News\nAnd I I I didn't have much interest at that to me it's just a silly stupid story\nOr Elizabeth Warren getting a DNA test to prove she's Indian or not it's just silly and stupid\nAnd Trump responding to her calling her Pocahontas just silly and stupid the whole thing silly stupid\n\nAnd so I didn't talk about it I didn't want to talk about it I got angry because people wanted me to talk about it and I said instead I said you know what matters\nThis issue doesn't matter what the hell does this matter for why are we talking about this this doesn't matter what matters what matters is the bankrupt in the future generations that's what matters\n\nThe beauty of Monday was both of these stories had Elizabeth Warren's DNA results\nAnd the federal budget deficit jumping to the highest it's been since twenty twelfth the think about that from that just think about that ... position they're two major stories hit on Monday\n\nAnd everybody covered the first\nEverybody covered Elizabeth Warren's DNA results and every body except this show ignored the huge jump in the deficit\n\nWhat does that say about us as a country\n...\nWhat does that say about us as a people\nWrite it says to me that a country more interested in\nHow much of an Indian Native American Elizabeth Warren is a nation more interested in that then a rising federal budget deficit is a nation or that deserves to be bankrupt\nAnd that's the way I thought that's the way I see it\nKind of like a whole room thing going on right at\nThe end of the empire bread and circuses right just play games just to entertain me the people of people who grow fat lazy and stupid just entertain me\n\nAnd yeah I think that's where we are in America\nAnd a Monday didn't prove it to me Monday just\nReinforced it for me\nWe are not a serious people\nAnd by the way when I say something like that\n\nI'm not talking about everybody\nI may not I'm probably not talking about you\nWhen I sit here on my high horse and say we are not a serious people\nUnderstand that ah that's hyperbole I I Know there are serious people in this\nCountry I consider myself to be serious I'm sure plenty of you are serious but when I say the American people are not a serious people\nTalking about most of the American people and I I won't budge off of that\nAnd I will believe that that is our problem\nI I Will choose to believe that\nThat right there um the fact that we have eight people not serious\nA people not responsible\nUh people uh who would rather be entertained then informed and educated educated\nPeople who are can tell you\nAbout\nBeyonce\nAnd not tell you a damn thing about George Washington or that some people\nAre no longer worthy of a great country and and that's a people that will bring down a great country\n\nStudy or history\nOr study your history of the Roman empire\nOr it's it's pretty clear\n\nThat the people of Rome or\nChose to play games\nGet drunk be entertained and just sort of be silly\nAnd the umpire disappeared I think that's where we're at um we have people who no longer\nDo their part in this thing we call the republic or they no longer stay engaged and informed and educated they no longer stay involved politically they go to their phones in their computers in their TVs\nAnd they watch silly shows and movies and listen to music and they can't tell you who this a chief justice of the Supreme Court is they can't tell you who the vice president is\n\nThey can't really tell you what the bill of rights is\n\nAnd I think this problem of the people\n\nDoing what\nOur founders believed they needed to do\nTo keep this great republic going\n\nA Thomas Jefferson said\nThey probably all set a variation of this but Thomas Jefferson said\nIt it takes two to tango it takes to to keep this republic\nThe representatives well they've got to represent\nThey've got to listen to the people they've got to represent the people but they're represented\nThose who are represented they got a job to\nThey got to stay involved they got to stay informed they gotta stay educated they've got to stay engaged\nAnd if they don't want\n\nThis government of representation this ... public it will not last\n\nThat's what some pretty damn great men believed\nIt can't last it won't last\n\nEight five five six for two fifty six hundred\nCountry more concerned about Elizabeth Warren's DNA more concerned about that than the bankrupting of our future generations\nAre is a country full of way too many people who\nAre simply just not serious [noise]\n\n\nThis is personal to me\n\nAnd I I Can't hide my disappointment I Can't but it bothers me something big or it bothers me that so many of you so many of us\nConservatives\nTea Party patriots\nThe very issue that activated us eight ten years ago\nThe bankrupting of this country that issue that issue that issue\nSprawl the Tea Party movement to life\nAnd here we are eight years later and we're doing it again and all of my Tea Party folk are quiet\nAnd and I know why and you know why it's because Trump's president not Obama it's because Trump's president that George W. Bush\nAnd it's this thing where you treat Trump or like a unlike any other politician\nIt's this thing like you got so much invested in him it's this thing like\nYou hold Trump to a lower standard\n\nAny other president who runs up these kinds of deficits\nOr they can be strung up\nThe Trump no that's different Joe\n\nI hear that a lot I hear that a lot\nIn it bummed me out ah I I Hope I'm not loving you out harping on this but I\nI'm doing it on purpose\nAnd I'll drop it here in the ... but\nI I Want you to think long and hard about this\nWhat's more important is standing by Trump no matter what\nWe're stopping the bankrupting the future generations in this country what's more important I Want you to think about that I Want you to think about this\nDo you still care about the debt in deficits\nAnd if you do why aren't you speak enough [noise]\nThink about that [noise]\nAre you ready to throw up the free says this is Joe Walsh program ... enjoy your show signs of say live radio\n[noise]\n[noise] what is already News I'm Rhonda rock struck\nA continued threat for flooding in central Texas is more reads expected to fall on the already saturated area for dams or open along the swollen Colorado River for more to be open tomorrow making a eight total a record number at the damn\nGeneral Joseph Dunford chairman of the joint chiefs of staff does Mitt today with Saudi Arabia defense chief amid deteriorating relations between the two nations after the disappearance of parent death of a Saudi journalist who lived in the U.S\nNew York prosecutors say former lead police detective in the Harvey Weinstein sexual assault investigation urged one of his accusers to delete information from her phone before turning it over to prosecutors\nManhattan District attorney's office detailed the Alan and alleged misconduct in the ... lawyer that was made public today and they all cs final Dodgers beat Milwaukee five to they go up in the series three to to this is this are in news\nToday I'm Scott from plugging past free I Want to personally think all my plug in Pittsburgh costs must have taken the time out to call right and who left messages to thank me for ruining their homes and businesses of I wanted wrote in past problems\nSo for me to you I think you plugging pass phrase the only scientifically tested and more importantly\nConsumer proven electro magnetic pest management system since Nineteen Ninety five why put up with those annoying ... any longer plugging in past phrase one hundred percent chemical free making it you're safe is bad too many ... past problems around your family and pets\nWas sixteen I money back guarantee you have nothing to lose so old are yours today at go past free dot com used primarily ... saved twenty four twenty percent off and free shipping that go past free dot com primary card save twenty\nTimes spraying regret plug in and forget go past free dot com today [noise]\nFour fifty fee answer whether [noise]\n\nIn early evening showering from Vonnegut my partial clearing knife risking cold there will be in areas across the galloping thirty three written some are either fight sunshine high forty eighth a lot of them are nine thirty three friday against some folks around in the morning and I'm like sunshine will give waited clouds\nNot as harsh for the African even a high friday at fifty six degrees meteorologist Daniel I'm you know I Am told fifty fanfare\nDid you have an Eighteen midterm elections may be the most consequential in memory in\nPennsylvania will play a critical part maybe the critical part in the outcome please join me for the battleground talkers tour andme onto our heights country club October twenty second along with my friends she healing\nDennis ... first phone John's diver wants as we clarify wants to say this November ticket started just twenty dollars get details on dinner the program in the IT tickets now at the answer P.
