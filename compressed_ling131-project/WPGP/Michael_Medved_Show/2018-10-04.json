due process but all those mean women were saying those nasty things about him\nSo just the way she posed the question it was like almost having sympathy for Bill yeah I Know you know these women they that this stuff about bill and he was convicted without ever really getting any but uh no no hearing and needed that was terrible that without the bill\nAnd then she switches gears right away it
