happiness and ... and who and to secure these rights secure these rights governments are instituted among men among men yeah Iraq and otherwise\nSo the idea of government that's what they were doing they were setting up a government to secure these rights but doing it as and the last words the declaration isn't so we pledge to one another our lives our fortunes and our sacred honor\nIn other words the the whole idea of creating a new nation or it involves nationalism because the recognition that Jefferson had and all the founders had\nIs that without a nation without a government without some kind of social structure anarchy simply doesn't work\nAnd there are no rights unless a government exist to protect them so this is one of those things I understand people have gotten a very very bad taste from government meddling in big government and certainly\nIn the twentieth century there were monstrous examples of a governmental tyranny particularly in the communist world and a Nazi world elsewhere\nBut the idea that this somehow reflect badly on nationalism and there was a guy named St John ... who ah wrote a book defining what this New America was and he begins by saying who is this American this new man\nThe work national after the racial implications and America since the reviews then by the no nothing's New York is Nineteen sixties it was used to exclude the Irish the

this is can we recognize that American nationalism from the beginning of the country\nHas been different because it has not been based on race in other words the ... and ... in German nationalism\nA such as it is it all very complicated there's a a a a a a tweet that came out uh basically defending Hitler in order to condemn Trump that we have to get to in a moment\nBut ah at Hitler wasn't even

extreme form of nationalism now if you take an extreme form of nationalism uh where are you you were insisting that you are in nation must rule\nThe whole world problematic but one of the points that the people who've written about this make in defense of nationalism in in defense of identity is that if you don't have a nation defining who you are\nAnd do you define who you are based upon race or ethnic background or something other than a a national inheritance or a national cause\nIt's far more dangerous and far more toxic\nAnd or in terms of a ...

... he's also an expert because he wrote the book on it literally on the question of voter fraud and manipulating elections\nJohn is a columnist for National Review he is a contributor at Fox News\nAnd he has why is the blue wave looking more like a splash\nThen it soon I mean that's his latest piece it at our at National Review John thanks very much for coming on the show a pleasure Mike level always okay\nRight now uh uh ... how many states approximately\nAre people already sending balance of course here in the state of Washington people are because it's all vote by mail\nThirty states have some form of early voting whether it's absent here\nUh you know showing up at a government office before the election\nOkay so let me put the word out to people anyone listening to his right now and one of those thirty eight states and you probably are I don't wait sending your ballot get it done that way you you make sure you're making a contribution\nTo this important national decision the consensus seems to be on the part of everybody who's looking as Johnson that the momentum seemed to turn around in a Republican direction after the Kavanaugh hearings you agree with that\n[noise] well I think a lot of people had baked and the cake any negative attitudes they have the President Trump and I think that Trump's antics\nAs a personality had depressed part of the Republican base but the Kavanaugh hearings brought out the ugliness of the left their complete disregard for normal procedures and rules and the rule of law\nAnd I think that at best that show the Democrats to be the equal of Trump in the violating norms and politics\nAnd at worst almost extra constitutional so I think that Trump\nManaged to succeed where nobody else ever thought he would he managed to get the Democrats to drop their own to block to her surprise on their feet never to blow up in their face\nAnd yeah it's it does it does seem like that and I know there are a bunch of people like Dean Heller a who is long considered our most endangered a center at the center for Nevada\nHe strongly supported Brett Kavanaugh's confirmation and that appears to have given him a boost I think they're running time now right now in Nevada are they\nI think of the election were held today Republicans would lose none of their seats and the only question is what the Democrats lose two three or four years\nWow which means that of course Republican control of the Senate what about on the house side\n[noise] I Would say the Democrats\nBecause of a variety of good factories including the fact that uh\nYou know suburban women become one of the most resistant groups against Trump twenty five point gender gap against them a gift Republicans I think they're sixty percent chance to take back the house with sixty percent of the lot lower than it was two or three weeks ago because I think that\nAs the issues start to be talked about you know remember most\nOf your listeners are into politics Michael you and I are into politics the average voter doesn't pay attention to much closer to the election so when they\nActually look at the issues to the center right country and if the Republicans frame the issues property they tend to close the gap in the last two weeks unless there's some\nExtraneous about like the two thousand they financial meltdown\nOkay two two issues which are very much front and center at this moment uh one is the alleged had horrible gaffe that President Trump made last night and used and when he called himself a nationalist do you think this is going to alienate millions and millions of American voters\nI think it maybe hundreds and hundreds of reporters and journalist or once again appalled\nBy the fact that the president is\nYou know troll ... telling them I mean I noticed when he said he said I don't I'm not supposed to say it but I'll say that anyway I mean look the president may not be the most elegant speaker but boy does he know how to use language as a weapon up but it ... whenever ears as a trigger word someone doesn't like he he pulls the trigger\nRight and a pulls the trigger on on them to watch their heads to explode and I it's just extraordinary I'd like to hear people I even offered to listeners to call up and say why nationalism was a bad word a one eight hundred nine five Seventeen Seventy six our phone number go ahead\nIt has some bad historical antecedent but basically it's another sending them and I think you've pointed this out for patriotism\nYeah of course a ... and again the first three Senate ... that are listed when you just click on it on the Internet are national stealing a national uh as patriotic feeling pardon me patriotism and flag waving\nAnd uh nothing wrong with any of those three things what about we we had on yesterday and I Eric eggers who\nIs a very concerned about ah the confusion in American voting registration suggesting that as many as twenty four percent uh of registered voters right now are really shouldn't be voting\nHow you've written about this um extensively do you think that's a very big problem two weeks in the day\nIt depends on the state or you know I I hate to draw national brushing twenty four percent sure sounds high to me I think that the problem with voter fraud as it doesn't show up until the very end\nWith an election was closed and somebody gets desperate and they put their thumb on the scale and send the street money out and it all happens quickly at the very end you know under the cover of a ... you know vans and everything else so we may not know\nWhat happens but we do know that we need to watch for it and if there's anything on toward\nThese bad with these lists like in Georgia you\nKnow these ... these are not people are being prevented from voting it just means they have to show up at the polls and fill out a provisional ballot and prevent their id it doesn't we're not preventing anyone from voting we're just making sure the person who's voting is the person they say they are\nYeah I mean while I'm there is a um a this additional thirty six governors' ships that are up in in this election right now right\nYeah it's a big this is the big casino yeah and these these these\nGovernorship will help decide how redistricting is done after the next census within two in two years\nRight which will also help to determine whoever wins what will be a very close election you don't think there's any chance the Democrats win more than thirty seats to you\nThere oh no no no in fact I think I think the governorships they're going to be a lot of swaps the ... Democrats will take back some Midwestern states that have been in Republican control for a long time like Illinois\nAnd the Republicans are going to take back I think there will pick back states where the Democrats mismanaged the finances so bad that ah you know they've given up any chance of governing but Connecticut by the way even Oregon even Oregon make elected Republican governor for the first time in Thirty years\nRight which would be amazing Boyd is Kate Brown ever deserve to be voted out of power in Oregon now there's one surprise to look for is there a Republican candidate against Angus King in Maine\nThere is but it is a good guy but unfortunately Angus King has this impenetrable independent damage because he technically runs as an independent so he's got that nailed down\nOkay except I understood the New York times today random forming piece about the Democrat there is a democratic nominee against Angus King whose name is Zak Ringelstein and he apparently is a big Bernie Sanders guy he's been endorsed by democratic socialist\nIf we could encourage anybody listening to us up in Maine vote your conscience vote for the real socialist votes or ringelstein the Democrats and makes his has right there has to be at least forty percent something like that all votes Republican anyway right\n[noise] well you know I'll I'll say is that when you're trying to remember who to vote for king does beat rankled Stein\n[laughter] at the ... yes in in terms of the future but I I assume that the Republican candidate could do more than ringelstein as well any other surprises that you think we should look out for an election day\nYeah Minnesota Senate race the the the L Frank and resigned from the appointed incumbent named Tina Smith Michael last night they have the only debate the Democratic candidate didn't\nShow up refused to show up fighting scheduling difficulties there was one candidate on the stage the Republican candidate and at the podium\nWow and uh\nBy the way as close to the polls if a six point race according to the Minneapolis Star Tribune which does Republicans do favors at its poles\nThat is terrific I'm I'm actually going to be in Minnesota and a campaign event on Thursday night there are three red hot congressional races in Minnesota there to Senate races one of them not so red hot where I think isn't senator club is on the ballot to\nShe's the ... probably the only political figure of the Democratic side who came out with a reputation and a half of the cabinet are here in\nBay or John son's reputation enhanced by his new\nColumn about the blue wave looking more like a splash than its nominee we will be right back on the ... that show with some of the worst political ads of the season\nHave good chance of knocking on some democratic seats I Know there's a district in Minnesota where the Republicans actually now favored by the cook Political Report to win a democratic seat um\n... where do you think Republicans should place the emphasis in these last two weeks they campaign in order to try to hold on to the house\nWell I think that they have to emphasize three things one is you know even though there are problems in the world were peace\nAnd frankly we are more respected now than we were two years ago that's number one to\nThe economy is really good and that's not an accident or a ... a buck Obama's policies having a delayed reaction if you want higher taxes and want to take a risk with picking the economy backwards vote for the Democrats the takeover Congress and the third is you know\nUh there's some basic things the Democrats don't seem to care about one of the rule of law as proven by Kavanaugh and to\nWhy are they saying nothing about this caravan this mob whatever you want to call it that moving up from Mexico as the wall Street Journal reported today which is very pro immigration this is outrageous that we have these people encouraged to move to the United states that influence our election\nAnd at the same time the Democrats are completely silent but a fundamental issue of national sovereignty\nAnd apparently this is the work of a former president of Honduras and his henchmen\nEr which the wall Street Journal is written about in the Daily Beast has written about that this really started or as as basically a means of undermining the current center right president of Honduras and to hold the American people hostage to the vagaries of ... door and\nDirty tricks campaigning doesn't seem a good idea Jon\nOr of the Democrats need to step forward and say this is wrong and I hear crickets cricket\nWell exactly where they have nothing to say because again they would much prefer to a run on the the the the family separation issue which they tried to make a great
