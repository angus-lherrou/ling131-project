first time in a very very long time we will get to that story\nOr there's also a very good news just broke moments ago\nUh from the White House about fulfilling something that I had been pushing for for a while on this show\nAnd I'm very glad to see it it's a cold and across the board\nBudget cut spending cuts for every federal departments that President Trump is apparently planning to demand\nAnd as president he can demand that are starting tomorrow and that is appropriate meanwhile continued ramifications about this horrible murder\nIn Turkey and it appears pretty obvious that it was a murder\nIs Trump responsible that's what a lot of people on the left and in the media ... sometimes means the same thing are saying uh plus uh we we really do need to go to uh some of the other media stories\nAbout media malfunctions including an attempt to slime a great American just moments after he died a we will get to all of that on the ... show one eight hundred nine five five Seventeen Seventy six is our phone number\nFirst off this very positive story or and and again it's a story not based upon\nA conservative source it's based upon the world Economic Forum which every year does a rating in terms of the most competitive countries in the world\nAnd the U.S had not been doing badly compared to most other countries in the world we've been fairly competitive but we moved up very dramatically and we are now number one of the story is it's covered in uh on line of the wall Street Journal\nOr is US's world's most competitive economy for the first time in a decade the last time we were the world's most competitive economy was two thousand and eight\nOne is two thousand and they'd have in common with a two thousand sixteen Republican presidents and yes that does make a difference when you have a pro business guy in charge\nThe U.S is back on top of the most competitive economy in the world regaining the number one spot for the first time since two thousand eight and an index produced by the world Economic Forum which had the country could still do better on social issues okay\nAmerican climbed one place in the rankings of a hundred and forty countries with Tom five rounded out by Singapore number to Germany number three Switzerland number four in Japan number five or five countries scores rose from two thousand Seventeen with us not seeing the second biggest gain\nAfter Japan's\nNow all of this is good news is good news for us that Germany is more competitive that Switzerland is more competitive particularly that Japan is more competitive\nThese are American allies and I know Swiss Switzerland supposed to be not aligned neutral it's effectively because of trade and economic matters it's an American ally it's tied into the west\nThe top spot hasn't gone to the U.S since the financial crisis of two thousand and eight stalled output and triggered a global economic slowdown\nEconomic recovery is well underway with a global economy projected to grow almost four percent in two thousand Eighteen in two thousand and Nineteen said the report that uh was published\nA last night by the organization that produces the Davos conference on global politics and economics okay you may say well what does this have to do with my life everything because a more competitive economy means more jobs it means higher wages\nAnd means more prosperity it means more freedom\nBecause frankly if you'll have more options in terms of the jobs you look for in the way that you are in your living in the way that you can invest what ever dollars you can save\nIf if you have more choices that is the equivalent to more freedom\nAnd then there's this uh President Trump\nActually just talked about this at a a White House meeting and a ... this is uh what what President Trump made gives me it was just health he announced in advance\nThat he was going to make a demand from his cabinet secretaries and here is what that demand sounded like just moments ago\nI'm going to ask each of you to come back with a five percent budget cuts\nFrom fuel various departments whether it's the secretary of administrators whatever I Would ask everybody to come back with a fiber says God for the for the next week and I think you'll be able to do with their baby a special\nExemption perhaps how to do that exemption would be if you can do more than five some of you will say hey I can be much more of a you know\nI've heard about the penny for Fifteen Years one Betty every year for a dollar one very every year after four or five years the countries in good shape of a say with the petty ... five but it but I think you can do it\nSo I'd like to have everyone around the table\nYou're incredible domains that you've presided over so bravely in some cases some cases very well some cases where there's like a I Would like you to come back with a a five percent cut [noise]\nGet rid of the fat that heard of the way and I'm sure you can do it I'm sure everybody has to say look at those\nOkay this is terrific and this is one of the best moments for the president so far in my opinion\nOne eight hundred nine five five Seventeen Seventy six the only thing that I Would add\nAnd and I feel kind of an bowling to do this because this is something that we've talked about on the show we saw that recently we've talked about a month ago it was necessary it was great the president is right on target there's one thing you could add which is I'm going to set the example\nAnd I'm going to ... my White House budget I'm going to cut it right now\nAnd we're going to come back to you at the same time on all of you to come back and show them not cutting just five percent on cutting ten percent and by the way it is easy to cut the White House budget by ten percent there too many darn people who work in the White House near stumbling over one another by the way one of the good things about Trump is he has an appointed\nPeople to fill all of those useless jobs at the White House wants a useless John you have a whole offices with a director and then an associate director and then various secretaries for things like the office of White House liaison to this disabled community now this is not that this the disabled community\nBut there's no reason there are other government departments the deal with that health and Human Services has a huge commitment to that you don't need a special White House office there is a special White House office was damaged by President Clinton\nTo deal with the ... T community why it's not necessary that doesn't mean that access should be divide the denied the algae Beatty people look there's a special White House office to deal with the Jewish community\nAnd I benefited from it because I during the Bush administration they wouldn't have a Hanukkah party and it was a lovely thing\nKeep up the Hanukkah party but you don't need a special White House liaison you don't need a special White House of Ponte you don't need somebody drawing a government salary they can tough this back we have a deficit right now seven hundred and Seventy nine billion dollars it went up Seventeen percent since last year it's not because of the Republican tax cuts\nIf you actually look at this and you read some of the hysterical democratic articles\nThey make it clear revenues have not gone down sharply if anything they may have gone up very slightly they basically been stable was gone up has been spending\nAnd yes it's true as Mitch McConnell made the point yesterday that much of that spending about half of it is three big federal programs and Mitch McConnell made a little bit of missed it many said that the Seventy percent of the federal budget\nIs Medicare Medicaid and Social Security it's not Seventy percent it's about fifty percent\nIf you add on an interest on the national debt and a bunch of other social programs then it gets up to Seventy percent but still the point is that there is room for cutting the federal deficit we're really highlighted some of the programs some of the stupid spending that has really crippled our country\nNow that does not include however spending to get a new ambassador to Saudi Arabia this is something that President Trump could look into or do I believe that President Trump is to blame for the killing of ... of course not\nAnd this is a ridiculous ... liberal\nBasically incantation and if they say it or not they say it enough it might be true and now it's not true do I think President Trump is doing a great job on Saudi Arabia and not so much but it's going to be okay it's going to be OK if he keeps in mind certain facts and priorities about our\nRelationship with his desert kingdom out by the way that desert kingdom one of those in white and play tonic wonderful blend no this is a ruling corrupt autocracies so how do you deal with it will get to that and your calls coming up on them at that show [noise]\n\nIs each of the federal departments is a lot of a set amount of money and let's say you have a a government bureau department is is a has a budget of a hundred\nDollars well that budget cut would mean you find five billion dollars to safe but you're you're right to bring this up to and thanks for the call let's go to I'm Mark in Columbus ohio mark you're on the Michael ...\nThank you sir I really appreciate your ah your bipartisan\nOr ... or your ah\nYour regular view of America really appreciate that thank you [noise] um yeah when you say a President Trump should lead by example he really are [noise] ah I mean once you've got yourself a ... he's already left opposition was open\nOn the field as a as a from people would say and and ... alone I think she she yeah I mean the numbers are incredible something like a a the previous administration had a hundred and twenty five\nAnd a way of twenty five I was going to bring this point up the your ear entirely on the right track I'm\nMichelle Obama had a staff of sixteen to twenty four people depending on when and her eight years as first lady Lonnie has a staff of nine\nBut you know what ... Milan you could make do with a staff of seven [laughter] don't you think and and and seriously because this whole thing about getting first ladies big staff\nIs is relatively new and uh and the point is you're right Trump has left a bunch of White House positions unfilled and good for him but I'm ... the whole idea when people talk about turmoil in the White House\nThere would be less turmoil if there were less people working there fewer people working there and I I think that's very very clear I um\nI wrote a book about this a long time ago it was at the time that it came out which was a very long times forty years ago the time it came out last thirty nine that time the shadow presidents came out it was the first comprehensive history of the White House staff up to that time\nAnd it's shocking a President Lincoln won the civil war\nWith the White House staff of two that's right too it was him and to assistance because he had a cabinet as well and I'm not saying that presidents should try to deal with the White House staffers too but he could probably make do with White House staff of two hundred we'll be right back [noise]\nThe Michael ...

people only people who have been ignoring the problems within the party could have been surprised by Trump's when I I certainly was not surprised I I I knew that these problems are building\nAnd then um your your other question is about a libertarian thought leaders while you mentioned by professor in Jordan Peterson in Canada I Would I wasn't aware of mental ... early last year as people began speaking\nWho has talked about the problem of overspending and that has just pulled the Ryan and Republicans rose to power in two thousand and ten in part by right raising the alarm about the deficit now that's true and Paul Ryan is still talking about President Trump was talking about it today\nAnd um then they have right below that is another headline add one more insult to presidents catalogue

to be women and then there's this in adds some Democrats are being cast as terrorists\nAnd um\nThen they say ... a Democrat running for Congress and California has been portrayed as a terrorist sympathizers\nOkay the headline\nSays are being cast as terrorists this is a phony head it is a lie there are no as out there that are saying the Democrats are terrorists\nThey are making a point that this guy a mark ... who's running against Duncan Hunter is a is a terrorist sympathizer how do we know because he donated money for the cause\nLook I I\nFirst of all his grandfather was one of the masterminds of the Munich Olympic massacre it's his grandfather and he used to praise his grandfather and their stuff on the Internet about him calling his grandfather a legend which he has since deleted and now he apparently converted to Christianity good for him but even since his conversion to Christianity\nOr he is continued to give money to donate money to uh the council on American Islamic Relations\nWhich is not a terrorist organization but it is an organization that justifies and sympathizes with a Muslim extremism I had a brain Hooper on this radio show\nWho was head of the time of the council on American Islamic Relations with the congressional candidate donated to\nAnd um I was trying to put it brought him who were on the spot\nAnd us saying did he prefer would he liked to see ... replace the constitution of the United states kind of straightforward question and I said at a simple answer of no absolutely not would suffice it wouldn't give that answer\nAnd I pushed and pushed and pushed and then eventually said yes well if we ever get a majority of Muslims in the United states it would be appropriate to uh to have sharia replaced the constitution sorry that's an extreme position\nAnd it is worth it is perfectly legitimate for I'm Duncan Hunter and for the Republican campaign committee which is working to defend that congressional seat to make it clear that the\nThe candidate that they are running a mark ... who by the way has changed his name to make it sound less he he he used to be\nHis middle name used to be Yasser and that was changed um [noise] it the entire thing is is is crazy now the reason by the way that he is even the Democratic nominee is no one wanted to run against Duncan Hunter because before he was indicted\nIt was a looking like this was a slam dunk for Republicans in by the way it should be and for people who are listening to his down in San Diego\nCounty where there's congressional seat is I've I've been very critical of Duncan Hunter I don't think he has a big future in politics she he he does need to respond effectively to the charges against him\nBut that doesn't mean that he shouldn't be re elected to

and I uh I have to say it might be the worst generation we got one working now that might be in competition for it but that's that's for another show anyway this is something that nobody could have predicted when we were in college we baby boomers\nAnd if this had happened in the sixties or seventies half of the people between ... sixteen and what twenty four something like that would have moved

made a one of his campaign promises than there is he's the he's the he's the prime minister and he\nCame to on his promise just like Donald Trump to do down here\nSo you know if you're old enough to remember uh when Bill Clinton showed up on the scene back in the early nineties he is in Salt and everybody's intelligence he was asked if he ever smoked weed he said he never inhaled okay\nNow only someone from another generation bought that steaming pile of horse manure for two seconds but ... but bill there's pictures of bill with long hair you know he looked like a hippie he had long hair everybody did long hair and a beard he was over at ... at Oxford he was studying is he was a Rhodes Scholar\nUm where did you go before the Georgetown I don't know where he wanted a ... an Ivy League anyway [noise] trust me\nBubble was smoking weed okay but you know he could he installed everybody's and tells you is because they said he never inhaled\nNow if he had admitted actually inhaling he knew the smart they knew\nAnd nobody in North America between Nineteen sixty five and ... and today as ever smoke marijuana without inhaling he wouldn't have been elected president if he had said oh yeah we used to smoke wait all the time and call you can say that now nobody cares I mean look at Brock Obama\nThere's pictures of him he looks like these boon Donald his mind and he had some name for the cruelty ran around with a they liked the smoke weed he was elected president twice\nAnd ah he wasn't you know I think he inhaled\nSo of course bill not being elected would've been a good thing but that's another issue now I bet a lot of money to bill and Hillary smoked a lot of we'd have you ever seen pictures as I said from the sixties uh I've ever seen pictures of Hillary\nAh come on and that was only twenty six or twenty seven years ago when bill was saying with a straight face but he never smoked weed because he knew he couldn't get elected president if he had told the truth\nAnd now a
