I and I'm not even sure how you pronounce this in proper Arabic I'd always thought it was ... but a lot of people are saying ... ...\nBut whichever way he's was chopped up into a lot of different pieces and his body apparently he was brought back to Saudi Arabia\nIs not a nice thing it's a terrible thing that had happened\nAnd if you listen to CNN\nWho's to blame love Trump of course why\nI'm Brian Steltzner was on with Fred Hyatt on CNN and this is what Brian Steltzner had to say to\nLower someone to a consulate to December the body and to take it back to the Saudi it it it is a crime of a different caliber I Wonder if you look at what's happened the last five days and you wonder if enemy of the people rhetoric\nNot just from President Trump but also then from other world leaders\nHas anything to do with anything at all okay what what uh\nThis Trump's rhetoric has to do with the actions of Saudi Arabia I yes we are aligned with Saudi Arabia and yes we need to be there's a powerful piece by Walter Russell Mead in the wall Street Journal today that make that case\nBut the attempt to blame the killing of this Muslim Brotherhood affiliated journalists\nTo attend to blame that killing on President Trump or on his rhetoric is is just absurd\nOf the people who listen to Trump's rhetoric and share it when he takes on fake news are not murderers and they are by and large not Saudi Arabian I mean while this was the response from Fred Hyatt on CNN too uh that charge\nIn a case like this with important through on the actual crime or to keep focus on the actual criminal and you know of the Washington Post were very focused thing we've got to get the facts\nAnd then there has to be accountability and there has to be consequences\nI think there is a larger picture which it's also fair to look at which is that a dictators around the world feel emboldened when you have fruit and reaching out to Britain to poison his enemies when you have China\nReaching out to Hong Kong elsewhere to kidnap people they perceived to be their enemies\nAnd went in each case the proposal enemies are peaceful ah you know for people who have done absolutely nothing wrong or you have to ask why is this happening and I do think it's happening\nIn part because the United states is retreating from its traditional role as a leader in the world standing up for democratic values and including freedom of expression\nOkay that's fair enough I mean the idea that there should be no us retreat and you need to establish norms and rules of law by the way of course they forgot about North Korea is North Korean our good buddy you may remember\nThat I'm Kim Jong London um it it also abroad had his half brother um murdered\nBecause he might be dissenting from the regime look this is one of those things that there is obvious concern about and this bipartisan and it should be a Lindsey Graham who's become one of the strongest supporters for the administration in the United States Senate\nHad a had this to say on Fox and friends about the ...\nI Know this nothing happens in Saudi Arabia without NBS knowing it who's MBAs the thirty three year old crown prince who jumped him over other people he's the son of the fifth in king\nAnd I think he's on a and a bad track I can never do business with Saudi Arabia again until we get this behind us for it and what does that mean that means I'm not going back to Saudi Arabia is longer this guy in charge so you're selling the crown prince has to leave this up to them but I'm not going to have in their biggest offender on the floor of the United States Senate\nThis guy is a wrecking ball\nHe had just gotten murdered in a conflict in Turkey and to expect made it ... I feel Houston abuse I was on the floor every time defending Saudi Arabia because there is a good ally there's a difference between the country and an individual the NBS figure\nThis to me toxic he can never be a world leader on the world and what does the president did thank us up to the ... but what I Would do I know what I'm gonna do want to sanction the hell out of Saudi Arabia [noise] you know\nWe deal with bad people all the time but this is in our face I feel personally offended they have nothing but contempt for us would you put a guy like me and the president in this Fox for after all the press and has done this guy's gotta go Saudi Arabia the lifting there are a lot of good people you can choose but NBS is tainted your country and painted himself like\nOkay this is probably not the right approach frankly because you have a situation in the country where the crown prince NBS Mohammed bin Salman\nOr is are in power because his father is old an ailing and uh I'm not sure that there is a power structure in place in Saudi Arabia that can simply replace him right now\nAnd there's a find peace in the wall Street Journal and I mentioned by Walter Russell Mead the headline is don't ditch Riyadh and a fit of righteousness\nAnd he makes the point that we have to deal with these people\nAnd I I don't think anybody would say that we shouldn't go forward with some kind of a deal with Kim Jong on which remains one of the most promising\nA diplomatic initiatives of the Trump Administration so far uh nor should we simply write offs Saudi Arabia or there is breaking news the Washington Post is reporting that um\nThat President Trump spoke directly to the crown prince to Mohammed bin Salman apparently he was ... together\nThe crown prince was meeting with secretary of state Mike Pompeo and he may have handed or the phone he was on the phone with President Trump to a mum had been Solomon and according to the president the crown prince totally denied any knowledge of what happened to counseling turkey\nAny promises answers shortly ... disappearance\nA secretary of state Pompeo press the Saudi leaders to move quickly with a transparent investigation of the disappearance of democracy Yogi and yes it sounds like a truly awful business see he comes into conflict\nBecause he wants to get papers he needs so that he can get married his fiance is waiting in the car outside no he never came out of that council it or at least he never came out in one piece\nThey brought in a an expert with the bone song they brought in an expert in autopsies they apparently packaged the various little pieces of his body and sent them back to Saudi Arabia this is a bad thing\nIs it's it's ... ... fans even the norms of state misbehavior but then again\nMohammed bin Salman has a I'm a real problem also with the with the policy that's going on in Yemen\nAnd the I guess the Saudis are basically looking out for the American for American interests and standing up against the Iranians who are the ones who would really stand to gain if there was some kind of big break between the United states and Saudi Arabia which I emphatically hope there won't be\nBut something has to be done or with a show of arresting people who were behind this killing and making it clear that is not approved of or authorized by the government one eight hundred nine five five Seventeen Seventy six you remember may remember that\nUm last year the Saudis kidnapped the or whether they arrested the Lebanese prime minister Saad Hariri\nThat was a disaster they all said this failed diplomatic\nConfrontation with cutter which was a disaster we need a stable productive and strong Saudi Arabia but we also need a stable productive and strong US government Alec Baldwin says we need to overthrow it how why we'll get to it coming up [noise]\nOK doesn't that sound a little bit like a conspiracy theory\nWell it is now there's a history on this dinner this was originally called the Jefferson Jackson day dinner\nAnd named after the two founders as it used to be told of the Democratic party Thomas Jefferson\nWho started the Democratic Republican Party and then Andrew Jackson who started the modern Democratic Party problem with those two guys are both slave owners [laughter] and bake time slave owners hundreds of slaves so they changed the last year\nThe name of the Jefferson Jackson day party to another illiterate of name it became the Kennedy Clinton day dinner okay that's a little bit of a problem and hash tag me to do you think that I Know Hillary says that\nPresident Clinton had no abuse of power he was urine does have driven snow but do you think that John Kennedy and Bill Clinton each have a a little bit of a problem and the view of feminist by the way feminist had a very very important anniversary they celebrated we will get to that um so what did they change it to\nI mean what democratic reach our Lyndon Johnson that Lyndon Johnson on tape using the N. word\nA bronco Obama is still a little bit too recent and especially if you call the bronco rama day and you don't have a bomb on their side letting that he didn't come see you know what they did it the Eleanor Roosevelt there\nI'm Eleanor Roosevelt never got elected anything she was very bright lady um she was a I can you imagine\nBecause he can't do Kennedy Clinton you can't do the Jefferson Jackson the Eleanor Roosevelt said dinner maybe maybe they could make it the um Pocahontas dinner in the future\nAlthough actually now the the entire nickname for Senator Elizabeth Warren\nOr who is up there in New England the entire nickname should go back to what it originally was I mean the the the nickname that she was given was ... ... that's ... phony as an essay you X\nAnd President Trump should apply that name\nTo her very directly this is one thing that she has accomplished something amazing here\nShe really has the United the country United the\nCountry in ... against her\nWhy is that well you just have to listen to some of the responses and why it is that President Trump should not must not pay her that million dollars which is the wall Street Journal strangely says he should pay will get to that and more with your calls coming up on the ...

wanted to fight for the Taliban she's that'd be fine with me no objection if fighting for the Taliban against your own country's committing treason and when I think is sickening is the way that the

everyone she's far far left\nTo I mean way out there to the left for instance listen to the way that she referred a to Arizona in some of her past comments and will in that montage ends with a comment

out of it what do you think about it so it\nDown south but one started this all this I thought all the like the early ... walk up about Rubio Romney all this a name Paul and I'm In ... all this stuff never existed Bob on though I might be wrong\nWhich were not administered by President Trump I don't even know what that means\nBut uh the DNA test that she underwent that showed that she may be\nOne out of one thousand and twenty\nFourth or as much as one out of sixty fourth\nA Native American\nNo really ... by the way let's take the best case analysis based upon the DNA tests and everyone should understand that that no one can accept these DNA tests because very often they've shown that different companies do different tests and they come out with wildly different results\nThat's even why Elizabeth Warren had several different tests taken here\nAnd all of them show like most Americans the overwhelming majority of the European Americans and by the way also the over ... well Ming majority of African Americans there is a little bit of Native American and most people whose families have lived here in the United states for many years and that is true for Elizabeth Warren's family\nBut the best case analysis for her the id\nAnd she has one sixty fourth Native American means that about a hundred and fifty years ago she had one of her sixty four great\nGreat great great grandparents who may have been Cherokee\nAs she says family lore suggested the entire thing ... was a ridiculous claim to begin with\nAnd wouldn't it be better for her if she just backed off of it no but she won't she basically insists that uh this is the way she's going to set up her presidential campaign my question to you\nWould be what does she thinking why is this a good idea\nIt makes her look ridiculous had made sure looked like a liberal racist why do I say that\nBecause for goodness sake if you grow up in a situation where you never affiliate with the tribe no one in your whole family within memory is ever affiliated with a tried you've never go on the Indian events you haven't raised with any Indian culture you know nothing about Indian history or background\nYou have no connection no affiliation no participation know communal involvement with the Native American\nCommunity and ah then when you get hired at Penn and Harvard you put down that your ethnicity as Native American because that qualifies you as a diversity hire\nI mean the whole thing is sad now is it\nThe end of the world no it's not the end of the world but she is making of the end of her campaign she is blowing herself up and she chose to do this that this would be a good idea or does she really saying she should get the million dollars that President Trump by the way did not promise here is what that\nIs based on where a that's number three they're under Warren audio Jeremy where where President Trump makes the original offered to senator walk and he's doing a\nRally in Montana or over the summer listen I won't\nFor your favorite charity\nIf you take the test of the shows your hair [laughter]\nOkay and it shows you are an Indian right but\nThe ... that whole idea shows urine Indian means that you would be accepted by some kind of try and there is no try them in the country the ... someone with one sixty fourth Indian blood as an Indian\nAnd they do require you to be an enrolled member of any tried to actually show that yes you have a personal history\nThat has involved you or someone in your family or someone in your background\nShe has none of that and so she can't\nCollect the million dollars in the wall Street Journal is wrong and that the um the wall Street Journal and he should tell you what their editorials said and why I think they are wrong and seriously wrong about this it's bad or they basically suggest that Trump would look good if he just paid or the money\nAnd I'm here here's what the what they say in a their editorial they say write the check Donald you'll look\nGracious and you'll have and using talking points photograph it will last the entire two thousand twenty campaign she says I'm miss Warren now says Mr Trump should make good on his both to write a million dollar check to charity and ms Warren proved she had Native American\nBlood he didn't say she had to prove she had Native American blood he said she had to show she was an Indian and venture and if he doesn't ... says he's ... what you call in and give her right or an Indian better I'm\nAs Lindsey Graham actually spoke on this he was willing to uh he's going forward with his own DNA test and he's going to out Native American Elizabeth Warren here's what Senator Graham and to say\nWas before and yes the NHL she could be anywhere from sixty fourth to one thousand Native American you have a challenge I'm going to take a DNA test all of you have I've been told him my grandmother was far Cherokee Indian it may all be just talk\nBut you got to find out in a couple of weeks have found them take this year we're going to take it I'm taking it and the result is going to be revealed here this is my ... this is why I wanted to say why don't you I just I'm dying to know [laughter] how did I you know I didn't really think much about it but she's less than one tenth of one percent\nI think I can Vader I think I can beat her right and if you do ... with us for a million dollars from the president to not want to casino enemy but\nOkay he wants a casino and a million bucks uh I I I've good luck with that Lindsey or by the way it can you imagine how of the headlines and some of the more left leaning papers was South Carolina senator says he wants to beat\nHis colleague from Massachusetts are abusing woman again really ... by the way it does\nIt have anything at all to do with feminism or hash tag me too if you think it does you can give us a call one eight hundred nine five five Seventeen Seventy six looks the one thing that a Senator Warren\nI think is ... is a a really bringing Americans together and a news busters put together a collage showing the way that major networks including some that are usually reliably liberal reacted to this Elizabeth Warren ploy\nThe Cherokee Nation criticized warns announcement saying that her you sort of being a test is inappropriate and quote undermining tribal interests with her continued claims of tribal heritage beyond I've had people questioning whether this revelation really they had ... any point\nFor ... this is the reason it controversial when she was at Harvard law school and when she was at the University of Pennsylvania ... represented herself as Native American she contributed to a Native American cookbook\nCalled powwow chow\nCherokee the Cherokee Nation called the president's attacks interested but it's also criticizing Warren thing she is undermining tribal interests with her continued claims of tribal heritage adding a DNA test is useless current DNA tests do not even distinguish whether a person to ancestors were indigenous to North or South America\nIn the video war and so she respects the difference between family history and tribal affiliation not enrolled in his prime only trying to determine tribal citizenship\nHuh [laughter] oh boy\nOh boy is right I mean really what was the lives of Martin thinking and what is her side of this\nIs there a sign of this not that I see a there was a um Cherokee Nation secretary of state and yes it is a separate nation officially a was on CNN with Jake Tapper and Chuck Hoskins junior had this to say\nThe problem with the DNA test is that it proves nothing of relevance to whether a person is a citizen of the Indian nation and member of an Indian nation\nDNA and best can give you some indicators of some markers that to indicate that you're\nRelated to somebody who live long ago that may have lived in North and South America and they have been a native peoples of those continents um it's irrelevant to what it means to be a Native American in this country that that's the base that's based on a legal definition certainly every tribe has that in common than we have some legal basis for citizenship that\nWe determine consistent with federal trainees just holy unhelpful or for any national later to a claim to be in a way to determine the artists tablets that their Native American in this country\nAnd by the way it doesn't really establish require DNA there's a very famous American and he's a featured character in my book the American miracle\nNamed Sam Houston and Sam Houston was an official member of the Cherokee tribe why not because he was born\nThat way but because he went and he lived with the Cherokees and he worked with them and he was adopted by a local chief and he learned the language

known for his specialty buy one get one free gold you might be a little dog\nUsually from Memphis [noise]\nI I Will say that President Trump has tolls outright lies things that he knows not to be true

million dollar ... I Am wanted let me let\nMe play it for you okay I just want to be fair here\nListen to what President Trump said here's President Trump's original offered to Elizabeth Warren I won't\nIf you take the test of the shows you're there you know [noise]\nOkay is it shows you're an Indian and my point here was that there is no Indian tribe in the world in the country the would accept her as an Indian based upon this CNA test that shows that she may have had one great great great great grandfather who\nWas an Indian that's my only point\nJust want to say that I'm from ... in your color and uh and the previous hour said Trump that brought us down to the gutter he really had and I mean you guys I I'm I'm just so\nI said let me let me let you let me ask you this okay\nDo you think that it is honorable or for Elizabeth Warren to have a promoted herself as a diversity hire to have contributed to an Indian cookbook to have gone through this masquerade for all this time\n[noise] no I don't think she should have done that I ... it was trivial and he shouldn't have done it but I'll tell you what prompted calls out when he called he'd said Dr for it doesn't matter and she was lying or not we want and what do you want it that's all he cares about winning and he doesn't care who he dumped on\nOkay look I I Believe that President Trump does sometimes go way over the line I think it's unfortunate and I said it already on the show\nI think it was a big mistake on his part and it was inappropriate for him to attack Stormy Daniels who was made accusations of intimate kind against him\nTo attack her as horse face ... who put that in a tweet today\nUm it's probably we probably reached a point in our world where if you're going to be attacking a female and you can attack or the way President Trump is attacking was with warm but don't attack or looks I think we can agree on that and Pam I appreciate your calling\nMe and caring enough about the show\nTo actually call even with a complaint [noise] the point is that the fact that a Trump or a can a occasionally makes mistakes I Would never say he can do the wrong\nBut it's wrong to say he can do no rights we will be right

called culture the forty fifth president President Trump deserves applause and support and banking when he leads American the right direction\nAnd I think much of the time he does but\nThe idea that his personality should be the big issue that determines how we respond on this direction I'll tell you a way that I think Democrats are going to mess themselves over by trying to do that the American people don't want an impeachment\nCrisis\nAnd and you have Democrats now who have promised that if they take the house they're going to try to impeach President Trump's are going to trial and preach justice Kavanaugh really\nThat helps the country how it doesn't at all and it's absurd\nLet's go to Doug in Houston Doug Iran that Michael met that show\nAnd Michael for taking my call you bet [laughter] yeah well I think that should take the money um he made it\nMade a statement in a statement said he'd been in dollars it proved that she was an Indian\nHe was one one thousand twenty four the Indians there should be about nine dollars and thirty eight that\nI'm sure you've done the math that the problem is he he basically said she needs to show she's an Indian and what that means is how do you define who is an Indian now\nIn the URL Nuremberg Laws and Nazi Germany this is something you'll find out about the ... movie\nOr they used to ... someone who is Jewish who was eligible for execution and liquidation if you had won sixteen\nA Jewish background\nNow she doesn't close to that one sixteenth Jewish background means what is it it means a\nGreat great grandparents she has to go back to great great great great that's for great great grandparents a hundred and fifty years and it's absurd she cannot prove that she's in Indian she cannot show that she's in India and therefore\nI think it would be wrong for President Trump to even pay the one thousands one one thousand and twenty fourth of it appreciate your calling and your sentiments Sean San Diego you're on the Michael ... show\nYeah you made um you've had a comment earlier and questioned whether it was racist or not or their racism involved is calling her Pocahontas\nWhen and I I think it is racially insensitive up a very nice and one of her percentage or the fame to show for African American would it be okay for the president to call her ... or some other African American or I'm not entirely\nNo but if if he were calling if he were calling somebody who was falsely claimed let for Rachel\nDollars on you remember Rachel dollars on who pretended to be back black yeah\nOK it would probably not be received well in the Pocahontas thing hasn't been received well but if the cold or a ... Rachel dollars all Harriet Tubman or if he called or by the name of some black hero 'cause\nPocahontas was not a bad person she was a good person she somebody who's remembered fondly in American history for goodness sake if you look at that Disney movie uh she paints with all the colors and the when I I I Do not understand why when President Trump's whole point about Elizabeth Warren\nIs that she's a phony\nThat it's insulting for him to use the name of a one of the most famous Native Americans in our history\nOr to make fun of her now do I think he should save he's going to say it at all I should say folk ... which is how the thing yeah yeah I think that would probably be better at here's a way to President Trump responded\nYesterday to the ...

is obviously doing a pretty confident these days the dollars up above four hundred the last I heard that should make them feel even better a lovely stole mentioned um ah yesterday the day before\nThat uh she noticed a big difference in him\nUm saw an interview you did with him for sixty minutes compared to talking to them or right after he was elected so much more confident and he seems much more like a president and as I said here yesterday I think he gets it ah he's been he's a pretty smart guy he's not um he's he's well aware of\nA how to run\nAn enterprise which is all the uh which is what the way he's running the country right now so it's not a big deal to him to be in charge of lots of things and lots of people and they now I think he's settled in so uh you know that's what people are going up to deal with these field feeling pretty confident\nUm he he's much more confident actually who would everybody needs except that uh you know\nDonald Trump knows exactly what he's doing calling a woman horse race for public consumption that's about as on politician as it gets remember he's on a politician and this is also the guy who called the um the evil dictator of North Carolina or North Korea rocket man\nThe people who hated we're going to continue to hate him and the people who love them a love what he's done they don't care including a maybe a specially preventing the missus from becoming president that's what they love the most for the that's what so they're they're not getting nothing he tweets is really gonna\nIs really going to bother them and he figured out

it or whatever no seven o'clock eight o'clock and that's what they'll be talking about force base and he knows it there'll be preaching to the choir because nobody who's planning to vote for Republican on November sick\nOr vote for him a and are not vote for him and twenty twenty and that will actually nobody who is going to vote for Trump to Tony Tony ... is watching any of those
