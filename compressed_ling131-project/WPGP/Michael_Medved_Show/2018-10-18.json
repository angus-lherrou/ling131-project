mean wrong but it's it just takes time for the program I I Would like you to read these were going to put these columns up from the Washington Post I don't miss all three hours I have received from these columns\nIs the junior senator from Nebraska who I think has become by a large margin of advantage\nI'm One of the most indispensable voices in the United States Senate his name is Ben Sasse a senator Sasse it's great to speak to you\nMichael but for the ... and you're right about those words if I said anything like that a my BS meter would go off I wouldn't be able to protect you can save the world by politics but my wife would just whack me upside the head\nOkay and this is not to say that politics is unimportant in your new book which is hosted up at our website the book is called them\nWhy we hate each other and how to heal and it's already a best seller and it should be because it's a very important book but one of the points that you make again and again and again is politics you didn't get us into this mess and politics isn't going to get us out what do you mean by that\n[noise] yeah so I'm sure we're gonna talk something today about politics and why does matter so I don't want him to sleep and have your audience and saying that it doesn't it truly does\nBut what we're going through right now ... even in the chaos in our politics really didn't originate in our politics I think we need to know kind of where we are an economic and cultural history and we're going through a digital revolution which is awesome and lots of ways we're going to\nProduce more total goods and services than the world has ever known and all of human history a partly because of the digital revolution but one of the things that it does\nIs it enables humans to think that we can be ruthless at exactly the same time that we have lots of social science literature now confirming what people have known for millennia a through philosophy of the allergy which has been rooted makes you happy do you have a family or do you have a few deep friendships do you have meaningful work\nDo you have shared vocation you have some projects with co workers in your community the whole locavore spin community\nIf you have those things you tend to be happy that's about ... and yet our technology of letting us be ruthless and we haven't figured out the habits for this digital age this this rootless age and so\nTraditional tribes good tribes family friends workplace at cetera there and collapse and so we're trying to find meaning grand good and evil meaning of politics and it's not going to work\nAnd and this is I think an important point that I I can of emphatically agree with is that part of what has happened here with a Americans believing venture either on our side or you're on the other side and the other side is pure evil and our site is pure good\nThat kind of political talked flows from the fact that people don't have more what used to be called normal uh relationships in support systems and so they look to politics I was thinking\nI did you follow the story senator I'm sure you did a of New York in Portland, Oregon there were fights in the streets between Proud Boys and anti thought\nAnd and the two groups of of Todd's who seem to get great pleasure about actually being violent with one another and you follow that story\nI heard little bits and pieces of it but it's just so weird [noise]\nWell it it seems weird because again the question is what are you going to accomplish how does it make life better if you beat up some uh if you're from antifa new beat up somebody from Proud Boys or if you're from ... new beat up somebody from antifa\nHow does how does that help anybody it's kind of like the jets and the sharks except those gangs were kind of lovable\nRight exactly and it could sing uh it it turns out that you know if\nYou if you beat down people who disagree with you about politics you don't necessarily accomplish anything that's lasting by doing that but the great quick hit a takedown is good to just sort of\nA pontificate in front of an audience of people who already agree with you but you don't persuade anybody that way and so when people use all these war metaphors for politics I think it's sort of miss understands what we think of the American tradition politics are supposed to do\nPolitics maintain a framework for ordered liberty so that the really interesting communities can thrive and flourish the things that matter are the communities of love and your neighborhood where you persuade people to join with you in a project and there's a lot broken in our politics politics isn't serving those local community as well\nBut a lot of the political chaos and discord we face really is downstream I think from the collapse of these more natural or tribes of affection and community and you know your your point about\nUm the loneliness align your used there are half as many friends in America are in the last twenty seven years what does that mean\nSocial science data showed that in Nineteen Ninety the average American had about three point\nTwo friends the average American today has about one point eight friends half as many forty percent of Americans have either zero or only one Koch to not into all there is a loneliness like out there and a whole bunch of people go to politics say at least I can figure out how to have a\nUm an enemy with somebody else and that will make me feel like I'm On a team but it doesn't really work\nWe're speaking with Senator Ben Sasse a senator a Republican conservative Republican from Nebraska his book a new book is called them why we hate each other and how to heal\nUm let me try to make a case and you can ... down if you choose a that that part of the healing process has to be making sure Republicans when the house of representatives this time I think we're going to hold the Senate\nOr where you work but we need to hold the house of representatives and the reason that I Would put that in terms of healing is the Democrats have already announced that if they take over the house they're going to be pushing the impeachment of justice Kavanaugh they're going to be pushing the impeachment of President Trump\nThat we're going to have investigations and politics of destruction and this incredible hateful bitterness that we all saw during the Kavanaugh hearings\nThat's going to go on and on and on so the only way to prevent that is to make sure that you don't hand over the house of representatives to these ... mean spirited hostile and very destructive folks\n[noise] yes so let me uh overwhelmingly agree and then also offer one tweak so the or the overwhelming agreement is I'm I'm Out there raising money for Republican candidates I'm I'm writing checks I'm campaign and what people are so I absolutely want the Republican I Want us to not just\nA expend extend our majority and the fact that I Want the Republicans start to win in the house um\nBut at the ... that I should also say I'm the second or third most conservative voter out of a hundred in the U.S so that so if you look at anybody score card on on who the most conservative senator I'm always on the top half dozen of everybody's scorecard\nSo I'm not in different uh on political matters and this is not an argument hey let's just offering to buy off and have a much metal there's really nobody more conservative than I Am\nBut I think we need to recognize that because the Democrats in the house might do something incredibly stupid and tried to impeach everybody under the sun or if that we take the house\nStopping that from happening is not actually the same thing as healing it's just stopping a further slide into this political tribalism I think that the ceiling that's gonna satisfy people is\nIn a world where our job to ration is getting shorter and shorter and by the way economically that's pretty great we're producing more and more a smart humans with brains are figuring out ways to produce more goods and services are more cost effective way that anybody has in the past that's great but it means average duration that uh from I was born in Nineteen Seventy two\nAverage tuition at a farm in the seventies was about two and a half decades for a primary breadwinner today it's four point two years and getting shorter\nOne of the things that means is you don't have relationships with your coworkers that last over the course of a lifetime and nails in particular aren't actually good at forming new relationships after about twenty five to Thirty years old and so we've got a lot more loneliness and their country\nPolitics can fix that problem rebuilding their neighborhood is what we have to do to fix that problem and this book is about fifty percent constructive about what do I do to rebuild in my neighborhood I Do I I Do I joined with\nA local civic organizations that me and I'm more likely to know the person who live two doors away from me because that's actually highly correlated with being happy\nAnd uh that's one of the big focuses in them or the new book by Senator Ben Sasse it's post on our website at Michael midday dot com\nOr a senator you you're also a very outspoken very deeply committed Christian man of faith\nAnd you do talk about uh the the need really for people to go to the center of communal affiliation which traditionally has been congregations here in this country\nWhat's gone wrong with the church do you think and with with synagogues or have that that has caused this sort of this affiliation particularly among young people\nYeah ... well fed so I think there are two or three different things happening at the same time I'm In the same way that deep friendship and stick\nA nuclear families and shared work are heavily connected to place worshipping communities are as well that we we know in the literature now what makes people happy do you have a family do you have a few friends do you think your work is meaningful and do you have a philosophical theological framework to make sense of that they're suffering that\nDrives happy that but one of the other things that happens in your local worshipping community is you're with people at an intergenerational context overtime and it turns out that I've got two teenage daughters and then the younger son as well but teenagers live the most generationally segregated lives that anybody has ever lived in human history\nThey really think the accident of birth year defines almost all the people they should associate with\nOkay so how do how do we fix it I Want to get to that with Senator Ben Sasse his new book is damn\nWhy we hate each other and how they feel there's so much in this book about where we can go not just in politics of course but in our personal and economic lives will be right back when Senator Ben Sasse [noise] [noise]\nFor some of our political addicts and Washington to try to act like blood sport politics or forever more\nIs what they want what they don't really love their neighbor they don't really care about your listeners kids and grandkids because they're not trying to solve long term problems they're trying to make politics the center of the gladiatorial fight and that's not going to work in a republic\nYeah I mean somehow World Wrestling entertainment is not what you want for uplift of of your kids or for the American future a speaking speaking of which one of the things that last night I I I gave a talk or to a neighborhood group bleeding couple of hundred people there it was great\nBut there's this general sense that our politics is broken and I found myself ... when it's being to you today\nTalking a little bit of a would I be wrong to say that the Nebraska Legislature which is nonpartisan and you and a camera on there's only one house and the legislature\nThat things work a little bit better in your state than they do and many others\nThey do a ... there's less sense of preening constantly for the cameras and even though my state of you know one of the four or five most conservative states in the union and that's one of the reasons why I was one of the most\nConservative us rather than the United states molecular from here\nEven though we're a very conservative ... probably two to one Republican and the legislature people do not officially ... really parties in our unit camera all our one one house a state budget by ... and so\nWhat people are mostly doing is wrestling with ...\nGr term pragmatic question how do you get a good infrastructure and highway and bridges bill that's cost effective uh there's less certainty that you're going to find the line between good and evil of for people who might have slightly different priorities of which religion which highway to find it's a much healthier thing to do bridges and roads by politics\nInstead of trying to do a good and evil heaven and hell by politics if the federal politics do what they should in America unconstitutional system which is maintained a framework for ordered liberty\nUp broken the idea that people are created with dignity the image of God and they have rights by nature and government is our shirt project to secure those rights government is the author stores are right then government give you a small number of big things or we need to build the fiber of strategy for the digital age et cetera\nBut then most of what's meaningful can happen back in communities where people actually live next door to their neighbors\nWhat ... what a concept change from the bottom up not the top down that's part of the theme of them why we hate each other and how to heal is the new bestseller by Senator Ben Sasse of Nebraska\nAll I can say is keep it up

now Donald Trump has another another non today and so it's kind of a going to somebody who is you know kind of strong uh from the conservative side if he if he nominated Bill Clinton\n[laughter]\nI I think that a Bill Bill Clinton having lost his law license um I think he's ... he's gotten his law license back um I think that would make\nIt ever go away\nAnd we ate did he he lost his law license he was disbarred um after the after he left the presidency\nI'm I Am of course Bill Clinton would love to be a a justice of the Supreme Court up up I don't think that would be a a plausible new for one thing a Bill Clinton is is also getting up there he's had some health issues\nOne of the things that I think that either a I'm a Democratic president if there is one ever again\nAnd or President Trump or any other Republican president any president is going to be cared caring about is appointing a justice\nWho is in very good health and is that a young age\nAnd I think that alone aside from all of the scandals in controversies yeah I mean can you imagine there'll be other accusers who come out of the woodwork if Bill Clinton were nominated and I don't think Mr Trump wants that um

Bloomberg an increasing number of Bruce happen outside of marriage signaling cultural signaling cultural and economic shift\nThat are here to stay according to a major new report from the United nations forty percent of all births in the U.S now with her outside of wedlock\nThat is up from ten percent in Nineteen Seventy was that means to put it in context is that in in less than fifty years the rate of out of wedlock birth has gone up for a hundred percent\nWhy would that be\nThis a report was issued by un FDA that as the United nations population fund\nIt's the largest international provider of sexual in reproductive health services says the number is even higher in the European Union and the European Union already sixty percent of birds occur outside of marriage\nThe eight eight you report says likely sees more births out of wedlock because many member countries have welfare systems that support gender balanced childcare\nSo said these senior advisor in economics for the un FBI his name is Michael heroin and in an interview\nHe said a public health care systems paid paternal leave early education programs in tax incentives\nGiven where parents support beyond what a partner can provide\nAnd is he saying from the un this is a good thing in Europe that you have sixty percent of kids born out of wedlock that a good thing using developmentally the government can do a better job than parents\nOr even the government can do a better job than some parents by providing these services one eight hundred nine five five Seventeen Seventy six\nLook the problems with a single parent families are fairly obvious\nBut one of the things worth noting here with these numbers the reason that I'm indicating to you that that forty percent number born out of wedlock\nMaybe a bit overstated at least in terms of meaningful consequences is because that includes couples who are actually living together but decided for whatever reason not to get married\nAnd it\nIs unclear what percentage of people who have a baby outside of marriage then follow that up by getting married\nIt's not a small numbers at least twenty five percent\nAt least one out of four people were a baby is born to a couple of outside of marriage ended up getting married and particularly if they do that while the child is very young and has no recollection of and it it can provide some of the same benefits of marriage I only what are the benefits of marriage\nWas one of those things if you spent any time at all in your life around the baby you understand immediately it's an extra pair of\nHands it's an extra pair of eyes it's a extra love that can be provided to the child\nAnd if you have one person who is also going to be responsible for trying to provide an income well what happens to the child or two children and this is not to blame\nSingle mothers it's not to say that single mothers are terrible people or that because obviously there are wonderful wonderful results that do occur sometimes with single mothers but it's very very difficult\nAnd single fathers\nSame thing it can happen that that things will work out beautifully but the idea that there should be putting up as an ideal or isn't acceptable ideal I think it's very destructive and if you take a look at the vastly greater likelihood\nOf being involved in poverty criminality self destructive activities\nLike opioid abuse every risk for bad outcomes with the child is increased by a child who was raised in a single parent household\n\nOne eight hundred nine five five Seventeen Seventy six and somebody could say well what about gay marriage why uh what's what's been the impact there the fact is that gay marriage his remains so rare in the United states such a small percentage of the population one of the studying things in this from the Census Bureau\nOf the marriages that have taken place in this country since ... since the decision that basically authorize gay marriage for every state in the union\nLess than one percent have been same sex couples yeah it's a shockingly low number\nAnd that's shockingly low because a lot of people it assumed though there will be pent up demand there will be all these couples that have been waiting to get married still less than one percent the the highest rate for gay marriage in the country was it will be shot San Francisco Seattle a second\nBut even in San Francisco their dream at one point for nine percent of all the marriages actually were marriages between a same sex couple\nThe data shows such births in the U.S and in the ... predominantly to unmarried couples who are living together rather than to single mothers the report says\nThe data suggests that societal and religious norms about marriage childbearing and women in the workforce has changed said Kelly Jones the director for the center on the economics of reproductive health at the Institute for women's policy research is it a good thing is they've changed\n\nI I I don't believe that it is in other words it was it fairly common in American Life to have what we are cold shutdown weddings\nWhere a couple actually\nConcedes the baby before they're married not recommended but they do but then there's social pressure for them to get married so the baby has welcomed into a married home\nOf course that's more desirable and and by getting married you were making a commitment to that child into each other\nJust someone down the idea that in most cases then of course I understand there are exceptions there are some times spouses who are abusive and self destructive and terrible and that can be a terrible situation for a child but in most cases\nIt's better for a child to deal with both a loving mother and a loving father let's go to your calls to Andrea in Columbus ohio and ray you're on the show\nThanks for taking my call you about um so um for me um I have a wonderful thing and um I I think that parents have to be mentally president we have to be physically present\nThey have to be mentally president and whether you're a single parent or whether you're fortunate enough to have a spouse\nUm you have to be there for them and and unfortunately when it's just one person that half he'll carry the burden of thing they're physically and emotionally and spiritually um you can't do it all\nI guess especially if you're earning a living and allegedly and look at its it's very difficult and this is not to say the preschool is an important then doesn't represent an important alternative\nIt's just that you see if we have in this country such a a an inclination to not make value judgments is that leads us to be\nBlind to the fact that it is more desirable for each child to come into the world in a married household if we can establish\nThat and agree on that\nThen we have lost the whole idea of constructive social norms one of the constructive social norms that is\nWorth maintaining it seems to me is not applauding open racism or open anti Semitism or open racial or religious hatred of any kind\nSo why are Democrats still applauding an open hater we will get to that question to coming up on them and that show [noise]\n\nMaybe you have to live with their grandma parents or relatives or other relatives show I think this can be done successfully as long as we are open minded in in the day after these tranche\nBut what does that mean I Know it sounds good and adapting to trends that sounds very open minded and terrific but what does it mean\nI Would say that we need government programs horse that would help\nThat would a specific group the terror alert to kids living in a single parent situation\nAt one time programs are you thinking of you want the government to send babysitters the ... government daycare centers\nI think over ... ... would be one way I think manners where are you if you pay people who are professionals to go in and spend time with these ... these children and help them out\nOkay let me just mention something to you Bob I I understand that sounds very generous and very nice\nBut you know what there are some times families who are married to each other who are raising children sometimes multiple children and their financially press is it fair that people like that who are having a tough time financially with their own kids at home should have a bigger chunk taken out of their income\nTo provide for other people who may be struggling with only one parent\nOr you know you're going to hate the fish but ah I I I'm going to ... we should cut their parents parenting because it's just\nIt's just not necessary and we should also raised taxes on the rich\nOK well of course when you say I'm going to hate this on my shelves you down but the idea that cutting defense spending is going to be an answer right now we are spending more on the interest on the national debt\nThan we are on defense and in my opinion I think the and opinion most Americans the defense spending that we spend is the best investment we could possibly make\nAnd some of the very ambitious social programs are the worst one of the things that has happened in this country and has been shown by a wealth of books and information\nA there is uh Charles Murray wrote the first book that that blew the lid off the welfare system and the way the welfare system has been designed particularly by Lyndon Johnson the great society actually encouraged out of\nWedlock birth and they're Democrats who have written about that Daniel Patrick Moynihan\nWho was a moderate Democrats [noise] road about the problems with family structure in the United states and he predicted exactly where we are\nThe government's role wars out of wedlock birth of course they're going to get more of that we'll be right back uh with when does

don't like me\nIs a very real problem and this brings us to Farrakhan\nBecause if you look at Farrakhan history of just a cop Khamenei anti American hatred of his own country the idea that he should be on stage as he was that Aretha Franklin's funeral he was just a few seats away from a former president the United states Bill Clinton\nAnd uh I Do not believe that Bill Clinton is anti Semitic in any way I don't believe he is a racist\nBut you you simply can't all of a sudden jail because Louis Farrakhan his old at this point and because he associates himself\nWith um with with black people in as a representative black people that anything that he says that is filled with racial hatred and its racial hatred by way against white people in general and it's still toxic instill that deserves some kind of sanction go ahead last year\nBy by understand that Michael connected one more point go\nOkay so my point is that where this is coming from where they misled or in my opinion a a black people who are very hatred of ... there have full of of whites where it's coming from ... in a kind of a revolution are fighting back\nAbout what happened to them at the people over time whereas the other direction when it would have been not for you or whomever it would attacking people not because they did anything to them they made up conspiracy theory and made up that these people were doing stuff again that what it really\nOkay I look I I understand but if you're talking about this goes into the for instance hatred of\nTurks against Armenians and the Turkish genocide against Armenians one of the justifications for that genocide which was real and it happened and it ought to be acknowledged there'll be record so the Armenian people were cruel to the Turks and they were undermining it doesn't matter\nIf you were going to express irresponsible hatred toward any group based upon ethnicity or religious faith and there ought to be sanctioned and that doesn't mean that you ought to

let me let me know Calvin I\nCan't let you finish one what you just said is nonsense when you say runs a hundred percent of the media I mean it's it's complete garbage\nOkay so so that I take Fox News

who owns Fox News tell me I got I or you have you ever heard of Rupert Murdoch or them okay have you ever heard News Corporation or no I haven't News Corp\nIs Rupert Murdoch's company does Fox News

capitalist country ruled by a bunch of old white men who systematically oppressed people of color it doesn't make any sense\nNow we're told all the time that there are too many white men in government
