Arabia because he ran is a far greater danger\nTo the west and to Israel and Saudi Arabia is which is a danger more to itself although I fully acknowledged the Saudi contribution to a fundamental was awful madrassas around the world so on what grounds that you think otherwise\nThe group at nine eleven was from Saudi Arabia the um the money they want to I\nWill never to come from Saudi Arabia to\nYeah okay I don't know I don't know what rumors of ... that would have been Saudi Arabia was not prices\nAre now there were not what they were going against Iran Syria\nYeah on you or not or that comes from our you know that the amount of weapons that were given a job and they get right to it that way or that that's\nAs being heavily covered on CNN and everywhere and mainstream media President Trump's approval rating is the highest it's ever been\nOkay don't get too excited if forty seven percent\nBut forty seven percent to forty nine percent disapproval it means that President Trump has actually closed the gap between disapproval and approval is now basically tied the Americans or even evenly split\nAnd one of the things that I found stunning I Am by the way in the midst of a battleground talkers tour I'm tonight in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania [noise]\nUh and uh then on Thursday I'll be home God willing in between and on Thursday I'm going to be in Minneapolis where there are also some very hot congressional races and the governor's races and Senate races and more\nBut right now it's all so tight your vote really really\nMatters one of the things that I've found stunning is that um I was watching CNN in the airport when I had I had to change planes about six this morning in Washington DC I flew from Seattle, Washington DC and from there to Pittsburgh and I'm\nIn the airport that Tom Perez on who is the Democratic national chair\nAnd uh they showed in the new numbers about Trump soaring approval rating\nAnd I've asked them why and he had no idea he couldn't answer it\nAnd the answer is very obvious is that Americans have gotten used to Trump\nThey um and most Americans like the economic situation we're in President Trump gets very very good marks on the economy and for most people the economy is the most important part of the job\nUm meanwhile with an election this close vote fraud is a huge problem we will be talking about that later in the show there's a new book that suggested it is far more common than people on the left ever wants to lead on and far more threatening\nAnd uh there is also a um an issue lurking in the deep background which is the issue of marijuana\nWe did um [noise] a segment on the show\nA couple of weeks ago about a um a guy who said look I'm just a normal I'm middle aged a stay at home dad\nWho almost ruined his life through marijuana addiction and this individual by the way is for legalize marijuana\nIs going to be joining us on the show to tell his story and to answer your questions and to take your comments that all coming up on the Michael mad vigil one eight hundred nine five five Seventeen Seventy six [noise]\nIf you can answer the question that a Tom Perez could not answer why President Trump's approval rating would be going up so dramatically the last couple of weeks [noise]\nHonestly part of it as the Kavanaugh situation part of it is the caravan situation anybody here who thinks that we should have simply opened the gates\nAnd and lead in all the people from the caravan\nHe even those of us who support him immigrants and immigration reform and I support immigrants and I support immigration reform\nThe idea of simply saying that uh you get seven thousand people together and they're marching to the United states and they're all waving Honduran flags well of course you let them in because they're having a tough time in Honduras or there are a lot of suffering people right\nBut the notion that that uh\nUh that just somehow one of the Democrats said about this what is the right thing to do\nI think the right thing to do is to make it clear that before they walk the other two thousand miles they have left to walk before they get to the United states border they get a very very clear idea that President Trump and most other Americans who actually can think about this with anything like an open mind\nAre going to say no this is not a good idea you don't simply a let people into the United states without authorization without security clearances or then have them flood the system for processing asylum applications one eight hundred nine five five Seventeen Seventy six\nMeanwhile somebody who seems to have a position on everything\nBut I don't really think he has a position on the caravan because how could he he is a battle or work\nAnd one of the questions I Would ask here\nIs what is so great about Beto he is he is now inspired people\nThis the Democratic nominee for US Senate against Ted Cruz President Trump is going down to campaign for the guy who once called lie in bed and people say oh to Trump such a hypocrite this happens in politics all the time\nPeople who were opponents to run against each other then come together and work together it happens all the time of Ronald Reagan and George ... a age W. Bush George W. Bush running in the primary against Ronald Reagan in Nineteen eighty\nAttacked him pretty harshly he said the Reagan was practicing ... economics and then later he embraced Abu to economics a Reagan chosen to be as vice president and uh they honored and came to like each other or this is\nAll remarkable what is going on\nThe election is so close but that hasn't stopped people from breaking into song over\nThe great Robert O'Rourke that's his real name known as ... the Democratic wonder boy of this election cycle who was inspired melodies\nLike this\nI pass them God\nGuy is totally [noise]\nMovie memento\nOn may do burn by turning this may\nBe able to\nRun again now and down the road [noise]\n[noise] [noise] ...\nMen no you don't do that through a little bit [noise]\nOkay the last time I think that anyone sort of inspired this many songs are in a campaign was President Trump\nYou remember we spent several days playing the various Trump songs I like the one get on the Trump train 'em in any event the better our work and the the ex to see about that token someone explained to me\nWhat it is exactly that is so inspiring to people about Beto O'Rourke\n... what it is that the ... the soul and it makes people so excited that even though he is almost certainly going to lose his challenge to Ted Cruz who's been a decent hardworking senator and he's a conscientious and substantive conservative\nAnd by the way he knows so much more about the issues than ... ... what is it the better our work is going to do for the country\nThat inspires reactions like this and and basically with ABC News telling him he's not just a candidate he's a rock star listen I'm\nObvious strategies that are more than a in a modern Ken very literate show off everywhere all the time for everyone you can be without an interruption in from the federal background which I Love your thinking well you know there's so many\nOkay I'm or they're going to be a lot of disappointed folks in Texas are coming up on election day Fifteen days from now one eight hundred nine five five Seventeen Seventy six our phone number of President Trump\nHas his own response see as a new video out about uh the Democrats offering mobs not jobs or we will get to that and uh we will get to\nWhat the election comes down to there is also a a ... a very alarming piece of New York times at least has meant to be alarming I didn't think advantage so bad\nIt's by David Leonhardt and it's what if the Republicans when everything the fact that\nThe New York times even thinking about that\nThat shows you which side has momentum at the moment we will be right back on the Michael med show with your calls [noise]\nMichael you rock Michael [noise]\nOne age was written by five shoving dreams of music Michael [noise]\n\nTo the country the early primaries\nOkay there are two reasons I think you might be wrong I I watched a bay toe performing and is a performance is sort of a performance art as they say when he was doing a town\nHall in or\nNear El Paso which is where he's from and you know very friendly crowd and very friendly moderator Dana Bash from CNN\n[noise] and uh she she\nAsked him very directly about running for president and he said no if he gets elected senator he'll serve all six years of senator now of course he can throw that away but he said it's so definitively that it leads me to believe that you\nKnow he he didn't rule out running ever but he I think he rules out\nPretty well running in two thousand and twenty said that if he loses the race is going to want to spend some more time with his family of course they all say that um [noise] and some of that it might even be true okay the the other reason that I think he wouldn't be so solid for the race\nWas he was pushed and pushed\nOn the fact that he has said before the race even began\nThat as a member of the house of representatives he thought there was enough evidence of obstruction of justice inclusion that he could vote to impeach Trump now and he was asked about that as a U.S senator and he didn't back away from it\nHe is for impeachment he he believes even before the smaller investigation is wrapped up even before it's reported anything\nIn the essay indicted some people and they've uncovered some stuff and I I I think the Mueller investigation needs to finish and maybe it'll take some time to finish but needs to fish but better or doesn't think so\nHe agrees with a lot of people on the far right the ... just forget about the investigation let's impeach him anyway and I don't think that's a popular position and I don't think it sets them up well for a future presidential run or anything of the time hey I appreciate your call\nUm [noise] I I'm a I Will get back\nTo this and to David Leonhardt piece what if the Republicans when everything will we now know President Trump has made a couple of statements and I think one of the middle east to sort of flummoxed some of his age uh there's\nTalk about another tax cut that may be announced before November first that soon and very soon\nA and he says it's people are going to love it it's going to be a big middle packs a\nFlat

where he uh there's more to that and we really it's a about our country or or or battle anywhere I called to talk about the uh the planned invasion\nYou are you calling the caravan of planned invasion\nYes sir\nWell eight Ito given the fact that we've had so far this year I think we've had about twenty\nTimes the number of illegal entries into the country this year the illegal entries are way up because the economy is very hot right now people are getting across\nAnd ah this I'd only constitutes an invasion I think it is a challenge to our whole immigration system\nIs basically an attempt to raise the border and say that uh we have to let anyone who wants to come in and most Americans don't believe that a lot of them say that so [noise] but when you say\n... and a planned invasion what do you have in mind\nUh I think it's just a part of the the war or the battle between conservatives and left us that are trying to take down America and this is the latest strategy\nExcept if you look at those people and I've seen ... and of\nCourse they play a lot of very quote compassionate a video showing some of these poor people who I think are hungry\nOr scared I'm hopeful ah\nThey they do not appear to be actors or manipulated their just desperate people from\nPlaces in the world that are deeply deeply dysfunctional look I I think that President Trump is doing the right thing to basically make a stand and say no we simply cannot just open the doors to anyone in this country that's not going to be our immigration policy\nBut I think he makes a very big mistake when he threatened to cut off foreign aid and I'll tell you why\nThe best way to prevent other incidents like this and so this doesn't happen every week or every month\nIs not to cut off foreign aid to Honduras it's to coordinate more foreign aid to Honduras to take these people these seven thousand people I think that's how many they think there are right now\nAnd to bring them back home where you can work with them to try to make Honduras a more livable place because that's really going to be the only kind of answer that has a long term impact on let's go to Marco in Los Angeles Marco you're on the ... that show\nI might go a great job either way hey three things I was calling regarding that that the um the reporter that got killed I I feel that that really not our crime it locked the guys get killed all over the place we're not we're not up in arms about it\nFor sure it's a bad situation that happened but why are we getting involved country insoluble\nBecause we are and we are involved with the country I mean the the argument is we ah we have a lot of financial dealings with Saudi Arabia\nNow of Saudi Arabia is not a country we give foreign aid to their one of the richest countries in the world but it's a country that we saw a lot of arms to him as President Trump says we have a pending one hundred and ten billion dollar arms deal and if it doesn't go through with us if we cancel it for some reason they'll turn around and by the arms from\nA China or Russia and like\nWhy does that have to do what is that the deal with this guy can kill\nWell ... what's left is trying to do and I think it's despicable frankly is to suggest that somehow um Mohammed bin Solomon the prince crown prince and Saudi Arabia got the idea that it was okay to kill reporters because President Trump is always so critical of the press\nAnd I think he he obviously President Trump has never called on anyone to kill reporters\nAre and ... do I think it's unfortunate that President Trump made some reference and it was a joking reference to Greg Gianforte in one of the worst moments of his life losing his temper and slam slamming doing a body slam on a reporter yeah he

how many years actually had a problem I I smoked pretty regularly for more than two decades\nAnd that was they at least the last Fifteen Years or so I I overdid it so a long time how do you know you over did it\nWell now that I'm Silber I can look back on some of the uh the mighty have years when I was high and realize that uh\nThat was causing a lot of my problems you know I was having a public meltdown effort can't or even a getting into fights or I was doing crazy stuff in public that I probably wouldn't have done if I'd been sober you know and I also\nWas a sleeping normally I I was I was at ... and in addition to that I spent a lot of my time thinking about marijuana about how to get it about how to consume and about the consumers with\nAbout trips I could take that would revolver on

of the big claims when we were going through the legalization debate in the state of Washington where I live [noise]\nWas it this would be so great because fewer people would be drinking and more people will be smoking weed but for first of all there's no reason to believe that smoking weed stumps people from drinking as they're\nAbsolutely not I mean I I was less of a drinker when I was getting stone but I Know I Know people who do both in in ... they go together pretty well so now they're going to believe that\nBut there you know the thing with driving while stoned right there were the other to live in the in the started community that I'm actually um it's much safer to Dr stone\nThan uh than drunk because you know when you're stone you you get paranoid and you're more focused

did these candidates in those days still new to do better than Trump they just need to do as well and uh this would be very encouraging and it also brings up the point that when you read the generic polls nationally when they say well\nThe Democrats are have this big advantage and the generic poll\nThe reasons that doesn't matter as much as you might think it would it's the same reason it didn't matter alternately that Hillary won the popular vote by more than three well three million votes but you know what that was all in California\nAnd that's the point one of the reasons I think that Democrats may be doing well on the generic ballot there are thirty six seats where there is no Republican candidate\nReally where it's just so like I I don't think Maxine Waters has a Republican candidate against are there other seeds that are so dominated by the Democratic machine no Republican runs you know how many seats there are no\nDemocratic candidates only three so when you take that

on the in the lawns there for him it's just amazing and this is a very\nWealthy neighborhood and he's he's amazing and when he was just\nAs well they figured out the SAT bolt in from Massachusetts taught them if you go find yourself a combat veteran cleans up well in talks normal and isn't that crazy left wing radical right and they're always going to be a regular Democrat\nThey're going to win it's it's not a magic formula but then they go to Arizona and on and it's like Christmas cinemas and that and so our combat veteran went\nRight and he's a I think he's one of three Democrats to vote for the ... for the tax cuts you have ... yeah so he knows he knows where he is a but they you know the district was redrawn and all that so that all changed and so\nUm he he was he's been in Congress about twenty minutes and now he's back up or another election and ... with the wins which he probably will be there for fifty years he's\nYeah he's ... he's going to rise but I'll tell you what's interesting I think that uh it's still Trump country for more on our people are listening right now you should know that the browse going to be just do a lot of ... which is Trump country went for\nAl Gore in two thousand by fifty nine percent it went for John Kerry two thousand four by sixty percent voted for Barack Obama twice by sixty one percent\n... fifty two percent that Donald Trump trouble county say western PA this yes place flipped man this yeah this whole place what Trump\nI so I mean when you when you were supposed to be analyzing this\nThe only thing that's ever been there have been polls is what you're supposed to look at well this guy's eight points ahead of the ... twenty seven points maligned\nThey didn't mean anything last time I mean there are they even worth talking about any more\nI don't think so my friends is either right cheer for the threat posed to do that and for the couple of newspapers\nSoil to talk to people ... nobody ever gets called right on the pores try and do their job but a lot of people don't want to talk to them they don't want to advertise their Fort Trump barrel bears by Trump but they vote for Trump it's a fascinating time that we're living it's never been in the lab\nIs not a it's a pretty good time to be doing a talk show this seems to be a lot of things going on here [laughter] cultures coming apart at the same yeah\nAh so I mean there's all kinds of different directions we'd go you are but I'm just the uh the the plan for tonight here a month or heights country club what what goes on your ...\nWhere we got that is Prager Michael mad at you and I am for it and uh I usually take the microphone we largely I learned jokes that I Want to talk that much and if we give Prager two questions that saved the wrap it up and go out and then it'll get a couple\nOf and I'm just I'm just going to throw in um is going to do a break every Fifteen minutes and reached course\nThat's all you that's what we want the local color and there but uh what what happens is we never had unplanned we ended up talking about Trump never Trump ended up talking about the Democrats we talked about Brecht cabinet a lot of that radicalized a lot of people\nAre selling the show this morning before my voice gave out I looked at the polls over the weekend Republicans will get their back if you believe anything I aggregate them all I Do believe any one individual yeah and they're all going the Russian and Republicans and I think it's that the Democrats really ticked off the country by their treatment of break out about it if they was fair that just didn't think it was\nYeah and two weeks is not a long time except now there's a long time because because things seem to be closing in and the the gap seems to be getting smaller and\nIt's the last two weeks when he when you have a uh\nThat might be close the last two weeks as eternity\nTrump works hard and that's what's interesting to me\nYour your um your audience might have some Indians fans in the um the Indians one very early this year the division was so bad yeah and so they posted in the playoffs right there were horrible\nThey weren't even awake right Trump on the other hand is working every day you know twenty now and the elections he sprinting through the tape and to me as a political observer I like the energy\nAnd is a crazy caravan thing down in Mexico\nIt's like the perfect issue for the job yet it brings together all of the issues about lawlessness and border security and I have a heart for these people but you just can't march up to the United states like on the door and say I get to come in no\nNo and and it's interesting the eighties you see the ... the ... the AP changed or it's a headline no the AP had written a store I don't have in front of me here a ... an army of migrants was headed north and ... they got I don't know who don't know if there's one person who gets to complain and make a pie change it\nBut there were were eight where there was a complaint or there were complaints\nThat army was kind of a bad connotations so they changed it to um the caravan of migrants you\nKnow it's an army yeah looks like a looks like I I'm a giant mob now here's the thing\nI asked this question on whether it's the kind of thing that can get you in trouble but I don't care\nI asked this question because I'm going back and forth with some some people on Twitter and a ... as one or a black guy that like I get along very well with on Twitter we disagree on everything a politically but he and I get into good discussions about sports on Twitter and I like the guy\nBut he's constantly talking about we need we need changes because there's too many old white guys in charge and and you're allowed to say that now you weren't you know a couple of years ago you weren't allowed to say that but you are now yeah obviously\nSo I look at the picture of ... I don't know what the numbers up to now five thousand eleven thousand whatever the number as of this caravan that's coming north\nAnd what is it seven thousand okay\nOr whatever it is and I see looks to me like it's all people of color\nOkay so if if the problem that America is that there are too many white guys in the Senate if we heard during the Kavanaugh saying first of all it was men because it was a female issue and then it was white men because they're white\nShouldn't the caravan or the army ... be going in the opposite direction back to the countries that are have been founded by and are governed by people of color if if the secret to happiness\nIs ... is getting rid of old white guys well\nThat no it's not just that but if the secret to happiness is being governed by people who look like you are the ... the same color skin is you got\nWhy isn't the caravan leaving here and going to\nA question like ... ... ... left on the system and you know the oldest white guy in the world with Ted Kennedy forever and then he was saying\nThere's a saying that and even though he was allowed to be any horribly towards them and now the ... like a light bill to yeah I had John Kerry I'm area show last week he's a really old white guy you know it doesn't really matter to me if you're older young\nAbout the only difference is your facility was social media and you like me we we both use Twitter was sent away from its way down here and and so okay we're in that we can use Twitter we can get along but basically I got kids and they tell me when I'm acting like an old guy in there is fine but in politics it's all one both internal jar\nAnd they better stop insulting everybody\nThey're they're doing it a lot and you are on there was a Ann Coulter a wrote a piece of if you saw now called no more Mr White guy\nIt's I printed it out I don't have in front of me here I I Do have I might be able to read throw up some of the stuff that you had on there it was a page and a half long I'm nothing but a derogatory statements made by important people about too many white\nGuy or you know I get in trouble because I'm On MSNBC and I am like the way this guy yeah I ... I Am the pale as human beings have TV or read but that to them Irish Catholic and all all I'm just white you're shaving I should be a shame I but I go on MSNBC I get the old white guy stuff a lot of that and laughing\nAnd laughing and laughter they want to be doing this at least Fifteen or Twenty years yeah Bennett wait till he was Seventy five or Seventy seven you know I I intend to go for long 'til I fall over God takes me yeah and\nThey can't stop because on the radio nobody knows how old you are\nThat's right you know the old you are but\nI and then you have to what we're told that I mean who gets to decide when you're old can as you said Ted Kennedy was he'd he'd still be in the Senate he'd be a hundred and twelve right now he'd still be\nA senator from Massachusetts would he had lived this and he would and in fact with David ... drug somebody else in the end on a second girl a matter of drinking Ruth Bader Ginsburg is uh eighty five yeah and if she goes to a hundred and five she'll be on the Supreme Court [laughter] nobody will care [laughter]\nSome believable well I'm so\nWith everything that's going on right now what is the ... when you're on your show is there one issue that is the driving issue of everything is that race is that what what is Trump oh okay\nI could talk about Trump tonight we will talk about the president\nOr if we're if we're up there for Ninety minutes we'll talk about the president for eighty five yeah and it's nothing new it's like the gravitational pull of the of the sun you can't if you get close to the moon will get pulled into its gravity and it's because Jonah Jonah Goldberg John Part hoard said this morning Joe the other day\nThe John ... show the I'm too old to be the answer\n\nTo do it is here we are a month or ice a country club band that the battleground tore it\nWill be starting here shortly the festivities but dinner and then a little panel discussion with the\nEU and Dennis burger and Michael met bed and made John soccer all uh and um [noise] are there still are plenty of good seats available so you want to come out here you can walk up and get a get tickets at the door here here's only got a couple more minutes here before the voice disappears and he has to\nRun every ... gigs before do you know what it's like yeah oh yeah it is it you've got like a hundred yards to go and yet like Seventy and you're right that yeah yeah I just got to make it through those last throw yard\nThat's right so um what's the uh what do you think the what's the theme tonight\nUh the thing that's going to be on a set of surprises coming I think that the Republicans going to do far better than anyone thought that's what I think yeah and there and my friends I was in a third Iraq NBC headquarters on the night of your lecture mhm I'm sitting right here next to me is James Carville your ... or check is right next to check us Lester Holt\nA savannah Guthrie Tom Brokaw you wouldn't believe the ... the looks through the entire building I'd probably only I voted for Trump in the building and I didn't think he was or whether it's ... below ten o'clock and so it's ten Fifteen at night\nAnd he's one yep and they're just they're just ...\nWell the I have a friend who works in the media here he's a sports guy I Can't tell you name because he doesn't he's not a political ... he doesn't like to make his political stuff publisher\nI very much a political junkie balls is stuffed closely he told me from the day that Trump got the nomination\nTill election day he's gonna win he ... he had talked to some people they knew and Ohio and some people in the Republican Party he said I'm telling you he's gonna win he's going to win just is the only a never backed away from it he said he's going to win it wasn't just some idiot wishful thinking he he said he's gonna win\nHe says he said the same thing about the Republicans in two weeks that they're going to win big\nGuys finger on the policies got um if you talk to people that's one of the reason I like to go on these tours that actually talked to people not the beltway right right right\nYeah hey how much time we got ten seconds it looks like a lot of time you'll see in the room that a one minute one minute okay we got a minute or so I\nSo I got a question for it yeah greatest Cleveland player of all times and ...
