God for the work of law enforcement in diffusing those bombs and apprehending the evil bomber and yes he is evil he's not just pathetic\nHe's evil and it's possible to be both of course everybody wonders about what are the political implications of all this I Want to go a little bit deeper than that but we'll get to that too\nAnd I want to talk about what this means about America\nAre weak coming apart or we're experiencing a total social breakdown something utterly unprecedented in and this is just the worst thing in the world\nNo we're fine we're fine\nOne of the most beautiful things I ever heard I really mean it was the announcement on on the media\nAnd it was based upon a statement by the Anti Defamation league which monitors anti Semitism and anti Semitic incidents they reported that the horrible attack on Pittsburgh and yes it was horrible and was nightmarish was pure evil\nThat that attack was the deadliest single attack against American Jews in the nearly four hundred years that we've lived in North America\nI think about what that means what an indication of how blessed we are how unbelievably\nFortunate we are with this great country one eight hundred nine five five Seventeen Seventy six is our phone number\n[noise] um [noise] let me let me give you a little bit of personal perspective and I don't usually do this but this is very personal I'm not from Pittsburgh I'm from Philadelphia originally\nBut of course we have friends in Pittsburgh I have war shipped at a congregations not at the tree of life synagogue but congregations in squirrel hill Pennsylvania we have squirrels us as squirrels we we have friends in squirrel hill I'm sure squirrels too and in addition to humans\nBut um [noise] [noise] the the attack is devastating\nAnd it's horrible and it's nightmarish\nBut uh I think perspective is a hundred percent necessary and what Sarah Huckabee Sanders said in a White House press briefing I think this could be her best press briefing today\nAs she made a very important point which is when news of this attack came out the very first thing President Trump did was to condemn\nAnti Semitism extremism hatred bigotry that kind of sickness that led to this attack and the very first thing that\nMany voices in the news media did she said the media in general but if you can generalize many voices very first thing they did was to blame Trump and to blame his rhetoric\nAnd I think that stinks and I think the attempt by some radicals and they are radicals in Pittsburgh to hijack this tragedy saying that the president the first lady won't be welcome in Pittsburgh\nBecause of their past rhetoric let me make something clear I guarantee you those people who have signed that position or sixteen thousand of them\nDo not speak for Pittsburgh and they emphatically do not speak for the Jewish people in the United states I Am I found out about this\nOn Saturday morning after I walked to synagogue and and what I usually do and I mentioned this before\nOr our son and daughter in law and a almost two year old granddaughter live not far from our synagogue um I live further away so I Walk the close to three miles and then I stop in\nA with Danny and enrich shell and Julia and maybe for a cup of tea but just to catch up on the week in to actually see this adorable little girl\nAnd this week uh Danny walked with me from his home in the two of us walk together to synagogue and which is just literally his his houses clubs and\nWhen we got there\nUh it was something strange\nBecause there was a guy we know a dear friend actually Christian guy\nWho is a former marine officer a marine aviator I Know you're never a former marine you're always a marine in in Charlie's a marine\nHe's also a world famous honest uh opera singer and in NRA instructor and NRA last life member and he was standing in the back of our synagogue again these questions not Jewish\nAnd I came up and great um hey Charlie what's going on a great to see you and I said you haven't heard I said no what happened and he said there were a lot of people killed\nAt a synagogue in Pittsburgh and I just wanted to come out here to help protect my friends and\nIt was so overwhelmingly beautiful and it's such a demonstration of America that this marine from Nebraska\nWould see fit now as it turns out we also have an armed security guard we also have at least five members of our congregation um and it's religiously because we have a ... enclosure and a rule of around ... ... they're packing\nOn there and they're also guys who are like members of the n._r._a. and they're ready\nSo we now I'm not suggesting that every congregation that countries should do this but this was part of our factor and then part of what happened was that um\nWhen when Danny heard the news he said well maybe I ought to go back home and tell where shall not to bring Julia because you know coming to a two year old and if you're expecting some World War three it said come on we'll we'll be fine we're fine\nAnd he said sure and and the baby came and she had a great time she played was a big girls in sort of behind the services and then we had our um our our kid is like our social after the services and everything was fine now there was there was\nOf course there are special prayers and a mention of what had happened in Pittsburgh we didn't yet know the identity\nOf the killer and this is part of of what is so horrible about this is that um\nThat this occurred on on on the Sabbath and it's ironic those we listen to a lot of the show I ended the show on friday by talking about the importance of the Sabbath and how much I was looking forward to the Sabbath and and the value of actually turning off\nA media for one day a week\nAnd it's because of turning off those media that I only found out when I actually arrived in synagogue what had happened but you know\n... everybody who's Jewish pays attention to this stuff and you have in the back of your mind what's going to be necessary I I Know that that um to go if you ever go to synagogue in Mexico\nAnd I've gone to services in Mexico city unless ... which is a a neighborhood was central Jewish community in Mexico city they're they have really heavily armed security guards and metal detectors and\nWell but that's that's basically the Mexico such an unsafe well it's\nNot nearly as bad as Honduras Guatemala and El Salvador and we'll be talking about the care of and in a moment to\nBut um it it is simply wrong\nWell here's what Howard Simon said Howard find men for years of Newsweek he was commenting on MSNBC\nAnd uh this is what he said uh because I think it's it's just dead\nWrong and we need to answer answer it back years fine\nJust watches the Jews ... know their own history this was about a Jewish story this was an American story but says in America story about the fraying of our social fabric and the rise of violence as a way of expressing yourself in this country\nThat we haven't seen the likes of in modern times if ever we've have civil wars we've had strife\nBut we've never had this kind of individual violence against groups based on hate the way we're seeing them bubble up now ah and that's my concern and that should be all of our concerns on this morning\nOkay that's ridiculous it is ridiculous\nThe first in modern times and still in some ways most horrifying killing at a place of religious sanctity was the four little\nGirls who were killed in Birmingham and in the Obama administration of course we have this horrible horrible Charleston episode and then be for countless Ryan stance riots in Tulsa, Oklahoma\nThat killed about three hundred African American people left ten thousand African Americans homeless destroyed thirty five square block that was Nineteen Twenty one [noise] I have no idea what Mr find minutes talking about\nWe're over ... this is not the edge of destruction or the eve of destruction\nYou disagree can give me a call will listen to Sarah Sanders at her press briefing coming up on that show [noise]\nA you notify the authorities I because it is clearly a threat\nAnd uh they're interchange also included this\nHe says he created gap because he saw a new room for conservative points of view on social media take Twitter\nWinner thousands upon thousands of people calling for someone to kill Donald Trump thing they're going to kill Donald Trump\nExpressing hate toward white people towards Christian towards minorities who made a now support Donald Trump or they allow hate the view that certain groups and certain people\nOkay they allow I hate to be viewed as certain groups in certain people that that ... he's he's correct there shouldn't be that kind of hatred toward anyone and by the way one of the names that has to be mentioned in this context as Farrah Khan\nWho recently compared a Jews to termites and infestation of past\nAnd um look at a Farrakhan for years and years and years has been spewing this anti Semitic garbage and yet he is honored by people on the left he was recently seeded replace him on our two seats away from Bill Clinton former president at a reserve Franklin's funeral\nAnd Farrakhan just like this guy Robert Ballard should be stricken from polite ... conversation\nBecause of course ... to to talk about\nCriticism of one group or another group that is free speech but when you go into Nazi tropes and you talked about genocidal conspiracies\nIt's dangerous\nAnd there ought to be some kind of notification or some kind of concern one eight hundred nine five five Seventeen Seventy six is

tomorrow with the first lady and I think that's a good thing\nThe um uh\nThe letter that was signed by the sixteen thousand people says you yourself called the murderer evil but yesterday's violence

careful of Mr Weiss respectfully don't compare Louis Farrakhan the Donald Trump\nI mean Louis Farrakhan is an open unapologetic lifelong anti Semite he is I mean he he he clearly is they don't they don't apologize for it anymore\nAnd uh he he is identified I don't know anyone who can plausibly say that Louis Farrakhan is not a hater of Jewish people\nAnd Donald Trump is so free of that charge you can charge Trump with lots and lots of stuff but I I tweeted about this it is unequivocal that Donald Trump cares deeply about the state of Israel\nAnd as Sarah Huckabee Sanders said today he adores his Jewish grandchildren\nAnd the idea that the Donald Trump is quote dog whistling or is is some kind of deep anti Semite or that he's responsible for encouraging things like this synagogue attack by as ... said a guy who said he hated Trump\nIs that's a ton aren't and it's it's the worst kind of political smear and it's totally unfair\nOne eight hundred nine five five Seventeen Seventy six our phone number here was the opening statement at the White House press briefing or just about an hour ago from Sarah Huckabee Sanders\nOur nation mourns the loss of these extraordinary Americans and we also pray for those who were wounded our hearts are with the four brave police officers who were shot and injured while trying to stop the attack\nWe thank God for these officers and for every member of law enforcement who responded swiftly and bravely in the wake of the attack we've witnessed Americans of every faith tradition\nComing together to mourn with their fellow citizens to support one another and to stand in solidarity with America's Jewish community the president cherishes the American Jewish community for everything it stands for and contributes to our country\nHid doors Jewish Americans as part of his own family the president has the grandfather of several Jewish grandchildren\nHis daughter is a Jewish American and his son in law's a descendent of Holocaust survivors\nTomorrow the president and first lady will travel to Pennsylvania to express their support of the American people in Greece for the Pittsburgh\nOkay and that is the right thing to do by the way some props to the NFL or the Pittsburgh Steelers went on with their game and that was the right thing to do and yeah there were some religious Jewish people in the crowd USA Today wrote about them\nAnd there was a sign that I think called the uh the attention of many people which is hatred can't break a city of steel\nAnd by the way the Steelers one up if they were playing sorry Hugh Hewitt the Cleveland Browns so that wasn't a shot\nA John ah Jonathan Karl ah posed a question to Sarah Sanders about the the president's a legit responsibility on this heart\nThe president said over the weekend that he could tone off his rhetoric what we're seeing my that was he a concert at all his words\nCode is fire approval for all people do awful\nCertainly ah the president wants a enormous for our country is hurting like we've seen 'em in the last several days of find ways to bring our country together and we've seen him do exactly that\nHowever the president is going to continue to draw a contrast a particularly as we go into the final days of an election the differences between the two parties particularly on policy differences you'll continue to see him make that contrast [laughter] ah but he has certainly I think\nFound those moments to bring our country together and certainly focus on some of the things that all of us can support and all of us are can condemn as well\nOK and again I ... it is hard for me to imagine that Sarah could have handled these\nThese questions more effectively than she did Jonathan Karl kept a going at this and about President Trump blaming the media which by the way yeah do I believe he should pull back on that of course it's tired it's stupid stop it uh but Jonathan Karl put the question to Sarah\nWhy is the author you say you wouldn't be why is the author very very first\nThing that the president didn't was condemned the attack sloth in Pittsburgh and in the pipe bombs the very first thing the media did was blamed the president and make him responsible for these ridiculous [laughter]\nAccent is outrageous that that would be the very first reaction\nWas so many people on top of the country the I'm not finished the only person responsible\nFor carrying out either at these heinous acts were the individual to carry them out it's not the president no more than it was Bernie Sanders fault for the individual who shot up a baseball field of congressional Republicans you can't start putting the responsibility of individual on anybody but the individual who carries out the crime was\nFor the sake of the news media is the first one is the one pleasing claim here\nThe print them out but I think the president's not it's not responsible for these acts\nAgain the very first actually let the president did was can down\nAh these heinous acts the very first thing that the media did was condemned the president and go after and try to place blame not just on the president but everybody that works in this administration\nThe major news networks first public statement what's to blame the president and myself included I mean that is outrageous that anybody other than the individual who carried out the crown would hold that responsibility\nOkay and ... again particularly regarding the synagogue in in Pittsburgh when you talk about trying to divide the country the\nHandful of people from a radical leftist group who are trying to prevent the president's first lady from coming to Pittsburgh\nShould um straighten up and fly right I I mean he's the president of the United states and he's doing the right thing by going there and by the way I'm\nIn his comments are never ideal but it's obvious that his heart is concerned with this thing we we will be right back with more the dual between Sarah and the press and Mike Pence was excellent on this we'll get to that coming up on them at that show [noise]\nOne of the things that are striking a balance a saves are say opt\nJunior is he's a phony
