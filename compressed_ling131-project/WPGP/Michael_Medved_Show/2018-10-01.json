of a sexual misconduct cases most of them are Democrats you got Keith Ellison who still running for attorney general isn't meant co chaired a Democrat\nThis is why you do when I have some conservatives talk about the ... it's all conspiracy and so I I Am against or conservative and they said it a few victims there but when you look because the Democrats are largely in power with a public broadcasting in public radio and CBS and ABC when it's on their\n... whether it's Charlie would look at the whole Johnny rose and you probably have Ninety five percent of the other people have lost their jobs or been demoted law are for urban kicked out are liberal Democrats there because they were in power just like Sacramento here in California for those who naturalist it could be the

for those very charges and one is in jail for another reason as well as for the Democrats keep getting up\nAnd you know let me say this is going to surprise a lot of people there are a ... well I Can't stand Al Franken the personally it is in his politics there he probably shouldn't have left the Senate because he was groping some woman by now I'm not saying what he did was right or whatever the ups but but if they want to have that standard find because let's decapitated a whole bunch of Democrats there at that threshold\nThere so that gets to my point and everybody's part what happens to the presumption of innocence will this road they've gone down well not so I just this whole\nProcess you if you had true traditional liberals and civil libertarians over the years\nIncluding Democrats or where to go forward and said you know there's a reason why we have to actually limitations this evening is even prosecutorial now in in Maryland there and it's from the high school in a

we have nowadays is\nEverything is considered the same level as rape or a a you know and and but it's you know you you have a a a workplace where somebody calls but somebody in her hair or whatever and this makes it an unwelcome workplace so we in effect had the effect of ... the real serious stuff of rape and all these these are putting everything on the same class\nWhat about center refined

or three seats are unbelievable any really as possible any final thoughts\nI hear on my own radio station in DFW and you could say we talked to some capping off\nSo let me share with you some of the discussions I've already had with people than my goal is to have further\nDiscussions with you one eight hundred nine five five Seventeen Seventy six you know the number one eight hundred nine five five one seven seven six go ahead and get in line now you might as well I have a feeling it's going to be a a a a an active three hours because and ever since it was sort of the middle of the talk show day friday\nOr all kinds of things have busted out and we need to talk about all of them so why don't we take them in sort of chronological order and uh and I have questions for you and uh just let's just share thoughts and see where we all are because\nThis this is not just\nA confirmation hearing any more [noise] this is not just a battle like the ones we've had in the past contentious things like that of slander of Robert Bork by Ted Kennedy in Nineteen eighty seven the at the battle for Clarence Thomas or just a short period of time there after that was of course acceptable [noise]\nUh but with the Supreme Court is a very very big deal in the battles over and over a big deal\nAnd the moment Brett Kavanaugh was named as President Trump's election I knew I was in ... in support of his nomination because I Want constitutional is on the high court ah I I was thrilled to have Gorsuch that was a replacement\nFor the late Antonin Scalia a V. Anthony Kennedy vacancy ... was a kind of a fifty fifty Justice Kennedy a lot of rulings are came down on one side of the bed he woke up on and and he's been replaced by solid constitutional list which is a a a wonderful thing\nAnd and now we have a situation in which ah with with with Kavanaugh here comes another constitution list and there is no way in the world\nThere are there is no way that the today's left is going to allow\nA another constitutional list I'm On the courts a lot of people said well they didn't get this bad for Gorsuch Gorsuch somehow made it in what seems like a walk on the beach now compared to today's standards and and\nBecause they'll give you one you know there is that old precepts at when you win that election you've you've heard this a million times elections have consequences right and they do that's why ... board knows Morocco Obama's election I'd consequences and one of those consequences or Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan\nOn on the Supreme Court two constitutions shaping judicial tyrants because that's what you're going to get when Democrats main people at the Supreme Court but but it was Lindsey Graham said in that magnificent Thursday or\nA moment of his ... said it as as as he said as the Democrats that as as as you said to uh to judge Kavanaugh when you get on the court when you see something you sort of minor in ... and you tell them Lindsay said hello\nBecause I voted for them and I would never do that and what these people are trying to do for you I still wonder William ... four days later after that Lindsey Graham moment\nI I've I rarely them as a I\nI may have leapt to my feet sharing I'm Glad I wasn't driving 'cause I it was it was so magnificent it brought such moral clarity\nAnd moral clarity is what we need moving forward image crazy week this crazy week a week made necessary by Jeff Flake and we're going to talk about him in a minute in fact we're going to hear from him in a minute because he is at some\nEvent in Boston some radio station is doing something and he was just a it in one and they have an interviewer was asking him a bunch of things and since you know Jeff Flake runs Laurel now I guess we'd better probably you know figure out what to\nWhat people ... says in believe these days but the moral necessity of this is something that I Am addressing in a town hall dot com column that are that will run tomorrow and that is that this is not just a a Supreme Court\nBattle anymore this this is not just a victory that we should seek a because we wanted constitution list on the Supreme Court this is\nA moral assassinate because it's not just about him reaching the court anymore these kinds of tactics these kinds of things that you've seen these these ...\nBottom feeding tactics by today's left from actual senators to cartoonists to column writers to two pundits to people all walks of left his life\nThey can't they simply cannot win they simply can not when they have dashed against the rocks the basic precepts of jurisprudence\nAnd not even jurisprudence thinking about a couple of concepts innocent until proven guilty not just all that's on a law school precepts that's not something to justify courtroom ideal innocent until proven guilty\nIs a basic human decency it's what you will for anybody who's accused of anything same thing with requiring evidence\nAn allegation is made\nWell what's the evidence that's the first question you don't accept an allegation on face value this believe women saying it is a scam\nIn his political bullying Jeff Flake was bullied him at elevator and and and folded like a skinny seventh grader on the playground\nAnd and we're now in this needless weaker FBI\nProbe what's the latest hang on the White House is authorized the FBI to expand its investigation interviewing anybody it seems to edit it deems necessary\nAs long as the reviewers finished by the end of the way oh did you hear any bugs today that the FBI I don't know what kind of we can just go to America imagined that an FBI lake but there was buzz earlier today that the FBI it might be ready to wrap this up like tomorrow [noise] okay whenever you got till friday you got till friday\nThat is what ... told us a last friday is you know how old are you can have my vote you'll have it on the committee but you can only have it in the full Senate ah\nAfter a week of a further probes and and look the best case scenario\nThe best case scenario is that this week gives\nThrows a Boehner to the Democrats who were\nDemanded it creates a comfort zone to ideologically vague people like Jeff Flake\nProvides a ... I Would say cover ... provide comfort of for the Republican votes of Susan Collins and Lisa Murkowski and maybe here's where\nCover comes in and maybe provides cover for some Democrats who I think we want to vote for Kavanaugh I think they want to not because they like him anymore than Cory Booker does but because they really need to wind up\nAs you know there are dead you know Democrats famously running\nIn states that Trump won and won big Joe Manchin in West Virginia Joe Donnelly in Indiana Heidi Heitkamp in North Dakota these are people they don't just want to vote for judge could they probably don't want to vote for judge Kavanaugh but they need to vote for judge Kavanaugh because I'll tell you right now\nIf Joe Manchin votes for judge Kavanaugh he takes a big bite out of Patrick Morsi's attack on him Patrick Morsi is the west Virginia attorney general he's a magnificent man I think he's gonna whip and ... and that that would be fantastic that would just be a wonderful thing to Patrick Morrisey being a senator from West Virginia and set of Joe Manchin and I like Joe ...\nJoe Manchin is one of those Democrats who does not make your teeth sketch\nHe's a left of center you know big labor but just socially conservative sort of kind of sometimes West Virginia guy and I know that territory very well as the first place I ever worked in radio back forty some years ago and then you loved it then love it now\nUm love it so much that I Want them to have a conservative centered [laughter] so let's so let's go Patrick Morrisey and Patrick ... right now I like ... him to vote for a for cabinet which mentioned may do and this week of FBI\nFoolishness may may give them cover and so if we get to the end of this week in the deck is cleared and the nonsense says that is as old as all played out and we have a successful\nFull Senate vote on Kavanaugh is confirmed it will have all been worth it right it will have all been worth it\nBut first when you've got to get there first of all that but I just said has to actually happened and it may not it really may not have you met today's last have you seen these people have you seen what they do have you heard what they do\nThey will move heaven and earth to prevent this not not just this nomination their goal is to stretch this to the election\nWin back the house so they can impeach Trump and when the Senate so that even if he they they don't impeach him which they won't\nAh he'll never get another nominee on the court\nBecause when you boil it all down there is all about making sure that they're sacrament of abortion\nIs untouched that's what this whole thing has always been about you know that right if not I'll help you out with that [noise] so um some of the lowest things have happened over the last few days I'm going to share them with you because my my thought is some folks overplay their hand smart Davison for my comment that happy Monday\nIs Jeff Flake job and I and and by the way I'm not trying to turn them into Ted Cruz her turn him and to me this is what a responsible\nJeff Flake ought to have done at that occasion\nMa'am I I Am so sorry for anything that happened to you and I honor your experience and I'm hoping to your experience and you have every prayer and every good wish for healing and ... that's all I have to say about your experience your victimization I have exactly the the proper deference that anybody should have for that\nHowever when you identify judge Kavanaugh as someone who sexually assaulted someone that is simply not been born out in the fact it may in some investigation may play up next week but it hasn't been yet my decision my vote needs to be based on what the evidence shows\nAnd what testimony reveals and not based on anything anybody tells me no matter how passionate they may be about something that might have happened unrelated in their lives\nNow please get out of the elevator I gotta go that's how it goes on but it didn't just now we have this week of hell but wait a minute on that wait a minute on that\nWhat is this week going to do when you're together today and tomorrow I'm enormously grateful once again the talk show God's you're smiling a Michael's back Wednesday Thursday Friday and questioning moving on from there\nBy the time we gets Wednesday Thursday Friday we was friday being the supposed a deadline for this entire FBI dog and pony show\nI I think there's a possibility here because as bleak as it may look and as a twist it off as I Am about to having to endure this week you realize we are talking about today's left right we are talking about today's Democratic Party right\nI think the air hangs thick with possibilities that they may overplay their hand so profoundly\nThat they may reveal such a deep bug died hatred in the things they say and I do and I'm not I'm Talking about cartoonist columnist and United States senators and everybody in between\nThat the pendulum of empathy may swing toward judge Kavanaugh as millions of Americans just a good grief enough enough this man has suffered enough then there is still\nNo evidence of the type of wrongdoing that originally created this problem for him I think by friday that may be the landscape I pray that it is okay nothing a yam rang let's uh let's have you on TALK back to their one\nEight hundred nine five five Seventeen Seventy six Mark Davis

a mattress shopping experience by building mattresses and box springs in our own local factories and selling them direct view\nIt short sweet and simply makes sense [noise]\nSo experienced more than just the mattress store experienced an original the original mattress\nAnother great day and then Michael Medford show am twelve fifty\n\n[noise]\n[noise]\nMichael ... show final segment our number one on Jane number one of the month of October ... from Michael welcome welcome welcome\nSo there is a it's been a busy busy day like made me a day that's not but President Trump had a big news conference a that was mostly about trade issues and it's just funny ... maybe we can wage this in today maybe tomorrow because as a conservative I'm sketchy on tariffs\nAnd they're not my favorite thing but I just there's no arguing with the results sometime it's just these countries are falling into line as as as President Trump tosses out all these sharp elbows cherish next thing you know here we are signing a big old deal with Canada and Mexico as the rest of the trillions of dollars\nIt it it seems tremendous so there there was a lot of of Trump audio this morning here was one of my favorite parts\nAnd he was talking about Kavanaugh and talking about past alcohol use something he knows by his own admission nothing about so play this and then I have a question\nAfterward go says he didn't live out his drinking does that mean you'll pull his I don't think he did\nLook here's here's what I'm just saying I'm not a drinker\nCan honestly say I never had a beer in my life okay\nSo one of my totally good traits I don't [noise]\nWhenever they're looking for something that I never had a glass of alcohol I've never had alcohol I guess you know for whatever reason can you imagine if I had what a mess that they would I be I'd be the world's worst but I never drank I never drank okay but I can tell you I watch that hearing\nAnd um and maybe this is cause for some optimism because and and it sounds\nIt sounds\nMaybe a little snarky and I don't mean it too\nBecause I think their recent events that the kind of back up and I'm about to say and that is that today's left today's Democratic Party may overplay its hand so clumsy ...\n... by the time we get to friday a whole lot of Americans and maybe more than a few senators are just going to be saying enough\nIs enough there's nothing new here we've had the entire week the FBI probe that everybody was raining us to do okay we did it are you happy now the answer of course for it\nThey will be no of course they're not going to be happy now some people will never be happy because you know exactly what the game is delay delay delay attack attack attack a lot of people who said we just want to we just take it to friday and next week are going to be the exact same people\nWho are then going to say watch not enough it is an artificial deadline I mean why in the world where we're just trying to get the bottom of the fire people afraid of the truth oh my gosh you'll hear all of that garbage you'll hear all of that nonsense and so just hopefully Annette Lindsey Graham and the court I played last hour\nOr said look at it I think he might have heard some of what I heard a little bit of bugs it's not that the FBI might be about rapidly so they had a nice full weekend how\nTo talk to five or six people how long does it take you know I mean how many questions you have to ask\nSo that I don't know when the FBI is going to ah to to make its findings known\nI I Will tell you I Am comfortable asserting that I have no expectation of additional damaging information vis very FBI has looked into a judge Kavanaugh six times this is time number seven\nAnd so what's the likelihood that oh my gosh is a gang rape is what how did we miss that I don't think that's going to happen\n[noise] real quick [noise] you you host a talk show you take calls and then there's a little tape loop in your head that sometimes rolls of a previous call I Want to go back to a gentleman\nUh it was a very uh it was it was an invigorating vote called gentleman from Columbus and I thank him for his call his main points were Republicans don't want the truth Kavanaugh's a liar a it's all terrible and you know it did where we're just trying to get the bottom of this and into the structure gained going on and or or a cover up going on blah blah blah\nSo I asked him several times what is the evidence what is the evidence that a doctor Ford is telling the truth what is the as ... and saw that pesky evidence\nThat ah the doctor for this properly identified judge Kavanaugh as so has her attacker\nGentleman replied with a sentence that began will\nJudge Kavanaugh is lying dot dot dot will know so that that's re stating your premise you're not telling me the evidence that he's lying you're telling me that you think is like I'm going to give them a little bit of benefit of the doubt I think the idea of where you might have been going\nAnd this is a concept that I I think is going to be heavily played this uh this week\nI think the gentleman's the end of his sentence would have been that he's lying about some things so maybe he's lying about others\nOkay a concept in law the juries are free if you find that other witness if you find that a witness has indeed factually lied about one thing you may then cast whatever amount of debt you walk on everything else that witnesses said oh that could be interesting huh\nSo perhaps the gentleman's point I Want to get I Want to give him full shrift ah is that he found judge Kavanaugh not believable on some other things and that struck him as evidence that he's lying about everything\nThat that's far from a from a gracious interpretation but it if if it ... but it's something that the gentleman is is entitled to however here's the thing he has not caught judge capital in a lie about anything\nAnd nobody will no one will that precept only applies if you find that someone absolutely proven ... has lied about something that we have now is judge Kavanaugh\nTalking about some drinking episodes and there are some people from his pass to go through you might be under blamed the drinking episodes usually it was getting a little harder than he let on and then there's all this year\nBook code language of you know the Renato on this or a loved me us as they said it was also learned your vote of the generals triangle and booze and this and that just so stupid but here's the thing\nAre in their ... and everybody started Googling stuff is rule I don't think you do lose the truth about that I think he might be soft peddling that\nWe're never going to know okay\nWe will never not as weak or any week ... ever learn the judge Kavanaugh was factually misrepresenting anything about his way word moments at Georgetown Prep\nAs such there will not arise any basis for that legal precept of if we caught July and about a and B you might have been lying about the Indy so with\nThat are in a moment a boy in the United states to be in the Senate gallery today because there's red hot Senate action actually there's not really actually there's red hot Senate talking [laughter]\nThere's no real action we're waiting for action we're trying to take action we thought we were going to take action but Jeff Flake Saddam that he took action ... got a closet and and took action to bring the whole thing to a grinding halt thanks guys [noise]\nUm but but Chuck Schumer refers to some of exactly what I'm Talking about there but now they're moving the goalposts and it is not that there's any evidence the judge Kavanaugh\nIs is a horrible cereal sex criminal but rather they're going after going after his credibility on other stuff and you'll hear a Senator Schumer attempt that in a moment but one thing I said I wanted to share as the last hour of evaporated\nWas this amazing quote from a woman named Elizabeth\nLast us I think we have rich Lowry to thank over National Review\nIt is an excerpt from a book that she wrote called witness for the defense\nOr she is an expert in psychology law human memory eyewitness testimony I saw another article tweeted somebody in the New York times and like the year two thousand or I'll find it if if I Need to ah it was just a very compelling a essay written by a woman\nWho was raped I guess some time prior to two thousand 'cause she wrote it in two thousand and she said I I there was a lineup identified my attacker I was one hundred percent certain that that was my attacker and I was\nMistaken and her courage you're talking about courage that takes courage to admit having blown that call [noise] but as\nMorally necessary to be short and uh and you know what else can is morally and intellectually necessary for us to recognize\nThat this can happen to anybody to\nAnybody even Dr Ford so here is the excerpt from Elizabeth Loftis in her book witness for the defense\nFor how can we disbelieve the sworn testimony of eyewitnesses to a crime when the witnesses are absolutely convinced that they are telling the truth why after all would they lie\nBut there's the word lie that's the word that gets us off the track you see I witnesses who point a finger at innocent defendants are not liars\nSo they genuinely believe and the truth of their testimony the face that they see before them is the face of the attacker the face of innocence has become the face of guilt\nThat's the frightening part so truly horrifying idea that our memories can be changed inextricably altered and what we think we know what we believe with all our hearts is not\nNecessarily the truth man that's a paragraph that there's a paragraph from Elizabeth last us in her book witness for the defense a woman with expertise in psychology law\nEyewitness testimony human memory things like that\nI never ever ever actively believed that this entire thing was a trick so dirty that they find a woman who would under oath make up stuff that intentionally why\nI never believed that and as I watched a doctor forge testimony on Thursday morning she you know let's let's go let's go to the dictionary on another word\nShe seemed to what's the word everybody uses\nBorders credible means it made me it it was it means it means somebody who's the believable seems believable yeah but it means more than that and we'll examine takes

join us live right out of the box in the next hour some ... for that but meanwhile Senator Cornyn was talking about viewing all of all of this testimony through a very personal Lynn's\nI saw over the weekend or a one I could stand to have an MSNBC or CNN on for more than a few minutes was above ... to the guests and you know I'm I have been\nMaking an effort and I I figured that you know when you do a show like this before is doing the show I Would watch almost exclusively Fox because I just said no reason to have to put up with a MSNBC or CNN\n[noise] but I started in the last few weeks started thinking I really should\nWatch MSNBC and CNN once in a while just to see what they're doing and and maybe that not only for that just for purposes of the show but they you know maybe there's a perspective that it's\nA I should be getting I shouldn't be watching Fox only and I can't do it I I I Try I Try I just can't do it I I I don't\nLast more than a couple of minutes and ... and maybe someone who is\nA as liberal as I Am conservative turns Fox on and feels exactly the same way because maybe they hear the same things all the time but I I keep hearing the same things on a MSNBC and CNN and it's just so predictable and it's the same ... not just not so much from the gas\nWhich is also pretty predictable but just the panelists and what they say it's just\nIt's and it's just it's just bad television as what it is and it's it's unbearable I Can't watch it so I'm Sorry I Try I'm telling you I Try and I I'm going to have a couple of examples there later after our break\nA couple of examples of some things I heard today and you don't ... it's it's amazing alternate on and I'll say okay I'm going to just listen to this and see what they're saying\nIt's like a minute and a half I hit the mute button and I I I sort of looking at my phone or something and I just glance up at the TV to see if there's something on the graphic that might catch my attention to make me watch I I Can't do it it's just it's just so bad but\nUm you know I I what I saw over the weekend when I could stand to watch it was just\nIt was just unbelievably embarrassing and I'll get to more that after we take the brake too uh but speaking of embarrassing now how 'bout them Steelers uh they're one two in one\nThey probably shouldn't be one in three with a loss to the browns they got a break on a ... won that game to as easily as last but they could very easily be one and three and in last place behind the browns who almost one another game yesterday and right now they are tied with the brown\nGuess who's getting most of the blame\nHead coach a an undisciplined too much with players coach all the stuff you've been hearing for a while now maybe some of that as legitimate I always have to wonder how much of it ah the criticism of Tom and gets\nA and believe me I'm not I I Try as hard as I can to combat the people who find a racist everywhere they look\n'em and find examples of it but\nI I don't know if he's a white coach there and and you know obviously there's so many ah but there's such a high percentage of a black players on every NFL teams like sixty seven percent something like that two thirds of the players are black\nAnd you have a black coach and you have a team that's not doing well and you have some issues with Antonio Brown and all that stuff and I I always I have to watch because\nUh I think there's some of that involved in some of the criticism that Tom and gets I really do um I think if you were white coach you wouldn't be hearing the the ... they said that about power too but I I don't know that you'd be hearing as much about\nHim being a player's coach and not nearly as much about his players being undisciplined and I will say that car got a lot of that and he he had a lot of guys getting getting out of hand getting in trouble Joey Porter and\nAnd so some of that was going on but I just always have to wonder that and I'm not saying that that anybody who makes that claim or\nA mixed that uh and that has that analysis of what the problem is is a racist as only doing it because my comment is black I just think they're ... you'd be\nYou'd be in denial if you didn't think that there was some of that and ball just based on some of what I see on Twitter and all that stuff going on but that that's going on 'em and and then I said ... maybe some of that as legitimate a matter of fact some of it is but I I Do I still think\nThat some of it is also can be attributed to the fact that it's a black coach with black players and it it may not be\nRacism as much as it is just um I don't know if it'd be stereotyping or um I I don't know what you would call it but it's it's as if it were I don't know I just I just think it's there I don't I don't want to get too deep into it 'cause you know while get in trouble by keep talking about but I think there's some of that they're\nUm you know maybe the players are the problem though um you know maybe they're you know not good enough\nAnd maybe they could use levy on bells help James cars and nice story a you know going back and cancer and a a decent running back but he's not levy on bell\nAnd maybe the Steelers should be getting some of the same heat to the pirates get you know maybe they should have offered bell more money they ah they only ran the ball nine times yesterday its dealers nine times that's just ridiculous you'd have to go back to Nineteen fifty two\nWhen I was four years old to find a team or steal a team that only around the ball nine times and the game Nineteen fifty two and you don't want to know you think the Steelers teams bad you don't want to know how bad those teams were in the fifties or oh they're bad\nWell let me on bells been portrayed as the greedy villain and all of this but uh you know maybe that's not fair maybe he's worth the money he's been asking for maybe the Steelers are too cheap you know like the nothing's\nA pious take all the heat for not wanting to pay their players you never hear anybody are accused of steel to them and I know they have a salary cap and it's a different um financial a structure and all that stuff but\nStill guaranteed money is guaranteed money and dead money is the money and if the Steelers are unwilling to pay on bill the guaranteed money he wants for whatever reason ah why shouldn't ... why shouldn't cheat and this be attributed to do it at least a little bit um maybe it is\nAnd you know when they often struggles in us missing a guy who might be the most productive offensive player in the leg which bill at least was at one point if not last year the year before but he's one of the most productive players and the way\nI'm maybe Steelers management as dealers ownership should be taking the heat I should mention also that um you know I I I trashed the NFL pretty hard\nOr in the early weeks of the season and talk a lot about how the the national anthem issue is going to be a big deal\nAnd TV ratings are up the TV ratings this past weekend were pretty good uh they've had some good games uh the Thursday night game last week was pretty good or last night's game I think if you're not a Steelers fan\nOr a ravens fan that was still a relatively entertaining game to watch for the you know the the somebody wasn't rooting for either team\nBut ah I don't I don't know what the ratings weren't necessarily for the last night but I Do know that this Sunday afternoon ratings were good again I think that's the second week in a row they've been up over last year so there is that
