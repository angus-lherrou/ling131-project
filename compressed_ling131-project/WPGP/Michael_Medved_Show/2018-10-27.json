{"month": "10", "state": "PA", "station": "WPGP", "content": "You know maybe you're listening to us right now you feel pretty good about your investments you feel like you've got a good handle on things and I want to ask you have you ever heard of and you a ... like the initials anyway\nSounds like a a soccer team or a soccer league\nOr an association yeah I mean I thought initially it means needing unlimited assets that could be that could be what you need for retirement as you can go out and do what you want but anyway what I'm Talking about here in Terry talking about the hidden tax break that might be in your four\nOne K. is something called net and realized appreciation or any way\nAnd this could be a big help to people that have four one K. is retirement savings plans\nWere you hold a high percentage are a lot of employers stock and as you know that employers stock it's always something that you should look at\nSome times we found people that are sixty Seventy eighty Ninety a hundred percent of their retirement plans and employers stock which is not a good idea folks\nYet is not asset allocation at it's fine instead of not diversification but let's say you find yourself with a lot of company stock in your four one K. so let's let's say that you worked for Westinghouse\nFor all these years and you had a well as the stock even exist anymore but if you had Westinghouse stock and your Westinghouse savings plan or if you worked for Proctor and gamble\nAnd you had eight hundred thousand in your four one K. and five hundred thousand isn't Proctor and gamble stock or what taking advantage of this and that and realized appreciation is there is a cost basis that you paid for that company stock that the company\nKeeps track of how much money that you point out of your own sweat equity into that stock it's called your costs basis so in my example you have eight hundred thousand and four O. one K.\nFive hundred thousand of it is in the stock of the company you work for three hundred thousand which is called mutual funds\nWell that five hundred thousand dollars of company stock let's say that you have a certain amount invested into that obviously you look at it and say oh what do I have invested in it and let's say that you pay fifty thousand dollars into that stock over the years and it grew the five hundred\nThousand so in a normal situation then you have four hundred and fifty thousand dollars of capital gains that account was not in an hour\nIf it were not in an IRA so or four one K. correct so if you were able to if I were to tell you that wasn't that unreal realized appreciation it's hard to say that well anyway\nIt's easier to say you know aren't allowed there that are on like I said needing unlimited outside as if you take\nThat money and you you have the ability to roll that to an after tax account and you say wait if I wrote to an after tax account I'm going to have to pay taxes on five hundred thousand dollars and the answer to that is no not or if it's done properly under the end you a provision you only ordinary income tax on your costs basis which in my example was fifty thousand dollars\nThe other four hundred and fifty thousand dollars when sold when the stock is sold will be taxed as a capital gain not as ordinary income tax rates than if you're in a high bracket\nYou might go from thirty thirty five percent taxation on that money down to Fifteen which is what long term gains are for a lot of individuals in retirement and you might not end up paying much capital gains tax it all depending on your income so there are there provisions there now\nI've just looked at this with the client recently where it made no sense to take advantage because them paying any ordinary income tax even on their costs basis now\nAt a thirty seven percent rate they will be in a twelve percent tax bracket when they retire which is lower than the capital gains rate that they would pay depending on their income with will end up getting out of retirement so it may or may not make sense at that time but it did not make sense to use it but there are some pitfalls folks\nIf you just attempt to do this there are rules you have to pay that ordinary income tax\nYou have to roll out the ... the entire amount of the four oh one K. before the end of the calendar\nYear et cetera et cetera so like we talked about earlier with rollovers and sixty day rollovers taking advantage of net ... appreciation is a science and it's something that you should call us if you have company stock\nIn your four one K. call us today eight hundred three to one Seventy nine sixty three that's eight hundred three to one Seventy nine sixty three and let us give you the advice I we have a CPA in house that can examine every personal situation right here in our building\nAnd tell you if it makes sense to do that and boy that could be a huge tax savings for many of you listening\nAnd a lot of your advisors are are not talking to you about it because they they're not familiar with it they're they don't do retirement and they don't focus in areas like\nThis ... and folks it's that simple you know there's a lot of advisors and brokers that want to help you invest your money and believe it or not that's the easy part\n[laughter] you might be chuckling right now with the market going up and down the way it is but yeah that is the easy part\nNot trying to turn your life savings into a paycheck that last while also protecting that savings for market volatility is the challenge\nRemember the only way to really figure this out is to get information it's to sit down with someone who does this\nDay in day out he's learning the strategies that move you from a retirement savings plan into a retirement income plan and we've got lots of opportunities for you to do that coming up during this next month of November we've got\nCommunity college south campus in West Mifflin we've got retirement classes at community college boys up in Monroeville we've got workshops in the waterfront down in ah west homestead in hopes that area\nSo you've got lots of opportunities for you to increase your knowledge base there is no obligation when you come to these things there's a small cost for the college classes that just covers the room run on the cost of materials\nBut folks your retirement is just too important to leave it to chance find out how you could have a solid retirement income plan\nEight hundred three to one Seventy nine sixty three where you go to our website click on the events tap and you'll find out how to sign up for those classes again that synergy group Inc dot com S. Y. N. E. R. G. Y. the word group I. N. C. dot com\nSo obviously building a retirement plan where your paycheck is recreated building a plan where your assets are protected these things are so important and we always say it's not just what you make it's what you keep and\nThat brings us into the discussion about taxes and we talk about Tom Barrett the CPA that works with us here and he's a huge help and an asset to our clients are we are trained in terms of helping looking at the tax situation but that's what he does and that's why we have them\nIntegrated into our practice and I always tell people look taxes are there is the the old cliche you know the only thing certain or\nDeath and taxes and and that's one of the benefits of building these accounts and accumulating tax deferred retirement savings it's tax deferred that's a huge deal while you're saving but guess what when you get to retirement it's taxable and you need to find some efficient strategies\nThat's right and you also you want to pay the small amount of taxes possum absolutely so\nI think of crazy stories you know having for young kids so here's all my mind works at there's this for whatever reason this cultural phenomenon that you have to go to a pumpkin patch every year you know ... I mean this is interesting\nEven when the kids are older you still have to do this when they're gone you still have to do this if you have a young at heart wife guide\nOr grandkids right or yeah or whatever that is that is an interesting phenomenon you go out and this muddy field and there's a bunch of punk and they're not attached to the vines any more than just kinda sitting there staged by you know by the former but the the reason I bring up the pumpkin patch as we had our kids out after our soccer games this weekend we had the kids out at the pumpkin patch\nAnd were walking around and the kids are saying they'll look at this one and cold and picks up are rotten pumpkin and throws it ... and chaos there but eventually they find the perfect pumpkin and we put it in in this thing was big it's like a thirty some pound pumpkin wow and we put it on to the one of those wheelbarrow carts if you remember those and\nWe willed it up to the uh we were out to transform\nActually and Harrison city and we we all up to the register and there was a sign that the register and folks there is a point to stay with me here are the sign at the register said you have to pay taxes on your pumpkins\nUnless you tell us your going to eat your pumpkins I'm Serious about this and it said the white pumpkins are inevitable so you have to pay tax on them so the point was is if you say I'm going to eat the pumpkin you don't pay tax on the punk\nIf you don't say you're going to eat it then it's taxable\nThe interesting thing is is that makes me think about retirement because there are some things that you get to pick when you pay taxes you get to make the choice just like I had the choice to say you know what we're going to carve this pumpkin or to make a Jack o lantern and we're going to take those things are going to eat the seat so we will be part of the park and\nSo by telling now they say seven percent on my pumpkin Its Food and I told the truth because we will lead to save my wife will make tried to make a pie of some of the filling but the like in the store a year to understand that there's some things are certain investments are certain decisions you can make where you have to tell\nYour plan or should be telling you whether or not you're going to eat the pumpkin you know so whether or not when what choices you have unlimited or controlling your taxation is the same decision I had when the kids and I were up there making that decision at the pumpkin patch and\nRemember that you know remember that you have that freedom but again advisors a lotta times focused on selling and selling and we need to step back and we need to focus on reducing taxes and building income plans and building retirement plans and because we only do retirement this energy group that's what we think about so let us help you decide\nUh when you'll pay taxes by structuring your plan properly and making sure that taxes are integrated into your retired\nWelcome aboard or M world traveling long stretches back with all of your today coast to coast for the border into Canada this year's America's number one from a radio show your home for everything and anything in the

highest rated votes or something yeah it's I don't either anyway go vote folks are um world travel dot com\nRudy uh where where do you want to start with travelers\n[noise] well um I have some advice or Disneyland sniff to step aside because plans are underway to build a theme park near Columbus ohio not far from Cincinnati\nOr it's going to be four times the size of the Disney park in Southern California I mean I Can't comprehend that typical planet a wasted so Ohio planet wages Ohio about two billion dollars and the parks president says it's located in Ohio because it's the quote unquote center of the universe\nNow listen I was born in Cleveland it's been a lot on there but I graduated from Ohio University but even I Would be hard to argue the Columbus Columbus is the center of Ohio will give you that\nBut I'm not sure Ohio is the center of the world let alone the universe anybody ground as broke as this week parts of the park it'd be open as early as a year from now four times the size of December\nI maintain imagine the number is ... ... land in a\nWhile I ran out here in the New York area I think I think it was next year it might be early twenty twenty I have to verify that but they're building a huge lego land about sixty miles north of New York city in Goshen New York which is an area that I was raised in a\nSo that's comes ... moving into the northern part of the country interesting uses the warm weather parts of\nThe middle of course ... should know isn't that centered universe rubber well know Columbus ohio and I just explained that route underside somebody ever asked the question where is the center of the universe Columbus ohio okay Dr ... shocked astronomers are [laughter]\nI married my right\nWell China has opened the world's longest see crossing bridge linking Hong Kong to the mainland that happened this week dollar Bridget chip ten years to build of course it came in with many delays and over budget so we had somebody on a few weeks ago about that\nThat that will be and with that bridges and tunnels and if you have that you're kind of went across this it will be like ... yeah you're on your way and there's actually a tunnel component here that bridge will cut travel time across the ... river delta\nFrom several hours to thirty minutes thirty ... thirty four miles long and six lane crossing in one section of the crossing does diving underwater into a ... mile tunnel ... cargo\nBritish Channel or it down by Virginia Beach and the Chesapeake Bay bridge yeah probably so he says he wants more now I'm All right well that's\nIt is a beautiful I've seen it being built flying in looking down on it but it is so long I mean you can ... about forty five minutes aren't around yeah\nWell maybe you must go get over there with his um\nUh what what do we have that's coming that out too but he's built into personal to rather just she read over there were no ... are one other thing I Know we've talked about on occasion on the show is how the travel industry is engaged in the cause to eliminate single use plastic and actually Brett told them and the trauma corporation and his tread right foundation their leader actually\nAh in this movement this week Delta Airlines joined a mission to eliminate single use plastic such histories rappers utensils straws on board the aircraft as well as in all of their delta sky clubs\nAnd what struck me was purportedly their efforts are expected to eliminate nearly three hundred thousand pounds in plastic waste annually and ... you know that's tough to get around that number right 'cause what does it mean well to give you a visual it uh it translates into the weight of more than two bowling seven fifty seven aircraft\n[noise] wow well good for delta so they're stepping up on that I don't know the American public\nI think that I Do actually ... air is to end Cleveland Cincinnati and there it goes to blowing up the center at the university here in St Louis there I think I took carrier WOW air announced this week it's any service from its Reykjavik had to Cleveland\nCincinnati in St Louis so far our listeners in those cities if Iceland is on your destination list you

S. list that huge ... why\nIt's absolutely why we have made\nStarted up so much in our downtown core riverfront\nTwenty blocks north up to our over the right area but he really create for five in the sense of place in the restaurant or document or would like to call them are set up in these really great faith [noise]\nTalk architecture all over it creates an experience that you know when you come into that feels like a major metropolitan don't feel like you're in the mid west are skeptical when work every day or we just have to clean up at the gym here how about a month ago and created a\nLot of native with one of the only thing I thought out all year so far and it's certainly just fall and feeling really to elect to gauge how\nA lot going on there sure is so ... we'll switch gears just a bit for the business travelers in our audience Cincinnati and Delta Airlines you know there are certainly synonymous and and well like the city is also a draw for some of the top design shops in the country you're also home to major corporations like Proctor and gamble Macy's kroger's and you have the pro sports teams like the rest of the bangles\nSo how influential are all these companies and teams in raising the profile of Cincinnati was travelers\nWell you know you mentioned are now up to you know cracking down three professional ...\nWe're talking major league soccer correct right All right\nDo you know we we just got that doesn't make you know all these things have to work together from the ... the\n... really grow read the Bible and when we look at what we have all these are very big way to really grow the by but it's also a huge opportunity for spring\nThem aboard you're listening to our two of the nation stopped traveling this and we'll just top travel radio shows use me Robert Mary Karen are glad to have your joining us today it's just after eleven am eastern time on Saturday and this final week of October\nRobert very I Know we've got an email segment coming up this hour but here's something not to do\nThe next time any of his travel and at night is a man of the name of the manager at the Delano Delano South Beach hotel in Miami she landed Miami grabbed your bag from luggage carousel was shocked to open it later defined it filled with airline equipment like work boots and safety best empowered strips\nSo if you read right on Twitter and advise the world that never fly American Airlines is the contents of her luggage had been replaced by airline paraphernalia and all American did when she called the complained about it was asking to fill out a form well\nTurns out ... to grab the wrong suitcase you taking the one filled with their mind to it but it wasn't her ... Americanized following tweet so it's good news we can all fly American again\nClearly nothing like John took her now is a really\nGood example is getting on social media in my opinion way too fast because her tweets were really strong die and fly the airline here's why and a thousand dollars worth of season airs are gone well if I had a thousand dollars even airs they'd be in my carry on when I checked\nOut by the way I Would say that's a lesson to Delano great hotel down there on South Beach stole white folks have ever been there furniture drapes walls everything but\nI did not address that they are real happy to have her name associated with is a shame multiple nasty tweets yeah exactly so far away from this point\nWe're about we're only actually since it's been any there were two only halfway through today's trauma get together and said how Halloween is on Wednesday as we begin this hour with a broadcast we have a guest who's going to help us determine what is the popular can be across the country so that should be fun to read the dollar industry so\nUh we'll check that out awesome airlifted a rundown we're gonna get raped ...\nIraq coming up and just a few minutes for a

something sweet that's special to that particular area of the nation\nTom Johnson is with candy store dot com so clearly is a great job and he's joining us right now to share the popular candy for Halloween around the U.S Tom I Am I right but you have a great job I'm guessing you either have a ton of friends who get the candy with you or maybe no friends as they're all envious\n[laughter] uh

why don't we start with what's America's favorite Halloween candy on the west coast and maybe a few from the southwest and the mountain states\nOkay um so in the west coast it there's not really sort of a west coast consensus it's um it's it's a little bit divided state by state Skittles or the big one in California\nUm and that's because it's the most populous state out there I'm In north to Oregon and you could be the cubs Washington the salt water asked me a candy corn has done well in Idaho in Nevada or a trend that's been a little bit controversial a country\nOr even in New Mexico there's the candy corn is the number one can\nSelf interested um why why's that controversial to say\nOh you wouldn't believe people either really love her a candy corn ... um we didn't we did a lot of the list who did a survey where the forty thousand people on what what Halloween candy they don't like\nAnd candy corn was number two on that list of the candidate they don't like so it's a real lover a thing and um for example Michigan oh this is the third yang wrote them up and in Michigan for all three years that the top ... has been candy corn and we\nGet so much pushback from from reporters there who are customers there we get emails and tweets and\nUm they well who do who are really not happy\nRudy I Know where you know ... what's the big thing really where you are in Minnesota apparently\nTootsie Rolls a poll very well here but what else is popular for Halloween I mean for for people who are traveling on the upper or lower Midwest I live in Minnesota by the way

one that's kind of a newly come up in the rankings that getting ... um we sort of associated with a with a younger demographic um I don't have the data to back that up um but just anecdotally it seems like people from sort of the older generations can understand why people would like\nSomalia going sour patch kids and people from the younger generation I'm just love\nIt up to like as soon as I Know Texas is big with races All right so Mary and I are based on the New York area so um what do you what are you thinking of the eastern seaboard a U.S give us one or two areas from northeast to se that really stuck out here\nWell what sticks out in the northeast itself patch kid there was another one candy in New York, Maine and Massachusetts\nYeah our our youngest son likes them I Would say um I guess I don't really understand about the southeast are what are you seeing there\nThe southeast Skittles does really well so it was a the number two in Florida last year and then the one in Florida and that's a big state or any number one in South Carolina a and just generally in the south you see more sort of sugary sweet candy unless chocolate\nEmail ... well I'm going to just literally no we

thousand dollars a night yikes night one night right\nWell they're somebody will stuck it in high end with me I Would have All right I'm\nGoing to go on a completely different direction and talk about a novice and rental car dealers right now every time you rent with eight is during the month of October which is obviously ending soon I end this week if you rent with Davidson you use the Susan G common discount code ten percent of the base rate will be donated to the ... foundation for breast cancer\nAnd in conjunction with that there's a twenty five percent savings going on a space race right now with Amos and they also had if you're a travels you remember they have a special deal for you or if it does there in a partnership with traveled to\nAnd anyway\nShopping for an SUV and I are very rarely shop for cars because for much of my the last decades I have been driving cars of advertisers which\nEventually they they sold their businesses in any way ... whatever it is it um now as we're having a new experience to having had in a while ago even car dealers and I don't want to give card the worst the business I Want to do with by Internet or want to know what to do with you know with car dealers\nLet me give them the business but it was it was really fascinating everybody was nice I mean all the sales people were mice it's not an issue there were almost all young men with whom I took test drugs I think in every instance five I think for four or five the five young men\nBut the thing that got my wife and me was any question I mean ... any question that I asked was clear they didn't have an answer and they said with no embarrassment I'll look it up oh let me let me this look that up\nSo uh as I said at the end I think that if this is all representative and it may not be like fully acknowledge that but if it is it all representative\nThere were two things that immediately strike me and one is that the idea that you should know as much as possible even about a product you're selling has has not registered\nBecause hey I could look it up why why do I have to know if that SUV can come in all wheel drive why would I have to know the length of the of that SUV versus the other one it's like oh I could always look it up on the other is in general\nKnowledge may not be valued\nWhy do you need to know anything if you could just pull out a little smartphones from your pocket and find out all you need to know\n\nThis is now if you feel that my general generalization is not valid or you do I'm very curious\nTo hear from you because it made a real impact on us I Am trusting of the lines are working one ape Prager seven seven six eight seven seven to for three triple seven six\n\nThat was a ... that was one\nAspect of the experience that hit me there was another one too which is even deeper\nAnd that is that the there was there seemed to be an absence of passion I\nAgain I remember from years ago when I when I last really went looking for cars with dealers the the the sales\nFolks were passionate about cars that's why they were in that profession\nI didn't have that sense from any of these uh sales people get older young\nI didn't have any sense of that\nBut they were passionate about cars that was it was they might as well have been working at a shoe store this is not a negative these were very nice people ... ... ... not a character challenge it's just the statement of a change that\nYou know if you haven't seen anybody in ... in a war you ever seen a young person or time wow boy did you grow up you really grown\nBecause you haven't seen them see you see if you haven't seen something of a long time you can see a change so this was a change that we saw a gentleman who you are just so many folks ask a technical question our our launch working is what is the story showing that you do\nOkay All right anyway uh\nWe'll find out oh they're not working yeah oh I'm Sorry folks I hate giving you wrong information I was given the information\nThat all the lungs are up about okay these are unfortunate things that I must admit annoying me but you gotta live with it and you gotta live with it and that's the way it works\nWas it was in it and and then I translated that into as well they they didn't seem ... in in young people and I'm specifically addressing men whether they they're ambitious or no\nAnd I wonder too if in this generation we have in some ways it created a less ambitious young male ... theories on that but let me go now to\nMy just my looking forward to talking to Jones in Iraq\nSenior editor of the streams
