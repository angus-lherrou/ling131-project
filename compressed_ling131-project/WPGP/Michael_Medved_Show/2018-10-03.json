anyway a few years ago I'm fifty three now but if you're like oh I was the manager in charge of hiring\nWill get a response on that the new attack which is really an old attack about president\nTrump dodging taxes and he isn't really a self made billionaire and there is it feels like about a two thousand page report seems to be very well research in the New York times so\nWhat is the relevance of this right now\nThat's a obviously an attempt to shield the election in the direction of Democrats will be speaking with Stephen Moore a advisor to President Trump and the Trump campaign about that about the progress on trade\nWhere there's been great progress in the markets loves it we've had this week the markets have just been on fire sky rocketing\nUm why is that happening\nWe'll talk with us even more about that will also be speaking with Juan Williams on Fox News his new book about President Trump and the black community it's not a positive book toward President Trump\nBut the question for Juan Williams will be what about the evidence and there's lots of it that there is at least in increasing open mindedness to the Republican message from African Americans we will get to that as well on the ... show but first\nI just wanted to give you a little bit of perspective is as people probably recognize I was off for the first two days of this week because the conclusion of our Jewish holiday season\nAnd actually I Want to thank\nMark Davis for again doing such an outstanding job and are helping to carry the ball on this show while we were completing what is a a basically it's almost a month long um one holiday after another and they're all important holidays and they're all meaningful\nThis one was particularly meaningful to me not just because our daughter was here from New York um and and not just because there was a great time to get together with family and and big extended family and began things but also because on this whole Kavanaugh matter\nI I was able to see a little bit of perspective let me just tell you something had happened which I don't think I Will ever forget I mean normally I go to services I go to synagogue\nAnd a A N normally I talked to my friends I I was approached by a little kid and when I say a little kid and ten eleven years old\nAnd um [noise] it ... ... he asked that I'm not even sure we watch it you know I was was it kind of regime a hundred people there and anyway so the kid comes up to me\nAnd he says I I heard somebody say here that that Brett Kavanaugh through ice at somebody a Thirty Years' ago\nWhite minds that a big deal and I had not yet\nSeen the story about the alleged a bar fight at one thirty in the morning when Brett Kavanaugh was a sophomore I Believe at Yale\nAnd then I later in the horrors of ice throwing\nAnd somehow it this is now reaching ... kids in America I mean under age kids this is where our politics is\nA is that just think about think about it think about it I mean not that it's okay to throw Weiss or not\nThat it's okay to be under age in a bar fight and cetera et cetera no one uh was damaged or charged or arrested in this a bar if they were arrested they weren't charge\n'em okay\nThis whole idea where our politics is right now I really do believe those political consultants and girls in campaign people who are saying that right now the Kavanaugh thing as powerfully helping Republicans\nAnd I believe for one very simple reason if you like everything we've gone through with Kevin on four in the back in the forest and the punching the pushing and\nThe nastiness and then you're going to vote for Democrats because I'm\nA Kavanaugh was not arrested okay let let me make that clear there was a police report about breaking up a bar fight and there was an allegation that he threw whites\nAnd a ... again I think it's more relevant to the Democrats want to throw ice out they want to throw out ice they want to get rid of the immigration and Customs Enforcement I mean it was anything is more relevant\nThan the idea that Brett Kavanaugh and money was at Yale I'm I\nWas a member of a hard drinking fraternity ... the whole idea that this is significant and this is worthy of our attention this is where our politics is right now if you want more of the politics of personal destruction if you want more\nOf let's go over every single detail of people's pass to try to smear them and destroy them if you want more of this feeling of constant combat then sure you want the Democrats to take over the house because that's what you'll get you'll get impeachment you'll get in fact a Gerald nab blur\nThe radical from Manhattan and he is he's one of the most left wing members of Congress\nWould become the new chairman of the house Judiciary Committee and he's already talked about impeaching justice Kavanaugh after he is confirmed\nIf you think that's where politics should go then first of all tell me why\nSecondly at your own little sure to vote Democrat anyway if you do want to change if you are in politics that is a\nLittle bit more civil a little bit more respectful a little bit more about results rather than just destroying the enemy\nAnd results for the American people more days where the stock market is is a more days where people are working where people get raises\nI mean across the board it's happening now and ah and meanwhile what what's the focus the focus\nIs on on President Trump not mocking but daring to question up Christine Blasey Ford\nAnd he did it at a rally last night and President Trump is on button and rallies and they'll just wasn't a speech but first of all people say well he ... he didn't imitate her he referred accurately to some of her testimony here was the president of the United states and what he had to say\nI have one right [noise]\nWell you think it was I was wondering\nHow did you get home I don't remember how did you get there don't remember where is the place I don't remember how many years I don't want I don't\nKnow [noise] what\nWas it and I don't know\n[noise] I'm Wondering what I don't know what I Want [noise]\n\nAnd I'm at a map\nOkay um [noise] look\nAt ... is it somehow out of bounds probably it would be better if the president do didn't do it but is it appropriate to question her testimony or you can only question\nJudge Kavanaugh one eight hundred\nNine five five Seventeen Seventy six our phone number the I'm Sarah Sanders was asked about that today by John Roberts on Fox this is the White House press briefing about President Trump's comments about Christine Blasey Ford and here is the presidential press secretary Sarah Sanders\nWhy does the president said was useless loses he's the\nPresident was stating the facts I frankly facts that were included in special prosecutor Rachel Mitchell's report he was stating facts that were given during Dr forts testimony innocent it has to make a decision based on those facts\nAnd whether or not they see judge Kavanaugh to be qualified\nTo hold a position on the Supreme Court every single word judge Kavanaugh has said it's been picked apart every single word second my second his testimony has been picked apart yet if anybody says anything about the accusations that have been thrown against them it's totally off limits an outrageous this entire\nProcess has been a disgrace and the only reason that it's been that way is because Senate Democrats didn't do this the way that it should have been done and they circumvented the entire system and frankly they undermine in our entire judicial branch by the way that they've acted in inappropriate and this is which they conducted themselves\nOkay I I Believe it is with that in mind that\nCertainly the Republican base people who voted and put President Trump in the White House\nThat bases getting engaged and that's a good thing there's other reasons for having to do with the economy will speak with Stephen Moore are coming up about the future of the economy and its political impact\nI don't know why they did it right now I was on CNN last night commenting on the show I I didn't I didn't make it through the ... how many more it was thirty thousand a it was it ... I read a lot of it I didn't\nMake it through the whole thing I had a couple impressions I made this point on CNN last night and I'm ... and by the way they really beat me up on the first point I made was wait a minute this was like you know turning on the TV and seeing you know it was a hundred times you know friends episode rerun you know that you've already seen twenty times\nHow many times with the New York times run the story I I ... I worked on the campaign they must run three or four stories about Trump cheating on his taxes\nAnd you know then they went last year another running this one and there's not much different in this story than the one they've run multiple times so it's just like you know just by an old copy the newspaper because at the end of this movie before the second point I made us look there are alleging kept fraud tax there is a difference a\nMichael between tax avoidance which any good businessman them any good you know head of household will do you want to minimize the taxes you pay right I mean I don't know about you Michael I Try to pay the least amount of actually after you got the most I'm Out\nThere was a shock backs a boy and tax evasion and they are they are accusing Trump of tax fraud went a lot of these\nLike I'm not an expert on tax policy but it looks like a lot of these things were just legal ways of of minimizing your tax burden and is there any American in the last fifty years has been funded by the Iraq War than Donald Trump\nOkay but here's the question why won't the release his tax information he he's been very resistant to them I guess about this article is it's an attempt to try to force him\nTo make some disclosures about or his taxes and if if he doesn't that'll be a reason there are campaigning for Democrats the Democrats will force out the tax returns what do you think\nYeah once again you're all one hundred percent uh correct that's exactly what this is about and that's what you know the CNN uh Chris Cuomo asked me about last night as well why won't Trump\nA release of tax reform I advise Trump among many other people during the campaign do not do not really sure ... because if you think this report which was Thirteen they aided Thirteen thousand words they don't even have\nYou know a lot of the tax documents that the man who has you know warehouses full of ... tax document\nThrough all the businesses he's running through the ... and all but I mean I I just think it would be a Pandora's box\nOkay uh and and don't file your taxes in a Pandora's box Stephen Moore\nWho is a distinguished visiting fellow in the project for economic

believe that a lot of what people have talked about as the enthusiasm gap\nEvent that is changing because I just know this from conversations with people and the emails and tweets and the letters that we're getting\nA people on the Republican side who were either resigned or lethargic a lot of people said oh what do we have to worry about the economy's doing so well well right now there's a very

with very strong Republican support in Nineteen sixty four changed America and changed life or your family how\nWell first of all the book is structured in terms of the civil rights act or fix before

has this progress made in this country\nPresident Trump has invited to the White House no okay would you go if he did no\nSee I don't get that I just in the end of the same thing with with some of the um in other words like you I I Want President Trump I Want Republicans\nGenerally to uh be a more broad based party not just to be the party of older white guys are to be a party that reaches out to everybody because otherwise we have no future\nAnd uh so why why is the president invited you would you not go to the White House\nWhere I think he's insulting condescending and and so lacking in any sensitivity or knowledge of how American history you know central to American history has the story of black history\nSo when he says things like calling a black woman Omarosa a dog or calling another black woman a congresswoman Maxine Waters who is a tremendous Trump critic but he says extraordinarily low IQ\nWhen he engages in politically or you know advantageous tactics I guess with his base like saying the first black president wasn't born in this country and then he uses that\nTo elevate his profile I think this man is just about the biting the country about beating people racial hate and I'm not going to be in his company\nOkay [noise] ... when\nYou say that ... ... your your nose and he's going to be you don't expect that he is going to be removed from office do you\nI don't know I mean I don't know what Mueller has in terms of the Mueller probe if that's what you're talking to\nYou know I'm I'm just talking generally is going to be president for another two plus years two years three months\nAnd I'm OK during that time period and and this is\nA part of the the challenge to ask for your book and let me back up for a moment because a lot of people may not know but one you wrote a courageous book the guts you lots and lots of attacks on the left it was a book called enough subtitle is the phony leaders\nDead end movements and culture of failure that are undermining black America\nAnd what we can do about correct and one of the things you talked about was having um black leadership to talk more about achievement and a lot less of a constant sense of grievance\nAren't aren't aren't you coming into that trap that that you yourself described in your book enough\nNo in fact I Wish that the president President Trump would celebrate the idea of black achievement and that society\nInstead of you know always talking about black people in the way he says oh you know they live in circumstances worse than Afghanistan their neighborhoods filled with violence\nAnd poverty and joblessness and bad schools I'm thinking wait a second that's your description of black American twenty Eighteen I mean right now Michael forty percent of black Americans on between thirty five and a hundred thousand dollars an additional twelve percent between a hundred and two hundred thousand dollars\nSo you can see a majority of black America is either in the middle class or beyond this is one of the prime achievements of the civil rights era in addition I say obviously the growth of black political voice in power as part of American society so these are tremendous achievement\nSo I'm all about looking at how people who were faced with such disadvantage in this society slavery legal segregation ongoing racial bias and all the rest nonetheless\nHave thought out the American dream and have kept it alive and and want to fix the ... you know like the Jefferson slogan they want to move on up\nRight absolutely good stuff but this president instead he focuses on the twenty percent\nWho who are in poverty disproportionately young people and kids often times because of broken families on the like and he makes set out to be the entirety of the black caught like they're all gonna mug you are going to take your job or they're going to ruin your schools I think it is just so deceitful and dangerous because again it is racially divisive\nOkay I again I I ... some of the same uh comments by President Trump and gestures by President Trump I've been\nHighly critical of on this radio show a because I'm not one of those people who believe that President Trump can do nothing right or nothing I'm ... but I also I'm a believer\nNot one of those people things President Trump can do nothing wrong and I'm not one of those people and things that can do nothing right and he must be doing something right because we've covered on the air before\nThere are a bunch of polls and it's not just Rasmussen there six major polls that show that his approval rating in the black community has been going up\nAnd largely that's because we do have a black unemployment rate that is the lowest ever measured that people have been making the kind continuing the kind of economic progress that you're talking about right\nFirst of all the polls that you're talking about is a poll that by its own admission have too few black people polled so what you get a a distortion the reality is with and I find that this is so troubling about\nA two thirds of Americans think race relations or worst today under President Trump than they've been in the past you also get higher levels are getting more than fifty percent disapproving of how Trump handles race relations\nAnd the most difficult one for me to accept and I think this may surprise you Michael is it forty nine percent of Americans said Trump is a racist and the reason that bothers me is I\nThink it just shuts down at a station if you say something fell flat we've than people think oh I'm a Trump supporter or I'm not but\nI don't want that I really want people to think\nAbout how this country is becoming more diverse\nYou're getting greater sense of global economic and cultural mixing and how do we deal with that when you have a president who's\nSo I think the vice if\nOn racial issues immigration okay so let's let's approach that approach how other leaders can change and how the president can change to deal with this more effectively I'm what the hell do you have to lose that's the title of the new book by Juan Williams' movie right back\nI think it's quite similar in terms of you know somebody leveling a charge against the nominee and the comics case it was on the hill and\nYou know it was very slow to come out but then the committee the Senate Judiciary committee looked at it privately they mess that she wasn't put her name to it and then it got leaked and then he came out so it's very similar because look at professor Ford she sent a letter to a congressman ash too many makes its way to Dianne Feinstein\nA and then her name is Lee or she does the interview with the Washington Post ... ... ... things similar to me is a level that charge I don't think that anybody that\nUh you're Clarence Thomas talk on a better\nYeah but as a one there's a difference that test and the other direction the charges against Clarence Thomas had to do when he was head of the equal Employment Opportunity commission he was a government official and he was already yellow graduate the charges the core charges against Brett Kavanaugh has to do with when he was Seventeen years old\nYeah but I think that the larger issue here is ... character for someone who's going to be on the highest court in the land\nAnd that's where I think he's open themselves to his critics and I wish you hadn't done it because they you know the whole presentation of himself at the urging of choir boy he used to go to a book is the was and then all of the sprints like this guy was a big grin and he loved the parties don't count\nOkay waist level if you were a U.S senator and who knows you maybe someday I'm not really my editor for\nFolks that you can leave Washington DC becomes a fifty first date which probably won't happen ... ... one um would you vote for ... confirmation\nNo not at this point\nAnd the main reason would be because the way he presented himself as the hearing\nYeah I think especially last week when he went off he was making all sorts of suggestions or got Clinton conspiracy theory again and the Democrats or I was thinking wait\nA minute you're ... you're trying to be a judge on the Supreme Court you're just displaying a tremendous\nLack with a permanent or\nDon't you think given given the amount of money that was spent by George Soros and other than it's

pretty effectively when you read this memo\nIn any of that here was a Sarah Sanders and give them a pasta or about that to President Trump's comments\nSince there's something wrong with the president of the United states mugging somebody who's your shoes are sort of\nSeemed to me that he was stating facts that Dr Ford herself a laid out in her testimony once again I every single word that judge Kavanaugh has said has been looked at exam and picked apart by most of viewing this route but not no one is looking at\nAh whether or not the accusations made her corroborated whether or not there's evidence to support them\nReligiously judge shows is that the movies\nI think both Dr Ford in judge Kavanaugh a or victims at the hands of the Democrats I think it is absolutely disgraceful\nWhat they've done and exploited this process they exploited Dr Ford there exploiting all of the women that have come out to make any type of accusation this isn't the process that should've been done and certainly everybody deserves to be hurt but that includes judge Kavanaugh's and that should be part of this process and the facts\nHave to be looked at and I think you have to look at the prosecutors

directly to David in Scottsdale, Arizona David you're on the Michael ...\nMichael how are you doing doing well I have a question for you yeah so\nThey do it's covering a gets confirmed okay and what you should uh hopefully is there any kind of a lawsuit like not frivolous lawsuit I kind of a lawsuit keep ... you know impose on the food on the proceedings if it turns out it's just a false allegation\nAnd it accuses him of tax fraud and lots of other stuff um but the headline tells me something as suspect tax schemes\nUh it doesn't say illegal tax game so I don't know I didn't read the story yet and I uh so what what they actually think they have on them I don't know but I think if it would have been illegal they would have used that word is set of suspect\nBut it does accused him of tax fraud other things and I mean it's Fifteen pages so they got to have a lot of stuff in there but Trump has already had his lawyer Charles Harder tell the times that they should be expecting a libel suit now\nSuing a a a media outlet for libel is a tough thing to do most of the times at least as far as I seem to understand\nThere are there are thrown out just because it's the only the doesn't get the trial because the judges want to hear about it no it just gets thrown out\nAnd you're not going to win it but this guy Charles Harder tells the times they should be expecting one and he's the guy who won a few million dollars and an apology from the New York daily news because of a bogus story about millennia Trump they wrote that she the modeling agency\nThat she worked for was also an escort service\nMilan dated like that they sued and they won in the New York daily news had to apologize so you can win them that they are tough the really hard to win but here's the thing nobody who voted for Trump is going to care nobody and unless there's some serious crime I don't care really if Donald said millions in taxes by using\nEvery possible loophole that's out there good for him\nBecause everybody pays too much in taxes and I don't think how much money any citizen has should really be any of the government's business the income tax was and is a bad idea as far as I'm concerned that that's the topic for another show I'm sure maybe we'll do it on April fifteenth but the the income tax is not one of my favorite things\nAre so I uh but but the thing about how much money that he be may have not paid\nIf if someone I I don't care if you make four hundred million dollars a day nobody will ever convince me that the government deserves half of that half of what you weren't if you make four hundred dollars a day or forty dollars a day\nIs just wrong if the government thinks that isn't titled to take what it took you four hours to make and you're eight hour day so I don't care how much you made if or how much he didn't pay\nOr and or if it's illegal or a little bit illegal I Hope it's a hope he's covered enough but he doesn't get caught and I'd say that about anybody like you know I don't know maybe the Kennedys or somebody like that it might have I don't know cheated on their taxes little but who knows but anyways I said that's the topic for another show and speaking of attorneys\nLet's pause for a word from our sponsor\nHave you slip and falling for accidentally been gang rape story then sexually assaulted\nEven if you didn't really you may be

pretty good chance that's exactly what it would sound like but that was a fake that was not one of our sponsors meanwhile the world is waiting for the FBI's report on Brett Kavanaugh nothing yet so we still don't know if he actually did throw I said a guy in a bar back in Nineteen eighty three\nComing up after a break we're going to talk about a president of the United states who did something in a bar a little bit more serious than throwing ice\nBut anyway this may be backfiring on the Democrats according to rest must than most people think that the confirmation process has been a national disgrace that's what Kevin on the uh called fifty six percent believe that that's a uh\nLikely voters ... agree with what Kavanaugh said and he's the one who did called a disgrace thirty percent disagree Seventy seven percent of Republicans in fifty one percent of independents agree with him on that there's a number I thought was interesting forty percent of Democrats believe that it's a national disgrace no I don't know\nWhy maybe they maybe they're a reason for just a considering it a national disgrace as different from Republicans region but forty percent think it's a a national disgrace which means I I'd say like a hundred and four percent of the people in the country just wanted to go away\nBut the forty percent of Democrats agreeing that it's a disgrace doesn't seem like it would be a very good thing for them good sign for them and then there's Chelsea Clinton\nWhy anybody thinks America needs to hear her opinion on anything I don't know but CBS morning news thought it would be a good idea to have her on the show and here's a little sample\nI just thought oh my gosh we learned so much larger and your mind and then ... at least in line yeah like I don't think I heard of a loner him tell he was nominated a week ago\nThe pool or traveling with how to make it a little harder for me wise and I think the principle of and judicial review voting for an apartment kept the really important so if he hadn't gone after President Bush\nOr President Reagan family I feel the same way like I don't think of that or how the um\nThe dynamic on the Supreme Court are very candidly any court while you're on said their performance that behavior was quite out of bounds\nAnd clearly she had an issue with issues with it do you think that he should be confirmed to the Supreme Court a gallon for examination from the beginning because I don't\nAgree with his dance and placing ad for a minute late lie opposition to handle it and ... and that I now and even more of a poke in life feeling\nBecause of how political forgotten I'm Wondering what your response is our phone Dr foreign supplied after she get Jeff fat\nShe reached out to her local Congress land had that is her say they just want it to be and not enough federal won that count as like the way she has now and then we see that result what what is your response to those who might say you know what I was telling her that I don't think that while\nI was ... understand that and I hope you're still willing to raise your hand raise your voice and if we need more people engaged in political science at every level not for a while I completely out of that could have a chilling effect I put it that\nWell Chelsea uh the Chelsea they they you know they talked to her for three and a half minutes about Kavanaugh and you know Dr Ford and everything is involved their sexual assault believing accusers guess whose name never came up\nBill Clinton's her dad they somehow they just kind of forgot to bring that up\nAnd that probably would have made Chelsea feel a little bit uncomfortable but that's exactly why she and really anybody who voted for her mother her mom as they referred to her in the interview should never express that opinion about sexual assault victims and how they should be treated ever should they ever talk about it\nBut anyway to make sure you stick around for the second half hour or we're not going to talk about Kavanaugh at all and it shouldn't be I think you're going to like it I have the executive producer\nOf a movie that's coming out next week is called God's
