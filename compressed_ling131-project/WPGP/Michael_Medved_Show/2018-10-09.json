going\nOn behind the Haley resignation which was announced today she is in a resigning immediately she's going to stay on the un\nA for her since I I Know I'm again I'm not that some implying that there are any sins on the part of Nikki Haley as she has been a a terrific UN ambassador in fact one of the best ever\nAnd um we will see what comes next with her and what her resignation is really all about ... who is likely to replace her at the United nations we'll also talk about a new poll which shows what seems to me to be a contradiction to CNN poll\nAnd it shows that support for President Trump is going up and going up fairly dramatically at the same time support from Brett Kavanaugh's going down\nSo what's the story there we will get to that and also to the arrest of a a teacher\nFor something he tweeted and it's something that is very very macho see as woke or he is clearly on the left and he also is just lost his job\nWas pretty possibly have said that would cause

judge Kavanaugh was already sworn in as justice Kavanaugh on Saturday Night so he's been an official member of the Supreme Court for a while\nBut President Trump I think very rightly wanted to stage a formal swearing in and it was a wonderful occasion\nHe had a judge Kavanaugh's family their head all the justices the spring part with their Ruth Bader Ginsburg was\nThere dancing and celebrating and wasting a few Bruce ...\nUh no that's not true that part but she was there and uh that's\nThat's appropriate and that's important and I think the judge Kavanaugh justice Kavanaugh spoke\nVery well and President Trump a President Trump did not speak outrageously or as badly as a liberal media are\nTrying to suggest and we'll get to that place of where you can tell you why but first off on this issue of civility which remains a very very big and divisive issue in the country there was a contribution to civility from a contributor over at MSNBC and this is\nVery much appreciate does it puts the situation in such good focus of this is a big contribution from Eli missed all\nThe thing about making a deal with the devil\nBacks up his bargain alright the devil does not Trump has delivered for these people on the things that they care about most the of delivered racism for these people feel the liver massage any for these people and now he's delivered the Supreme Court for these people which is something that they've been trying to get for a generation we're going to see if\nIf this way but they now have control over all three branches of government we're going to see if this rain

racism and massage any\nAnd we're as the sun Janine American Life right now is it a the idea that there is a lack of civility on the right how is it civil to suggest that a President Trump\nIs making a deal with President Trump is a deal with the devil or that the people to whom he has delivered massage any and racism and corruption and horror and misery and and just general awfulness\nAre actually diabolical one eight hundred nine five five Seventeen\nSeventy six and then there's this um Tom ... who was invested\nI think it's upwards of twenty million so far I think it's way above twenty million might be upwards of fifty million so far he spent on ads pushing the impeachment of\nDonald Trump he spoke out on who to blame for everything that is going wrong in America here's Tom Sawyer\nA group of very rich very entitled white men wanted to tell the rest of the country we are going to have our way and if you don't like it that is too darn that was\nFar as I'm concerned the only thing everybody else can do now the the rest of America to go to the bulls eye November Six Flags pill those rich entitled white men\nThat we exist and democracy exist\nOkay just a question um is Tom Schneier a man and so yeah he is I think he currently identifies as a male even assist gender me\nShe white yeah he's white is the rich yeah is he in titled yeah so I I don't understand this is this is all\nThe fault of rich entitled white men\nAnd with this kind of thing going on on the left basically suggesting that its rich entitled white men who are controlling things against the public interest\nOr does it does seem a little bit bizarre for the defeated presidential candidate Hillary Clinton to say that what we need now is\nA new civility but there's only one way to achieve civility\nYou know what it is here's what she has a say on CNN\nCannot be civil with a political party that wants to destroy what you stand for what you care about that's why I Believe if we are fortunate enough\nTo win back the house and or the Senate\nThat ... can start again but until then the only thing that the Republicans seem to\nRecognize and respect is strength and you heard how the Republican members led by Mitch McConnell\nReally demeaned the confirmation process\nDemeans the confirmation process where they the ones who brought up a drinking games in high school\nWhere they are the ones who are brought up obsessively looking at a high school yearbook and even at general references in the high school yearbook\nHow is it that Republicans demeaned the confirmation process and and what about this notion that the only way that we can restore civility is um\nIs somehow to ah have the Democrats back in control heaven forbid one eight hundred nine five five Seventeen Seventy six she also in the same interview Hillary said what was done last night and the White House was a political rally\nIt further undermine the image integrity the court and that troubles me greatly it saddens me because our judicial system has been viewed as one of the main pillars of our constitutional government\nUm okay\nIt was she watching what wishy washy me she was watching the Saturday Night live cold open\nWhich showed people celebrating an ... locker room if you actually watch and we should posted on our website Jeremy if you actually watch the ceremony with President Trump and justice Kavanaugh and Justice Kennedy very much in evidence the mentor of justice Kavanaugh who sworn and again\nWhy was that unsuitable I I honestly a\nJump was asked about this briefly and about Hillary saying that the swearing in ceremony was no good it was a political rally it was inappropriate here's the president\nBush responses over what\nI guess that's where she lost she doesn't get it [noise] she never did I knew that a long time ago\nHillary never got it [noise] that's why she lost\nAnd and by the way when you talk about political event [noise]\nWas uh what judge Kavanaugh said political about wanting to be a justice who was there\nHe said all nine of us just as the Supreme Court review of the constitution and yes that includes Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan

as a strong case as you can make and none none of what she said can you argue it it's all the truth and yes she was part of it\nBut all of this did happen under President Donald Trump\nAnd this is one of the reasons I suppose that on the CNN poll despite the fact that there has been so much hysteria on the left about having on and the the various horrors that are alleged to have been perpetrated by old white males led by Donald Trump\nThe President Trump actually saw his approval rating rising look as far as Nikki Haley is concerned\nThere's a lot of talk about her replacement and some of the talk that as most inflammatory has the idea that the president's going to appoint his daughter Yvonne ... why would that make any sense ... has traveled around the world\nAs she speaks very well she

new study comes out from Canada is published in the American Journal of psychiatry it's peer reviewed it is a very very alarming scientific study\nIt makes it clear that marijuana does more damage to teenage brains for teenagers who use marijuana\nThan alcohol\nBy the way it doesn't mean that alcohol is a good idea for teenagers isn't it isn't and no don't somebody bring up Brett Kavanaugh look at it most parents understand that it's not great for kids at fourteen Fifteen sixteen to be using alcohol\nIt's even worse for them to be using marijuana yes even in states where that might be illegal by the way I don't think there are any of the legal marijuana states where it's legal for people under Eighteen\nUh this is um the peace in the New York times when I'm Talking about is by a guy name Neal Pollack\nWho's a writer he writes very well and he has an intention getting headline it's a piece about his own experience she can just argue with it and say well this didn't happen to know what happened he writes about it and he has all kinds of records to back him up\nHeadline is I'm just a middle aged house dad addicted to pot\nAnd then the sun heading says Canada should be legal justice alcohol should be legal but marijuana addiction exists and it almost wrecked my life here's a story it state line Austin, Texas my name is Neal\nAnd I'm a marijuana addict\nA year ago I wouldn't have

and so I didn't have a problem but clearly I did and I'm not the only one who suffers this way\nThey'll marijuana diction isn't deadly like opioid addiction or toxic like math addiction it's still wastes millions of lives\nAround nine percent of even casual users become addicted\nAnd about Seventeen percent of those who starred as teenagers\n\nOkay something worried about these statistics that he's using those statistics are based on an article that was published\n... might be eight or nine years ago but it's it's an article published in the journal of the American Medical Association spin looked over its been peer reviewed it is a solid article on a solid analysis here's what they show\nThat if you take the total number of even occasional marijuana use is if you take people who take even one\nJoint getting high once nine\nPercent of those people that's many many millions of people will become addicted to marijuana that means that they're dependent on it that means you have to
