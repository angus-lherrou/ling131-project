I mean I'm\nI Know somebody is is it okay if I say who it is Greg\nIs you are who has suggested a the any any time the police bought a van or a car or any kind of people with more than six bumper stickers they ought to investigate it immediately\nIn any event this uh this is a sort of a tip off to where he was coming from but this is the way Jeff Sessions sounded this morning and and by the way I Hope that this leads to President Trump and all the rest of us\nAppreciating the attorney general a little bit more appropriate here's the attorney general of the United states\nI'm pleased to

spoke beautifully this morning no I mean uh the Twitter feed probably best ignored but uh his speaking this morning was solid\nHe uh he was speaking to a great group and they were so enthusiastic and he was bonding with them so well it was a moving occasion\nHe was speaking to turning point USA's young black leadership summit and it's it's ironic I just this morning I left a Minneapolis I left the hotel this morning at five\nAnd five AM and I wrote to the airport with my friend and colleague Larry Elder who was on his way to precisely this young black leadership summit\nAnd ah here's what the president's sounded like with the announcement before he began what was a very successful and a fine speech to the people who are attending that someone who is the president the United states\nI'd like to begin as you are leaders that's a real leaders\nI'd like to begin today's remarks by providing an update on the packages and devices that have been male too high profile figures throughout our

good for you Mr President and then he went on to say this\nMuch never allow political violence to take root in America come up for the habit\nAnd I'm committed to doing everything in my power as president to stop it\nI've just concluded a briefing with the department of justice following the apprehension of the suspects\nI Want to applaud the FBI Secret Service department of justice the U.S

it's looking like a a you're looking it's a needle in a haystack how do you do this so quickly they've done incredible incredible job but I Want to congratulate\nThe president of\nThe United states

horrible\nJust as I I Know that when ... was shot and almost killed when there was the would be killer and the congressional baseball practice who fired at Republican members of Congress\nI didn't see

ridiculous to assume this was some kind of false flag operation\nUm I don't I I I I Do not believe that there is ... would be some kind of conspiratorial Democrat who'd be willing to sacrifice himself\nA in order to try to kill some members of his own party ... none of that makes the least bit of sense so fine dining you're right I mean ... but\nFor you to assume do you think that saves are

yeah the greatest show on the planet Michael\nAnd on the Michael Mann that show I've referred a couple of times on this show to um [noise] things that President Trump has tweeted that [noise] that I think are not constructive uh this is a tweet from a couple of days ago before they saw this a crime\nThe series of crimes actually President Trump tweeted a very big part of the anger anger capitalized we see today in our society is\nCaused by the purposely falls and inaccurate reporting of the mainstream media that I referred to as fake news is gotten so bad and hateful that it is beyond description\n\nAnd then he says mainstream media must clean up its act fast and fashionable capitalized with an exclamation point\nUm\nWhat's my big problem there just one word which is purposeful\nPurposely false and an accurate reporting in other words this is not to say that there isn't an accurate reporting there is not to say there is an biased reporting there is what's the idea that it's purposely falls that as part of a conspiracy that I honestly\nJournalists don't go into the business and this is true for people on Fox News as to where people on CNN\nIs to have a right and left\nYou don't go into the business of journalism or commentary to get things wrong\nDoesn't help your career it's embarrassing or let's\nAlleged perpetrator has been apprehended he has been interrogated a the proof is accumulating\nAnd the prospect as he will be going away for some forty eight years but meanwhile the president\nThe United states charged us earlier today and I think in an appropriate and dignified way with the necessity of people actually coming together and transcending some of the bitterness and viciousness of our politics recently\nAnd I want to speak to you for a few moments or with a friend and somebody who I I view is a very significant ally\nFor constitutional causes his name is Michael Ferris he is the president the c._e._o. and general counsel of the alliance defending freedom and uh and and like we were just talking off the air for a moment\nOr I think we agree that one of the essential elements of trying to to reduce the levels of polarization\nAnd hostility and viciousness and meanness and craziness that has inflicted American politics\nIs to affirm freedom of speech and freedom of conscience freedom of faith and that's exactly what the alliance defending freedom as about we agree with that proposition when did you\nSure the the um historical American position has been I may disagree with everything you say but I'll defend it to the death your right to say it\nAnd we're losing that left in particular although there are some of the right to take this position but the left with the levers of power like in the jak Philips case where they tried to shut down a Christian Baker who didn't want to use his creative skills to speak of message in favor of same sex weddings\nAnd and the California case that we did a screen where last year where California tried to force her life centers to give a pro abortion message people aren't willing to let people have their own opinions and say them freely\nAt you know can we go to the California case Vermont cause I follow that very closely and it was extraordinary an extraordinary victory it seems to me for the alliance defending freedom\nA this was I I've spoken several times for fundraising banquets for um for crisis pregnancy centers and would crisis pregnancy centers try to do is to give people an alternative\nIn a crisis pregnancy where a very often people are on Mary they have no funds\nThat rather than terminate the pregnancy getting an abortion\nOr that the centers will help you bear the child raising the child and and deal with all the challenges and mom\nAnd they were being forced by legislation in California to put up signs that said if you want abortion sermons [laughter] go go to this address go here go there um and that's about right isn't it\n[noise] yes um I argued the case in the Supreme Court myself and you got it exactly right California's a real big ... ... in their papers passing a law that this is a part of their progressive vision to ensure that the correct pro abortion message was given everywhere I'm\nIncluding these charitable private crisis pregnancy centers that were set up by donations from people who are pro life\nYeah exactly and so the ah they were not willing to let people have a different opinion on abortion if if if you were on\nOur side of the issue of the other side of course I wasn't required to print the Planned Parenthood is true is not affected by this law it was only they claim that they only wanted all women to have a views well that didn't work that way\nRight and then comes just to get this so people see it so clearly in other words you would have been fine with is is that at Planned Parenthood they had said well if you want an alternative to abortion and then go to a crisis pregnancy center\nIn equal actually I Would have ... I Would take the position that Planned Parenthood shouldn't be forced to give our message and we shouldn't be forced to give the pro abortion message but the the lack of a quality shows what the real problem here is is that people want to silence\nTheir viewpoint that they don't agree with and I I think that that's that's where the lack of civility is really coming in it it's we're saying that the other people don't even have a valid point of view I mean we can there's a difference between saying I'm you know you're you're entitled to express your view\nAnd saying I agree with your view and you know it's it's okay to disagree in this country but to some people are not allowed to disagree anymore and they will silence you if you disagree with the progressive viewpoint\nWhat uh what is the story going on right now with Blaine Adams and who is approved does promotional T shirts a case\nCases pending in Kentucky Supreme Court [noise] um the local officials there went after him because he wouldn't print T shirts with a gay\nPride team to them and he will print teachers for any person but he will deliver messages there's other messages these turned down over the years he found them another T shirt shop to deliver the exact same shirt at the exact same price\nUm but that wasn't good enough it wasn't that these people want it to be entitled to have their shirts which they clearly God\nThey wanted to have a pound of flesh to go with it and so there are trying to punish planets and hopefully we won that case in the Kentucky court of appeals [noise] um and hopefully that will be affirmed in the Kentucky Supreme Court if if not we'll be taking their case to the Supreme Court in the states\nI I just saw an unbelievable number um how how many uh different uh attorneys do you put out in the field to defend these cases with with the ATF the alliance defending freedom\nWell we have a sixty attorneys on staff and three thousand allied attorneys that um volunteer their time sometimes at reduced rate sometimes absolutely free um but we have a you know a big team that are willing to come in and help Christians and other people all over the country\nWho have a real religious freedom and freedom of speech problems\nWell that's a that's a very a very significant um army if you have the three thousand volunteer attorneys and by the way we're we're talking to you because right now today is fried or going into the weekend you will feel great and you'll have more reason to celebrate and feel great all over the weekend\nIf you can do something to um\nTo help the alliance defending freedom go to our website at Michael midday dot com you can read more about their fascinating work and some of these important cases\nAnd see what this great organization led by Michael ...

... student at Cal State University in San Marcos and he's the president of a pro life group on campus that she thought um funds for a pro life speaker of the student body has a rule process where they found all\nOrganizations all all groups are supposed to be on equal basis but as it turns out normally equals not equal the pro life group was denied any funding for speaker but the gay lesbian groups received over ... um about a quarter of a million dollars in round numbers\nLayaway about quarter of a million dollars for eight years and\nAll the other groups combined received in around thirty thousand dollars and so the groups that are pushing the progressive message are really two groups received\nThe lion's share of the money and this is money taken from every student in student fees is like a tax on public school ... college campuses\nSo so what what are you feeling for what the relief you're seeking for ...\nWhat we're seeking a quality a relief for open mic on these kinds of cases\nIs to end the practice of collecting student fees for a for these kind of purposes that they just need to stop there there are being administered and such uneven fashion that they become

... show will a post this Meghan ... column that I'm Talking about uh the immigration conversation we need to have it's called and it's basically\nA conversation that makes it clear we cannot have an open borders policy is there is no constituency for it it's something that either way conservatives use more than liberals not because conservatives supported it because they characterize\nThe liberal position as being for open borders and you know to some extent it is only be calls on this caravan issue have you heard anything from anyone on the left anyone in the Democratic party\nAbout what they propose to do about it all you hear is criticism from oh Trump said that there were middle Easterners and the caravan and they're not probably not\nProbably right that he's wrong but okay so what ... ... as Meghan McConnell makes the point even if every single person in this caravan\nIs solid and hard working in decent family oriented you cannot just accepted patently the caravan has dwindled down to about three thousand people which is good news because it means that there's some people were finding some kind of asylum or some kind of ability to be taken in Mexico maybe some all go back to Honduras\nAnd and that it seems to me is an area where Americans can be helpful both a private sector and the public sector they're wonderful charities one of the things that I'm very proud of as we'd been associate on this show and I I mentioned this last night in Minneapolis\nA we've been associated for years with food for the poor\nWhich does a a great job feeding people and providing for people in Guatemala\nAnd by helping to provide for people by helping the cause of reform in these dysfunctional countries and their horribly dysfunctional\nThen then you can make it less urgent for people simply the fleet and yes it is true that many of the people are fleeing the scanner fleeing for their lives\nI'm not saying we shouldn't helps them what I'm saying is that feeling compassion for people who are desperate\nMeans is used to help them in the right way which is back in the place that they're coming from rather than encouraging him to walk across two thousand miles of Mexico were more and um present themselves here in the United states with\nSome kind of a welcoming\nTo people who are desperate who were decided to march up to the United states nowhere else they they want to go there probably places where they could establish themselves more successfully and more immediately\nBut the United states backing and we simply cannot cannot uh allow the fact that the people want to come here to allow people who wanted to come here who are willing to force the issue\n\nLet's go to a Kurt in Minneapolis ... you're on the Michael ...\nMichael Vick you're protecting regard I ... really interesting question I ... I ... I I don't feel that we should write any of these people are giving any of them but what can we do what our options ... or ... I mean you just mentioned that\nThere are obviously traveling through other you know Mexico depending on where they're coming from but it's like\nWhat you what your diplomatic wait what can we do immediately\nOkay well first of all Mexico has not been terrible on this and even President Trump has agreed that the new the new president of Mexico Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador\nHas a agreed to some level of cooperation they want to discourage these people from going through Mexico and the numbers of apparently declined recently but I've been cut in half\nWhich means that maybe half of these people have uh gone in the direction or split off from the caravan or or finding some places to stay in Mexico it seems to me this is an area where government can cooperate with and work closely with private charities\nAnd they're all kinds of private charities that could take it among themselves to greet these people on the Mexican side of the border before they get into the United states and say hey\nWe're gonna help you get back home and when you get back home we're going to help\nPut your feet on the ground and we're going to help work with you I I Know that the charities that we support actually do things like building wells in a village which can make a huge difference I'll tell you what makes a huge difference in a village were in a city in Central America\nIs continuing to help the local law enforcement so that it's not a situation where people are shot in the street all the time and it's it's much better to invest money in that it seems to me\nThen invest money in the process of simply a letting people into the United states and then processing them and then sending them back and taking some\nTry to dry up\nThe attraction of coming here and the other aspect and and this has to happen with immigration for must is workplace enforcement so that people don't think I can just come into the United states and whether I'm legally accepted or not I'll find work\nWe should make it very very difficult for people to work here in the United states who do not have the legal right to be here\nLet's go to Dan in Columbus ohio you're on the Michael ...\nHey Mike ... first of all for not only having an emotional point of view but having a rational point of view what's the point of view that I feel like the lap author lacks that even if you lived at the you're limited to the article earlier today\nUm it's such a rational argument I mean I can make the I could draw the same comparison to say you know so and so was I was born into more wealth than I was therefore I should have access to their finances which is of you may be the law passed but\nAt the end of the day they have to come to the conclusion that there's a rational side of the argument that they often fail to see or understand and I think\nYou know even if you look into it a little further he would simply relate to the point that there's this emotional side of them or for whatever reason they feel like that to solve all the world's problems\nYou know what it is I think it's a lot of it as guilt is in other words people look at themselves and I think look here I Am in America and I live in a great country and things have gone well for me in one fell from my parents and my grandparents\nAnd they don't understand that by state saying the point of view that we think everybody in the whole world is is entitled to what I Am\nA that would actually undermined precisely those things about our country that we value and I know that our country does have a\nTradition of mercy and acceptance and integration an American ...\nBut not on on on limited basis and the idea that you should be able to inherit some of the credit that your approach janitors have expended fighting for this country and building this country that is profoundly rational I appreciate your call we'll be right back\nMichael ...

show\nIt Michael Hi thanks for taking the art I I think I Would I listen to jog he talked about how lucky we are as Americans but a jog clearly a gold star family my family as my father a major quite thought of that was the first national guardsmen hey I Do have a a wide enough what occurred\nAfter a president job you would probably Cuba's ...\nAre they going to be very tricky\nYou're absolutely right\nThere will eat everything I Do\nYeah I I [noise] there's so many stories like this there was a friend of mine good friend who's actually going on in Israel trip with us coming up named George guilder who is one of the leading intellectuals of our time and a a great writer and a great man\nAnd it was covered with Donald Trump pictures stickers pictures of people but uh like Michael Moore and Hillary Clinton and and the other people that Donald Trump doesn't like and goes after quite a bit\nAnd some of them had bull's eyes on their faces\nA so says are ... a guy who was a known name suddenly become world famous and that may be what he was looking for because everybody's going to know his name now it'll be\nIt'll be a trivia question but he'll be a a name that everybody's going to remember for at least for a while anyway\nUh in all always be there somewhere in the history books still haven't been able to get an answer on whether any of these bombs\nWere actually moms that would you know blow up we'll find out at some point I I did see that the FBI saying that they are not hoax devices\nUm whatever that means I'm\nA I I yeah I don't know how that ah yeah I don't know how that compares to a a bomb that it's not going to blow up but it's not a hoax device um but anyway getting back to say is our ah here's a quick rundown of some of his life time accomplishments okay\nI'm not sure if this was a hundred percent official but I this is what I saw somewhere and I'm just going to run them by\nAh arrested for I'm not I don't know if he was convicted for any of this stuff but his record has this on it then goes all the way back to Nineteen Ninety One twenty seven years ago he's in his late fifties\nOr Ninety One staffed Nineteen Ninety four domestic violence and here's a good one in two thousand and two a bomb threat he was taken into custody for a bomb threat\nHe had threatened to blow up a utility company now not everybody does that when you're electric bills all to hire or a you know that's what he did he he threatened to blow it up so I don't know that might have been a pretty good indication that he was probably not as suited for being out on the street how about putting them in jail anyway after that so to\nHope for something to do with an illegal id ah also an old for a controlled substance also an old for evidence tampering all those sound like they could all be connected to the same situation illegal id controlled substance or evidence tampering\nA he has a a foreclosure on his property that that was an old nine I don't know if that means he's been living in a band for eight years that it'd be uncomfortable\nAlso oh nine operating without a license\nUm I don't think he was operating like operating as a as a physician I I just I'm guessing operating some kind of a vehicle without a license and then the third teeny through into a theft\nI don't know whether it was a you know they stole a\nA Twinkie at a seven eleven or what but was staffed and then Thirteen battery so that's his that's his accomplishments and that's the kind of guy we're dealing with there\nNot a genius and um he's not a good guy and he probably shouldn't have been out on the street and that's always my question when I see stuff like this when I see the guy with this many\nUm offenses and I don't know how serious they all are and how much evidence they had on every one and whether you know he could have been put in jail for it but um\nYou know that's who he is so how does\nA guy who does that say on the street that would be my question it would be one thing is the only thing that he had done was you know threatened to blow up a utility company that's that to me it would be enough to put them away for a while but soft battery evidence to bring a house this guy not a ... behind bars somewhere\nAnd so how's the media handling this well I've been watching CNN and MSNBC actually may have heard it when I went on the air I forgot to turn it down but uh if you've heard that in the background I have I had it on here in the studio um but I haven't been watching CNN MSNBC purposely not watching Fox because I I I kinda know or Fox is going to go with this\nAnd um I just wanted to see what the the two who would be happy to see that the\nStickers for the Trump stickers round the van and she wanted to see how they would react [noise]\nThey're not coming right out and blaming the president but you can kinda tell that they really liked to especially at CNN um and then I Want you to listen to this response from David your and Jonathan Karl this is from last night I think um and this is what Sarah Huckabee Sanders\nShe had said a ... in response to people trying to blame Donald Trump wants you to listen to what she said listen to their response and listen closely to what Jonathan Karl says the president tweeted about the media\nThe idea that this is that the hands of the president's ... absolutely ridiculous at us at the hands of the president were her words there at the answer John defending the president there and it's\nCalled for unity from the president himself last night about how long do you suggest the last\nWell the person is about to embark on his most intensive period of campaigning says himself was running we're talking about at least ten rallies plan for the final week of the campaign he certainly tone down the rhetoric last night\nIn Wisconsin but at the same time neither the president nor any of his top advisers have said there is anything wrong at all with his rhetoric or ... anyway encourages violence\nAnd White House officials say David that he will continue to draw sharp distinction with Democrats and this morning he issued a tweet or a brand new attack on the media saying quote news organizations are bad and hateful being on description\nSo the bottom line here is I Would not look to the president to be toning down his rhetoric for long\nOkay he said the media is quote bad and hateful beyond description okay\nWell that's what Jonathan Karl said that Donald Trump tweeted this the kind of thing that Donald why why Donald Trump calls it fake news and why he says he's treated unfairly what you just said again by the way out on a on a tarmac somewhere on these on his way wherever he's on his way to\nKnow he he he when he was asked about this today thank the law enforcement and then he made another took another shot at the media\nBut he said that Donald Trump said a matter of comment about the media which he said were quote bad and hateful beyond description but here's the tweet okay\nA very this is the whole tweet a very big part of the anger we see today in our society is caused by the purposely falls in an accurate reporting of the mainstream media that I referred to as fake news\nIt has gotten so bad and hateful that it is beyond description mainstream media must clean up its act fast and fast isn't caps so he he didn't just say that the media is bad and hateful beyond description he said\nFake news has gotten bad and hateful that is beyond description and so on national television last night in front of millions of people Jonathan Karl\nWhen he said was true but it was completely biased and ... and unfair toward Donald ... you can hate when he tweeted anyway the old ... that's that's fine\nBut he it was a perfect case of how in the media you can buy 'em by just\nI don't know just picking and choosing what you want to use him a quote or buy\nA leaving something out you can make it sound much worse than it is you can still if pure pure accused of not telling the truth you have a defense cause you can point to the\nThe tweet and and you'll see that in there but leaving it out what what you fail to mention is just as bad as not mentioning it or mentioning it incorrectly so it it completely distorted the weight and completely distorted with Donald Trump but said\nSo now let's go back to another incident that involve the politically motivated wacko or maybe you remember this a guy actually shot it almost killed a Congressman Steve skull east the Republican congressman back in June twenty Seventeen\nThe guy's name was James T Hodgkinson\nThen he had a ball and tear it for the Bernie Sanders' campaign and we're seeing carrying a sign in front of a post office said tax the rich he didn't like the rich hated the rich and Bernie got 'em all round up the hate the rich apparently\nEr and he also tweeted this uh this is hard to get some guy who is now dead fortunately somebody shot him it was good but he also Twitter this I Want to say Mr President quote I Want to say Mr President for being in\nA hole you are truly the biggest a whole we have ever had in the oval office that was the other guy before he went and tried to shoot multiple congressman before he was shot and killed by Capitol police so he was a big Bernie fan\nAnd he tried to tell several Republican congressmen or know how he felt by shooting them at a baseball practice but uh I don't remember Bernie Sanders ever taking the blame\nWhen president I have just been informed that the alleged shooter at the Republican baseball practice this morning\nAs someone who apparently volunteered on my presidential campaign I Am sick and by the despicable act and let me be as clear as I can be\nViolence of any lines is unacceptable in our society and I condemn the action and the strongest possible terms\nReal change can only come about who non violent action and anything else runs counter to our most deeply held American values", "show_name":
