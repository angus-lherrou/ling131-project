Tucker has this tremendous new book ship all schools it's funny it's roping goes that all the check takes on the elites that dominate American society so after this great successful\nA triumphant return to Fox News prime time now he's got a big hit both on his hands right\nHe does and this is the first book he's written in Fifteen Years so I mean this is a pretty big deal a ship was interesting it it's about how America's ruined classes failed America\nAnd he kind of tells the story of Trump a little bit and what he saw and what not a lot of other of our we saw understood it just to give you your examples you know he talks about how\nHow is it that an elite ruling class I think that giving people tax cuts would be considered crumbs or\nSaying that having to X chromosomes doesn't make you email makes you a male and you should be allowed a woman's bathroom and you're being told that not America First is globalism person's citizenship citizenship over the world\nAnd so he goes to the story talking about not just ... but also the right leader to walk down what about American and does it in his charming and and funny way [laughter]\nAnd no bow ties anymore you know maybe they were no more going into it and I think we're going to have him on the Mike Gallagher show next week he's been traveling this week but he said he wants to do the show so I'm looking forward to the interviewing him about the book and of course rubber fifty years the conservative book club has been guiding book lovers the best conservative books and authors of our time\nI'll if you've got

use his meltdown the president last night\nShows about a politician body slamming a reporter\nWho the predictable outrage from the Trump hating world got all that and more coming up is the Mike Gallagher show continues from Tampa [noise]\nWith the U.S embassy now open in Jerusalem the world is witnessing the filming a God's cabinet with his chosen people what does this mean for Christians around\nBased on anything anybody can imagine it's indefensible morally indefensible crime was committed against them and [noise]\nThere's a lot about the man that I don't know I don't know what his views where he is portrayed as a liberal in Saudi Arabia against an autocratic regime\nBut there are of the reports about him but no matter what his views that this is obviously not something we can morally accept the question that looms larger than that however is why is there so much attention being paid here\nDissidents or regime opponents in the middle east are routinely murdered\n\n... ... ... ... it's one of the great puzzles of life but I think I have an answer to this one but it is often a puzzle as to why something dominates the news and something else doesn't\nThe Saudi or the Saudi regime got rid of someone wanted to get rid of\nAnd now in the year twenty Eighteen this is international\nNews to the extent that it is an ongoing daily story\n\nGiven how many people who who oppose Assad get tortured to death\nOr or in the Egyptian regime or in other off African regimes other Arab countries of the Muslim countries they have many people have been tortured to death in Iran\nCan you name one so why why is this so much of a fixation\nThe question is not whether or not we accept what happened and\nThe question is why is there a fixation on this man\nWell one reason as you wrote columns for the Washington Post so he has a connection to the west and specifically to the United states another issue that we have photographic data\nWith regard to I mean there man walks into a consulate and never walk south\nPretty damning than we have that on video we have on video of Herman entering\nAnd we have the information about those men entering turkey and then leaving turkey so everything is obvious why the Saudi regime or elements of the Saudi regime would want to get rid of this man that's a puzzle to me\nDid you ever hear of this guy I I'm I immersed myself in world affairs and I've ever heard of the guy and and\nAnd by the way and if you read the column so they're not exactly a shift to leaving or revealing or or anything I mean it's the Washington Post wanted the Saudi writer idol I understand that but I Wish they had an Iranian writer\nWho was who was a dissident what's the guy would be a dead on arrival the away so here's my theory as to why they're such preoccupation with this ban\n\nThere are two reasons in my opinion one is Saudi Arabia's ally of the United states and\nThe the media are far more preoccupied with the bad things that allies do than the bad things that enemies do\nYou know you might want to ask why the car I don't know fully this is this is now speculation\n\nThey would I think they would argue we we have influence on allies we don't have influence on enemies\nTherefore on those that we can influence we should try to have some influence that's the most noble read of the preoccupation with the deprivation of allies as opposed to the deprivation of enemies\nRight there's ... there's nothing on the dissidents in Iran and when Iran did in fact have an uprising during the during the Obama administration has essentially said nothing and\nThe the ... that was defended by the entire liberal slash left media\nBecause it was ... Obama so\nBack to the question why is there such preoccupation because one one is if you have a moral sense and it's a very important thing for a lot of people to think well of themselves and we we can feel good about ourselves we are bringing to the world's attention\nSomething terrible that they're an ally of the United states is the second reason\nIs that he's not only an ally of the Saudi regime was not only in LA of the United states an ally of the most hated man in the world most hated man in the world for the left is about Kim Jong un and it is about the Ayatollah Khamenei me\nUm is not a it is not Bashar al Assad's diet is Donald Trump is by far the most hated man in the world's media because of the world's media run by the left and the left hates him more than any of them and if she has a friend the friend is hated\n\nThose are the two reasons so why are we supposed to do here is the question on the table what are we supposed to do we can't deny him is because it's it would be a law and you can't tell lies cat that I went to Saudi regime that does it go up all the way that the crown prince we don't know\nBut that it was these are these are pretty well connected man apparently who are\nEngaged in this murder so what are we supposed to do cancel a hundred billion dollars whatever what is the ... that they ever ordered in in ... five hundred billion right\nThat's a lot of that is a lot of jobs so you'll say well listen morale will be more important than jobs to which the answer is what is that yes it is yes morality is more important than jobs however there were two big cavity up here one is jobs is a moral issue\nIt's not it's not unrelated to morality whether or not we can ... a ... a ... tens of thousands of Americans to work but if but murder is burger I I I fully agree I have a hierarchy of moral good and the hierarchy\nOf moral bad that's a very big component of my moral thinking but the a lot of save the Saudi regime or toppled because of sanctions by the United states first of all if they didn't have American to buy stuff from they would fight elsewhere\nThey're not going to stop buying military equipment number two and most important if you really want to talk more real than the greatest moral good white male might be in the world the world scene might be opposing Iran\nIran is the most evil actor on earth\nThe north Korean regime is the most evil regime domestically\nThe Iranian regime is the most evil regime in terms of foreign evil evil outside of its borders it's it's great enemy is Saudi Arabia\nNow you'll save so we are supposed to compromise our values because they're our ally and because the enemy of my the enemy is my friend no you don't compromise your moral values you speak out\nYou condemn you try to make that ally ... a more decent place but you don't abandon that ally because there are greater good the most obvious example being a man who didn't kill one dissident but about twenty five million\nGift that figure because it's not possible for the human mind to wrap itself around it and that is Joseph Stalin and we back Joseph Stalin knowing that you were ... people in the millions because he was on our side against a greater enemy Adolf Hitler\nAnd that is the way the world works for people who are willing to look at the world the way it works not the way we imagine we allowed to Jimmy Carter allowed the America under Jimmy Carter allowed the shop to step down in Iraq\nBecause of the various\nThings that he did that were bad like his ... is the world a better place because the ayatollah regime took over the answer is obvious\nOne eighth Prager Seventy Seventy six is the number I'm Dennis\nDennis Springer show live from the relief factor pain free [noise]\nTroubled themselves and in\nThis case it Saudi Arabia and ironically it's happening when Saudi Arabia is becoming a morally better place that's the irony\nAlright\nFeinstein Feinstein wants to reopen Kevin Ware hearings if the Democrats take control of the Senate\nDianne Feinstein his so deteriorated visit moral figure or because of the running against a radical leftist she's just the regular leftist Kevin delay I'm\nSo for her the issue is how do I win\n\nNot waters right they will open hearings again on the Supreme Court justice I Want you to understand something about the Democratic party today because it's a left wing metal liberal party every institution it doesn't control it wishes to destroy you realize that\nIt doesn't control the electoral college it wishes to destroy it\nIt does and wishes to and the electoral college it doesn't control the Supreme Court for the first time in my lifetime and in a lifetime of any of the senators show it calls the court illegitimate that it's a regular phrase\nThe the court has no longer Supreme Court has no longer seen as legitimate because it's not left if it's not left it's not legitimate you understand\nIt's a force for chaos left isn't it is a false that just purely a tornado of destruction\nNow where was the article about how the Senate protects white voters against black voters and Hispanic voters did you see that\nIt was the Washington Post I think but it might have been to New York times they hate the Senate because the Senate like the electoral college is state based not population based\nThis is the United states of America the states ought to have their own worlds indeed genius I could cry about the genius of the founders of this country\nIn their genius they wanted competing moral societies as it were cold states\nTo see which one works they didn't they weren't so arrogant just to think they knew exactly what would\nWork really that's why we have ... states that's why we have a Senate [noise] so now everything they don't control is
