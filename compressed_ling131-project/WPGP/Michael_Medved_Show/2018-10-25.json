hundred troops to the border as the president's request\nTo make sure that order is maintained and that know people are not just simply going to walk in from the caravan I that is of course the right position to take\nBut what's the Democratic position\nIs the position that literally anyone seeking asylum in the United states should be welcomed with open arms and should be allowed to come in if they are suffering there are a lot of suffering people in the world\nHow many do folks on the left actually wants to take here and then we have disagreement day of course a but first up I Am very very pleased because\nIt'd be it'd be so depressing the other way up President Trump is handling this bombing situation decently\nIs he handling it brilliantly in was unbelievable a plum and so much style and so inspiring no but it's it's it's better than adequate it's good it's fine\nI mentioned on the air yesterday it it might have been a nice thing and who knows maybe he did it it just hasn't called attention to it\nTo call some of the people who have gotten these bomb packages send to them and say gee I feel bad we are going to try to track these people down and make sure you don't get any threats again they didn't call Joe Biden you can call Hillary Clinton you can call ... rock Obama\nWhy not he's president the United states\nAnd uh he did get the tone I think pretty close to just right at the beginning of his rally last night Wisconsin a lot of people are saying oh what's he going to say in Wisconsin in federal court fact people in the media are freaking out they say he's blaming the media for this whole thing he is not\nHe is not their distorting what the president said here is what he said the very beginning of his rally in Wisconsin of course all of this for the

got lost he cheers there from conservatives I haven't heard a single conservatives say\nWell you know what people who got these bombs uh deserved it\nA ... no one is anyone stood up to try to defend the mad bomber whoever this person is\nI don't think so certainly no one or the right as anyone on west stood up to defend him or her I think it's probably a guy or a ISIS as ISIS defended [laughter] the bomber and by the way it's not an ISIS flag\nIt has now been carefully analyzed it was the image was a parody of an ISIS flag that are invoked a Larry the cable guy\nGet her done\nBut that was the image which was a parody from an ISIS flag showing three scantily clad women in high heels okay I mean really\nReally [noise] [noise] okay\nIt's the president went on in opening is rally speech last night to say this\nWe walk\nAll sides\nTo come together in peace and harmony we can do it we can do it [noise] we can do\nMore broadly there's much we can do to bring our nation's together for example

prominent one on CNN [noise]\nOf uh of people calling comparing President Trump to Hitler\nAnd know that is not appropriate and yes that is disgusting and it's inappropriate so the president is speaking well I I Know is reading from a teleprompter I Know it's prepared for it but that's what you want for goodness sakes this is a time where he has to be careful of his language and he was\nBut then he added this and this was a controversial part of his rallies speech last night and I think what he said was absolutely one hundred percent correct and highly defensible listen\nMedia also has a responsibility\nA civil town yet or stop the endless hostility and constant negative and oftentimes false attacks and stores have to do [noise]\nOkay why is it not possible for people\nOh say on CNN or MSNBC or on CBS or any ... any of them to acknowledge that the president is right about this but instead of that we heard this from John King on CNN in response to the president's remarks\nNo one's blaming the president and the president\nOf but the president that wants to make this about him um amen to the president for what he said yesterday\nEvery body tone it down\nLet's just see where the fact that was the investigators do their job we can all be better\nIt's our fault why\nOkay she never said it was your fault the president's words where the media\nAll responsibility to set a civil tone and stop the endless hostility and constant negative and oftentimes false attacks\nHe didn't say it was your fault he said that if we're going to be better as a country and that is one good thing that could have come out of it it's going to have to involve all sides and everybody\nAnd uh here was I'm Caitlin Collins on CNN [noise] uh yeah we we will get to that at at actually arguing with

America look bad and they I I and that's my uh my wife was a clinical psychologist is convinced that it's the Russians who knows we'll see\nBut her her idea is that this kind of thing on not only makes Republicans look bad because everyone's assuming as a Republican\nBut it makes our country look bad because uh if if you're having very prominent people whose safety is being threatened in this

what a nationalist means generally you can look at the expense of cinnamon for patriot\nAnd yes I think my country is the best in the world and I put my country above any other nation in the world I Do\nAnd you know what what's amazing here is you'll hear Caitlin Collins is twenty six years old she's a graduate of University of Alabama\nAnd and this may make the make you doubt the Crimson Tide holes on the national championship frankly because she's arguing with Jeffrey tube and the legal analyst for CNN and he also defends the term nationalist but it sounded like this\nI don't think he can just change the wording national I like that I just don't think that is how this works and I don't think I think we're laying if I think that that I mean do you ever if you think you would think you are a national and then if that's what the definition of the word that you're using what'd you say your one\nProbably not you know I Would I mean I don't I I you know I as someone who believes in in the United states and the important thing in the United states I'm not a national now that's what the national left out please come on I mean that term has not become like Hitler I mean that is why he has\nNot use the word national at the guy on a negative connotation it is not the national Teddy Roosevelt in the Nineteen thirty\nNine years in many legitimate grounds to criticize Donald Trump for for his racism for his ignorance for his lying I just think this one is one where he has a legitimate argument\n... alright er public as well as we got we got a big another very good I Will say the

turning you on about this one eight hundred nine five five Seventeen Seventy six\nAnd one of the things you don't get to vote on is I'm Megan Kelly because no matter how much you want\nTo continue watching her on NBC's Today show apparently that's not going to be\nPossible and this particular case is one of those\nWhere I think that people who were treating this feeding her as a victim or treating her some kind of horrible criminal or both wrong or what Megan Kelly displayed in her interchange on NBC about black face and Halloween blackface uh costumes\nDoes not represent racism and it doesn't represent innocent victim mode either it just represents\nColossal monumental indescribable stupidity she's a lawyer\nShe's obviously a very bright and capable TV journalist and for goodness sake given the fact that she had just a couple of years ago a huge explosion of well deserved controversy for her insistence that Santa Claus was white\nAs she should have been able to watch out on this\nBecause what all of this is based on that she was commenting in a discussion about a Halloween masquerade which looked truly awful frankly uh by ... the lessons to his one of the real housewives of New York\nAnd um she uh she dressed up as Diana Ross\nAnd pose and put out pictures of it and uh\nAnd and Diana Ross of course has very um a light skin and as soon as she was trying to approximate that wearing a big giant afro wig and it looked awful and ugly and people were offended by it of course\nAnd a Megan ... took it upon herself in a conversation on air\nTo defend the idea of dressing up in blackface for Halloween a very very stupid\nPoint to make but here's what it sounded like\n[laughter] it's really ... you get in trouble if you are a white person what's on or a black person it puts out white they\nLike that that was okay as long as you're addressing other character if somebody feels like something that's offensive to them then you should say it and that's fair game and if they're going to dress up only take\nYou've got to be able to take it okay Allen broker of course veteran a weatherman on NBC or was one of the many many many people demanding that Megan Kelly apologize and er here here's what al ... had to say\nBut the fact is a while she apologized to the staff shields a bigger apology to folks at color around the country because\nThis is a history going back to the Eighteen thirties minstrel shows to do to me and denigrated\nOr a race wasn't right when I'm old enough to live through Amos and Andy where you have white people in black and he's playing to black characters and it was just magnifying the worst area we talked about black people and that's what the big problem is\nOkay yeah it is a big problem and by the way Megan Kelly saying when I was a kid it was okay to dress in black face she's forty seven years old\nIf she was a hundred and fifty years old maybe maybe it was okay or or even if she was eighty years old or Ninety but I've got to tell you I'm older than Megan Kelly I hate to admit it but I Am and\nUh when I was a little kid it was emphatically not okay if somebody had showed up\nAt our Halloween carnival in my elementary school in San Diego California uh wearing black face costume for Halloween\nI think they would have been asked to go home it it has not been okay\nFor a long time a long time\nAnd that's something that Megan Kelly as a graduate of the University of Syracuse and Albany law school and somebody who's been a TV journalists for a long long time honestly should've known her apology on air\nWas very carefully composed and it was meant to say for career obviously and it sounded like this\nI Want to begin with two words I'm Sorry\nWe made her the yesterday we had a discussion here about political correctness and Halloween costumes and that conversation turned to whether it is ever okay for a percentage of one race to dress up as another\nBlack person making their faith later or a white person making errors darker to make a costume complete I defended the idea saying as long as it as it was a respectful and part of a Halloween costume and old okay\nWell I was wrong and I and [noise]\nOne of every day in his chair and\nGetting to\nTalk of sometimes I with him [noise]\nAnd yesterday I learned I learned that given the history of blackface do an awful way by radio country\nIt is not okay for that you'd be part of any team Halloween otherwise\nI'd never met any kind of person [noise]\nBut I Do understand the value and being sensitive to our history chicken early on race and ethnicity\nThis past year has been so painful\nFor many people of color that guy fail so divided and I have no wish to add to that pain and offense I Believe is is it time for more understanding war love more sensitivity and honor and I want I think part of that\nThank you for listening and for helping me listen to\nAh well didn't work she suspended or now it looks like\nUh she uh she's not going to be on air on NBC and she's also dumped by CIA the talent agency major Hollywood talent agency the handles her so she dumped by both but she may be able to collect a what's left on her sixty nine million dollar contract\nSo good luck with this I I Do feel there is something that first of all black faces disgusting and all you have to do is go back and look at some even some quality old movies I I'm\nOne of the films that that comes to mind is a wonderful movie called holiday and with Bing Crosby and it it's a lovely film accepted has a sequence in it with Bing Crosby in blackface singing the song Abraham\nAbout Lincoln's Birthday and pretending to be kind of an old slave and it's so cringe inducing its horribly embarrassing ...\nAn enormously popular a singer\nAnd just enormously popular and he of course was known for doing his shows in blackface do I believe that Bing Crosby and ... were were horrible races I Believe that they basically shared some of the values of their time where\nIt's almost as if there was something funny something humorous\nAbout being black because it was so different and the whole minstrel show blackface\nHistory is laments Hubble and it it is an indication of how far we've come or do I think there's any defense for Megan Kelly making making the case that uh uh that wearing black face on Halloween is okay no there's no real defense for it\nBut is it perhaps an overreaction to see her entire career go up in flames because of this one stupid passing comment\nWell it's happened before or with other people I again I I think it is appropriate and good that we are more respectful and more careful\nI mean well there's a piece over at Fox that actually is pretty amusing if you don't get routes wrong with blackface here's why it's so offensive\nAnd genetic Desmond Harris writes put down the black and brown face ... step away from the bronze or twelve shades darker than your skin that is if you're at all interested in not being walking symbol of racism this Halloween wait what's wrong with black face\nA lot of people thankfully don't need this question answered to many it's obvious that it's a lazy non funny costume\nBad idea with a depressing history that is the opposite of celebratory people have even made very simple visual aids to communicate this and they have one circles I should I wear black face on Halloween next circle says no\nI yeah it it is a big ... know if you disagree [noise]\nHi Michael nice to talk to you great to talk to you [noise] um\nSo I originally called in to say why I'm voting for the first time in the mid term\nOh good I'm Out here and why\n[noise] well I think it's a way of expressing yourself all the eggs that people are saying and feeling right now like these the imported bomber\nOr these pipe bombs you know I think part of it is he has ... and yes he is probably here she is probably a a dysfunctional person I'm Sorry I'm getting off track [noise] so how voting because I think when people that are in power\nOr you disagree with that you tend to to look and see what they're doing and be paying more attention and so I think that the best way to express my feelings are about the situation and my lot in life is to vote and vote in a local level and the state is the best way to do that\nNot good for you as one way or the other but\nThey're no good good for you I can I ask are you voting for ah Sherrod Brown where are you voting for congressman or when I see\nA ... at this point I haven't looked over their platform as listen to all the governor debates are that's far and now I'll be voting for Cordray for governor um\nThat's interesting why\nUm I agree with issue one uh mostly um I I thought he did better in the debates I I feel like the viewpoint wind up\nUm\nIt after that that that's kind of how I took away when I took away from it\nWell I knew it was fascinating as you know Ohio carried big time big league for President Trump won Ohio by nine points\nAnd in right now uh I Know the the governor's race is close a Sherrod Brown the very very liberal senator who really should be voted out but it looks like he is going to win and what this shows is the American people are not doctrinaire they're not automatic about their voting\nBut I I salute you Josh what you're saying about voting to express yourself to get involved\nIt's a good thing and it's the right thing and congratulations on that let's go quickly to David in Duluth or two for a okay we will go to David in Duluth, Georgia in just a moment\nAre coming up\nI Want to go to this idea of um [noise] this early voting and what it means and why it is that Republicans might be voting early much more than they have in years past and much more than the Democrats are doing this

for a percentage of one race dress up as another\nBlack person making their face later or white person making errors darker to make a costume complete I defended the idea\nSaying as long as it as that was respectful and part of the Halloween costume food okay\nWell I was wrong and I am sorry [noise]\nAh I worked in t._v. for a long time and there've been lots of times when I've heard about a hiring at a station or at a network\nIn my immediate response was start the clock meaning it's only a matter of time before they have to admit the mistake one of the Big East roommate was Katie Couric being hired to replace Dan Rather who had replaced Walter Cronkite CBS\nA Katie Couric was known for being perky\nPerky is not what you want in the person who's filling Walters and dance Jews sorry she was good news reporter but she came from the today show where she was known for being perky Megan Kelly\nShe was known for being a good reporter and then a tough interviewer at Fox and she was and she was very good and after she became a star over at Fox NBC decided to hire her away when her contract was up\nAnd they put her in a job where perky would have worked a lot better the day she was hired I said the same thing start look clock\nIt's only a matter of time somebody NBC paid her twenty million dollars a year and they still over sixty nine million and she has a she's a lawyer herself and she has another lawyer and she plans to make sure she gets every penny which by the way I Hope she gets\nUh the daily mail is saying ah ah she has and they have a I'm a I'm an executive be ceasing this quote\nMegan Kelly is done and she's not ever coming back we're just working the timing of the announcement but mark my words she is gone and will never be seen on NBC live again I guess they ran a replay ever show us today and they're going to do the same thing tomorrow\nAnd by the way one of my dreams has always been to sign a multi million dollar multi year guaranteed contract and then get fired about twenty minutes into it but I'm going to late in my career I don't think it's going to happen for me\nAnd I don't know if what you said a few days ago was a bad enough the anchor off the air and pay or sixty nine million dollars it was done what you said I guess than she did apologize apologies don't matter anymore but\nHer show which I never saw one minute of apparently stunk and it did get terrible ratings so she's gone and she's probably not headed back to Fox because\nThe daily mail quoted someone from there who said we like our on air staff right now it's not a good sign for Megan when they say that if she's planning on going back there uh she got ripped when she was at Fox for saying that Santa Claus is white\nThat was considered racist and of course that was a it was ... condemned as being racist despite that home about Santa that said the U.S rosy red cheeks [laughter]\nI don't know I guess a a you're not allowed to say that but anyway that's where we are in twenty Eighteen it doesn't take much to be accused of being a racist and the word is thrown around so much that it's lost its meaning and definitely lost its bite that's for sure\nBut Megan Kelly is another casualty and it might be a long time before his ear again as far as I Know there is nothing new in the last few hours above the mail bombs by the way up and I just didn't feel like getting into it 'cause there's\nI don't know nothing much has changed anyway I haven't seen anything that makes me think the story smells any better\nI'm going with it wasn't done by somebody who wants to
