up they're treated lenient like she probably won't get the six months ago I think she should\nTo uh take up police time this kind of phony nonsense is is disgusting and it's a way of attacking

while this Florida thing was going on we will will play that in in just a moment\nBut the whole idea that somehow because we have this hurricane\nOr the president isn't allowed to do something else or somehow shows disrespect look\nThis entire obsession\nWith President Trump I think isn't working for Democrats and shouldn't because we're coming up to an election it's going to decide the direction we want to go\nAnd honestly I think that when you take a look at situations like this hurricane and a lot of Republicans up there on the Florida Panhandle but there are a lot of Democrats too when there are a lot of people don't really care that much about politics they all need help and support\nAnd I think they're getting that both from their state government under the great governor of Florida Rick Scott\nAnd they're getting it from the federal government doing a decent job\nSo the freak out and the attempt to make this count politically against the president seems to me utterly inappropriate when we come back I play with them\nWith Chris Matthews has to say no thrill up his leg but he is um he's angry at President Trump\nFor what they're doing something no other policy has

course\nWork by taking changes in our country written erections supported by liberals and conservatives you know that's my argument and if you do that by\nRestoring inflation guarded minimum wage preferred remaining workers making most and inflation adjusted wages in the nineties fix the\nMove toward a flow matter for free choice of doctor and hospital much less expensive and starting enforcing the law against drug industry and other industrial\n... price\nAnd let me do all the recipe for a moment and Medicare for all and by the way I um [noise] there there are millions and millions of Americans who depend on Medicare who needed who'd a live\nA ... minute and a ... ... how where do you find the money to pay for Medicare or a a literally a hundred million people may be more who has never paid in to Medicare\nWell plenty of places number one it's a much more efficient system so you're cutting your administrative expenses for over twenty two percent to about four percent that's experience in Canada\nWhere ... wait wait and hope you're talking about right now there are literally tens of millions of people I think the number is well over a hundred million I think it might be close to two hundred million who are covered by workplace insurance at least in part\nYeah so uh where where do you get this money to put them on Medicare\nWell they wouldn't have to pay their insurance the employers wouldn't have to be more competitive with foreign company companies have their insurance paid by a public sources\nSo is it isn't that isn't that a big give away during the ...\nThe tax system is crazy I mean you know you got corporations today paying two per cent touch three percent tax look at the banks apple and they're they're they're paying virtually nothing or some workers paying twenty three twenty five percent tax going to work every day\nOr the other thing is I get rid of offer offer I Know you agree with that that's hundreds of billions of dollars a year\nAnd the other thing is to crack down on criminal fraud fraud on Medicare from these Ventura sixty million just on Medicare so we have to re felt the corrupt inefficient discriminatory system that is increasingly saying to the American people die\nOkay politically do you think any of these things can possibly happen say if the Democrats take over the house and the Republicans maintain control of the Senate and President Trump continues as he will as our commander in chief\nYou know I think the the wage increase supported by Seventy five percent of the people without even a campaign because of all these people\nYou're talking about increasing the minimum wage\nAnd you see Amazon was going up to Fifteen although a couple of loopholes so a lot of these companies you know Wal Mart is going toward twelve dollars of federal seven dollars and twenty five cents I think the Republicans I get the message on that politically for twenty twenty\nOkay so you raise the minimum wage let's say ... raised first stage even all the way to twelve dollars I'm\nGiven the fact that in in most big cities in many jurisdictions have already raised the minimum wage or does and have a profound effect on the American economy\nYou're increasing consumer demand people can buy more than ... necessities on the table you don't get many savings from increase minimum wage because they can't afford to pay and so I got to buy goods and services for the economy I mean the concern demand is two thirds of our economy\nUm what about economic growth or what happens economic growth they have all of a sudden uh you are in increasing or the amount of pay you're offering at a time when even right now there's a labor shortage\nWelcome to deliver on because millions of people have not come into the marketplace wherever smaller number of people have been paying jobs now than many years because of all the drop of people just couldn't get jobs in\nPrior years no thing is you know

Ralph Nader his new book is called to the rampart see also calls for\nVery major changes and reforms in our political system including jumping the electoral college they're actually a lot of Americans according pulling who agree with that but I actually it is a complete fantasy because it never ever can happen\nOr I Want to get back to Ralph Nader and we'll talk with your calls one eight hundred and Ninety five by Seventeen Seventy six about how exactly you get rid of the electoral college without basically granting the whole amendment process and the constitution we'll be right than\nMichael Mitchell wants to marry this is\n\nBut part of what that means is that the ah the states the various states to sign onto it or would be pledged to actually give all the electoral votes in their states to not to the person who wins the popular vote in the state but the person who wins the national popular vote\nSo suddenly make the electoral college would still exist I guess but it will become irrelevant much\nAccess being naturalized\nOkay I Do you know I I Do think there are people who are already preparing legal challenges to that compact idea plus right now all the states you mentioned are very very blue state very liberal state do you see any support for this compact idea from some of the more conservative states\nYeah the next time Republicans won the popular vote for president and lose the electoral college vote when you get the rest of the states in a landslide\nBy the way you know that's never happened the only popular vote losers who has ever been elected I'm actually are a Republican or and John's on the adolescent in\nTwo thousand part because of carrying guns sixteen thousand more votes and were carrying Ohio and won the electoral college battle or even don't work out more votes popularly\nSolves true that is a danger I I liked the idea Ralph and I've talked about on the air before\nOf everybody going to the Nebraska and Maine system that you break it down by congressional district but in order to do that you'd have to really make a nonpartisan not gerrymandered a portion of congressional districts what do you think about that you have to enter a\nStep

president and see what what country does\nOkay well our our country does and it's actually historically it's worked out a okay I mean and president Hayes wasn't a disaster some of his name President Bush wasn't a disaster\nAnd are certainly hope that President Trump will continue to enjoy some of the success he's enjoyed so far Ralph Nader has enjoyed great success with his literary legal and

the state's death penalty today ruling that it had been used in an arbitrary and racially discriminatory manner now there are not hundreds of people on death row in Washington there are eight\nWell that's not true now ... let me let me go over some of the people who are on death row in the state of Washington and all of these people have been given quite literally a new lease on life by the nine justices of the Washington state Supreme Court they are virtually\nAll ultra liberal and\nThat should not be a decision that is made by the court if the legislature wants to eliminate the death penalty then that's okay but eliminating the death penalty for people who have already gone to trial who have been condemned who have been sentenced\nPeople like Robert Robert ... he's a serial killer he was responsible for the deaths of more than a dozen women many in Spokane area he was convicted in two thousand two for the murders of a twenty four year old named uh Melinda Mercer and the thirty

that the court intervenes on behalf of someone like that I mentioned that there was another case that shows you exactly why you need this by the way ... also white\nThe and I mentioned that because the Supreme Court is using racial injustice as the basis for throwing out the death penalty on these folks who have all been arrested they'd been tried they've been been investigating been convicted again and again and again and again\nAnd they deserve the death penalty\nParticularly Byron sure why he was convicted of killing a correctional officer named Jamie bendel by strangling her with an

talking about all the time just talking about a briefly with a Ralph Nader go to don't touch my Medicare dot com because you'll find out why all this talk about Medicare for all\nReally amounts to Medicare for none because what they're doing is they're taking money that people have paid in over the years now of course that money's not there's a bunch of vial use but it's people money to people paid in over the years to pay for Medicare for their own Medicare\nAnd uh all of a sudden you're going to give Medicare to everybody in the country really and where's that money supposed to come from

state Senate passed\nA guy who says he and his grandson were almost sit by flying objects a while they were at the pool is is filing one of the suits and the leasing company that owns the condos falling on for damage is done that they say a Antonio refuses to pay now Antonio says he's innocent until proven so we'll see this is alleged\nAnd we do have the presumption of innocence around here\nBut my question a couple of days ago was how does the guy who seems seems\nTo have been caught throwing large objects from the fourteenth floor of a building\nNot interested I got my answer from the north Miami Beach cops last night believe it or not or I call down there they actually called me back last night\nAfter I left a message and the the cop that I talked to a he said that he told me that the reason no arrest was made was because it happened on private property and the owner of the property isn't pressing charges this is all very interesting to me because\nUh I Know are going back a long time not just the Steelers but NFL players\nAh I've talked to guys who were working as a detectives in the cities in the city of Pittsburgh back as far as the fifties talking about Steelers being arrested and then disappearing meaning disappearing from the jail cell or a the charges being dropped in this was going on for a long time\nSo I you know NFL players tend to get a break so I was just wondering how somebody could get away with throwing\nYou know a a a an Ottoman off of a balcony and the cops also the ... told me that to be fair that they they're they don't think he didn't think there was anything in the report about large objects or not that you know from the fourteenth for how large is to have to be hurt you or maybe kill you\nBut uh well anyway I after I talked to that cop and the north beach in North Miami Beach cop or he is I was finishing up with him he said you might want to call the Hollywood uh Florida cops and asked them about some issues they've had with a Antonio Brown so I did\nAnd I found out that in March and again in July of twenty sixteen the cops had to come to Antonio's house because his girlfriend and called and said that the cops need to come so you can imagine what that is all about\nAh especially from a guy who likes to throw ... may may like to throw large objects or medium size objects or even small objects awful fourteenth floor balcony\nAh I don't think he's the if if he did do that a ... probably not the kind of guy you want to be around when he's not happy so um anyway\nUm they said that uh he he had\nHad issues twice um with um his girlfriend having called the cops\nAnd I did actually read the police report and neither report mentioned any violence actually actually went out of it on the way that whoever ... did the report said there were no bruises no indication of any kind of physical issue so\nLet's get that all the way there was nothing like that but let's just say as I said the other day from the quote Chuck and all of us Sydney Thornton\nAntonio has many problems and they are great\nUm I was told some interesting things by the way bought it appears he was paid to make\nUp and do boys a PA right up the road here a couple of years ago\nAnd let's just say that after they invited him up once and pay them a good chunk of money they and inviting them back okay\nUh and sorry to say this because he's a great player but Antonio Brown\nI don't know it looks like one of those guys who is headed for a bad ending I don't mean necessarily\nAre well I made a bad ending like bankruptcy or having serious problems uh especially when he doesn't have football taking up his time in a few years I just don't like I don't like his future that a lot of money and I don't know if he's going to still have a lot when he's done anyway then there's Kanye West\nOr who showed up speaking of having a lot of money he showed up in the oval office today wearing a make America great again hat\nAnd ah give you credit he's taking a lot of heat from the black establishment because of his support for Donald Trump he apparently has been given permission by whoever it is in the black community who gets
