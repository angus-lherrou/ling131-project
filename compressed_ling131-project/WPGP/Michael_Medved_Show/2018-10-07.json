I Believe that everyone if every one of the three males affiliated with the direct presentation of this show tripled gee the living martyr and I have feminine sucks\nI Do I Believe that and sure enough tripled jeeze feminine side came out where he said he would like to get a gift not a gift card\nAfter I laughed at him for about five minutes we resume the conversation\n[laughter] [laughter]\nThat they have gift cards when I was growing up not only that they had cars that yes running water showers bats yes no no no no it's amazing even even automatic transmission\nThat that's amazing I Know I Know I Can't believe that question did they have gift cards while he was that held his that hilarious they've gift cards no no they was invented when you were born oh my God\nIt's this generation we keep him around as like a sort of a a a you know to stay in touch with what\nThe with what the the new folk think anyway one aide Prager seven seven six eight seven seven to for three triple seven six\nAnd that is that that's the theory that I'm I'm working on women love to and by the way there's no better or worse here this is the er at all there there is no such thing in this regard I'm simply offering you may be wrong by the way I I maybe I I think I'm right\nNow obviously or I wouldn't have said it but you know what it what is your take see and I I Know in this case by the way you may be curious I think I should add that show what is your Dennis prayers feminine side and I said it to these guys and the the the living martyr didn't fully believe me I don't know why\nI have no agenda here I think I Know why he doesn't really believe I have a feminine side this has been a ... [laughter] no no no no no he doesn't believe I have a feminine side yes\nAnd he's wrong and I give you an example I prefer in movies I prefer romantic comedies\nTo slash him showed um\nUh dramas where you know action to action dramas men law yes Ben love high speed car chases\nThe guy shot him and this and and as it does do not explode should such explosion [laughter] drive explosions [laughter] that was great\nI I I I I I turned to the popcorn vendor when the when there's an explosion it it it does nothing for me\nBut a romantic comedy I Am totally enthralled I Love it I I Believe it I moved into the whole situation\nI mean I Love sleepless in Seattle I I was riveted\nYes\nI Know that guy's a yes or you don't even have to turn it off that's right triple ... so the living martyr is in the middle you liked both correct that was your statement you like a romantic comedies and and the explosions okay fine\nBy the way I did like I Love James Bond movies that I admit\nBut that was when I was when he smoked cigars and and the love women I have to weigh in the ... the early days and and that's right and gift cards that's correct if you see Dr know you see that the number of it as a gift card slip through them that is exactly right\nYeah yeah and exploded the gift card did explode so everybody was happy that the guys were happy and you know what if [laughter]\nSo I Am this this is a male female should is devoted to Dennis this theory on gift card versus gift\nI didn't ask my wife I I I I I you know as well as I Know her I\nCould see what do you think you know my wife very well why do you think or sue would or would would uh answer\nIt's a tough one what would your wife answer I suspect the gift yeah okay I I Do I Know there is a good argument in both I think if she likes the gift I think she'd be very touched\nBut I wouldn't be touched too if I liked the gift but the chances of your getting me something that would that I Would enjoy as much as me getting me that\n... are are very small ... who knows better what I Want than I that's my that's my rational bail brain talking\nSo let's say if if there's a hundred dollar gift right so it's a generous give a hundred dollar gift that somebody's spends they have fought to it\nAnd and I know they gave thought to it but it's not what I Would choose for me of course I'd rather have a hundred dollar gift certificate but people think this is another thing people think that you're getting them a gift certificate chose you didn't think you took the easy way out\nBut I I I don't relate to that at all\nListen don't couples set up one of the call when they set up an account at a at a department store or a furniture store\nYou you know what I mean you know ... people no no come on guys you guys are so out of it you don't ... couples marrying set up a thing what is it called\n[laughter] this is a problem when you work with men\n\nUh any way they set up an account and you to use the past that way they could get the the the dishes they want they could get their register that thank you that's right they register with a store now All right\nYou're right I should've known knowing romantic comedies but the last time there was a registry even a romantic comedy was Eighteen sixty nine the first or a picture of the ticket so now that's an example though right\nThat's like a gift card\n... are couples are touched by that if you give in to their registry [noise] All right this is my uh this is my question here we're going to take a vote\nOne eight Prager seven seven six you're listening to the dentist Prager show male female our the dentist Springer show live from the relief factor pain free studio\nThe ... show All right Christine I'm Sorry that you were even tangentially related to this sad moment\nShe there oh okay yes I Am okay go ahead it is it is I I Hope she didn't get in trouble [laughter] well she high but\nIt's over [laughter] hey go ahead I\nI honestly I prefer cash because the car and they have much sports leg off of gift card\nLike his paper lose on the\nTwenty five dollar gift card yeah something for twenty twenty bucks to weapon that gets quiet and you're going to be\nAll that is a very good point I never thought of that so much money that\nWay you know what this thing that it's very interesting you're so right but there's something\nThat seems a bit about well if yeah it seems almost tacky and it's and um and it's ridiculous because it's no different from a gift card but I don't know when you give a guy an envelope with a hundred dollar bill said again\nI don't you get to stand on the\nCat you know no you're right I I couldn't agree more\nThat you might be the cast wrapped up in the life little gift\n[laughter] a big one [laughter] [laughter] well that's why [laughter]\nVery funny that's a very funny for you give somebody gets a big box the bail open it up there's a hundred dollar bill on the bottom [laughter]\nYeah [laughter] All right I agree with you know\nThat was what I Want better than me and it and it at my age you know one company though by\nWhite so you're sixty three I'm forty three would have preferred a gift yeah\nAll right so I don't think see I don't think it's age related I I have to yeah I I don't I think I think it's more sex related and that's my theory but I you know obviously you you do you prefer the the the money\nUh there's a there's a there's a very er here All right good we have a male who prefers the gift will take a thank you Christine Marty in Indianapolis, Indiana Hi\nHey Dennis I'm a first time caller as well the first time that you're right now you gotta you gotta feed on that river crew there but\nYou would have the time of your life\nBecause just the people you'd be ...\nI ... I reckon I Would I'm loving the show I got a pagan birth pilot or in a as a male I'd say that I prefer I yes I think you know your ticket later that it shows a lot more effort and I happen to agree with that statement very much so [noise]\nAll right stay on because I'm going to ask you what you think of my theory what'd you say [noise] I'm not going to call them a woman [noise]\n[noise]\n\n[noise]\nWithout ...
