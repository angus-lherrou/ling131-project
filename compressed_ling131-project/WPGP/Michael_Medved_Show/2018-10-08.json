Christine Blasey Ford\nAnd then you hadn't testimony from Brett Kavanaugh very very high profile everyone's watching on TV a lot of interruptions from demonstrators\nNo I don't think there were any there weren't whether Germany nobody nobody know that now somehow they were able for that to control these idiots\nAnd I'm Sorry I think people who are screaming about murder and things like that or are idiots indeed\nHonestly if they can control it in a high profile situation they shooting troll it every day\nThis is like a banana republic it is not appropriate for the world's greatest constitutional republic that people should be able to come on and into the galleries and screaming shout and by the way one of the things that has to happen is really prosecuting these people\nAnd I'm making them feel the disrupting congressman doing its job and by the way\nI Would include all of the conservative demonstrators who do that kind of thing as well why do I say that because there are

them screaming shouting and sounding like this\n[noise]\nWhat\nWhat is the [noise]\nWhat is the the clear message here that we're supposed to be getting I Will tell you I think there's a clear message is overwhelmingly where\nIf you think this stuff is good for our country and then of course you want to vote democratic coming up a month from now you you do because the Democrats will guarantee much much much much more of this with impeachment investigations and lots of investigations and lots of hysteria and the end of the republic as we know it\nUh and basically some of the Democrats on the

think he's talking about uh uh he even analogize is the uh the Edmund Pettus bridge in Selma, Alabama\nWith people getting their heads bashed in we're has there been some cruelty where some salt on

anything\nHe wasn't called the radical he wasn't he wasn't cold heartless Merrick Garland a basically they postponed I'm considering his appointment because of when it was announced\nAnd but there was no attempt to smear him in any way and nor do I know of any basis to smear him but go ahead\nMan nothing about the fact of the matter is actually a few sexual a felt\nNo no there were not it was only I'm Sorry and this is very important\nThat um there was nothing injustice Kavanaugh's record nothing\nInvolving sexual harassment sexual assault sexual charges misbehavior there were no ex wives there

the time that a big article ... courts legitimacy\nCrisis is by Michael ...\nAnd he makes an interesting point which is that for justice Gorsuch injustice Kavanaugh they're the only two justices in

that's not something that she said apparently something she led the put out there and her name I think we make a mistake if we wanted to attack\nA Dr Ford as some kind of despicable person I think she's\nI think I Do I Do question our credibility I don't think she has been tried and credible and any of it but I I think she may in one level believe that there was actually an argument about this

anything that has produced of this this level of of negativity and craziness and hatred the Bork battle was close\nThe Clarence Thomas battle was close\nBut what's interesting about that is there were a bunch of Democrats who voted to confirm Clarence Thomas\nThey weren't\nThere were unfortunately a bunch of Republicans who turned against\nJudge Bork\nAnd here it was such a strict party line thing but Susan Collins I think spoke so well for people who may be in there are a bunch of Americans who are\nGenuinely undecided anybody who still undecided and you don't know well how do they handle it or what is really Kavanaugh about\nShould listen to Susan's calling speech she made this clear\nI'm OK we will get to that in a moment she made clear\nThat she believes that\nChristine Blasey Ford was assaulted\nBut she believes not by I'm Brett Kavanaugh\nAnd this is what Mazie Hirono the gentle lady of Hawaii I actually the most pathetic of of all of the Democrats and the Judiciary Committee this is what senator Hirono had to say about Susan Collins\nAnd you think that senator Collins is insulting to provide for for what to say that she thinks that back and forth I think that to the south or what does that and see the focus\nOf the herself that vaccines are so many survivors\nAre from her ... and now for all of us have been very sorry have an across from survivor of going back many many years where they kept all these phone calls come out at a cost to themselves\nAnd what happens with survivors that they did not come forward I hung out that in your interview that she kept saying that there was no cooperation are those are cooperation ... balls assertion\nWell probably a pilot study 'cause it was only one point four million dollar only now overall every year ha Jeff Dole's out about four hundred and fifty billion dollars worth of grants to put that in perspective\nUS military every year at the department of defense or total budget is six hundred billion dollars\nWow wow look at it in terms of what you were talking about with open the books dot com you have a a basic approach which is the transparency is the\nOnly way to solve this is letting people know what's going on and President Trump doesn't have to get this through Congress he could do it on his own right\nWell and that's that's the plan on the strategy that we outline first that the wall Street Journal then at USA Today and it's a three pronged attack and as the commander in chief at this moment that our nation's history when we feel that spending is a crisis\nThe president can take the three pronged approach and he should lead by example he should post all White House expenditures and then step to cut the federal agency waste and step three and this is my favorite part Michel he should report the American people\nShow us how he's defending the American taxpayer by cutting waste fraud and taxpayer abuse and we believe that he should do Twitter to do the reporting\nI think it's a great idea and by the way you also suggest here that there should be an across the board cut in every federal department beginning with a White House and this was something I wrote a book about the White House staff years ago\nAnd man is there a lot of waste and ridiculous nest in terms of the Fifteen hundred people who work in the White House staff at the President Roosevelt one world war two\nWith a hundred and six White House aides total and what is it that we need Fifteen times that number for today\nI I don't I don't get that at all what what about can you give us some background on the um the two hundred thousand six hundred one dollars that our government spends on a new condom design with a additional lubrication why why does the federal government spend on that\nYou know the economy ministry it's a very competitive industry\nBut I'm a two hundred thousand dollars floated or Boston, Massachusetts is a private company for new condom design this is just one of the grants now they're obviously a small company we did identify Michael\nAt the fortune one hundred these are our most successful companies in the entire world certainly in this country that over a three year period they received three point three billion dollars worth of our money American taxpayer subsidies and they cannot argue that they need our money\nUh there's another one here which is a cigar taste test in Virginia for a hundred and fourteen thousand three hundred and Seventy five dollars how could they hold the spending to just a hundred and fourteen thousand dollars for the cigar taste tests\nAnd there's a lot of studies like that one point one million dollars of our taxpayer money went to prepare America's religions for the discovery of extraterrestrial life one million dollars went for a study on where it hurts the most to be stunned by me\nOkay ... I guess is the theory is that if the government doesn't prepare you for the arrival of Esther extraterrestrials who will then we also spend money looking for extraterrestrial only government might\nWell I think that was an inside deal that was twenty million dollars that the one that went to one of Harry Reid's friends and they went out looking for extraterrestrial life\nOkay people should should get involved with this and what I Love is the three pronged approach which is number one President Trump begin by showing how every penny and spent in the White House and a number two he touched the White House staff\nBy ten percent and then orders every other federal departments cut by five percent and then number three he starts giving us updates every month on this war on waste because this is a war we can actually win\nIf you want to find out more about this uh go to our website to Michael ... dot com will link you write to open the books dot com\nThat's open the books dot com or Adam ... is the founder and the c._e._o. and I think you're doing the Lord's work my friend and I hope you continue and have great success with it we will be right back on the Michael ...

it to have you on the shoulder say hello can get out okay you're an idiot\nSo he he's actually getting away with saying stuff like that on national TV and the scary thing is that there are people sitting there nodding their heads as he's saying and they know that's where I can uh I never thought of that what is this two cents for every state thing who came up with that idea\nBut anyway he thinks that's a good idea\nUm and and that kind of stupidity as I said just you should be gone but there were people actually beating on the doors of the Supreme Court a building during Kavanaugh's
