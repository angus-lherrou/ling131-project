barbarism\nThe only file remedy for this Supreme and catastrophic evil is a federal union of the people that's what they believe that's exactly right\nBe turned out to be wrong by the way a Hitler was a race is not a national was he actually had found contempt for the German people as he made clear in his final diatribe yelling at them for losing cultural losers\nSo it was worthy of extended

national sovereignty use the root cause of the most time out of the steady march of humanity back to tragic disaster and barbarism the only final remedy for the Supreme of catastrophic evil of our

better\nSo but the left believe people were basically good especially themselves they know that they are basically good because they're enlightened and therefore\nAll the power that they could have will only be\nUsed benign only that is what they believe these people are fools by definition left this may be sweet they may be a whole host of things but to the extent that they have left wing views they're fools and foolishness begins with the belief\nThat power concentrated in a few people's hands if they are lightened enough is just wonderful they really do believe essentially in benign dictatorships that's what they believe the founders believed in diffusion of power separation of powers\nThat's why we have a Congress that's why we have an executive and that's why we have a court that is also why we have a U.S Senate to diffuse power among the states the left\nHates the Senate hates the Senate\nBecause it doesn't just reflect majority will because after all Wyoming with the with fewer and fewer than a million people has as many senators is California was while I don't know thirty million forty million people but it's completely non democratic which is exactly what they wanted it to be\nThey did not believe in democracy that is from their perspective and its lack of faith in humanity mob rule\nSo folks this is just unknown today because you don't learn that at school

then it's great to concentrate power in a few people's hands if you don't believe people were basically good you have to be idiots to concentrate all that power in the few people\nBut as I said they

what people would vote for but I think most people would say what you mean that's the point it's not valued\nLet me tell you ... where is is that my whole life it it it's been a ... a love or want to understand what is wisdom understand me life that is what wisdom is okay it's a it's it's the single word term for understanding of life\nYou can know a great deal and understand nothing\nThat is why the highly educated are usually the least wise members of our society\nHey because universities teach the opposite of wisdom they teach you to be a fool in my opinion some people a scape on farmed but many build a second to leave because they teach you implicitly from up explicitly\nThat knowledge is what matters rather than wisdom\n\nTo what aside from political correctness and the preoccupation and race and gender what does it show that Shakespeare's poster was taken down at the University of Pennsylvania English department it shows a lack of wisdom\nBecause he wrote the wisest plays written

white person and those of you who are biblical you oriented build up the word food is used pretty often\nWell as the fool the food was the person without wisdom doesn't mean a person without compassion so let me talk to you about compassion for a moment wisdom is infinitely more important than compassion in setting social policy\n\nWith me it's if if you just hear that today it will be very important if if only that sinks in in making political social policy for a society wisdom is infinitely more important than compassion\nCompassion without wisdom is destructive\n\nAnd that's what we have that is what we have in the western world vast amount of compassion or pseudo compassion doesnt matter even if it's genuine compassion but compassion without wisdom is overly destructive\nSo I feel bad for people I'm not going to get into policies are going to continue the discussion about wisdom but I give you an example here\nI feel bad for people\nWho don't have as much as others and so we will give them more benefits but the ... person asks what are you doing to that person and to the society by giving them more and more people benefits\nIs it good for society is a different question that's a question of wisdom is it compassionate is not a question that has anything to do with the wisdom\n\nCompassion without wisdom is destructive\n\nAnd we don't produce people with wisdom because wisdom is taught wisdom is soft\nIt isn't taught because it isn't solved\n\nI Believe ultimately that the\nRadical secularization of western society is at the core of the lack of wisdom\n\nWhen I get calls this I have I Know I mentioned before when I get calls here from what's a twelve or Fifteen\nYear old and the kid talks about important things of life I Am certain that they are in a religious home and in every case that it's turned out to be true\nThe twelve or Fifteen year old if they would even listen to discussions of great issues like I have my show even if they even will they would call in about let's say you ... the planet\nThey wouldn't call in about an issue of wisdom\nThey would be worried for people they would be again compassionate without wisdom\n\nThis is the great problem they realized that college so I have all these professors\nWho are very very bright very very male legible at an early on Wall eyes\nThey didn't understand life\nI fear for a society
