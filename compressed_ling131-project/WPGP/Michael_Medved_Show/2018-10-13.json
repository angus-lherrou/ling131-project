{"month": "10", "state": "PA", "station": "WPGP", "content": "We've talked about choices for claiming Social Security benefits in diversifying your income retirement plan like you would typically diversify your financial portfolio but we've got one more key to this everlasting income\nAnd what is it Roy again nowhere to talk about re purpose in your financial strategy to mess with or or defined okay we're going to talk about Jimmy Fallon says\nI saw that with them to use me over to pointed billion yogurt said he was getting tired but Web MD sitter could either be go oh you were scared of it but if you're ... purchasing just as Web MD is talking about their your financial strategy think about what you're up against right now\nBut can you walk into your favorite of\n... or you walk into your favorite sporting goods store and there's an item that you would be er a biker\nOr a ... lotta motorcycle got just a viewer riding the bike trail and you get a good bike or you've been looking at this by going\nOn and on the floor there forever but it's expensive it's a couple of thousand dollars\nYou know or you know walking their pay for that at all time high or you're going away for that\nBy going to cause right now the mortgage is at an all time high when I look at the market it scares me\nAs to where it is relative to where it probably will be in a year or two if that doesn't go against your grade if it if it's not what you've heard if you were raised her differently you don't buy into the market when it's at a high you buy in when the mortgage that will lower time\nIs scares me that some of these people were throwing so much money into the more specially\nThe money that they're going to be determined there'll be determined they need for income in retirement\nWell and and this isn't to insult anybody is listening but it doesn't take a rocket scientist to know that the market is overpriced and at some point reality is going to be priced back in\nIf you're close to retirement you're being told to be conservative by putting all the money into bonds you bond funds be very careful with that bonds or traded on the stock market they are not ... the way that we look at truly would have ... should be\nRe think that strategy and that's what we're talking about in this segment refurbishing your financial strategy and return\nYeah and re purpose could mean a couple of different things that you know you're asking yourself\nWhat should I Do read purpose might be okay look I'm not going to go out and leave the market or you know we've seen a doubt I'm twenty two thousand essentially here from a low of sixty seven hundred folks back in March of two thousand nine those are ridiculous type growth numbers in a short period of time\nRelatively speaking so I'm not saying that all you need to go out and employ the ostrich strategy where you're just going to throw your head in the sand\nUm you know and I'm trying to get through this whole statement that now wondering if I have ... I Am tired from\n[laughter] I Do not I might but I have to buy it had a chance all it is as I as I struggled through this\nKnow I I think of the fact that who really could get burned\nOr those passive type investors that the people that have revealed that rely on the index fund the numbers don't live you're a long long term investor here Fifteen Years twenty year investor you're passive strategy you just owning maybe three core index funds low cost set it and forget it that's probably going to work\nBut when you make that change and say look I'm a retirement investor I'm now on a fixed income I now have a shorter time horizon then I had when I started investing and the markets at an all time high\nThose are the things that you can't be holding and just sitting on and hoping you're going to work out maybe you need to employ and active strategy you know maybe you need to move into even though the costs might go up temporarily you might need to consider look I might need a money manager who has a more conservative bent\nA and certainly unbiased and saying that because that's what we do here at synergy group but maybe building a portfolio that can stay in the market but kind of\nReact so that if you you don't wake up in the morning and someone is through a a bomb and did the New York city and I you know I hate to use it and I don't say slipping Lee but\nUh you know the fact of the matter is if that happened then your money is already planned in terms of how it will be moved around rather than just sitting in some type of passive investment so you need to rethink and re purpose your financial strategy for the times we live on and is that we live in here and it's time\nTo look at diversification in a broader sense there'll be on just stocks and bonds\nThat you pointed out the key issue in bonds especially and mutual funds\nYou might need to rethink moving to individual bonds instead of bond funds are international bonds\nOr or more high yield bond that sometimes would carry higher risk but you have to look at this environment and you might need to get rid of bonds altogether\nThis is where the folks that say look let's throw annuities in the garbage because they lock your money up because they're too confusing are really dealing in my opinion a disservice to their clients because not everybody needs an annuity\nBut a new any could be a great bond replacement for providing that five six percent type of guaranteed predictable income with principle protection when we're talking about the fix type of options that can't be provided and areas that it used to be able to be provided so\nI mean I don't know if you're sitting out there and saying look I'm On the right track or not but I Will tell you that you probably need some fresh ideas\nYour assets because it is different now and retirement than it used to be and trying to figure out this figure this out on your own is difficult so we're here\nEight hundred three to one Seventy nine sixty three eight hundred three to one Seventy nine sixty three if nothing else\nThat don't have a cup of coffee to figure out the steps that you can take the choices that you can make to put these improvements in place that you can kind of get a where you need to be and have protection um and and we can show you how to re purpose the best part is is you make the decision we don't pressure we just give you the information eight hundred\nThree to one Seventy nine sixty three\nYeah I think it's important to restate that our philosophy I returned my philosophy that we've used with clients goes well beyond just stocks and bonds like you were saying Jay there's so many other\nInvestment options out there that ad predictability especially when it comes to this income planning peace and if you do want some fresh ideas on how to allocate your assets\nCertainly you are open to advice that his tailored specifically for you know if you're retired or retiring within the next ten years give us a call request to visit with our team eight hundred three to one Seventy nine sixty three you need to get your\nIncome retirement plan review today and that includes a risk analysis on your current position that includes the analysis on your current positions as well because you want to make sure that you reduce fees and risk in retirement as well as build that income plan that you cannot outlive\nYour back to ... to go in and talking about the changing rules the retirement and financial planning and general that's one of the things that we bring to the great discussion and the retirement classes that we conduct that if you're out there saying how can I be better prepared for retirement\nInvest two or three evenings with us in one of those retirement classes there'll be a pit there'll be a community college there'll be a Penn State there'll be scattered throughout the geography but what a wonderful way to get a better understanding of all the rules are changed and what you might be doing\nThe day or to make sure that your retirement even if it's two or three years from do a little bit better you'll see those classes listed on the Web site at synergy group thank God calm\nAnd again you can bumper on the way it was a little bit but rather the events that you'll see where we're going to be a ... year workshop or the classes and invest some time in yourself\nTo make sure that retirements as good as it can be ... and it shouldn't just be bad that comes it should be mom and dad that come sitting there because as a team you're going to walk through retirement you're going to talk about Social Security decisions required them distribution decisions charitable decisions gifting decisions as a team\nThat you should take the time as a team to learn the\nFolks you've been listening to lasagna retiring today we've discussed this three keys to everlasting income let me remind you what those are will do a quick recap\nThe three keys to everlasting income number one income diversification\nNever you know your number what your retirement income number needs to be and finally ... purpose in your investment strategy\nNot doing the same type of investing that you did that got you to retire on it now you need to make it last and and distributed over your lifetime let me say this J I think there might be one more heat everlasting income and that would be working with the right he\nYeah I mean I think that's big you know working with a team\nTo put your interests first you know who works under that they're sharing a standard who uh is going to look at the whole market place not a group of proprietary products that are sitting up on a shelf but an independent advisor who acts as a fiduciary a and who works with the entire marketplace\nIt doesn't take a product off the shelf unless the oil after reviewing it says the product of the show\nI mean I I think that somebody that is focused on retirement and and I say that that you know our focus is on retirement by looking at the clients that we serve\nOr not because we've gone to school for a special license uh it's because that's where we spend our days that's where we spend our time are helping people\nJust like you were listening out there who are concerned about running out of money who are concerned that the markets over inflated who are concerned that the bank or basically pays them you know a bag of peanuts to hold their money and that those are those are big issues those are real issues and we have real solutions and big solutions\nTo help fix them so again you know knowing that there is a group that is what you're looking for out there a group of advisors who are committed to you I'm and dealing with this retirement issue and the challenges that you're concerned with you've just got to take the first step eight hundred three to one\nVisit us online at all real moral travel by far far\nLess baseball canister rant that are and moral travel now want them to America's number one radio

senior nomads staying at air being bees only around the world we've invited them back today to see how they're doing with their world travels\nW Michael welcome back to our world travel next to reconnect with your most\nTo talk to you guys\nWell we appreciate the time today so Mary and I we were preparing for this interview earlier I asked her question and she said Robert just ask it to them so I'm going to do that you know you've been traveling consistently now for over five years living somewhat as locals in air being based on some ... some odd countries are so\nWe talk a lot on this program about the power of traveled to be transformational so I really want to know give me a noticeable way that travel has transform your life since she began this world truck\nClinton had Michael [laughter] I think we're\nI think we're still is curious has ever I think we're we're we're able to see all the difference is that there are around the world and appreciate those differences I think it's um made this humble and Debbie will probably say she'd braver\n[laughter] I Am very very I think that this has given us a prospective outside of our country that we could never have gotten otherwise look back at America and in a different way so are those out there that think they might want to do this twenty four hour your spouse or trans [laughter]\nThat that's actually my question\nFor a a perfect segue Robert and I are obviously married we did the show we travel together all the time we've been doing this for not to show that traveling together for twenty five years I'd love to know what it's done for you guys as a couple because I think that's different than what it does for you individually\nI I totally agree and we're having our fortieth anniversary on Sunday ... thank\nYou thank you even get on our on our marriage [laughter]\nYou know I think that I learned so much about personal dynamics and just the fact that we are flexible with each other now which they are different than like often talked about our rowing boat in the same direction and I think\nWe um we both got our own skills as we got her assignment on a two person team and you know I'm sort of stay in my lane and do the things that I Do well Debbie does the things she does well when you add them together I think it makes it really a great team so I don't think we've ever been closer than we are\nThe irony is that if you're most of the country school bus for colleges and glamorous schools they are now going back in the middle of August so Labor Day just just when we shut everything down\nAnd summer isn't over in most parts of the United states so the first week of Monday in September generally speaking\nTrue I mean according to mother nature's summer doesn't end until the equinox on September twenty first and I'll give you very brief example of that I live in New Jersey and two or three years ago it was over a hundred to share on Labor Day\nAnd on Tuesday or the lifeguards went home beaches shut down everything closed the governor actually had to order the state beaches reopen and the higher lifeguards so people in the state it gets to the beach because of the leaf hot because it was so summer\nSo if you were a number of the United states you suggest we move Labor Day to the third Monday in September but one of your main arguments Renee is that uh it would be an economic who's really handle that fifty seconds left but you're single for fourteen day period about thirty nine billion dollars in direct spending ugly taxes in trickle down benefits\nWould result by extending Labor Day and having people stay on the job\nThat you have to lose by trying to move the day or two weeks according to us travel you took that thirty nine billion dollars you're talking about hundreds of thousands of jobs\nInstead of having a holiday that effectively shut down all of the country's largest industries travel could actually keep it moving for another two weeks two or three weeks long weekends people would\nBe happier and country would probably be economically better off there's there's no real downsides to it\nWhere they make is president of perception here with a interesting idea pushing a Labor Day back to the or a third week of September ... thank you for\nNothing that into our heads I receive something bucks\nThank you very much

right into this you know we are hearing some good things from our contacts but from your perspective how would you say you know the Caribbean is doing these days is a rebound from the twenty Seventeen hurricane season\n[noise] I think what we have found and in fact I spent a good part of the very late spring traveling among some of the most damage to Ireland and from the twenty Seventeen hurricanes and it's\nHard to believe it's been more than a year but in September of course as we all know two enormous hurricanes plowed across the Caribbean and then did also significant damage to the mainland United States Irma and Maria and several of the island groups and islands of the Caribbean\nWere ravaged I'm In ways that we haven't seen in the Caribbean in a very long time and so we really important for us it cost of living to go down we wanted to cover the recovery we wanted to inspire our readers who love the beach and of course and a lot of the Caribbean\nTo go back and spend their money and share their love and help these islands were cover of really great to be there and see that a lot of these beautiful little boutique\nHotels resorts beach bars are back and they're ready and they can't wait for you all to come down\nWell that's very good news Tracey I Know you were recently and one of the U.S Virgin Islands St John is the one I'm thinking of taking their or can you let us

sharing exactly what the southern living hotel collection is and does the collection cover the entire south eastern portion of the country\nAre it does leave work very hard to bring together a hand picked group around twenty two independently owned hotels I'm that includes in bed and breakfast\nSmall ends into larger property but that is um that's how we got to discover these folks there are seven living stories that we ever as we traveled a full region in the south\nAnd we invited these folks to become members of our wedding hotel collection just a few years ago it's relatively new for us but growing rapidly\nCutting hair so from what I understand you do have sort of a wide mix of properties you've got some new properties as well as uh\nSome of the older more iconic hotels that I Would think are deeply rooted in some good old fashioned southern traditions I'm curious for our listeners who have not travelled or state in the southern region of our country can you just described some of that old world sort of southern hospitality that you look for in these properties\nSure I mean the federal building our bags are always that we love to travel but we like to experience very different\nVery recently that said they um parts of the south and hospitality is always number one when we're thinking about what property with along in this collection that for instance you could go to greater Ashville area in the mountains of North Carolina maybe for\nSome beautiful fall color like I didn't like eighty percent of settling living people um consumers book a trip to go to the fall color and she's got seven\nRooms all decorated\nIt looks like the pages that suddenly the magazine and author is based on February ... recipes and her hospitality ... the owner operator and it's like

that's the beginning of it\nHe's constantly asked isn't that great a do you see him in and of course what he means is here's the irony I Do believe there is a threat to democracy and it comes from the
