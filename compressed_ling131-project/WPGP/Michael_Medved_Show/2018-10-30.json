coming up it is hard to believe the president is due to land in Pittsburgh in\nA short while to help anticipate his visit or will be speaking with Lou Weiss who wrote a terrific piece in the wall Street Journal yesterday he's the father of New York times writer Barry wise or he is a long time member\nWas a long time member of the tree of life synagogue which was struck by the terrorist attack\nWhat does he think of the president of the United states are coming to visit Pittsburg\nAt a time when there are some folks including the mayor who is not Jewish by the way the mayor of Pittsburgh saying\nUh know may be the president should not visit there a\nOne eight hundred nine five five Seventeen Seventy six or there is so much going on in this country right now to drive us apart\nAt a time when we really ought to be trying to come together and I think that some of what is driving us apart is naked and cheap and rather ineffective politics on all sides and\n[noise] just strange strange situation because at the same time that I think many many people feel frustrated with both sides of the political debate at the moment\nThere's evidence everywhere that the amount of interest in participation impassioned with this election is just Ryan Zinke and surging and may in fact\nSet records are there are elements of a recent stories that show obviously some of the worst in our country but there are also some stories that show the very best\nAnd one of those stories as it struck me and I'd like to begin with this before we talk to a ... from Pittsburgh\nIt's another story about Pittsburgh and about the way that this entire nightmarish attack was handled which is very very much to the credit of some of the participants ah there is a I'm a doctor\nWho's the doctor in chief and in charge of the hospital to which the killer\nWho is now being arraigned these has twenty nine charges against him yes he faces the death penalty and I think that's appropriate the um\nThe doctor in charge of the hospital introduced himself to Robert ... hours after he was brought in wounded and treated in the hospital\nAnd uh he had um a a\nA very brief word that he delivered when he went in to look at the killer\nAfter he'd been treated here's what he told him he said uh I'm Dr Cohen and this after\nThe killer had been brought into the hospital or screaming or I Want to kill all Jews I Want to kill all the Jews here here is that Dr Cohen his name is Jeffrey Cohen he is the president of the Allegheny General Hospital where some of the victims\nAnd the killer were treated as he says he when he came into the room with the killer there he asked me who I was I said I'm Dr Cohen president of the hospital and I turned around and left\nAnd the FBI agent that was guarding him said I don't know that I could have done that here's what Dr Jeffrey Cohen had to say\nI've been invited to a Steeler game a couple of weeks ago\nMy when I was I had to get back to normal life so I went to the ...\nI talked to the nurse of took care of him before I went down in the game\nAnd he had already broke out as yours is or what all this mess\nOff I went to the game and came back\nBut I went to see the shooter cops was already\nI wanted to try to understand why did you do this\nI mean I have no answers I asked them\nMinnesota varieties of\nBut I produce or sell ... general\nThe FBI agent in charge will diminish a\n... foot of\nRetired for leaders who you know\nAll the chaos is going on the gentleman's if if you're\nA member of the measure society of\nCivil noise\nHere's the noise\nBoys were soldiers or being slaughtered\nOur which harm to rise up and do something\nWe would just use the word ... usually worse or what do you mean to be\nDoing things like this that are hard to force\nOkay I'm at that is a balanced inappropriate statement\nThere are too many harsh and ridiculous words some of them by the way many of them on the left we will get to that Dr Cohen a continued his comments he had this to say\nWe're one very simple mission trip alligators\nWill take care of sick people we don't you have questions where they are\nAsk questions about ...\n... patients so it makes a very simple\nOur staff to do the right job\nSo I Will tell you that I'm very proud of their father did a great job\nSomebody who is yelling in the ambulance sort of odd spittle I Want to kill all the Jews taking care of by a Jewish or there's a Jewish hospital president\nAnd there was also the attending emergency room doctor who cared for the killer was also Jewish the nurse who cared for and his father is a rabbi and I'm\nA call in and says Dr Cohn and we just heard from is personally connected to the shooting beyond his role of the hospital he live so close to a tree of life synagogue that on Saturday morning he heard the gunshots as the massacre unfolded he knew nine of the people who were killed nine of the eleven\nThat didn't stop him from going in to check on ours look this is America\nAnd it really is and I I was reminded of something it's not nearly so dramatic because it doesn't involve killing and shooting and horror\nButton involves part of the beautiful part about the United states of America years ago I did a book called hospital which actually was one of the most successful books that I've done it was a big bestseller\nAnd ah it was about some of the pressures that physicians encounter and some of the problems that physicians encounter dealing with those pressures that was a profile of thirty real life medical professionals\nAnd ah when I was getting the book I I went to Pittsburgh and I was doing a TV show and I was I'm told I was going to be on the show\nWith a um a a leading expert on substance abuse who treated a lot of doctors who would come to substance abuse so I come to the TV studio\nAnd uh there is a husk Hasidic rabbi who was sitting there and um I introduced myself\nAnd he says oh I'm I'm Dr ... and and he is uh Hasidic rabbi and he is also one of the world's leading experts on substance abuse\nAnd he is in charge of psychiatry at St Francis hospital a Catholic hospital he graduated from Marquette University a Catholic university\nHe's always been Jewish she's from a prominent Hasidic dynasty I was floored because I Know this rabbi ... from his work he's written one of the best Bible commentaries I've\nEver read period it's called live every day and [noise] ... again there's something about that there's something about the story and it it actually move\nMe to tears up to date the local Muslim association in Pittsburgh has announced they've raised the hundred and Ninety thousand dollars to help the people a tree of life congregation at the service that they held in Pittsburgh on Sunday\nAfter the shooting the a\nMuslim leaders of the community were very prominently involved and given some of the harshness between Jews and the state of Israel and and Muslims around the world this is a beautiful thing and it is a great tribute to the United states of America\nI think it's also a great tribute to the United states of America that um many people most people are going to welcome the president of the United states respectfully\nAnd with dignity and gratitude when he comes to Pittsburgh or in moments frankly we're going to be speaking to a Pittsburgh are named Lou whites\nLewis talked about some of the internal evil aspects of what happened in his city or we'll be right back with that and with your calls on the ...

numerous accounts I Can't keep track for every email I read to appear as a reading that one so I just cannot keep up with it I've received many emails that I'm\nNot happy with those words on this

better than this we can be better than it is\nOkay he is completely correct\nAnd yeah it's it's not appropriate at this point it's always a purpose to disagree that's our fundamental American right and disagree in criticized but the idea of hatred of up calling the other side of evil or a very prominent Democrats just called President Trump's\nEvil evil or it's completely out of bounds one eight

the right person I'm thinking of your young man\nYeah yeah okay go go ahead\nSo my comment with the uh shooting I mean\nWhat the media and the mayor of Pittsburgh and anyone else who wants to blame the tragedy on Trump they should just be quiet and let the president do the right thing and respect the dead I mean blame murders for their crime and do not bring some politician you do not agree with into it\nI yeah and and again this is a time when even people who you made profoundly disagree with are are feeling some of the same things I mean this is one of the\nOne of the things about the nature of the shooting I have not heard anyone and not even David Duke or some of the prominent American Nazis or I even have a ... even ISIS I don't\nThink has a commended Robert Bowers for what he did and I I mean I I don't know if you've heard the story earlier Jose about\nI'm a doctor\nCohen who is the president of Allegheny General Hospital who came in and introduced himself to Mr ... hours after he got out of the emergency room it's a powerful statement or really again we're all Americans\nAre above all we're human beings above all\nThe um the the attempt to try to blame one side of the other it's it's just wrong and and by the way to blame mass media for this\nIs just wrong now having said that do I think that uh\nThere might be more attention paid by a media platform like\nGab dot

American Jewish history Jews first came to what is today America when they came to New Amsterdam which later became New York on Manhattan Island\nSixteen fifty four right I mean shortly after the Mayflower as thirty four years after the Mayflower okay\nThat's an amazing thing and there's a piece in um a local paper I don't even want to say which one because I don't want to embarrass the person who wrote it but uh she writes the Jewish community held a vigil in solidarity with the people of Pittsburgh\nWhy is it okay\nFor a former presidential candidate very prominent presidential candidate former U.S governor [noise]\nEnded up by the way a physician\nAnd or somebody who should know a lot better Helen how we dean the former Democratic national chair\nWas just on MSNBC and Governor Dean had this to say about the way he perceives the current struggle politically as a fight between good and evil listen\nLook evil lurks in the hearts of men that and it does and what Trump has tapped into is he\nA and eventually will overcome that because of the Republicans are always about the past and they're always about fear of the future and the Democrats are made plenty of mistakes but they are about the future at idealism and making America a better place I think in the end hope wins over evil but it takes a long\nBut it works both of those working humankind and that's what this struggle of out from that this has now become a struggle about good versus evil and the president of the United states is evil [laughter]\n\n\nHave you in a normal country that would be a reason to alert the secret service the president of the United states is evil [noise]\nAh does anyone think that's acceptable one eight hundred nine five five\nSeventeen Seventy six I Know I Know they're going to be close to call in and say\nWell Trump calls the other side of evil\nActually I spent some time yesterday\nI tried to look that up about times that prompted use the term evil to describe specific opponents look he uses all kinds of ... in in temperate language and I wish he would he just uh may have helped the governor of Florida when\nUh the Democratic candidate for governor in Florida when the race which I think is a shame because I wanted very much to see Ron descent as the Republican win that race but it's wrong for the president to call the mayor of Tallahassee stone cold these\nUm any ages did that I I think that mayor Gillum of Tallahassee is morally compromised ethically compromise I think he has a lot of problems\nBut this is the president of the United states you can't use that language Mr President but certainly certainly Howard Dean to say the president of the United states\nIs evil\nDo you think it's appropriate for a former Democratic national chair to use those terms\nOne eight hundred nine five five Seventeen Seventy six this is one of the problems\nIs we have just had a demonstration of evil and there have been three\nCases very prominent cases one not as prominent as the other two\nBut it should be in which really evil was displayed\nThis killing is a double killings a homicide in Louisville and they have apprehended the perpetrator and in lieu of all there was a guy who tried on Sunday to get into a Baptist church a black Baptist church was stopped the door was locked\nHe was armed he apparently had it in mind to kill some black people and then he found two people at random track them down\nOr killed a a one\nOne African American shoppers sixty nine in front of his grandchild\nPut the gun at the back of the guys had assassinated him and then he called a black woman in the parking lot and this was a guy who was just melting off about the N word and ah and\nBy the way it has a history of violence in the history of psychotic behavior\nFormerly married to an African American who he had also abused by beating her and using the N word with her\nUm this is a real problem this is a very real problem\nAnd it's a real problem when you have somebody who sends out\nBombs to Fifteen people none of whom are criminals none of whom are evil but you see this\nIs the problem it is evil to try to blow somebody up because you disagree with him politically\nIt is not evil to disagree with them politically sure you can express contempt or you can express dislike for George Soros or for Brock Obama or for Hillary Clinton\nThere lots and lots of people who dislike them but when you use the term evil it puts it in a different category and it's simply is wrong and what Howard Dean is doing here is wrong it's also deeply wrong with Don Lemon did\nA Don Lemon on CNN\nHad this to say about the biggest terrorist threat our country faces\nI keep trying to point out people not to demonize any one group or any one ethnicity\nBut we keep thinking that the biggest terror threat of something else some some some people who are marching you know towards the border like a feminine so we have to stop demonizing people and realize the

Joe\nHi Michael how are you today I'm very well\nUh I Love listening to your show I find your voice very thing it's like therapy\nOh well good that's my wife was a professional therapist though but go ahead\nYou go I uh I was a Republican uh up until now Donald Trump came along I'm now an independent uh I I I like when you do the things you say you call it like it is I could just sit back and then there's always a buck\nAnd I want to know why there's always a spot in what he is he says what he says it seems like we say oh okay that's just Donald Trump them again so why can't they evil and we why we are up for\nWhat they want to eat all you do you think he's evil yes evil evil is a strong\nWord hit the person I Would say the things he says how we say\nWell wait they'll ... they'll have two different things there are two different things Deborah and this this goes to the heart of your challenge and I it's a great challenge I I think there are things that he says that are outrageous\nSpeech ... in in and of itself to cool speech evil\nIf if you are saying I order you to go out there and murder these people yes that's evil but to make some stupid remark and and Trump makes a stupid embarrassing remark virtually every day I mean it's ... and it's it's tedious after a while because when you talk about what he does\nWhat he has achieved as president you recognize as a former Republican Deborah don't you that he's had some successes as president\nYou know what yeah yeah\nYeah way he's a really doesn't articulate exotic eloquent as nothing about and that is a leader on my mind that the president of the United states but it all it all against everything he does that's good because he he acts like oh\nOkay what would you hold on hold on for a moment at ... alleged bronco bomber was extremely eloquent he was almost always dignified um he spoke very well\nAnd I think he did a terrible job as president as President Trump makes fun of himself frequently he has he has not eloquent or he is often our food and and childish and all those things and but not his record on appointing judges his record even on foreign\nPolicy is record certainly on Middle East policy and his record and managing the economy\nHas been admirable don't you think but it's okay so why\nDo you care more about do you care more about what the president says or what the president does\nAs I got very very well look what's going I think it is important I think he is in ...\nI think it is important but I Would prefer a ... and I'm a president who does the right thing\nAbove a president who says the right thing\nBut it's a profound challenge and I appreciate it we will be right back\nWith a Nazi Halloween no really coming up entertained your brain\nYou know the American was the minority a lotta times ... American lost their job they ship than somebody and and and this has nothing to do with the synagogue shooting but I'm just saying a lot of people are angry people have to understand that there's\nTwo angry groups' share it's not just the minorities and the blacks I mean the women it's the regular average person white what have you and it's been going on for far too long\nI look I agree with you I think there's too much anger in the United states so what are you saying should be done about it\nI don't think the founding fathers said beware of the factions you're very smart you know the constitution and he thought they should not be practicing identity politics and and showing them and we're working with these groups everybody's supposed to be equal you don't get them\nPositive rights because this is what starting all the problems\nWell the the point is you don't give people ... you get people's rights based upon their status as citizens of the United states not upon special status of a citizen of a certain ethnicity or certain heritage and I think you're entirely correct It's one of the reasons that one of the most toxic ideas\nWhich by the way it seems that the Democrats have largely ... dropped is this notion of reparations and I am glad that's gone away appreciate your call let's go to I'm Joe in Los Angeles Joe you're on the Michael Mann that show\nThere Michael how are you I'm well oh go go ahead and\nAh I ...
