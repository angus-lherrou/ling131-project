{"month": "10", "state": "PA", "station": "WPGP", "content": "David Stockman and this is an article from um NBC or CNBC on line but David Stockman who is the former financial director under President Reagan is delivering a fresh round of dire Wall Street warnings and this is actually from um march towards the end of march of two thousand Eighteen\nAnd that kind of just say well yeah I think it's no coincidence folks that these men are often years that they've been around the block a couple of times they've seen a lot of things they've they've\nThey've endured a lot of market changes and these are folks who aren't that the young box who are trying to make a name for themselves they have already shown their metal and they're saying these things about what's going on in the market\nYeah and and um when I'm Talking about Stockman and Stockman talks about the market hitting an inflection point and he uses the term and I quote that the market is whistling past the graveyard trading at twenty six times earning\nA twenty six times earnings at the top of the business cycle ten years um it's it's almost a record an all time in terms of works trading\nAnd he's saying now that you know in the theory that earnings have rebounded and we'll go even higher he believed that the complete illusion I mean his comments came out when we talked about back in March and and all that we're talking about now are these tariffs then at that time there were the steel tariffs that that\nA President Trump was talking about but you look at the tax cuts you look at\nEverything going in line and certainly that added some fuel to the market but he's looking at the issue that okay these tax cuts were good to put some an infusion into the market\nBut he's saying and using this term drifting he said drifting path a graveyard is he saying that we are kind of like the Titanic here as a Titanic got closer they knew that kind of pushing the engines faster that you know with the iceberg warnings and things that are out there\nAnd he's saying that hey we're not looking out for an iceberg or he called it that burg and burn ... E. B. T. D. E. B. T. said that's what is in front of us\nAnd and folks you know no one's really talking about the deficit a things along that line but when interest rates go up the amount of that that's out there the interest it'll have to be paid on that that it's it's almost insurmountable\nAnd he's referring to the after effect we haven't used this term quantitative easing in a long time but the Federal Reserve has been unwinding that quantitative easing this fourteen trillion dollar financial crisis era trade dumping money into the economy\nAnd there's going to be what he calls a massive you'll Chocola offset as NPR earnings and an almost um all of the effect of the tax cut he believes will be ... done so in plain English what does that mean basically means or do something about your retirement portfolio before what he said that happens as your\nDebt service is going to strangle your ability to just by normal goods and services and when you're in retirement that is a bigger deal than when you're working\nRight what that says to me folks um let's take it down to another level is the income you're going to rely on for retirement make sure you have a plan for that make sure it's as secure as possible many of our colleagues can't build that will show you how to build that income plant\nSecondly I Do believe that path of management index fund investing\nGood disciplined investing over Fifteen year periods or longer is the most productive way to invest but what we're hearing from Schiller from Stockman from buffet really lends itself to more active and proactive management because volatility is increasing\nAnd not to get better games but to reduce your volatility\nAnd people don't have that Fifteen year timeline any longer for growth\nThat's all right so it's selling them anymore we should be considering shift the active management too conservative portfolio managers or moderate or moderately conservative managers not just what's the advisor says one way to tell okay how moderate or how conservative really am I\nHow much would I lose a lot of these things come to fruition\nGet that stress tests get data now says we've been offering all throughout the show this is the last time the offered her mentioned it on this\nProgram here today eight hundred three to one Seventy nine sixty three say I want to stress test I Want to know in the face of all these warnings from all these are economists from these mines that are out there that see what's beneath the surface I Want to know what I stand to lose if things go bad\nAnd when I I Want to know what I can do about it doesn't mean that you'll make changes\nBut boy you should know what changes to make if you consider them take us up on that note Costa obligation to get that review eight hundred three to one Seventy nine sixty three do it now folks before the market dramatically changes because eventually it will\nAnd you'll say boy I listen to that show and I should have at least understood where I where I stand and I should have gotten that stress that don't work off of show does that take that step because it doesn't cost you anything but your time\nAnd a phone call the eight hundred three to one Seventy nine sixty\nThree bucks on me remind you that we have a website and on our website or lots of resources for you to take advantage of their some educational articles on there\nThere are other radio shows that you can listen to but there is an event tab on there and it details all the different types of events that we do out in the local neighborhoods and we do public workshops which our town hall style\nWe do lots of college ah adult non credit courses at local colleges and other facilities you need to get the information from these things to\nYou build a good solid retirement plan that will go the distance for you lots and lots of things to be aware of when it comes to investing and planning for your retirement future these days\nToo many things can can affect your ah your retirement health you want to make sure that you're ahead of the curve sign up for one of these classes again go on our website make the phone call sign up for folks you will not be disappointed it will be a really good use of your time\nRight one of the things we talk about our some of these solutions for addressing market risk in the last one I just want to touch on real briefly is to address market risk and again thank you for listening to locks on your retirement\nOr talking about this role one hundred and it's been a rule of thumb that's been around for a long time basically it's a role to show what percentage of your assets you should have and growth and what percentage you should have more conservative it helps you choose the investment products that are available out there based on your age and then you factor in risk tolerance from there\nNow we've adapted Israel to the role of one pet because people are living longer so no matter what number you use one hundred and ten or one hundred if you're fifty five years old you take your age and subtract it from that number so but the role of one hundred it would be forty five\nJust a roll one ten it would be fifty five\nAnd that number that you get there at the maximum amount that you should have an invested in anything affected by the markets remember bonds fit into that equation it's a simple rule it's a powerful role but if you say the market crashes and you lose thirty percent of your money if you had six hundred thousand the market you can lose a hundred and eighty thousand where you're down to four twenty\nIf you use the role of one hundred you would only have two hundred and Seventy thousand exposed which would cut your losses basically in half\nYou would have effectively forty five percent less market risking your portfolio so a great role to at least use as a starting point to mitigate\nRisk exactly I'm Glad you said starting point because there are folks out there who take this ruling applied to everything like it's gospel\nThis is something that we teach about in our college classes that it's a good rule but it is certainly a starting point\nBecause you have to figure out what am I going to do with the other fifty five percent what am I going to do with that to save money than that is not exposed to the market\nWell we've talked about it all show long hair folks it's it's finding opportunities in other types of investments that were not appropriate for you while you were building your house while you're in that accumulation phase but now that you're heading into retirement\nYou certainly need to look at investments that are going to give you income predictability and also be safe from the market volatility that they're going to keep you protected\nFrom any types of a market crashes that we've been talking about a show law we've kinda ripped through this last segment here lots and lots of information for you we\nSuggest you go to our website at synergy group ... dot com click on the radio tab and you'll be able to hear this show\nIn its entirety is anything that we spoke about today on this program resonates with you please give us a call eight hundred three to one Seventy nine sixty three we'd be honor to sit down and help you understand what's going on in your portfolio and give you some good solutions for that eight hundred three to one

eat most frequently on airports here the results\nAirport club rooms forty percent of your formal restaurants at airports twenty two percent fast food and sports bars tied at Thirteen percent\nSnapshot ten percent in vending machines three percent so uh I guess there were probably club roommates\nAgain I just think there's been an overall increasing the number of people eating the lounges and the ... the airlines everything here is\nFaster than average rare our second travel whole question when traveling what type of breakfast do you enjoy the most will get food theme running here clearly was weak on the results are hotel restaurant or paid buffet thirty two percent of you club room Nineteen percent\nWe also have a tie here room service and free hotel breakfast Fifteen Percent donut or coffee shop eleven percent in the fast food restaurant nine percent so I frankly I Wish we had ... pancake houses on their merit ... uh but I think I don't know for me I guess courtrooms probably most frequent\nI guess although I like a good ... good hotel yeah I Would rather that he will in turn and how old you are where the hell did I don't like when you go with it's like forty nine dollars now that are not great but again it can literally hold you through latch on the line when you're saving money that way well et cetera I Wonder if the new I Try to post coming up\nWe'll put those up by early next week so folks check out our am world travel dot com and you can check out the new polls and catch the votes and as we move right along Mary where do you want to start off with some travelling\nAll right well I think it's always a good thing when large companies get back to various philanthropic projects and on that note carnival corporation announced a series of community projects that will support children education at emergency preparedness in the Caribbean carnival of course has a huge cuisine presents and it is the world's most popular area for Cruz vacations\nSeveral of the carnival brands have been working with both local and international non government organizations including UNICEF and United Way of Miami Dade and Puerto Rico and they are partnering with several of the island's hit the hardest in\nTwenty Seventeen hurricane season and some of the projects include rebuilding damaged schools and bringing back children's playgrounds yeah by the that list\nAre putting a they're they're putting their money back out there and the communities that are participating and I know really likes to talk a lot about Wilbur and this week they received proposals from Wall street banks valuing the ride hailing company around a hundred and twenty billion\nAs they prepare for their ideal and early twenties Nineteen that valuation Mary ... bigger than General Motors Ford and Chrysler combined no go ahead and really what what also grab my attention they're competitor Lyft is launching a monthly subscription service\nAvailable across its user networking which users pay a flat fee of two hundred Ninety nine dollars\nThey'll get thirty rise per month essentially lift subscribers I can take up to thirty rides and the value of up to Fifteen dollars let's go over that number or they're going to pay some more uh over that thirty minute window or an additional rise beyond the thirty will come out of five percent discount\n... interesting I write well Jet Blue in the news this week by the end of twenty Twenty one Jet Blue said that it will retrofit a hundred and thirty eight Airbus a three twenty aircraft with vortex generators what the vortex generator well apparently it reduces noise on landings and believe it or not the entire retrofit will cost less than one million dollars\nSo that's a good thing since twenty Fifteen Jet Blue has been taking new delivery that Airbus a three twenty and a three twenty once with for a text generators All right so now we know we all know what a vortex Jane now with that is now\nToo quick to land in too quick I was from a a United Airlines first this week they boosted their profit outlook for the year as the U.S economy continues to home right along a and they're seeing big jumps and passenger traffic at Chicago Denver and Houston hubs plus more business travelers are paying higher fees for those premiums states\nBut they also make clear flyers who buy their cheap basic economy fares on United that they're going to continue to pay the carry on their bags despite moves by American delta who have relax their policy and then this last one for me to marry a Elizabeth I applaud for its honesty but\nPerhaps not for its liability did you see this week that Nebraska tourism debuted in New tagline for its new tourism campaign that's in Nebraska\nHonestly it's not for everyone [laughter] although I'm not making the scientists say there's obviously you know they're attracting outdoor enthusiast to stay as they have so much natural beauty there and their new slogan is going to replace the one that dates back to twenty Fifteen Nebraska nice\nBut we really need to watch this because the purpose of the tourism department and they don't need me to tell them this but maybe they do it's a cast as why didn't that as possible and attracted many visitors of possible so I'm not real sure about the success of Nebraska honestly it's not for everyone will\nNebraska nice it's how well when was the Nebraska's one fifty so that clearly that wasn't working if that's the only three years old and they're ... they're getting already see well they've

a nutshell Giuseppe youth poured more than thirty five thousand cups of tea for strangers around the country give me the backstory to that what you're riding around in and serving your tea out of and why serving strangers free T is so important to you\nWell you know I accidentally stumbled upon this power surveillance pretty um\nI was one of those people in this country uh about forty percent of people in America or experience loneliness on a regular basis and what I found was that when I started having non monetary interactions where I actually just started simply sharing with people are dead my basic human needs or you know ...\nLike my social and emotional basic needs started being that I'm\nThat those being community genuine human interactions and things like that and so for the last Thirteen Years\nI've been traveling the country making the for free the last ten of those years has been an end to live with a free T bus which is I'm a short school bus that's been converted into a mobile free tea house using a mostly salads materials running on recycled vegetable oil\nA solar power I'm actually a huddled up next to my woodstove right now making a\n... so then you lose either you live at the end of Lou right I've lived in that and to live for a little over ten years so so you what were you doing when the ... before you hit the road what were you doing and where\nI'm I was working fulltime in the video editor in Hollywood, California um when I first started serving T although I I had been either limited my pickup truck at that point for um for about six months a supply or you know I I was in college basically before that were from college to the full time limit\nSo you pull up into a new city and started brewing tea and what sort of open the back of the back of your a mobile unit or put out a table and people walk by say when a cup of tea is that it's that simple\n... pretty much I put out freaky signed by white people in the inside of the U.S they really warm woodwork space it feels like when people come in it's a lot of people take a deep breath and they say oh I feel like I'm home\nOh my goodness it you have made I Know lifelong friends who have people invite you to their own for dinners to stay there to shower there to hang out with the kids and meet their friends and and there's also you also gifts sometimes and receive gifts I Know that's not you know a formal thing you tell me about that\nWell you know I'm One of the beautiful things I realized that uh for most of the few history we actually lift lived in small scale sharing society the gift economy and so really that's what I'm trying to reinvigorate and in that\nOr or am world travel for everybody I'm Robert carrier and married and I appreciate you being here with us as we

Halloween destination since that's the next holiday coming up in Salem, Massachusetts as that big day will be here and eleven days\nYou know Salem ... it's an interesting place to visit you haven't

Massachusetts so let's head to the show hotline and welcome Giovanni al obese so the president of failing historical tours\nHi Giovanni it's nice to connect with you we appreciate you Spain a few minutes with us as we begin this hour show\nOh thank you so much it's very nice to connect with your great\nTo have him here so I think a lot of our audience listening today will connect sandwich Massachusetts all the way back to those iconic infamous which trial is sixteen Ninety two so I left in al how was Salem preparing for Halloween and give us an idea of these sixteen Ninety two sailing witchcraft walk you offer\nSure um well sale is preparing them we prepare every year a week at one point five million visitors a year and then during uh during the how Halloween falls on a Saturday or in October we can have like a hundred and twenty five thousand people in my you know I'm\nSo we're always prepare it and try to make things better bring people in Atlanta as far as the trial of all my God uh everybody comes here it's so funny we're not the first to do what Europe does it we execute twenty people but everybody comes here but we're glad they do we love telling them about it and that's a compelling story\nI'm sure than it is I sort of you know the Salem historical tours and the haunted footstep goes towards a lovable\nUh they're the oldest walking tours in Salem, Massachusetts from what we understand your tourist they operate combo of history with a dose of those grim details in keeping with the Halloween theme so for listeners around the country who might want to come to sell them at this point hoping to see her experience it goes what can you tell them to come away with\nUm well you know we're a combination of a lot of things sell the witchcraft trials everybody knows about we're all for the for the oldest city in Massachusetts we are older than Boston\nUm we are the logo is great stories in here so we were an incredible seaport uh we had over two hundred and fifty ships going around the world during both Seventy nine eight Eighteen fifty a and it's um the wealth of the nation was here in Salem\nIn the early Eighteen hundreds we were the one that uh but it all comes crashing down due to various factors so\nBut um incredible revolutionary history as well and they've combo tours they just kind of um you can take a call ... get the ghost stories get the stuff at the seaport history\nHas already announced looking on your website and I saw gallery and so now this is from people that have taken the two hours [laughter] when or Arabs and goes I mean these are that's an awful lot of oddities on these tourists um have you ever seen it goes to what you think might have been it goes\nOut absolutely I'm definitely going to go um yeah so we ah well one of the house or the way it's considered the most haunted house I'm In the city and that's where the court one family has lived on those grounds the house is not there anymore to another house but\nI was there telling a story and something went through the tree um we have stuff in our office to wear on the old custom also there's several custom houses where the second to last so my daughter got started here when I found the\nVoices behind her head so she got a little freaked out so yeah but I've slept in my own building because sometimes you know I got stay overnight waiting so I've never had anything happen then but I definitely have had stuff happen on like horse\nYou know I think the part of the country that you're in and for folks that haven't been to Salem, Massachusetts I mentioned a just a couple of minutes ago when we were about to introduce you that\nYou know it's easy to get to I mean you're thirty forty five minutes I guess depending on traffic from Boston northeastern right there on the coasts as you said and also this time of year I mean I guess the folks want to go about forty or forty five minutes south you've got plenty of so you can kind of hit an all their\nUh you know I got a few questions right now for you to tell us do the tours ruined during all types of weather and how often do they run and do you and your team you know do you ever get that real fright or scare while you're out on the tours\nOh yeah we're on every day I'm through November fourth\nHere and then uh then daylight savings time happened and so we go to weekends but um yeah you know the Boston Salem climate combination is really a great combination people go to Boston and they take the train up care the train comes right through the city\nOr in a life have you ride and then they do fail until the spend a couple of days here Dubai couldn't maybe go planet so\nIt's a really great combination I mean our area is rich and history and our one of the oldest part of the country so um\nBut yeah so it's um it's it's a great combination all around\nWhen people come here for the tourists uh ... what do you find is what surprises them the most when they leave that to you you're always going to chuckle about because you thought they would know and they just don't [noise]\nWell I think one of the biggest things that we are older than Boston and everyone doesn't realize that and then when we tell them or stuff like Alexander Graham Bell live here for three years and ah we had a very\nFamous revolutionary I'll say it's a conflict I won't say battle that preceded Lexington and Concord and it's actually the first confrontation of the a Revolutionary War\nSo there's a lot of like stuff like that that wild with them and then we call them all the stuff that oh my God people are just blown away we talk about ... and you know some of the little stories of the trials that are just so incredibly interesting and explains a lot\nOf those trials

libraries but you actually have organized a trip or several trips with your family to include libraries tell us about it and what was their initial reaction\nIf we've done to Niger international now out to do this and I walk a lot of time with the international ... eldest daughter who's ... and the youngest one\nAnd we traveled around the world can focus on like ... are you an idea\nIn Europe and North America so you go to ... and all that well with young children and they're very good thing says how a law degree tiger\nYoung children and that will really was a group of a lot on\nThat one of the things that I left that you write about in your article is that yes libraries of course are all about the book and the collections but you also referenced some of the secrets in the actual buildings and now the one that you describe I think it was the ... the library of St Paul is that where is that much and then\nYou can put it in a really cool and I got laid off and go in and about an hour from now\nAnd what we tell our listeners maybe one little secret or ... that you have discovered in that library besides the bucks\nIt's a wonderful girl law green and it has very clever Logan in San ... a call them you know the column inside the\nCop shows you where the bar or not okay and the actual books that I mean the last couple of hundred years so much back on\n... how did you begin to choose which libraries around the world you would face at first\nIt was very much for the eldest daughter on the mummies in the British Museum and so we'd go a lot of London touring around that\nWe had to go right from the British Museum and that was working the library which is a ... coup collection but also I'm sure a lot of groups like ... and ... and land but however relatively easy I'm Single and\nProbably enough money in the middle of the long run for that wasn't even going on for us it was really a whole lot of the night to grieve over a lot on the road that we had to go to the old law\nWell I yeah I Love when you just said hey you know how you all came about this together and how it was a negotiator and the other hand movement very ... we took our sons to the library of Congress a few years back I can still frankly vividly seeing the expressions on their faces in my hand\nJust from its sheer grander it was such a wonderful place to visit but before we run out of time can you recommend a few must see libraries for travelers from your experience but you think that right now they have to go see inexperienced themselves\nFrom a column and then I Will go to a second column in the Washington Post they have a feminist column\nIn the Washington Post where are women the word feminist or or one I think in particular feminist columnist writes and I was reading some of them on the plane last night\nAnd I I shared some of them with you know some of the quotes\nI think that these are so important to understand the damage that feminism image each make believe world ... ... is ... ... from the west or make believe socialism is make believe\nAnd feminism is make believe you ... is make believe it's all make believe for whatever reason and it's all psychological what ... ... it's there's no other explanation there was a beep beep\nBeep or unhappiness\nMaladaptive ...\nTo reality on the part of the people who were braced these things and certainly those who develop them to have contempt for the world as is conservatives understand that the chance of making the world worse\nOr is are the chances of making the world worse or at least as good as far as making the world better when you have a revolutionary idea\nMaking the world incrementally better use spectacular that's what we should be doing in every generation but overthrowing the foundational ideas of society because you have a dream of something better which is one character respects the character respectable I\nRemember from the will to fundamentally transform be invited states of America ... revolution\nThat is where only bad things will happen in the bad things do happen she writes here that she's a middle aged single heterosexual feminist by the way one of the things that I did not mention in my first read of her\nOf her column in the Washington Post and I'm not seeing her main deliberately because I have no desire to a model left is by no desire to humiliate people\nAnd it's not important to she is she they're interchangeable they have feminists are feminists are feminists are feminists are on the left of but it is interesting that there's no mention in any of the columns by her or older women writing in this column in the Washington Post\nThat may be part of the solution to their lowly mission she says I have never been so lonely used to marry\nShe seems to be looking for a relationship but she has the the word marriage is not even enter she's a she is divorced from mistaken but she ... there's no mention of of marriage so she wants to wish racial loneliness\nWe've relationship or even if an appealing temporary are fleeing would appear from what I'm reading\nThe divide between men and women there's never felt so wide and I have never been so lonely too what she described that I knew what I describe it to\nAnd then she writes about her on her being uncomfortable with this really nice man she went on a date with for three hours and he kept saying whatever you're comfortable with when she asked where he wanted a week long she said whatever you're comfortable with\nAnd now I read to read from her over the course of three hours that while I became is ... ... she didn't like that\nAnd then\nWhat I even not only put a bold for myself but ... what it was time to part ways\nI was comfortable giving him a comic called it was not sexy being the one in the driver's seat for three hours\nSo if they're managing the driver CDs of patriarchal guy and uh probably somewhat of a massage therapist and if she's in the driver's seat she doesn't find it sexy\nWell and then she wonders why she's never been so lonely in her life because what the feminist like Old West is living and make believe rural\n\nIt is is awful and then they have an imaginary world were things will be better so she says if the if the man is a dominant decision maker ... glaring red flag that's what she writes\nThere she's disgusted with the guy who says whatever you're comfortable with\nI don't need a man she says to ask permission for every move he makes fun of course that is exactly the way young men are taught today you have to ask permission for every move you make\nWe shouldn't let the battle cry of consent translate into boring sex see this is they they just said that they want their cake and eat it is like it's so trite they want to change the world into some imaginary things that can't exist\nIntentions are important in every one's intentions during sex should be of care healing and relief not personal appetite implying conquest\nYou're going to move personal appetite for sex all the good obese care healing and relief sounds like a visit to a social worker or a therapist\nOkay now I Want to read to you from another one\nBy a different feminists are also in the Washington Post this one is from October fifth\nDo you know where your date stands on Brett Kavanaugh you showed so she said she doesn't like to talk politics on first dates but now it's inevitable that she wants to know where they stand on Brett Kavanaugh\nSo she writes a few years ago when I was getting back to dating after getting over a breakup I told the friend about how I felt stuck in a paradox okay listen to this is nothing to do with Brett Kavanaugh destroyed the title but listen to this again\nI told the friend about how I felt stuck in a paradox I wanted to be open to love but I also wanted to protect myself from the emotional rooms that dating in relationships method oblique can bring\n\nDid you hear that this is a grown woman\nTheir children left his two children before they do want to grow up I Want to be open to love but I Want to protect myself from the emotional wounds that dating and relationships inevitably can bring why don't you say that about anything else\nOpen to working but I Want to protect myself from the emotional wounds that working for a living can bring I Want to live fully but I wanted to protect myself from the emotional wounds that life it negatively can bring\n\nI told you there children there was no exception leftists are at heart children they do not want to grow up growing up means facing reality being prepared for her that's the reason for safe rooms and all of that stuff\nThey are snowflakes some of them are even nice snowflakes but they're snowflakes they're not grown ups\nDoes it amazing thing she admits this like the other woman admitted in the Washington Post how lonely she is and how crappy relations between men and women are\nI now I continue reading at that moment it felt difficult to do both now I imagine a lot of the leaders feel stuck in the same dilemma really that's not true\nLeftist theaters are stuck in this dilemma conservatives have mature understanding of life it involves inevitable pain there is a pain in life this is ... ... you can't do anything about it\nLife has pain you want to live fully that's the garden of eating story people chose pain and full life over little pain or no pain and not a full life\nI'm finishing my huge genesis commentary in fact this month it'll be up in a may first\nOh by the way just a reminder the mom my irrational bibles but the wife five volume commentary on the first five volumes it's been so successful the we're going on the fourth printing of ... the first volume was on the second book\nUh the prices going up to five dollars 'cause of the price paper it's printed on very beautiful paper\nSo you could still get the old price at um at Amazon if you want to get it and I'm just letting them know that is the rational Bible at any rate uh I

may be more strong feminist position and now they're kind of struggling with well I found myself in that that kind of neat you know I Want it his faith that strong\nWill right yes I agree with you now but I agree with you but at no point where you can write but at no point the she challenged feminism\n\nBut it may be her own personal statement and again if people are familiar with this particular person maybe they're the evolution as well I mean I'm a Democrat I so I have left progressive\nUm positions but I think when it comes to this and my relationship and kind of by\nSense of oh no you know I I Am a nervous they're scared to do that again that like human ... either\n... or whatever I don't know that that already\nAttached to one side or another politically it's just\nOkay All right I appreciate your call very much a Cassie in Torrance, California Hi Cathy\nHi Dana Hi [noise]\nUm I just called to allow it may sound a story that I heard from a recounting from my son about five years ago he is\nNow how old is your son thirty two so he when he was a ... hound writes\nUs probably four or five years ago a he was telling me about a attempting to date and he said he found young women so aggressive that\nWhen you're trying to get to know them at some little like a job interview they want to now on\nHow much money you have and my kind of car you drive and what your goals are immediately you know not just a friendly let's get to know each other about a very aggressive grilling\n... so ironically if that's the case and I have to have the word if but if that's the case so the argument that men will see women as sex objects is ... is matched by women who see men as financial object\nWhich by the way there is some truth to both not necessarily a terrible thing it just the way people were built we have to live with it we have to figure out how to\nLive with real life with them if you do your cold the conservative I'm\nDennis Springer show live from the relief factor
