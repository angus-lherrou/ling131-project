how few left wing or his will go on TALK radio and they're they're right not to\nBut we are polite they won't look good\nOpposite opposite I was going to be honest I\nYes if my ... that's a very

your friend Michael mid vet who is a dear friend in those instances tends to ask them very polite questions not that big cat debate the guy's brilliant\nBut they they they feel they have a somewhat safer time with Michael and they will because Michael is interested in having them off or their side I Am interested in clarifying where we differ which is not the same thing and Michael does a great job but I don't know if Thomas Friedman is ever going by Michael ... show\nAll I Know is they don't come on mine and it's not because I ever ever ever insult them what you insulted me I never do that

about college\nStruggles I was going to college and you said something about\nHabits are bike it's in\nThe wrong it when I was in graduate school let me finish when I was in graduate school they dropped requirements at Columbia because the students said we want to determine what we study that has now become the norm\nThey are not told in most cases what they have to study unless they have a major yes to get a degree in history you must take the following history course that's true but they they aren't there was no general requirements in most of our universities that I stand by that because I saw it happen in my own life\nI got a vast majority of students at church choir and watch this that\nYes I just said that Mike I if I just said that you're you're listening to speak as you said for if I did say that I said if you have a major in history you will have some required courses in history but general requirements\nWhat stood out there that you're\nOkay you're you're you're Oregon than let me be clear I'll give you the benefit of the doubt that I haven't been clear\nFor example you have to take the course of Columbia courses in Colombia in western civilization to get a degree if you majored in bought me or you majored in uh in German or you majored in physics you still have to take certain courses\nIn order to get a BA generally speaking those have been dropped that are where universities and the way I don't understand so that's your strong man argument that's that's my you're generalization I set up our mess and\nWe do it all the time actually I Am driving and like I haven't written it ain't got\nNo no I understand that okay so let me ask you let me ask me questions might like let me All right we ... we had enough on the majors okay let me ask you a

the truth that is the reason people take me seriously\nAnd uh if it you know All right we'll leave it at that I'm lying about their not being generalized requirements that most universities okay

you\nI agree so a lot more interesting one I differ with you and I differ with you on a fire metal policy I think and I suspect that what three minutes talking about when he uses the word science\nCorrect or not entirely a feeling of oh\nYeah well and so I Do on that there are like three word than it is sort of a phrase well one of them I happen to agree with ... which is I think my side of the Republican side is often in the science denying category when it comes to global warming\nRight we have a lot of videos on this given by scientists\nThe oh I Know ... ... no no but it's important that you know that I mean Richard ... and was the dean of climatologists at MIT in the country\nAnd she takes issue with the proposition that the the there were three propositions to the global warming thing big collapse it into won the world is getting warmer it is getting so much warmer it will lead to worldwide catastrophe if not extinction\nAnd it is caused overwhelmingly by human beings no one is denying that the world was getting warmer I have not met anybody who denies that\nAnd they apparently are bombs they're rudimentary they're not highly sophisticated but they apparently are operational and good for the NYPD and the FBI and the New York bomb\nSquad basically and all the people who are trying to deal with this and do it also for some of the reactions not all of them some of the reactions have been appalling\nAnd hypocritical and wrong or but\nNot Steve ... says the various reactions that I've seen I think the one from the whip for the Republican Party in the house of representatives\nOf the honorable Steve's Elise congressman from Louisiana who's been a friend of his show a Steve writes these attempted attacks that have been made or beyond criminal their acts of pure terror\nViolence and terror have no place in our politics or anywhere else in our society I've experienced firsthand the effects of political violence and I'm committed to using my voice to speak out against it wherever I Can't\nThose responsible for these evil acts of terror and yes even if no one has killed God willing known will be killed these are evil acts he writes those responsible for these evil acts of terror must be hunted down and brought to justice and I have great confidence that our law enforcement officers will\nSucceed in that mission as a nation we must agree that this is a dangerous path and it cannot become\nThe new normal excellent that is fine and\nBy the way with the president said he spoke after Milan yen millennia was promoting some of her causes any complimented his wife speaking as she introduced him he got a standing ovation and uh then the uh the president said this about the bombing intense\nSuspicious packages and devices mailed to current and former high ranking government officials the safety of the American people is my highest an absolute priority\nI've just concluded a briefing with the FBI department of Justice Department of homeland security and the U.S Secret Service as we speak the packages are being inspected by top explosive experts in a major federal investigation is now underway\nThe full weight of our government is being deployed to conduct this investigation and bring those responsible for these despicable acts to justice we will spare no resources are expensive this effort\nAnd I just wanted to tell you that in these times we have to unify we have to come together\nAnd send one very clear strong unmistakable message that acts or threats of political violence of any kind of no place in the United states of America [noise]\nWhat the\nPresident said is fine and it's appropriate and he offered a little bit more to be more specific here's President Trump\n[noise]\nIt's a very bipartisan state but I can tell you from both sides we both agree on that\nDisagree just conduct is abhorrent to everything we hold dear and sacred as Americans my administration will provide additional updates as they become available and I just want to thank everybody for their understanding [noise]\nWe're extremely angry upset unhappy about what we what this this morning and we will get to the bottom of it\nOK given the fact that two of the most prominent targets of these bombs\nWere Hillary Rodham Clinton who President Trump defeated and the election\nAnd a Democratic president that he replaced Brock Obama I think it would be helpful for the president or for Sarah Sanders frankly to reveal I mean enough to reveal dishonestly but I think it would be a good thing for President Trump to call President Obama and for President Trump to coal Secretary Clinton\nAnd to express his concern and his gratitude that they and their families are okay\nBecause uh and just saying that doing it would detoxify this entire matter and one of the things that I resent is mainstream media right now and a lot of democratic leaders\nAre injecting toxin into this situation\nThey're basically trying to blame Trump for this\nNow I get it I understand most of the people who have been targeted are very clearly identified with the left their opponents of Trump they include Eric Holder and Maxine Waters and Morocco bomb and yes all three of them are African American I understand that it also includes Hillary Rodham Clinton Debbie Wasserman Schultz\nAnd I'm I'm oh and George Soros she was the first ones to receive a a package and apparently they are now saying\nThat the package was actually delivered in person by someone that was not mailed to George Soros but the package with this rudimentary bomb and it was delivered to Soros his home outside of New York city\nAnd um [noise] look at\nThe idea that Trump is to blame for this of course that is irresistible to the left and it seems to me it is entirely wrong I sent out a\nTweet about this immediately when that tendency started and I understand that there are people\nIn the media who are trying to link together for phenomena what are the four phenomena these bombs the bomb scare\nNumber to the to show the murder number three the fact that Trump ... says that it's fake news as the enemy that people\nAnd um and and a\nNumber for the uh the idea that Trump praised at a rally in Montana the\nSlamming a reporter by Congress men Greg Gianforte by the way to apologize lavishly who paid the guy damages who apologized again and actually was pleaded guilty in court for assault and battery\nSo ah here's here's the point you just four separate things Greg John forte\nThe Trump assaults on news media as fake news an enemy of the people the murder of the show veep and these bomb scares which are attempted murder\nWhat's the connection between all for nothing\nThere is no connection the first two are evil threatening to murder people sending out bombs to people's homes that is evil murdering ... Hoagy which no American had any role in at all was evil and it's been\nDenounced that way by the president the United states the other two things Trump sprays of Congressman John forte for the most embarrassing moment of his life\nTrump's general ... on the news media is enemy that people are stupid and it's embarrassing it's not evil and it's not a crime and basically trying to associate these things is wrong it is irresponsible I Know it's irresistible\nFor people on the left especially Thirteen Days before an election but it's deeply irresponsible you want to hear about irresponsible Jack Reed the senator from Rhode Island was on CNN and of course CNN let him directly to saying what CNN wanted to hear listen\nI think is quite obvious us some of this is a reflection of the the base tone a debate and the president of the United states\nIs at a rally and smiles as people chant lock her up or make through direct attacks on the news media that doesn't raise the level of debate that lowers it and\nIt creates this environment where these acts could take place and not only being an attack I think the other half going to have this act profound cowardice someone is sending has exploded a device anonymously to people who could be hurt\nAnd and this is something that is just ... that\nIt's not just disreputable is not just caught and cowardice is evil but the point is we don't know anything about the perpetrator yet I Hope we will soon\nAnd one of these guys are wrong let me give you an example of something else it was just a couple of days ago that in Washington DC in northwest Washington Fox five Fox News in other words\nAttacked by a guy who have now identified his name was George ... and he came and he broke two big pains of glass and he came in and the security guard thank God shot him\nDidn't kill him he's alive now\nIf all of a sudden you're attacking Fox News of course some idiot could jump to conclusions oh this is because of all the hospital things that Democrats are upset about Fox News nobody said that because we didn't know anything about this guy now we do\nWhat do we know about him\nWas he indeed a left wing activist actually know uh what was he we will get to that in just a moment we'll also get to some of the outrageous stuff\nThat was set on NBC and something outrageous stuff that a leading Democrats said\nAbout the shooting of Congressman Steve spill lease so now you can't blame the less for that even though\nThe guy who shot Steve's Phillies and end up dying was a Bernie Sanders volunteer we'll be right back on the ... [noise]\nPresident Trump condemned the newsroom shooting and offered his condolences but he is often portrayed the news media is the enemy that people\nAfter the shooting the publisher of the New York times they ... burgers at in a statement that he told the president in private meetings that quote his language was not just divisive but increasingly dangerous in other words what did that has to do with the newsroom shooting in Annapolis\nOr the attack on Fox News which is where this appeared in the paper\nOr this we don't know yet\nIt'll be interesting to find out we do know be on any shadow of a doubt that wins Steve school leaves\nWas severely wounded and there was an attempt and and so we're Washington officers severely wounded assigned to protect the congressman and other attempts to kill other Republican congressman\nThat was politically motivated the guy was clear about it but\nListen to what Nancy Pelosi said at the time when a and this is more than a year ago this is June of two thousand Seventeen right after ... was shot she asked about uh some Republicans would condemn some of the hospital democratic rhetoric and here's what she said\nThey have or comments from those of us in including Congress about Israel it's rhetoric from the left being in some way to say\nWell I think that your question is an excellent one and I think that the comments made by merit publishing colleagues are outrageous than eat the dignity of the job that they hold\nAn eighth of dignity and respect that we would like Congress to command how dare they say such a thing how dare they are so this sick individual that's something that the law\nAnd it was horrible what he did hateful by for them to all of a sudden these sanctimonious and see if they don't never seen such a thing before and I don't even want to go into president of the United states but in terms of some of the language that he has you know again I let's go there and the other day but to ask\nHow could they possibly say such as\nPart of the way they can have such a thing the way they could say such a thing is big cause that shooter had told other people that he had a grudge against Republicans she had been just active in the Bernie Sanders' campaign for president\nHe was deeply politically active and apparently mumbled to his wife all the time when he saw stuff on TV we know the guy was politically motivated\nTo the only kind of political motivation that can be condemned is if it is from the right well there are other people who say no this couldn't have been from the right this was probably a leftist set up can I say\nWe don't know when will we find out we'll get to that with your calls coming up that the Michael mad vigil\n[noise] [noise]\n[noise] yes or a news\nI bought I knew in

intelligence community wants to protect Trump\nDo you think they want to damage drop\nI think they want to damage out\nOkay so how so you think that they damage Trump by is sending a these alleged did a bombs too and making sure that of course they don't explode I I think that's a better I guess a or a theory frankly\nI think that if the finalists drawings out there on the way they see the ever

incredibly bad for the country but look what happened with Bill Clinton\nHe rose his popularity the highest he ever achieved\nAt precisely the time that the Republican House had voted impeachment and then they didn't even get a majority of Senate voters not even a majority\nTo vote to actually remove the president from office appreciate your call 'em and I think part of what you're saying is at least\nIt makes a little bit more sense than the idea that there was some democratic operative who did this if it is somebody who is connected with the intelligence community that they should also be

more with the Bernie wing of the party then with the very left mainstream of the party the Bernie wing being left of left a one eight hundred nine five five\nSeventeen Seventy six she was the president of the United states speaking earlier today\nAnd if you have something that you find objectionable\nIn what the president had to say give me a call one eight hundred nine five five Seventeen Seventy six\nSuspicious packages and devices mailed to current and former high ranking government officials the safety of the American people is my highest an absolute priority\nI've just concluded a briefing with the FBI department of Justice Department of homeland security and the U.S Secret Service as we speak the packages are being inspected by top explosive experts at a major federal investigation is now underway\nTo full weight of our government is being deployed to conduct this investigation and bring those responsible for these despicable acts to justice we will spare no resources are expensive this effort\nAnd I just wanted to tell you that in these times we have to unify we have to come together and said one very clear strong unmistakable message that acts were threats of\nPolitical violence of any kind of no place in the United states of America [noise]\nPeople are applauding and then I Know I Know I Know the monitor on the left if there was somebody a sitting here who is a congressional candidate and there isn't\nA from on the Democratic party was ... you know we can never political violence but a at his rallies he ah encourage people to beat up some of the protesters\nI think some of what President Trump said at his rallies during the campaign was stupid and it was irresponsible and he shouldn't have said those things but is it necessary for him\nNow to go back there and say gee I'm Sorry I said these comments\nMore than two years ago in the middle of a campaign it's not necessary for him to do that what has happened\nIs he a stomped encouraging violence and then somebody's going to say well the other night he was speaking in Montana\nAnd he congratulated a congressman Greg John forte for having body slammed a reporter uh who um got on his nerves it wasn't even a reporter would have been particularly hospitals a Congressman John forte\nLook I think it was a mistake I don't think he should have done that and handed the other side that kind of support\nBut the idea that that is somehow associated with somebody trying to kill people and whether or not these bombs were very well made up it was an attempt to kill people or at least make people think that they were being threatened with death and it was outrageous\nAnd look there should be no problem at all with people acknowledge ing President Trump said something very good there\nHe said we should condemn political violence of every time we should condemn scuffles we shouldn't condemn people and by the way it is part of what he's very I'm perfectly and very poorly try to do\nIn some of his garbled and messed up response to Charlottesville or when he said there are bad people on both sides what he said it was terrible as he said they're good people on both sides there weren't\nBut there were bad people on both sides and that was accurate and if he can go ahead and consistently now condemn people\nFrom groups from the Proud Boys to end chief uh from the neo Nazis to uh some of the other people\nOn the extreme left who won't allow speech to proceed you know something I was just I just found out about ... and it's it's appalling to me because look I I have a certain affection\nFor the physical a Yale University campus I spent close to seven years of my life there and [noise]\n[noise] right now the cameras been totally defaced by graffiti and all the graffiti is excerpts from the testimony of Christine Blasey Ford right\nOkay what is the point of that for goodness sake I guess the point is because Brett Kavanaugh went to college and the ... law school he was also there for seven years so now they have graffiti to remind people I mean really that's pathetic\nAnd yes political violence and intolerance is pathetic whichever direction that comes from and I hear\nYou have two members of Congress actually former members of Congress uh Dave jolly of Florida who by the way is very anti Trump and Steve Israel of of Florida who well surprise is very anti Trump here's how they sounded on MSNBC\nWe're in an era now where violence seems to have a license for the president of United States\nAnd it's not just going to Montana and endorsing body slamming and it's not just saying that neo Nazis you know are good people are there are good people on both sides\nOf a march including neo Nazis remember the president item states in the campaign offered to pay the legal bills of his supporters are if they attacked his opponents\nAnd I'll just say one other thing on this it's not even just the president we have a bomb squad and CNN or the CNN building in New York City today yesterday I was walking in New York City and I pass the the building where Fox News is headquartered and the ticker with digital ticker that displays news in that building\nWas reporting on the George Soros a bomb threat and it began with these words for the man who has everything\nThat's not funny it is dangerous and so it's not just a president who gives a license to violence\nBut those who are enabled by that violence they have a responsibility to make sure that we are\nA embracing values of a piece of safety and not for a gas on the flames were happening too often\nI mean I'm Sorry how does how does I I don't know what the Fox ticker actually\nSaid but if it said for the man who has everything\n'cause he sure that that was in the context of George Soros I I don't know but it seems to me that if you are in the midst of a heated political campaign is very easy to say this rhetoric goes over the top or this is wrong or the president said you should beat up protesters who disrupt his rallies\nThat different from murder\nIt is and it's different from condoning murder and the problem the refusal to make a distinction between things that some people on the right may say that are sometimes embarrassing and irresponsible\nAnd just plain dumb [noise] that's very different from an action of attempted\nMass murder which is what we're dealing with here making distinctions is utterly necessary if we're going to be serious in our politics we'll be right back there's a statement now from CNN [noise] unbelievable [noise] are coming up [noise]\nAnd really you you want to show me that ... I'd love to hear from a prince Mohammed bin Salman oh yeah President Trump told me it was okay I heard him attacking the lying stinking disgusting fake news media and I thought okay I'll do something and no of course he didn't think I just didn't\nAt first of all we don't even know Solomon a mum had been some on was actually directly responsible he probably was but the idea that he was somehow encouraged by Trump's ongoing fused with MSNBC and\nCNN is ridiculous I Do hope that\nWhen we emerged on the other end of election day whatever happens and I hope urgently in earnestly that the Republicans prevail\nBut that we can move on from this this stupid back and forth on both sides it doesn't do the country any good to have voices in the media just perpetually blaming the president for everything and attacking him for everything\nWith a visceral hatred that I Do believe is unique it goes beyond anything that they apply to George W. Bush a Ronald Reagan or anyone else\nLet's um\nOr go to a John Berman who is an American news anchor\nAnd currently the co anchor CNN new day with Allison come out on CNN he's a regular uh released presenter of Anderson Cooper three sixty this is what he had to say\n\nThat could have been sent to John Berman\nMeant to be because they said John Brennan on the packages had Brennan B. R. E. N. A. and\nI see okay so nobody knows that package was sent it but if it was sent to John Brennan which is more likely than he's another politician not primarily a media figure um meanwhile\nOther

[noise]\n\nThe question is how should President Trump respond now\nTo a new joint statement from the two leaders the Democratic party in Congress both of them want to be majority leaders\nAre in Thirteen Days from now or when they we have a great big election uh also thirty six governors' on the ballot in that election is so important to be sure you vote\nHere is what's on Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer had to say we listen with great interest to the president's remarks this afternoon we'll take an oath to support and defend the constitution and to protect the American people and that is our first responsibility\nHowever they say President Trump's words ring hollow until he reverses his statements that condoned acts of violence\nTime and again the president is gonna known physical violence and divided Americans with his words in his actions expressing support for the congressman who body slammed a reporter the neo Nazis who killed a young woman in Charlottesville he never expressed support for killing a young woman in Charlottesville it's outrageous an inch wrong\nLooked she was an ... that's an outrageous charge and they haven't right in their\nExpressed his support for the neo Nazis who killed a young woman in Charlottesville he never did that expressing his supporters are his supporters at rallies get violent with protesters dictators around the world who murder their own citizens and referring to the free press as the enemy that people\nLook at the the instincts year to play politics with a direct in serious threat what would they still be doing that if if one of these bombs going off and people were killed it would be it would be even more outrageous\nAnd it is a\nNow we we had a caller who um who called in and ... she wanted this age should Trump toned down his rhetoric he should certainly avoid anything that can be construed as an endorsement of violence on any kind at the very least between now in the election and probably forever\nAnd yes he can be more careful there is nothing wrong\nWith a a a president being careful about what he says it's Theodore Roosevelt called the presidency a bully pulpit\nAbout the asylum process and about the level of illegal immigration and it uh it it mentions that illegal immigration right now is at a forty year low the only years where illegal immigration has been even lower than it is right now\nWe're the last three years including last year as the Obama administration has been brought way way down and brought down by three quarters way greatly reduced part of it a bad economy part of it much better border security which began by the way under President Bush\nIn any event here's the interesting thing\nWhen uh people come here\nIn terms of uh applying for asylum between the years two thousand twelve and two thousand Seventeen in other words including the Trump Administration\nImmigration judges turned back Seventy five percent of the people who came here from Guatemala seeking asylum\nSo she may say it's America's strength to be tolerant and accepting but right now including under President Obama and yes under President Trump most people are coming looking for asylum or turn back\nAnd that it seems to me is reasonable it says the Trump Administration has made the process even more difficult by ordering immigration judges to stop granting asylum to virtually all those claiming to be victims of domestic violence\nA move that could block tens of thousands of people from gaining permanent entry into the U.S and in other words if you're running away from an abusive husband\nYou probably don't have to run away two thousand miles to get to the United states\nAnd that seems to me is reasonable enough uh let us go to your calls to John in Columbus ohio John you're

cut things out anything they can do\nIt it's really perpetrating the law that was on concern but I'm ... and the the that the political people on the left side\nThere they're lower the bottom feeder tactic of marrying President Trump than it is a lot of a ... he's he's pretty much kept this war he stayed on target he's trying but like you said nobody is perfect guy created nobody's perfect\nRight but the point is it don't you I I don't think it would be helpful if folks on our side\nDidn't for instance chant lock her up lock her up um I mean again it's I I think the American people are kind of tired of that and that's OK maybe in the height of a campaign\nBut I don't think it helps our side and it's not a question that there's some kind of great huge moral outrage or this crosses some line that's inscribed in the heavens\nIt's dumb politics because actually particularly the key deciding voters in a in this coming election are going to be white suburban women\nAnd I'm not sure the chance

think you're right it doesn't make sense of violence as a tool of accomplishing some objective is is something which we as a society and so\nWe will not tolerate and so clearly clever is doing this is doing for no reason they did it they're not helping themselves and they're not helping whatever cause it is that they thought they were you know his name um so yeah no it doesn't make any\nSense and I

set of issues and he's having any issue left right or a survey a spec and if you can design the are crazy people who think that violence where to go and you're right it doesn't make\nSense what about the fact that the it was done in concert a is you know many many people getting these bombs simultaneously what does that say\nYeah I mean so it clearly says that whoever or maybe it's a small group of people we don't know yet quiver has is during this clearly had I think in in a motivation and I plan to do it to do whatever they're going to be assumed that obviously you know the people on the

your expertise we are talking to David in Sarah of the Heritage Foundation their homeland security and foreign policy analyst um your expertise is in\nThis kind of stuff or would it would you rule out

some sort of false flag operation where you want you want you to think of something else but that being said\nWe will ... we're gonna be looking into the motivation of who did this and why they did it\nAnd I think will not soon enough um but I mean yeah based on the types of target it it's at the initial assumption I think most people is that yes this was probably carry optimistically is that definitely the case no but I Would say it's definitely like like\nWhat about the timing any chance that the caravan headed here from Central America would make someone think now it'd be a good time to
