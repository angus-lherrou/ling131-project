lie that President Trump is increased anti Semitism in the United states to really frightening proportions\nLying in hysteria or mainstream left wing weapons they lie so much they don't even know they're lying so there's no hope for the left the only hope is to defeat the left peacefully\nCivil e decently but effectively\nThe ... one of the best ways not the only one was the best ways is obviously through ah through elections\nI sit in in just a I'm stunned that I should say that like a ... a retract what I was a much stunned\nIf all people here as left wing propaganda it's understandable but they will think that it was a beautiful deep to vote Democrat if you believe the stuff may be you know Trump is increasing racism in America increasing anti Semitism with America\nThey're yelling at him for calling the the caravan\nThat's that's you know seven thousand of the time people coming into a legally to the United states that he's seeing something to be if I

garbage out if you're out of your car you can't you can't let her because it's your home\nSo what is the less regard America as a home just like their whole with regard to people coming in\nAnd for the sake of the um the fraudulent monitors of\nConservatives there is no comparison God Forbid between these people in the garbage as a comparison between the left not viewing America as it's home and

do ...\nIt's an amazing thing isn't it but again it's it's the reason it's so important is number one so you'll know the laws we are drenched in by the media New York times Washington Post that actually cite this fraudulent report\nAbout is doubling or whatever it is of anti Semitism since Donald Trump was elected sold a fraud\nAnd I read to you from professor David Bernstein law professor at George Mason university got kids than Trump\nSays it's it's they use the one who says this is a fraught so it's not even coming from a pro Trump man it's coming from pro troops but if you're pro truths to be on the left you could be anti Trump which can be a leftist the moments you're pro true fuel equal\nWhy is it that the one area where they are counting on actually winning control of the house of representatives has to do\nWith the wealthiest suburbs in every state\nWhy is there is suddenly a Republican problem with a will to do suburbs in this country one eight hundred nine five five Seventeen Seventy six the New York times asked that question in the business section today they take a look at some of those areas where\nRepublicans are not running well where the Democrats hope to sweet to power in the house of representatives\nAnd they happened to be parts of the country that have done supremely well under the leadership of President Trump\nWhat's the problem here\nOne eight hundred nine five five Seventeen Seventy six our phone number there's also a new Republican at addressing that and also there is another big issue that we are prepared to take on which is the issue of Halloween\nIs the focus and the expenditure and the concentration on Halloween as a great national celebration\nIs that a good thing that ought to be encouraging applauded or not such a great aspect of American Life the great Halloween debate which we run through every year this year with a very different perspective by the way\nBetween myself and the most formidable person that I ever get to debate a which is my wife Dr Diane med bed that's coming up also on this edition of the Michael met that show but first off I uh I think it's appropriate to uh to offer a golden turkey award\nFor a truly remarkable performance in a faithful candidates debate this is one of the closest Senate races in the country and by the way\nIf you look at the polling right now even according to the polling\nThere are almost a dozen Senate races where the Republicans had a real chance\nOf ah of making big inroads against various tablets Democrats now one of the Democrats or Republicans are very much hoping to knock off his Joe Donnelly of Indiana\nWho by the way is an idiot I mean this is not a bright capable member of the U.S Senate this was a guy who got elected because he was running against him very weak Republican candidate he's running behind all ready but then there was the debate\nLast night and a Joe Donnelly both in what he said and the way she later explained that stepped right into a wealthy stepped into unpleasantness\n[noise]\n\nBigger town or your first and foremost I'd like to thank God for years and the grooming I Would like to thank my wonderful aging more powerful below people's George\nI Would like to share this with every single senator\nNow it's time for another gold in Turkey award nomination [noise]\nAnd on the Michael ... show or the golden turkey award going to Joe Donnelly he is running slightly behind the Republican candidate Mike Braun there's also an independent candidate\nWho may be taking votes away from the Republican those are terribly wasted votes in in a faithful election like this anybody who's thinking about voting independent in Indiana think\nAgain think again this is a very clear choice you can choose a clear conservative Republican an outsider who is running for more Washington reform\nOr you can choose senator Donnelly who's a unparalleled eloquence led to this in the midst of a televised debate\nOr state director is Indian American but he does an amazing job or director of all constituent services she's African American but she doesn't even more incredible job then you could ever imagine\nOkay why could you not imagine that an African American as credible job he's Indian American but he does an amazing job but he doesn't amazing job okay this is an amazing job uh this is a job that is going to cost him his Senate seat I certainly hope\nAnd and listen to this because he just a couple of hours ago issued a a quote an apology explanation\nHere's what he said I misspoke I meant to say and instead of but\nThat would have communicated what I've tried to do my entire life that I make a habit to seek out and promote people of color for both my campaign an official staff\nNow isn't that problematic to seek out and promote people of color for both my campaign official staff\nDon't you want to say senator Donnelly I mean isn't the right thing to say\nI seek out the best people regardless of their color or their background but he doesn't amazing job okay this is it an amazingly poor job or an amazingly poor job\nIs also um reflected on the part of Nancy Pelosi\nShe was on the ah friendly confines of the other friendly confines I Know I Know that's Wrigley Field\nThe cubs weren't in the playoffs this year but um you know I've congratulations to the Boston Red Sox and what an amazing year in London amazing season and they're being talked about for a hundred and Nineteen wins\nBut that of course includes the playoff wins in the world series wins\nUm mariners still two thousand one hundred and sixteen wins okay meanwhile in the friendly confines of the Steven cold beer show\nNancy Pelosi was on last night [laughter] and and again I'm ... please before you vote think whether you really really want to install this lady as speaker of the house of representatives just a heartbeat away from the presidency here's Nancy Pelosi\nUp until today I Would have said the election were held today we would win what happened today to change that [noise]\nBut now I'm saying is we've away [laughter]\nKnow if you want to say that on on Hillary's fireworks barge day\nWhen\nWe own the ground we're not using one guy and it's sad how long are the curtains that\nQuick yes walking precincts and if everyone votes will have even a bigger factory ... Democrats will carry the house we have to think of the Senate governorship it's gonna be a great guy for\nSacrifice a gold or something [laughter]\nOkay um I don't I don't think you have to sacrifice would go no no goats sacrificed in the making of this at a she came back and suggested this solution which actually echoes Hillary Clinton hauntingly\nFor the question instability in polarization in this society listen yeah\nI can I ask you about you if you weren't let your started wearing purple side is that an inclusive message that you're sending out there that it's not America's neither read nor blew it\nCould be that unifying our country I think it's a time to heal there's been a lot of talk lately about um of of\nLowering the temperature of political discourse ... have you seen evidence of that well I think when we when you will see evidence of that\nAh when when we when we're going to tone down the political discourse\nBecause a calling for investigation of a sitting justice of the U.S Supreme Court that would be Brett Kavanaugh calling for his investigation and potential impeachment calling for impeachment of president that's a that's a great way to tone down the rhetoric right\nOne eight hundred nine five five Seventeen Seventy six and then there's this um\n... Andrew Gillum the a\nDemocratic nominee for the governorship in Florida who right now is running very slightly ahead of the far preferable a Republican nominee Rhonda Santa's\nIn any event Guillaume said this about his opponent when he was on the Daily Show with Trevor Noah\nHis campaign has been inundated by racism when the people supporting him all his other tolls on who's saying\nDo you think that that will be the defining characteristic of this race well I don't I mean I think um I Do that [noise] uh this is probably given too much harbor a two races ... anti Semite um\nHe spoke at conferences with him he authored a book justify slavery quite\nOkay this is simply not true he did not offer a book justifying\nSlavery um [laughter] I don't you think you would have heard about that before now so what did he actually say in his book what he said in his book was true it's about the constitution and yeah we'll talk about the constitution and birthright citizenship and more coming up with your calls on the man that show [noise]\nAnd grow western queen then that's coursing right now for our politics [laughter] something that is [noise] um [noise]\nI think what we need to understand it's not just about rhetoric is that just about political points about football ... people's lives are now on the line and going back to the Republican Party in going back to a child\nI was just this week that three men in Kansas for convicted of trying to bomb Somali refugees and they said in court that anti Muslim rhetoric how to influence that decision to take football why this is not just a matter of rhetoric of distractions of cultural\n... this is a matter of people dying all over the climate that's being created by by not only the White House\nAnd condoned by by people like think tank and boiling Graham that people are dying and people are literally dying over there and I think I think that is one thing that Americans need to consider when they go to the calls as a country that want to be right now the last week that we've had the last two weeks\nIf I were any other country I shall travel warnings to the United\nStates over the climate and the violence that we feel OK really\nIf you look at the murder statistics we're still\nAt less than half the murder rate\nThat we had in the Nineteen eighties and this is something that all Americans should be proud of it's not just a Republican achievement\nBut there's a new ad frankly that that was run by the Trump reelection campaign those this is not the Republican campaign committee this is the Trump twenty twenty election campaign and the ad is one of the best Republican as I've ever seen and really mean it\nIt hits exactly where this problem came to order which is why is it that right now the places where\nRepublicans are facing the different challenges\nAre privileged suburbs places that have done very well that are earning lots\nOf money lots of new jobs lots of new businesses lots of new\nConstruction of those places that are doing so well why\nAre people in those communities leaning against Trump and yet in down crowd and\nCommunities in places in the mid west in in rural America in a small town\nAmerica that really have suffered recently and haven't yet partake in fully of the new prosperity\nThat's where Republicans are doing well have the party's flipped positions the Democrats are now the party and the rich and the privilege and the comfortable and secure and the Republican Party has become the party of the aggrieved and struggling\nWe'll get to that and your

all do you change [noise]\nYou'll live so young\nMan who is\nOkay um it it goes on like that here here's the question and I know that the music business is\nChanging and people are listening to music on Spotify and you download something and you can listen to it once and then throw it away but the core of the music business for a very very long time and I say a long time\n[noise] ah oh going on two hundred years I mean really for a very long time okay hundred and fifty years the um the music business has been about getting music that you want to keep yeah and listen to and enjoy\nAnd um I Know this again last night um I came home I went to see a new film which we're going to review on friday with my wife\nAnd we came home from the film and then we were doing some work and and they were ready to go to bed and I just had a again a to hear this particular very obscure piece of music\nAnd I I collect CDs I have a lot of a compact is\nAnd um and and so I was able to find this eight Russian folk songs by ... the auto [laughter] it's a very obscure plays music\nAnd I want to share with Diane 'cause she didn't know it and so I put it on even though I haven't listened to the CD for a long time I was glad to have it because it's beautiful music can anyone imagine\n... said two years from now\nI say ten years from now where President Trump is no longer president he's term limited don't worry liberal he's term limited\nWhat someone want to put on this song don't lie to me about President Trump to hear more of this can you imagine sitting down in your living room in the middle of the night and saying yeah let's let's share the the musical experience of\nGangs and we don't see the full\nYou can see when\nI I think that they the Democrats should employee this song in campaign events [noise]\nUh no I meant the Democrats should because that would absolutely ensure that people are in the right mood of despair and\nI see I don't get this I don't get it and look I I I knew Barbara Streisand years ago I actually worked with her at one point and and by the way she's a very nice person she is not a\nMean evil nasty person at all or she has kind she's considerate and I think most people who have had any experience dealing with her on a personal basis I Will\nTell you that and it's sad for me to see this\nAnd and I'll tell you why I I I Know that Barbara has serious aspirations as an artist but somebody ought to tell her somebody ought to tell everybody on the left there's no lasting art there is no art of lasting value that is created for the politics of the moment\nDo is use is how do you okay honestly because it has a\nVery short shelf life\nOn the campaign songs that various people right or not songs of people turned two years later\nAnd frankly you can think of things uh like a blowing in the wind is blowing in the wind had a general political meaning but it wasn't specific like this aimed at one candidate or another\nAnd if you want to create music that really can do what music can do at best which is to nourish the soul and maybe uplifting country wouldn't it be useful if the left would get off this this\nIs incredibly hard isn't one sided perspective she was asked an important question by the New York times the question was\nWhat do you say to those people who maybe your fans who may love you're singing may love your work\nBut also love Donald Trump for answers kind of astonishing and very sad we will get to that with your calls coming up\nOne eight hundred nine four five seven genes Seventy six Michael [noise]\nThen later she she says in the interview she blames Donald Trump for making her fat\nI'm not joking\nThe or the interview concludes with ... asking Barbara how are you feeling these days and she says I Want to sleep nights if we take the house I'll be able to sleep a little bit better\nAnd then ... and if they don't don't know I've been thinking about do I want to move to Canada\nI think she'd promise to move to Canada before if Trump won the election I mean the presidential election and then she says I don't know if I moved to Canada I'm just so saddened by this thing happening in my country it's making me fat I hear what he said now and I have to\nGo eat pancakes now and pancakes are very fattening we make them with healthy flower though I'm and flour coconut flower okay good for her ... does anyone think it's fair to blame Donald Trump for making you\nFat that's what she said ah\nLet's go to Jeff in Seattle Jeff you're on the Michael ...\nMichael ... the the whole bomb thing going out\nWith Trump saying you know is fake news is evil or why are they the new people and the left is missing opportunity where for trying to try to put a face to the people who exactly are the liars who is the fake news is that\nLike Lawrence O'Donnell is if people on Rachel Maddow Don Lemon is that the guys you know a B. C. is that a lot of people you know they need they need a fortune to name these people who thinks is alive\nAnd well he he won't she won't because frankly he doesn't watch fake news as he sees that he ... and you've heard the stories about how we only allows Fox News on air force one inning apparently got into a bit of a tiff with millennia because he called her watching CNN or why\nCording to according to Don and when I watch all of them you know listen to try and was in the bits and pieces all of them are good dogs I mean you know he says that dog he watches his show but the my issue is is they need to try and force him to say who are these people these people can come out and say I you know who is\nWell again I I I'll tell you I I think you actually I understand what you're saying and I I Do believe that President Trump would gain a lot\nBy inviting some of the people who have been most critical to him and tell me the White House sit down and talk it out it's a it it actually would make you look so different but but the polarization are and to the extent that President\nParticipates in it I I think he's hurting himself will give another example coming right out

that's wrong about this moment of polarization the I'm Megan ...\nMore of a stress in an interview have you ever met Trump\nAnd she says no but when I was editing my last TV special for Netflix and we were looking at audience shots there he was sitting next to Barbara Walters but he never came backstage to see me or meet me so I've never met him\nI take a President Trump takes abate invite her to

warmly about McCain now that he's gone\nUm she said awful\nThings about McCain when he was running against the\nBronco bomber but seat honestly the face to face with people and I've never met Trump but\nI have heard from people who know him that he is actually a very\nDifferent kinder person in person than you would think and uh there's\nThere's no reason to allow this this kind of insanity to continue it in her new album the album is\nCalled walls and\nI'm Maggie Haberman writes Barbara Streisand has a new album one that has the musical and bought him a diverse singular disliked of

already released don't lie to me as a direct addressed were filler native New Yorker who novels the oval office there are similar messages throughout the album walls which is released on friday can't wait\nIn ... by by that context I think that they could say that someone who is growing up as a citizen of another country or somebody who is left the United states and live the rest of his life in\nSomewhere else okay you exclude that person but to try to go after now people whose parents were not us citizens of the United states are not here legally the undocumented\nIs clearly a loser and there's a great great\nEditorial today in the wall Street Journal making that point the real point about this is that there is neither political will no judicial will to do this or to have a constitutional amendment to change birthright citizenship\nPresident Trump is a very strong ground when it comes to resisting the caravan very strong ground\nAnd virtually all Republicans and nearly all Americans agree with that nobody wants to throw the door is open to everybody\nNobody wants to remove borders I shouldn't say nobody but very very few and just a fringe of the Democratic party\nAnd to stand on that principle the idea that we have to have an immigration system that works that's the kind of thing you can win\nThe or by the way they they did some fake news today on CNN or they said that well in in order to change the constitution the president would have to get two thirds of both houses of Congress and two thirds of the states that's not true\nHe would need to get two thirds of the house two thirds of the Senate and three quarters of the states it is not possible birthright citizenship is not going to\nChange 'em\nIf Mr Trump wants to end the practice as the wall Street Journal and again nothing new York Times of Wall Street journal which had been very supportive of President Trump generally says Mr Trump wants to end the practice sometimes called birth tourism\nHe can always draft and campaign for a constitutional amendment but Congress is unlikely to agree and pass a law much less than an amendment to the constitution\nSo is making this futile gesture of an executive order a week before election day Mr Trump made a political mistake this year by not trading legal status to adult immigrants brought here illegally as children for more border security then Republicans would have run on an immigration accomplishment\nAnd said he wanted the political issue and will ... will soon see how well that worked\nBut here's my basic point about this politically\nI don't think there's anyone who was excited by President Trump saying he's going to address birth tourism who wasn't already supporting President Trump who wasn't already supporting a Republican and getting people excited over this by the way I Do think it would be possible to curb birth tourism\nBy enacting some legislation around saying that in special circumstances where people are traveling to the United states not for the purpose of long term residency but simply to give birth to a child here in the United states\nThen you can question whether that child really is in the jurisdiction\nOf the United states and that's okay but generally to challenge the idea that a child born to someone who has lived here for\nTen years and uh where the child grows up entirely in the United states you want to try to challenge the citizenship status of that individual\nWhy not make more citizens who are actually committed to this country\nAnd so make sure that there is some kind of commitment or naturalization if need be but uh if there's any doubt for the parents but creating a process where people can go through American is Asian\nIt seems to me is much better than obliterate in the idea of citizenship as some Democrats seem to want to do or\nThe idea of changing the constitution to change the status of people who were born here whose parents may not have had the right to come here in the first place we'll be right back on the ... that show I go to some of your calls coming up the great hall of wean debate [noise]\nOne eight hundred and nine five five seven genes
