a Nikki Haley on the Republican side\nVersus Beto O'Rourke on the Democratic side more than ... I mean the the media love affair with this guy is something to behold\nDoes he deserve all the hype and then we're going to be speaking to Stephen Moore the author of a new book called Trump's ... about some of the lives about the economy\nAnd what happens next after the November elections to help Trump fulfill his America First vision of economic reform one eight hundred nine five five Seventeen Seventy six our phone number but first up\nLast night the president gave a a a rally speech and he was an extraordinarily good spirits using extremely jolly\nThe one aspect of his speech that has gotten all the attention I don't need to play for you because it's such an at CNN and CBS and NBC or all over it\nAnd let me just acknowledge\nI think it was unfortunate I don't think it was a good thing that the president said that it was a praise worthy or a vet that basically congressman Gianforte Greg Gianforte of Montana he was in ... in Missoula\nAnd congressman Gianforte and at the time I thought that John forte handle it very well he lost his temper he body slammed the reporter he knocked off his glasses\nThere were charges brought against him he pleaded guilty he apologized lavishly he made a legal settlement with the reporter heat assaulted and I've spoken to congressman Gianforte this was one of the most embarrassing moments with his wife\nAnd I don't think it's a a good idea for President Trump to make light of it I don't think ours when John forte would think that however\nWhat struck me about this is this is that that was a tiny segment of a very long and very substantive speech actually with Trump was doing and I think in a fairly effective way was laying out\nThe way he's going to be campaigning and very close Senate races in very close governor's races as a Republican trying to help other Republicans and Trump last night was in Montana where the Senate races become unexpectedly close\nBetween our candidate Rosendale and the incumbent Democrat Jon Tester who pretends because he wants lost a finger in a farming accident\nNo there's no solidarity there was to show the we're not talking about it because he was lost a finger in a farming accident he's really a moderate Democrat he's a a good old boy if he's not he's a big liberal\nAnd a Trump was speaking on behalf of Matt Rosendale another Montana Republican and he had this to say and defining what this election should be about\n[noise] I Know a lot [noise] of having all\nLaw and order and common sense that's what it's gonna be\nIt's got to be an election of those\nOkay he's talking about the Kavanaugh the caravan and common sense and I think he threw in all of script the idea of law and order but that that do fine I'll look in terms of Kavanaugh\nObviously because of the treatment of a justice Kavanaugh\nThat as mobilize lots of Republicans in there are lots of congressional races they are now the official people who do the polling and the betting and things like that say there is a one out of three chance that Republicans hold the house\nIt used to be down to one out of six so right now Republican prospects\nAre surging even in the house of representatives and that's a good thing and part of it is because yes with their response to justice Kavanaugh the Democrats show that they're not the party of jobs they're the party of well we'll let the president delivers on line\nBut the choice would not be more clear Democrats ...\nRepublicans reduced job [noise]\n\nThat's the pullout [noise]\nBrian Sharp [noise] and the radical Democrat they want to raise your taxes they want to impose socialism on our incredible nation they could Venezuela because that's what's going to [noise] they want to take away your health care because you won't be able to have in our country will be able to afford it\nDestroy your Second Amendment and throw open your own deadly drugs and vicious gangs because plenty of them are coming across a lot of drugs\nOkay and this is a problem for President Trump because guess what he's president United States Republicans controlled Senate in the house they feel the harm of homeland security they control lights\nAnd he is right that there are a lot of people coming across the border I just looked at the numbers and they're sad\nThe number of people entering the country illegally is not going down and went down the first year of Trump's presidency you're the first part of the first year of Trump's presidency\nSound like tripled where it was when Trump became president of the rates in September ... the angry\nAnd that's why I think President Trump is absolutely right to make an issue of this caravan and by the way the evidence appears to be as a half hour ago\nThat there was some progress getting Mexican authorities to move troops to try to block the advance of of what looks to be over four thousand people waiting Honduran flags by the way\nWe're marching their way through Guatemala and then through Mexico and they say they're headed to the United states what do Democrats say we know where Trump's stance\nFrom stands on a common sense principle which I honestly who who could disagree you cannot let this caravan in you can feel sorry for these people\nBut if we go ahead and say oh well you march told his way will come and we'll process your your applications for asylum that there will be no end to it\nIt will encourage more and more and more and more and look it's it's a question here not of whether we rearrange our immigration system to make it more sensible maybe even more compassionate\nBut right now the question was this caravan is whether we have an immigration system at all\nOr whether we simply raise the borders any kind of meaningful distinction\nAnd uh I think frankly President Trump is looking at this thing going on how is this going to work out either as he is going to win victory and turn the caravan back when there's going to be some kind of awful disaster and I think the incoming president of Mexico undress Lopez\nManuel Obrador um has a ... actually shown some willingness to work with the Trump Administration on stopping\nThis caravan which is crucial I've been a Trump ...\nSaid this about the economy and related it of course of the fact that there are more and more people coming across the border\nBecause I have such an incredible autonomy I Am so money everybody wants to try [noise]\nOkay\nProbably the rhetoric I've created so much I have done this I mean and you know and that's not ideal rhetoric but look the fact is the economy has done better that's what we're going to be talking about was even more coming up and and just a moment\nThe point over here and I think it's very striking is everybody knows what Trump says everybody knows where Trump stands everybody knows what Trump has to say about this has anyone heard a\nAny kind of meaningful democratic response on this issue of the caravan\n'cause I've heard nothing all they do is they attacked Trump and that's not a policy being anti Trump is not a policy and last night\nBeto O'Rourke the new democratic superstar the great hope for Democrats not just for two thousand Eighteen but for two thousand and twenty and beyond ... who's a talented politician but he blew up his\nHis own campaign and frankly I think its own future with a one answer that was just a moment we'll get to that and to your calls coming up we'll also be speaking with Stephen Moore\nThe author of the new book Trump ... of course one of the leading economic thinkers at the Heritage Foundation behind the America First economic reform we'll be right back [noise]\nOne eight hundred nine five five seven genes Seventy six so Michael men vigil last one eight hundred nine five five Seventy Seventy six [noise]\nThey claim that the tax cuts that you helped to write and help to design those tax cuts that have been passed have caused this exploding budget deficit because they've reduced revenues that's just a flat on line isn't it\nYeah revenues are actually up this year so we passed the biggest tax cut and three years and we actually have a slight increase is not what I Would like to see revenues higher and I think by the way as we get you know as we continue to see this economy\nOr continue to grow you you know the best way to get tax revenues headed for people to work at ... businesses profitable move businesses back to the United states which is happening uh but yeah the problem is spending and you know people say oh you're just a rival Republican I'm not a rubber Republican the Republicans\nAnd Democrats this bipartisan spending spree that's going on my caller both parties deserve a lot of blame for this\nAnd you like a President Trump's a idea a vast amount every department to cut five percent yes\nI Love that you know that's what businesses do\nYou know that that's the thing if you're running a business and you don't have enough money coming in and your expenditures are too high you got to go to your agency and this is what businesses did during the recession they\nTalked in their stomach they tighten their belts they got rid of inefficient workers and inefficient services and things they didn't need and they save money and they became profitable getting we never do that and government and by the way I Would like to hear one listener\nOf your show colony or show and tell me you can't say five cents on the dollar\nThat right it well exactly ... what about the one aspect and you mentioned this in your book Trump ... posted up at our website at Michael ... the one aspect of Trump's America First program that he talked about in the campaign was infrastructure that he's really done pretty much nothing to implement\nA where's the money going to come from to do the big infrastructure improvements that we need\nWell let me go back to what I was just saying about this construction boom that's going on in this country factories and warehouses and and apartments and that that isn't for structure and what we need pipelines we need ... terminals we need\nOil refineries we you know the point I'm making is a lot of that infrastructure and we need in this country you know rebuilding our ports a lot of that Michael I think can be could be done with private money it doesn't why what where does it say that the government has to pay for all this

which is the case of a Christian Woman whose name as a C a bb she's illiterate but then a lot of people in Pakistan are particularly women and\nBy the way that's not an anti woman comment that's a pro woman comment I mean one of the things that is deeply dysfunctional about a lot of the Islamic countries in the world is that ah they don't provide any education for the women\nIn any event she's Christian and uh\nShe has been on death row in two thousand ten what is your crime well here is the other way it's described in the wall Street Journal\nUm it it it turns out that are troubles began and again this is eight years ago with a squabble over a cup of water on a sweltering summer day in Punjab\nTo Muslim women\nAccused ms baby a farm worker and a a mother a mother of five in fact they accused her of\nPolluting the top that they were all drinking from on this hot day because she drank from it and she's not a Muslim\nSo in the midst of this argument allegedly ms Bebe told them Jesus died on the cross for the sins of mankind what did your prophet Mohammed ever do to save mankind\nNow it's not even clear she actually said that because under Pakistani more to talk about blasphemy is blasphemy\nSo all you're allowed to do is say she committed blasphemy you're not allowed to cross examine the witnesses she's been condemned to death since two thousand ten she lives in a windowless cell there have been international efforts to free her\nAnd um [noise]\nIt it's just unbelievable they're already people who have\nDied in her case a shortly after the span villagers accused ms Bebe of blasphemy and they had or imprison\nThe following year court sentenced to death she lives in a windowless L. where she cooks for herself for fear of poisoning by prison staff or a fellow inmates against this backdrop of standing up for his baby requires courage in Pakistan and then two thousand eleven as a year after she was\nCondemned the\nGovernor of Punjab governor Solomon Taseer a visited her in prison to try to show some sympathy for her\nAnd right after that visit\nAnd his expression of support for a sea of bb his bodyguard killed him\n\nTwo months later a gunman killed Shabaab bought see that's another a Christian politician\nWho also opposed Pakistan's blasphemy law it's an unbelievable thing this is a nuclear power now why am I talking about this right now not only because\nThere was attention to her case and there's a new president of Pakistan\nImran Khan who says he's a reformer he's a former cricket star and maybe just maybe he will show some mercy on this poor woman the problem is the president con\nUh supports the blasphemy law the idea that someone should be executed\nFor saying something that disagrees with the religious beliefs of Ninety seven percent of Pakistanis\nOr the entire thing is mad and it's difficult and it brings us to this um does your mouth to show the incident I uh I have been troubled by some voices on the right\nWho want to say that to show the at one time in his life had been sympathetic to the Muslim Brotherhood he clearly moved away from that if you read his last column that he wrote before he died that was just published earlier this week in the Washington Post\nHe was no Islam is he he was calling on Islamic countries to allow more press freedom ironically\nThe the idea that anyone would try to justify or minimize the hideous nature of what apparently was done to Mr show he said I actually think President Trump and secretary palm pay on particular have been getting it about right\nYou can't go off and say well we support other reforms that Mohammed bin Salman is doing therefore this is okay we have to look past it\nBut you also can say we're going to blow up our entire relationship with Saudi Arabia which is a regional power in a very important ally the United states over this one\nEpisode and it's it's a remarkably important that we move forward we will form of some unity and not make this into a political issue one of the things that the Democrats do wrong as\nThey want to make every last thing about Trump and or do\nI think that Trump made a mistake or comparing well saying that they he should be innocent until proven guilty it's like Brett Kavanaugh comparing\nThe potential murder to the uh legit and I believe imagined a solved by a Seventeen year old high school guy who ... and and the ... and it was all that the Coleman aided in groping\nA to compare that to a brutal murder and dismembered meant and torturing a guy in cutting off his fingers and and then slicing of his body to transport out of the country\nThis is not comparable and it's also not comparable because this was done in the name of government I'll tell you what scares me most about the show the story is that stupidity and sometimes\nMore frightening than arrogance or pure evil and how stupid do you have to be if you're planning to murder some journalists to try to do it\nIn the consulate in a foreign power what do you think is going to happen\nHow can you imagine you're not going to get caught maybe they wanted to get what they wanted to send a message but that's evil to send a message through murder and torture is hideous and it's evil and that's wrong these stories the one from Pakistan which is hideous the one from\nSaudi Arabia and or the murder if it occurred and I think it did is actually from turkey they're very alarming but they have one\nLesson that's profoundly important the lesson is\nProtect religious liberty is absolutely crucial or we will get to that and some of the fight for religious liberty right here at home in which you can actually participate upcoming right up on them eventually\nOne eight hundred and nine five five Seventeen Seventy six so Michael Smith

a little better\nA platform I Believe you get a little more time on TV you got to get to talk and sound bites wearing like two to three minutes\nTo make a point and so the ... what the book does take some of those points it expands on um the bills the case if you will that builds the argument as for my position on things like race crime police\nOr politics in America we get stuck too often the nice things and so what I offer as well\nSo um how much pushback do you get from fellow a black police officers or you know over the last couple of years when you become so visible you have to deal with the usual stuff that comes with being black and conservative and you know being a traitor and all that stuff\nOh no nothing from black police officers look who in the Jordan but police officers\nThey what they realized there were all blue so I don't get too much pushback from the prospect I get the heat really push back the hate is from the left media is from a lot of Democrats in and and liberals in general\nUm ... that's interesting because um I I just it's I Wonder what the what it's like in in the average police force or\nYou might get the impression that there would be some kind of a black white divide there on on all the stuff that surrounding it and all the you know being bombarded with all this stuff every time there's a shooting or any kind of an incident uh and that people are not taking sides and police forces around the country\nNot generally you know you may have one or two that that that does that the steps outside of that in a\nWill not condemn the
