Davis always go to the Michael amendment showing Twitter at ... and Michael ... dot com even when the filling guys are here right\nSo I I I've just I've talked to so many people and I've read so many things that I've talked to other people who do this for a living and they're telling me the same thing that that people are sick of this that it it has become\n... and ... it has become ludicrous we've gone from a a a an\nAllegation of sexual assault that was worthy enough to bring a woman in an effort sit down and share her testimony which she did a that story is falling apart there is no corroboration of it and the subsequent stories in New Yorker and among the arm of ah of\nAttorney Michael ... those those ... those are less credible and Dr Ford and that's saying something\nAnd and now we're getting into ice wars and uh and and then it ms sweating it who doesn't remember whether that was Brett or not at or near a punch bowl but he had some red solo cups that I wasn't going to take a red solo cup from Brett Kavanaugh\nIt it's it ... its feet are on the absurd it has gone from political theater to theater of the absurd\nI wrote a town hall dot com column this morning posted the dawn my time so it's been up there for a few hours out to share a couple of thoughts from it\nAnd um and then get some thoughts from you got some audio Richard Blumenthal [laughter] which is always enjoyable there's just something delicious leak\nTwisted about Richard Blumenthal democratic Connecticut lecturing anyone about truth telling Mr stolen valor they these folks they they ... they have no shame they just have no shame will also try again to diagram sentences for Mazie Hirono is just just always an adventure\nUh and and will will will attract the moving the goalposts and just sort of see where it's all going so my question for you I have an overall broad question for you\nI ... and that is is is what's happening before our eyes\nWhat is happening before our eyes I strongly feel that the nation is on to this campaign I mean you that I'm a slate\nThere are plenty of liberal plenty of Democrats and many due listening and I'd love to hear from you as well because we take all comers\nAlthough Michael bad vet show as you know Michael does that when he's here and I do it every any show I'm hosting Meyer somebody else's I absolutely welcome opposing views but I Will tell you something and and we had a little bit of experimentation with this yesterday here's my belief\nShow me a twenty people\nWho want to obsess about Brett Kavanaugh's calendar\nAnd who are just so convinced that his testimony just doesn't jibe with what the realities of early eighties party life we're\nFinding a mate among those twenty people are some folks who are really concerned about judge Kavanaugh's temperament to I mean oh my gosh she\nShe really blew his cool in in some questioning with Amy ... Sheldon Whitehouse and I don't know if we can F\nTemperament like that on the court and blah blah blah blah buzzwords find me twenty people who are all twisted off about the science shows ... irrelevance ease the ridiculous mess\nAnd do you know what's driving every single one of them\nThey don't want him on the court because he's a constitutional list [noise] they don't\nDon't care about how he might have treated women when they were Seventeen years old because of the people who are telling you that thing about probably have no problem with Bill Clinton probably have no problem with Ted Kennedy\nBill Clinton's I Know problem Ted Kennedy find no problem but Brett Kavanaugh whoa whoa whoa no surgery can't go there that that's when you know that something else is driving\nTrain and what's driving the train here in in this really is so simple\nAnd once you understand it becomes easier to grass and you've and know what's going on here\nThis entire episode has nothing to do with women or concern about who did or did not treat our midst treat women properly in the eighties or any other time every single bit of this is smoke\nIs smoke and what's behind the smoke\nIs the true motivation and that is that the campaign against Brett Kavanaugh is being launched by and embraced by people who do not want a constitutional\nList on the Supreme Court\nThat's because constitutional is don't make stuff up in their rulings they don't make up right that don't exist like low right to terminate the pregnancy\nWhich was absolutely fabricated from whole cloth and roe v Wade in Nineteen Seventy three and this is extremely important\nI don't want roe versus Wade overturned because I'm pro life\nBrett Kavanaugh will not vote to overturn roe v Wade because he is a conservative or a pro lifer and by the way I've no idea what he'll do but if he's a genuine constitutional issue you will absolutely vote to overturn it not to forward his political views or his political agenda\nBecause judges should keep justices especially should keep all those things out of there ... all that matters is is there a right to abortion and the constitution of course there is not\nLet's talk about the over ... versus a Hodges the twenty Fifteen gay marriage ruling thanks Anthony Kennedy for that\nAt this was a completely unconstitutional ruling that said the state not only the state could offer gay marriage equality 'cause of course they can states can do whatever they want in terms of the definition of marriage but over over she just said they had\nThey had to\nGo you've got to to make sure that women can abort their babies I Know you've got to make sure that states a rule that a a marriage of two guys is the same as my marriage to my wife\nNobody though if a state wants to end by the way that that conversely applies to abortion is what little constitution one on one if you need at the moment roe v Wade is overturned in that they cannot come fast enough\nThe moment rosy wages overturn what happens\nWhat happens is the first answer is close to nothing immediately the answer is nothing but the landscape that's left is every state can have whatever abortion laws they wish when over ... versus Hodges overturned every state can recognize the marriages that they wish\nIf state number one wants to have full marriage equality to do two ladies ... whatever you want to do it's all marriage to us that's great but at the state next door says not so much one man one woman that that they get to do that\nIf said hey wants to have ghoulish ally permissive abortion laws I Will lamented if I Lived in that state I'd fight doggedly against it but they can do it\nAnd it's a state next door says new we're going to be very restrictive we're going to absolutely protect the unborn\nIn many many ways that we haven't even been able to do before that state gets to do that all of that that I've just described hoping to make your wrecked a car or anything that's called respecting the constitution this is the kind of America that Brett Kavanaugh will help bring about\nIn other words in the ... the left\nAnd removing their ability to legislate through court rulings to get from the judiciary that which they cannot get from legislatures this has been an ongoing game of the left for decades and it is over when constitutional is reached the high court\nBrett Kavanaugh is just such a person God Bless him\nAnd um that's that's what it's all about because that that is garlic too of empire that that is is quip tied\nTo the left\nSo that's what it's all about him getting nothing to do with everybody's all concerned about Dr Ford listen we're all concerned about that for some map at our one that Brett Kavanaugh's hands that I Wish her well no ill will toward her whatsoever or go leader good happy and prosperous life oh I bet it'll be prosperous her calendar will soon Phil [noise]\nWith uh with book meals and I'm\nSpeaking engagements plenty I'm sure that I Wish her well I don't begrudge or any of that so to get to have it on the court are we going to do that is that going to happen to you feel like we're closer today than we were yesterday or could it all just goes sideways answer is yes it could and I'll tell you why next Mark Davis in for Michael advantage stick around\nOne eight hundred nine five five Seventeen Seventy six\nThat somebody could accuse you of stuff that doesn't necessarily have to be a woman as everybody say for somebody could accuse us up\nThank God you're automatically guilty why does this route you are certainly guilty

let's let's talk about the concept of respect um let's do a let's let's let's meet in the arena of colonizing I\nGrazed the good people of town hall this morning with a a treat is that says something I Want to run by you\nKnow this is no longer just the Supreme Court confirmation a catalog could fail it can be with you could withdraw himself he can be withdrawn and just offer up any Coney Barrett are ... and be just fine constitutionally\nBut these people cannot win the fabric of America is is is at risk here ... laws of basic decency basic human conduct basic behavioral norms they're all at at play here and am I being too dramatic\n[noise] I think what you're having the latest chapter in the saga of an ongoing disease which is our government has grown so powerful so all encompassing so able to bend the power of government to favor one group for people to another\nThat this is just the latest example of how our problem in politics is not too much money\nTo the Y. and others find where their word our problems too much power POW we are the founders never intended for the Supreme Court to be this powerful to decide things on the national scope with a single finishing them off in the five to four vote\nAnd as a result because all the power in my from on some issues especially the hot button social issues is concentrated in Supreme Court people will do anything to get that power anything and that's what we're seeing in the cabin okay [noise]\nWell that that is where we are because legislatures can legislate a chief executives can do executives things and pilot certain programs through presidents are powerful Congress is powerful but they're all um musical and they're all about biased by the Supreme Court\nAnd and that means that just when their disagreements they win and that's just all there is to it or is it what are we mistaken about that\nWell the Supreme Court is are unelected branch and as a result um in the court that for the life tenure we're term limits on the president we have um you know elections every two years in the house of representatives every six years in the Senate\nBut on the Supreme Court especially because the it's only nine justices someone gets on the court for life\nOr that can be in a lifetime of your side losing five to four decisions we'd be a whole lot better off if you remember that you know the first but no Supreme Court nominee ever appeared before the Senate Judiciary committee until Nineteen twenty five\nBecause the court wasn't that powerful now and in fact they didn't consistently started appearing until Nineteen fifty five now of course the Supreme Court is so powerful and so invasive in all of these areas of our life we treated like you know World War three whenever there's a TRACON the\nIt seems like an event horses hard isn't it a ... I don't I don't see any way that we can ratchet things the in fact I'm thirty seconds on a conversation I had well here's a little name drop that I Do on purpose\nMy friend Tom Jovan any heavy Institute for policy in the nation I Am wearing they're wonderful people\nAnd and he and I were having a conversation about as you said this whole thing about court supremacy Supreme Court supremacy if you will is just a mess there because they are co equal I have a term equal should suffice their co equal it meaning that that if the Supreme Court says something okay fine\nAnd if a president disagrees with it she can ignore it but then rather than chaos breaking out the public can figure out whether we like or don't like the president that ignores the Supreme Court and we can impeach our unlike him\nAnd there's a certain rough balance to that unlike what we had that you just described which is this all powerful tribunal that just runs our lives on their whim\nWell I Know that a grant Lincoln Andrew Jackson location we talk about ignoring the Supreme Court\nAnd the you know those were and they bring in this case the civil war was around I Would much prefer the Congress exercise of power it's almost never used which is Congress can pass a law saying the court does not have jurisdiction over this area of our lives\nIn other words we're going to take back the power we created the constitution created the courts the court's powers that infinite we take back some of it we limited jurisdiction\nI'm OK untangling now with with ah with with potential a list of making it might be in\nCase of the Nineteen sixties you know the Supreme right out of nowhere said Madeline Marie O'Hare is right you can't have a Supreme Court you can't have a a prayer to a Supreme Being in a I guess today we we couldn't go out for Muslims but perhaps not anyone else given how things are going but you can't have a prayer in public schools\nWell there was a big move in Congress and I think that if the times had been different had liberalism hadn't been renting renting Supreme back then Congress could have said no this is not the court's jurisdiction we take it back so the decision was null and void\nI and that's okay that's satisfying up to a point because I saw Madeline Marie O'Hare to be as repugnant a person\nA but but we couldn't someone rightfully step forward and say a while of doesn't the pesky First Amendment when can a legislature come in there and say that you could argue all day with her parents school is a First Amendment establishment clause violation or whatever but that doesn't that it's each kind of envy argument before it begins\nWell again um what the\nWhat the court had said in the ... case was this was a ... this was\nA violation of the establishment of religion claws well if you disagree with that Congress can step in is the people's representatives and say no we have a different view\nSo again that hasn't happened if I'm likely to happen but I'm simply saying that we are going to have to appoint a whole bunch more constitutional is people who are judicial\nRestraint people to the court because you know there are five people on the court if Kavanaugh is confirmed who don't have this expansive view of the Supreme Court's power rebel more humble view\nAnd I think that that's the best way to handle this put people on the cork who don't want to be played comic rulers of the rest of us\nPrecisely and and that is why a distance he would be the fifth that's why the left is is having a whole you know what's sad about that and that's what's great about talking to Jon son is as we can go very macro and now let's come back and go very micro\nOr I Am feeling a little better about Susan Collins and Lisa Murkowski a little because I think they were willing to vote for him before the FBI we should placate them Jeff Flake is a wild card I have no idea what amount of ... going to want to rush the will of course I called her own\nHe will ultimately vote yes why what makes you so sure I Know Jeff and I also know that a lot of this is a well let's just say McCain disease\nI'm you know I think Jeff has enjoying some of the media attention you know\nI I Hope that I Hope that the worst that's going on I really do but if you and God Bless Senator McCain but if you coined of the pathology\nI thought it was just part of the whole of his very defensive\nAh and on a [noise]\nYou know unconvincing presentation on [noise] and I\nI told someone later boy I'll tell you\nThey give us a lot of credit\nThirty six years ago I we started this again I\nGuess I mean if it is back at Yale that yeah well\nEven before in high school apparently um [noise] no I I I I don't you know look I I Want the FBI to conduct as a thorough investigation as they possibly can within whatever restraints are empowered upon\nThem um but I think\nFor anyone who believe there is such a thing as a judicial temperament and that we want judges particularly those on our highest court to approach issues approach plaintiffs and defendants with um a sense of fairness that there's a lot to be concerned about where\nDo tell I think that a judge Kavanaugh displayed exactly the right kind of radar for fairness because fairness ... exude from his every judicial pour\nIt it radiates from every ruling he has a very strong sense of fairness basic fairness basic decency\nSo that when those concepts are dashed against the rocks well those concepts are ex bloated\nRiding a vehicle of character assassination from the left\nIt is exactly his sense of fairness that infused his personality they're under questioning from those Democrats is Democrat tour mentors and it is exactly that righteous indignation that human instinct that anyone would have to
