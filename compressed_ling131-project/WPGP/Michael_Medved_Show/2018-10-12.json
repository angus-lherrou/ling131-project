political unity for the United states which is a a complete contempt I mean total content\nThat is shared by Americans are black and white and Latino and Asian and rich and poor and living in the interior live on the coasts everybody shares can him for political correctness\nThis is something that is stunning and there is a new study that are ... over at Harvard has written about yes Harvard we'll we'll get to that in just a moment\nAnd uh there's something else that uh I I think should unite Americans but maybe doesn't yet which is a fear\nOf another impeachment crisis I mean Democrats are being more and more serious and more and more credible saying if we win the house of representatives let alone the Senate\nWe're going forward with impeaching Brett Kavanaugh we're going forward with impeaching President Trump\nIs that a good idea will talk to one of the people who was central to the last impeachment crisis we had his name as a judge Ken Starr he uh was in charge of the investigation that led to the impeachment\nOf Bill Clinton\nWhat are the lessons for today's political world and one of the lessons for Robert Mueller who's playing the same kind of jobs that are that the Ken Starr functioned in back in the Nineteen nineties one eight hundred nine five five Seventeen Seventy six is our phone number\nOn this issue of political correctness first as there's this amazing piece in ah the Atlantic of all places in the Atlantic is not a conservative journal headline Americans strongly dislike dislike PC culture\nAnd this is stunning in the way that it shows that hatred for contempt for resistance to political correctness brings together everybody\nHe um\n... what what they write about is this is if you look at what Americans have to say on issues such as immigration the extent of white privilege\nAnd the prevalence of sexual harassment there distinct clusters that emerge progressive activists traditional liberals passive liberal politically disengaged moderates et cetera et cetera okay one of the things is fascinating here is people who are traditional conservatives\nFar outnumber those who say they're progressive activists by twenty five percent or conservative eight percent are progressive activists\nBy contrast the two thirds of Americans who don't belong to either extreme constitute an exhausted majority\nTheir members share a sense of fatigue with our polarized national conversation a willingness to be flexible and their political viewpoints el lack of voice in the national conversation\nI think that's exactly right and you can count me uh yeah I I mean I I Would probably be grouped together with a twenty five percent who are devoted conservatives they say traditional conservatives but they're certainly elements sometimes you feel like part of an exhausted majority\nAnd then they go on tour right they say most members of this exhausted majority remember that's eighty percent of the public and then some dislike political correctness among the general population full eighty percent believe that political correctness is a problem in our country\nEven young people are uncomfortable with it\nIncluding Seventy four percent between the ages of twenty four and twenty nine\nAnd of those under twenty four Seventy nine percent that means the people who most resent political correctness who think it's a problem in our country or the people are having a shoved down their throats it's not working\nAnd why is this why is this resentment so common and by the way who what racial group resents political correctness most remembers eighty percent of everybody\nYou think why people you're on\nThe uh racial group that most resents political correctness is American Indians\nAre second or Hispanics Hispanics hate political correctness and Asians\nThey hurried I'm political correctness or even more than white people do\nBlack people Seventy five percent resent political correctness think it's a problem in the country and this piece in the Atlantic quotes a forty year old American indian and Oklahoma who participate in a focus group is part of this project and it's interesting project\nBut uh this American indian again forty years old said it seems like every day you wake up something has changed you say Jew or Jewish\nIs it a black guy or African American you have to be on your toes because you never know what to say so political correctness in that sense it's scary\nThree quarters of African Americans opposed political correctness this means that they are only four percentage points less likely than whites and only five percentage points less likely than the average to believe that political correctness is a problem okay uniting blacks and whites and young and old\nCan we say no to political correctness\nAnd that goes for political correctness even in San Francisco\nOr this is an amazing story about someone named Steve on don't taste even his name is Steve on S. T. V. O. and he is the new president of the San Francisco Unified School district and they've had a long standing tradition for the San Francisco Unified School district\nA tradition of I'm beginning each public meeting saying the pledge of allegiance well no more\nInstead the first meeting that Steve on cook presided over as president San Francisco Unified School district sounded like this\nThat you tonight we start this me to get out of the claim American writer and activist Maya Angelou who wants to when you learn teach when you get give [noise]\nSection ... is accessibility to information for public sex shouldn't be opening items approval of four minutes for September twenty fifth ... motion the second please ... ... ...\nOkay and then they go forward into the meeting a no pledge of allegiance and instead a a phony quote why do I say it's a funny quote the Washington Post ... actually looked at this\nUh this quote that is allegedly from Maya Angelou the only source for believing that she ever said it\nWas that Oprah Winfrey\nA set at that Maya Angelou said it but there's no record that you have a road that are set it or anything like that and by the way what does it mean when you learn teach\nWhen you get give 'em a I'm\nI'm not sure what that means okay here's the story of Steve on cook he's a young man he grew up in public housing he did very well in school he went to Williams College very exclusive high ranking liberal arts college in Massachusetts\nAnd um then he came back to San Francisco is involved in a number of social initiatives and gum south elected school board is now the school board president\nBut he said the um\nThe move dropping the pledge of allegiance and instead of calling Maya Angelou was not a demonstration and the vein of Colin Kaepernick another San Francisco bureau in quotes uh he says I was looking for creative ways to express admiration for the people that make the country what it is\nHe told the San Francisco ... chronicles of the current current political climate was disappointing and the Trump Administration has quote been attacking our liberties okay\nYou can even say all kinds of things about the Trump Administration where it's been the Trump Administration been attacking liberties I hadn't heard that before what what liberties exactly is the Trump Administration attacked\nOne eight hundred nine five five Seventeen Seventy six and then he said I don't spend much time thinking about President Trump yeah I think that's probably true\nHe says although there is a requirement that schools conduct a pledge or similar activity there is no such requirement for school boards that was a statement from the district spokeswoman whose name is Lauren doesn't act and no one in the audience of beer to mind\nHooks new introduction of course not at San Francisco and now they are planning on having other quotes from other worthy\nOf to begin in a place of the pledge of allegiance those will include Harvey Milk James Baldwin\nToni Morrison the Wright brothers Abraham Lincoln and more um [noise] so what's wrong with this\nAnd what's wrong with a cross on the war memorial it's under attack we'll be right back on that show [noise]\nUh well he actually dissented from the majority opinion said nearly a century ago Marilyn citizens out of deep respect and gratitude took on the daunting task directing a monument to mirror the measure of individual devotion and sacrifice these heroes had so noble e achieved\nThe panel majorities has their effort violates the constitution the soldiers fought to defend I respectfully think otherwise\nIt is outrageous and one of the points that has raised an important column by a Jeremy ... is one of the lawyers involved in this case is not too far away from this monument and Maryland is Arlington National cemetery\nAnd if this decision stands up it won't it's going to go to the U.S Supreme Court and there will be probably a seven to two decision against the stupidity the story here as private citizens decided to honor people from that community who died in World War one by creating a monument in their honor\nAnd putting it up with public subscriptions it was not using taxpayer money it was all paid for by donations they put up this monument to honor the war dead\nAnd now if this court decision stands the monument would have to be removed\nDestroyed or defaced to a race to cross\nThis is outrageous\nAnd it's why the judicial issues are so important let's go to Rick in Los Angeles Rick you're on the Michael ...\nThanks so much Michael for taking my call I have a couple of points on this issue that you brought up first of all the gentleman in San Francisco who thinks that their freedoms are being attacked\nI I Love this about the ... you know all you have to do now is just so wary with those views that they hold and all of a sudden it's become an attack right that's how they would know this is absolutely\nAnd the other example is you're

in contempt\nIt is subtitled a memoir of the Clinton investigation the author is Ken Starr and a judge star I've I've got to tell you this a book is so reasonable it is so relevant and some of the revelations are\nMost sensational unsatisfying and uh the the book is posted at our website at Michael midday dot com in writing it\nAnd then the response to the book which has been overwhelming since it's come out what surprised you most\nOf what surprised me very positive way is that uh the\nClinton a spin machine has remained silent\nAnd I said I said and and I don't mean that to be on time but the the constant spin cycle is Howard Kurtz that at the Washington Post style but uh was extraordinarily busy and energetic and somewhat say highly effective\nAt a uh taking a a issue with what seemed to me to be indisputable and that is the facts and so I'm very pleased about that the other thing Michael I Would say is that there's so many eerie echoes from the past that we are hearing today and you mentioned to impeachment\nThat's very high on the list because as you though a impeachment was extraordinarily controversial in the nineties and yet some of those crying for impeachment now with some of the most of the sufferers voices saying how dare you that\nAh the book is called contempt a memoir of the Clinton investigation or Hillary Clinton doesn't come off are so very well in your book\nYes and uh you know turn the other cheek and uh and kindness to to others and so forth but it's just the facts and and and and the facts are are\nA and sort of the day new mall was when we and the investigation seriously considered presenting an indictment or to the federal grand jury and little log\nNaming Hillary Rodham Clinton alone for her crimes in connection with the Little Rock or Arkansas face of the investigation in addition a during the course of interviews with her at the White House she stood in such\nComplete contrast in terms of relational skills and the like with her spouse Bill Clinton who of course is eventually\nCharming and charismatic and a empathy at all the rest of it\nAnd she said as I say in the book seem to be just sort of deliberately in your face a A R massive a failure of recollection not only strain credulity Michael we just did that by\nThe time we assessed all of her answers we knew that she was ah she was lying under oath fainting or a failure recollection there was so colossal so profound that it's simply could not have been true\nOkay you clearly\nBelieve a and I know because you said this house where it would be a mistake to pursue for Democrats\nOr to pursue impeachment proceedings against a either a justice Kavanaugh who used to work with you or against President Trump or why why would that be such a destructive course for the country and and I need you can relate that to some of the lessons in your book contempt\nYes Michael it goes back to the a structural protections built into the constitution\nTo prevent mob rule as we heard Senator Cornyn during the Kavanaugh hearings so to speak about mob rule which seemed to be the disorder of the day and the dystopia that we all experience done were stunned at\nThe founding generation wanted a and demanded a super majority requirement in the Senate a simple majority of the house the people's house should put\nThe issue in the play at their discretion so the majority can simply send articles over but then there needs to be a bipartisan consensus\nThat's the practical political message and the two thirds super majority requirement or embodied in our constitution so don't go there there's just no reason there's no justification other that\nTo a further divide the country if that's the goal let's just divide the country even even more let's do what the Russians\nWere paying other ours amount of money and attention to to do and continue to do was just continue to sow discord\nA and rancor among the American people that would be the eventual a result and an ice experience that and obviously we learn from our experiences and while I was not advocating impeach when I was simply putting the facts of the Clinton investigation\nBefore the house of representatives and while I thought it was a perfectly reasonable action by the house of representatives once the articles arrived at even before that it was very clear that the American people through the United States Senate was just they were not willing\nTo go so far as to upset an election over these clearly establish crimes now if clearly establish crimes such as perjury and obstruction of justice and the like are not sufficient to remove and individual from office\nThen there is absolutely nothing that we know that President Trump has done and leaving justice capital aside\nFor the for the moment that he has done that rises to the level as I see it if it if you will of fence so I think it's a the the book in its own way is a cautionary tale be careful before you marched down the road peach\nWhich speaking with Ken Starr he is the author of contempt and men more of the Clinton investigation\nHe had been is pointed that special prosecutor and it was still special prosecutor in that special counsel and he's one of the most distinguished attorneys and jurists and legal thinkers in our country\nHe um had been appointed to the federal court of appeals by President Reagan he was solicitor general under President George Herbert Walker Bush\nHe also served as president of Baylor University and as a dean of the Pepperdine University law school the book contempt is posted up at our website at Michael midday dot com\nYou were talking before about the need for bipartisan consensus if any I drive for impeachment of anybody is going to be successful\nAnd are there did appear to be some attempt by both two senators I I can name they were both Democrats at the time of the impeachment crisis I Know that a Joe Lieberman of Connecticut and Dianne Feinstein a of um\nOf California I Believe had had both been involved with the idea of promoting censure or a resolution to censure and that could have passed the Congress don't you think\n[noise] yes I think a resolution of censure condemning the crowds of\nA crime a violation of basic principles of the precepts of the rule of law was passed overwhelmingly not unanimously but a overwhelmingly I think it would have exceeded a two thirds majority of cars were given a principled an elegant way out\nYeah and and ah why why was ... who made the determination because it wasn't you who made the determination not to accept a resolution of censure and then to go on with the people's business\nBut a number of arguments were fans to the fact that the constitution contemplated impeachment and so it was either impeachment or\nNothing and as I reflected on this constitutional issue I respectfully disagree with that and therefore would say that in the conversation that may uh unfold and twenty Nineteen\nThat those who are crying impeachment impeachment if their grounds for condemning and I'm saying if they're ... grounds condemning the browser but it's it's a foregone conclusion that impeachment will not succeed and that the the ... the United states will\nComplete his term of office where we seek reelection et cetera et cetera\nThen a resolution of censure strikes me is completely and the discretion of the Congress there's nothing so let me turn the tables on the argument there is nothing in the constitution structurally or textural light that forbid or prohibit or the\nSenate or the house or both from expressing its opinion is the sap probation and it ... past all the time and uh\nThat could be something that President Trump faces judge Kavanaugh justice having a most unlikely the book is contempt the author is Ken Starr we'll be right back with more lessons for today\nDay and age thing uh in northern Virginia Pentagon City she said using very foul language to her mother who was encouraging her Monica to\nCooperate with the investigation a tech herself out of harm's way\nThat she was not going to bring down this and she is very strong language cries of the uh and then she said that course for five months and\nUh the president for his part insist it of course that he\nHad told the truth and is a ... a deposition and the Paula Jones case so the combination of the ... city of Bill Clinton under oath and the stubborn refusal of Monica for five months to cooperate\nWith the investigation just hurt us and the nation through this very hellish purgatory old process\nSpeaking of a hellish in purgatory all process\nI'm ... I I'm I'm sure you've encountered a the current special counsel Robert Mueller he's quiet right now for a while because it's just a few weeks before the upcoming election and I guess the tradition for somebody in that position as you don't break any news right before an election\nI Would you have some special advice for a special counsel Robert Mueller about how to handle the conclusion ... based on your experience that you described in contempt\nYes I Would say that the regulations that are which she was appointed\nBy a Rod Rosenstein points to weigh two very happy resolution once he comes to a close friend and I think he has on me the wrong and I don't know but I think he has concluded that there was no collusion\nBetween the Trump campaign and Russian interests are that's why he was appointed obviously there's the whole Manafort monitor the Rick Gates matter the indictments of the Russian individuals and organizations which really do touch on\nReason that he was appointed bring this to an orderly conclusion and a professional way as quickly as possible\nAnd then happily this is a huge improvement like all over the independent counsel statute of under which I was appointed and that is the regulations in which a model was appointed to not speak of impeachment\nThere was a powerful dynamic in the independent counsel law that Congress passed in Nineteen Seventy eight to nudge\nThe process toward impeachment that's not\nWhere we're going God willing uh and you'll understand why that's so important when you read content a memoir of the Clinton investigation Ken Starr\nHas been a public servant all his life and I admire him greatly to the book is also admirable we'll be right back\n\nWashington a Turkish court has convicted in American pastor but as allowing him to leave turkey that's unanswered prayers many have been concerned about pastor Andrew Brunson including President Trump now for several months who's been calling on turkey to release him calling charges against him that he was involved with the terrorists bought nonsense and simply on through\nThe national Hurricane Center has issued it's vital advisory on Michael now post tropical psych most me to go over the Atlantic ocean by going to remain a very large storm tropical storm force winds said to be extending outward for more than two hundred and fifty miles from its set of flash flooding can still take place in some areas like the Carolinas\nAfter two days of steep losses on Wall street something of a recovery today the Dow Jones industrial average was up two hundred eighty seven points twenty\nFive thousand three hundred and thirty nine but as that goes up by one hundred and sixty this is as a new\nMoon again and I've never before endorsed the pain relief product of any kind of\nFun to him now into relief factor my wife is real because of her neck and shoulder pain let's face it almost everybody over fifty had occasional aches and pains new to aging or exercise and the three week quick started now discounted the only Nineteen Ninety five it's a hundred per cent drug free and the majority of people who order it's\nGoing to order more especially if we can get you out to pay to go to relieve factor dot com\nRefreshingly Christian dating cool nights our favorite time of year is here at the company store dot com our thoughts are turning to the comforts of home like soft flannel sheets lofty down comfort fluffy towels in college he sleep where and with the company store dot com friends and family event going on now you enjoy\nFree shipping and twenty five percent off your next order there's no better time to shop needed the company store dot com and enter family Eighteen I check out for twenty five percent off plus\nFree shipping from our family he ordered that company store dot com did\nYou have an Eighteen mid term elections may be the most consequential in memory and Pennsylvania\nWill play a critical part maybe the critical part\nAnd the outcome please join me for the battleground talkers to her ... her heights country club October twenty seconds along with my friends she\nDennis fragrances firms phone John's tiger moms we clarify wants to save this November started just twenty dollars get details on the program in the I think it is now have the answer P.

I Believe more than any senatorial campaign now in history it's each raise more money\nAnd it's a campaign that's going to lose\nI Am very confident going to lose deserves to lose if the campaign forbade or work in Texas and the young congressman who's running against\nTed Cruz ... I just took a look at the polls they all show Ted Cruz up and up to potentially up six points nine point seven points it's in that range but a ... hour work\nJust announced that he had raised thirty

people in only ... people over special interests people over ... people over super got people over corporation people insurance we do the right things for Texas for this country is critical moments so I just wanted to go back and say thank you for making it possible\nAnd that is because as you said you're not going to win anyway but it's going to be yet another example of people who believe so fervently that critical nightly gathering the big money always when it's going to people that one more time\nFavorite grab knocked off Eric Cantor being outspent cooking like twenty to warn comics

know stop during good money after bad\nActually they are entirely correct and it's a very very smart point and let me add to it and there's another thing I think it's a beautiful thing about sending money to bed or rock and I do want to say\nFor people out there who are dyed in the wool Democrats uh keep sending your money to ... it's a really great way place to put your money because it's absolutely harmless there Ted Cruz is going to win that race\nAnd it's much better to send money to pay into than to send it to some some of those swing state Democrats where it actually might make a difference a\nAnd then I appreciate your\nCall and and by the way the best example of money not determining the election\nIs uh in in the campaign Hillary Clinton outspend Donald Trump more than two to one and this is if you take all of the sources and all the money and all those national funding or ... was not by any means leading span during the primaries\nHe defeated all kinds of primary

anyhow um I think uh myself I kind of what you said I think they do is really running for president and this was just practice your y'all have all that big bank roll\nA leftover when he was dying no way to spend thirty eight million dollars I mean now and November he could be else in daycare centers\nThat he can go part of the law\nOr there you go [laughter] that'd be popular that his base would love that [laughter] we're going to save I'll go Sam money I'll build the wall go ahead [laughter]\nWell I have those are just my thoughts I think you just practicing for president somebody in the California and money has got him thinking that you've got to a chat sometime in the future and you've got to get his campaign chops and uh\nBut you know here's here's here's the thing what they're trying to do is they're trying to compare him to Lincoln and I'll tell you why Lincoln was a congressman just for one single term\nAnd then he ran for Senate and he lost any loss in Eighteen fifty eight but he did such a good job running for Senate that he became the Republican nominee next year and now the Democrats are saying hey ... or ... he's a congressman and now he's running for Senate and yeah he's going to lose but just like Abraham Lincoln there's one difference\nAbraham Lincoln was monumental lead brilliant\nAnd uh somebody of of deep deep integrity or ... or Rourke\nCome on appreciate your call Mike in Cleveland you're on the ... that show\nLike a federal thing I mean they don't rock is much more attractive I mean you know\nMore attractive than Ted Cruz are you crazy\nCruise comes off like a big rock minister and I was tired of all that stuff that's quite I think they all kind of a better chance than you think a lot of people are like\nOkay I I Can't imagine why people would would\nLie in Texas to I Am in any event to say that that they're not going to be voting for better or when they are secretly look the point about this is I I Know Ted Cruz takes a lot of gas because of his appearance\nBut he's somebody who's worked extraordinarily hard for his state and after losing the presidential contest with President Trump he um he's come back and he has been a constructive player in the Senate and you can talk to even people use to make fun of Ted Cruz most hated man in the Senate\nHe's actually somebody who's won all kinds of respect from all of his fellow Republicans and many of his Senate Democratic colleagues and uh I\nHonestly it will be very good to celebrate a victory with Ted Cruz on election night he deserves that we'll be right back on

Texas James you're on the Michael ...\nMichael I'm voting for Ted Cruz but my liberal\nHe had just turned Nineteen a few days earlier and it was a big deal although not as big of a deal as you might think 'cause if you think of hockey now and do you think of what a big deal must have been\n... it wasn't because hockey back then I'll get to that in the middle wasn't what it is now not even close\nBut um then I and I'm pretty sure neither the other local TV stations thought it was important enough to be there I think I was the only one of the three stations to be there for that night I Know there were no more than two I Know at least one skipped and I don't remember which one it was but anyway\nUh of course a lemieux did the kind of thing that you would expect somebody from another planet to do he scored a goal above twenty seconds into his career on his first shift\nThe first time he touched the puck\nHe scored a goal which he stole by the way stole the puck from a hall of fame defense man named ray Bork\nAnd then turned them in ... sin inside out and went in on the go to enter through a dig at 'em and stuff the puck in for a goal on his first shift first shot first any jungle there aren't many gods you live up to the hype that are guys like lemieux get\nOr he surpassed it I'm a ... by ridiculous margin and I remember that night well and I remember that I had a plan to um predict I was planning to predict that night\nThat lemieux would not only become a star with the pain was that he would become the owner of the team\nOr but I forgot I was going to make that production I forgot\nAnyway maybe it'll like sports or maybe like sports you know like hockey if you lived around here for any amount of time and even if you weren't born yet or on this date in Nineteen eighty four you were affected by what Mario Mario Lemieux did a after getting that first goal\nA and I don't mean just you know five minutes after I mean for the next whatever was Eighteen years back then there was one decent ice rink within ten miles of downtown Pittsburgh I Lived in the south hills my son was playing at the time\nAnd uh the mountain Lebanon wrinkles just a few minutes away but the next closest rank that was worth going to was in beaver county really a ... and so they just weren't any rinks around um\nAnd hockey was a sport that was loved by the kids who played it in their parents\nBut the pain was weren't putting more than ten thousand people in the arena for games at that time I remember all amused first game they had a huge crowd first home game second night you could have you could you could carry on a conversation with a a fan from one side of the read it to the other and I actually remember\nA fan this 'cause this is the way thing was fans were back then there were about eight thousand people directly to was deadly in their ... noise and I remember a guy on out ... second night okay\nSecond game of his career first game in Pittsburgh he was you know it was about Fifteen minutes into the game made me and I heard a guy all out come on lemieux dog\nThere there would have been some talk that he didn't act actually kill themselves on every shift a as a young player in the in the course of the negative fans here picked up on that right away they were looking for the first time he wasn't going a hundred miles an hour and anyway some dialed that out so uh but what happened the penguins were putting anybody in the arena\nA limb you didn't just change hockey though that's why it doesn't matter whether you like sports or like hockey he changed the culture in West Virginia and in West Virginia in western Pennsylvania uh kids started playing hockey\nThey started playing hockey nobody did that before um my kids practices were four thirty in the morning because there was no other rink\nAnd now there were three sheets device within that rank than I used to go to which was the only rank high school hockey's become big though do you go to any I uh ice hockey rink on the weekend now is packed\nWith people and then of course in The Cosby did it all over again when the maybe the interest of the way and a little bit Sidney Crosby is done the same thing all um you did\nA games have been sold out of the arena for several years obviously they're playing in a new arena lemieux who by the way is the best player I ever saw in any team sport ever best player I've ever seen in any team sport ever they're not just in Pittsburgh anywhere\nUm and he's the best player ever to put on a Pittsburgh uniform in any sport ever that is what Mary ... who is in a one year ago not one year ago thirty four years ago tonight he scored ...\nFirst of all and then of course he saved hockey again by buying the team and we know that they want a couple of cups before he bought the team and they want a couple three more since he bought it so uh and and it just changed\nMy life in western Pennsylvania for millions of people not just the people who watch games on TV\nUh and there were huge ratings for those best in the country but the the kids who play it the guys who are still in their ... their in their fifties now or late forties and they're playing in some a league a beer league maybe tonight somewhere and they only started playing hockey because of ...\nAnd it it all began with his first goal exactly thirty four years ago tonight okay well\nAnyway I don't want other stuff uh Kanye West I made a big impression when he showed up at the White House or the other day and not favorable to everybody here's what's now become a famous clip
