factor in what's in your mind these concerns the fact that you're concerned about where the market may go or when it collapses or how that affects your retirement\nHow are you digesting that information with the second quarter GDP report that our economy grew at four point over four percent\nAnd how do you a look at good low unemployment numbers and say look I see some good economic fundamentals but this just can't last forever how do you factor that in and make solid investment decisions well how you do is what we've been talking about all the while long you need to be in the market\nBut you also need the income portion that you need for retirement money you're going to count on to pay to provide the paycheck you need to have more certainty about ballot\nExactly and J I Know you well enough to know that you're not using scare tactics here and that's it went on about being pessimistic and doom and gloom its realism folks you know there's always the chance at the market is going to get more volatile and that will negatively affect your financial plans\nSo now's the time to have your current plan evaluate and see if your assets are position to help you avoid

have the freedom that you want and retirement the things that we talked about in our last segment about spending time with your family about buying things for your grandkids about staying independent I'll find out if you're on the right track\nGive us a call here at the center of the group eight hundred three to one Seventy nine sixty three get your very own personalized on track retirement review the number is eight hundred three to one Seventy nine sixty three\nYou know this whole shows have been talking about certain day and\nThat you use is quote a lot but Ben Franklin said it how the only two things that are truly certain in life or death and taxes and that's why it's important that we talk a little bit here about limiting taxes exposure I Want to die before the taxes are due can I Do that I don't know if you map that out you can figure that out and that's the ah yeah see\nI mean there are certain days okay so I just want the one before the other yeah\nSo let's just talk about an example strategy about what we do here at synergy group to help people uh with this tax issue and a lot of times it's proper tax planning and I was just sitting down for a couple recently and we were putting an income plan together that was focused on avoiding having them have withdraw that blood bump them up\nInto a higher tax bracket and folks you really need to understand these new Trump tax brackets here because there's a lot more wiggle room and things to consider there but if you want to be a little more strategic with your withdraws and a lot of times you need to sit down with a retirement expert and you may consider taking withdraws from a mix of taxable\nTax deferred and possibly if you put the planning and placed tax free account\nAnd being able to manage your income and there's a couple of steps to do that first of all you need to say All right what do we estimate are taxable gross income to be and then you've got to look at your standard deduction itemize all that stuff and figure out what your taxable income would be before you take any money from your accounts\nAnd then it's like a target say look while I Want to stay in the twelve percent tax bracket what to do that somebody falling Mary jointly right now it's about Seventy seven thousand or just above that that you can still generate an income to be able to do it so if you were\nExpected taxable gross income is twenty five thousand\nAnd this day and a twelve percent bracket is goes up to Seventy seven thousand then we that's our room to be able to withdraw from taxable accounts any money we would want over and above that should come from raw fire a or tax free type of accounts and then we can start to organize your income plan\nNot just by the right mix of protected investments in stocks and bonds but also in a tax efficient strategy and most of you were saying what the heck did you just say\nWhat we said is it there is a strategy to building an income plan that will also give you the potential to reduce your taxes at the same time\nWith expert or we talk to people once a year income is known as the growth position\nAnd again if money is in mutual funds manage money currently taxable pieces and then again you're doing nothing to mitigate or control your taxes\nBut there is the ability and we use the product which we call it protected gross product that gives you the opportunity to make twelve fourteen Eighteen percent of the market and if the market goes on and that protects the first Fifteen Percent of a job\nBut because as a variable annuity him that's not a dirty word it's a word that we use about two or three products\nBut there will be two or three that were comfortable with\nBut this product says let us managing money for five years but it's a good chunk of the liquid piece the mutual fund to manage money a cop with another piece over here this protected growth bees and will to further taxes on that until you need the money again part of a tax deferred strategy that you were just talking about\nA ... a lot of times people will come in and they don't ever spend the money the money goes out to the kids in the form of beneficiaries talk about a couple attack strategies that might be beneficial to getting money from this generation and to the next\nRight I mean somebody it whether it's your family that gets the tax advantage of that tax advantage passes to the next generation a there is some insurance planning that can be done there and many of our listeners would come in and they don't need life insurance they don't necessarily want life insurance and life insurance probably isn't a good deal for that\nBut it's a great deal for their families and the fact that that really is the only asked that class right now that truly is tax free or no federal income tax no state income tax no local income tax\nNo inheritance tax uh and if it's structured properly even if it's needed if you need to use a trust the hold it I Would avoid a state tax on an island ... one of the first clients that ever trusted\nYou to do their financial planning you put together a very significant life insurance program at their conversation with him to do exactly that take a significant portion of the transferring wealth of the kids without a nickel taxes being paid\nRight and then and those types of examples are over there and again the family didn't need life insurance but where that comes into play ah it's not a gimmick it's not as bad as what life insurance is designed to do its leverage money\nIf you don't need your are indeed distributions above the government's going to make you take them out also come in and talk to Terry coming to talk of Jay Sarah myself about how you could officially take those dollars\nGive tax free money your kids or maybe give us a significant tax benefit and ah the portion over to the charity of your choices well we'll take the IRS out of the picture but boy we can do some powerful planning if you give us the chance\nOf folks who are running out of time for this episode of lasagna retirement or that we're going to get hired at work during the heavy lifting for next year if you didn't get to

we can move on from there but\nWhat happened was she got to the top and she wasn't anxious at all the while I was about four feet high it was kind of a big plant or four feet deep and she never felt like she was going to fall off so that was kind of way but when we were going down we took the step down and it was a metal staircase you see through the flat and that's where she became really anxious\nEven though this last only about maybe five inches there was a feeling she could fall through and she could see down and so we worked on walking up and down the stairs\nFirst holding on to the handles and maybe just one and then just standing there on one step without holding on any and she just learned that she could tolerate that discovered so step by step one by one you're increasing

date with with a few short I think it's the most important thing that you can do to prevent um for the first line of defense\nAnd so we would encourage anyone to to get a vaccination\nOkay Gary either question I picked up a friend from Newark airport in New Jersey just a few days ago was this week and while I was waiting for her I saw several travelers coming off a slight\nWith those papers face masks and I'm curious I Know there was a potential measles warning issued actually at Newark a few weeks ago I Travers are concerned about avoiding airborne germs do those paper face masks actually health and well\nIt's actually the ... with us today effective or not I think some people just feel more reassured using them right um although people are concerned about getting illnesses are catching a bygone it on an airplane it's a relatively\nHarmless environment although it is possible ... what we tell people is if they are ill they shouldn't be traveling we we advise people not any for their own sake but for fellow travelers\nTo avoid travel if they are\nAnd if they are ill and they have to travel maybe they should be wearing\nFace masks please please I'm All right so yeah so I think a lot of confusion about ... it's almost like sometimes when it's really and the media that everyone thinks it's all over the place and now it's really not in the media but you know it's still around right so can you give us the latest update on the ... is it active anywhere\nElse so early on in the last year we had a lot of reports in the media about the cause is the what if it was introduced to the with it\nBut we haven't been hearing as much about it recently but you make an important point because he is still very much present it is present in a lot of the destinations that people traveled to for the holidays\nAnd people need to be aware of the associated with a simple\nThe average person it's not really a concern but as we know there are complications and and help through associated with pregnant women getting this disease right or\nGood information or certainly and so I'm going to ask you this five months ago our oldest son traveled the gun or with a college friend and we knew certain vaccines would be required but we didn't know what was the timeframe for getting them and there was one in particular have and I can think of for yellow fever than he had to get before he could actually get a visa\nThink well it was nice to meet you got [noise] thank you for the Grand Canyon and good luck [noise]\n\nGonna miss is the third hour on a Tuesday\nOr go [noise]\nWhich is a fancy way of saying that\nTherefore [noise] or if you will\nI Love the word ... but it's not you\nKnow why do I like kids do you like ... you know go to school with a guy named Jack hence\nThe ultimate issues hours devoted to the belief that having a map is useless unless you know where you're going\nYou know exactly where you are but if you don't know where you're going it's useless so why does it all about what are the big issues that's why it's the ultimate issues that after all so sometimes something in the news provokes a subject\nOf the male female our or for that matter the happiness or for that matter the ultimate issues that are not as the case\nToday so\nI guess it's ... it's a multi faceted question but it revolves around one issue and that is\nIf you are middle aged adults\nIs it important in assessing you how you active in high school it's obviously based on the Brett Kavanaugh nomination and that's the question you're how old is she exactly fifty four fifty three fifty four or whatever you're so you're in you're almost mid fifties\nIf you let let me put it to you this way if you\nHad an important position in Europe business where your school\nAnd you had to be unanimous\nAgreement that a man had led a remarkably good life as an adult lower words from the age of Twenty one so for thirty five thirty four years whatever has been a remarkable human being contributed to his community a family man\nAs a churchgoer which to me means something to many doesn't where do you then what do you pursue allegations of misconduct in high school\nThat's the question I wouldn't if I were hiring for ... for you and I\nI'm not talking about hiring a twenty two year old the where the proximity to high school is a few years I'm Talking about remember I'm Talking about the age of Brett Kavanaugh somebody applies for a job at ... university it is you ... what a find human being\nFamily man community man this person has been and then\nUh some charges are brought up about what he did in high school or even the exact same chart\nOkay I Would ignore them\nAnd it's clear what type of adult you would have been I Am I'm not going to look at what you were are alleged to do in high school\nSo that's the question that's the it's in how important in assessing a human being is their conduct in high school and high school alone\nNot not not a thirty about twenty five but in high school\nOne aide Prager seven seven six eight seven seven to for three triple seven six\nNow I don't have I don't have a vested interest in this argument okay I I actually was a good guy in high school and I let an anti cheating on tests campaign that was elected the graduating class president\nI I was a bird was a good guy basically\nBut I'm I'm sure that you know things could be brought up I mean that I don't even know about\nOr that didn't happen which is I think it's a possibility or in the case of birth capital but happen or not happen if they ... they were kids in\nThe school who were a day or two wells and who ended up fantastic adults\nSo ...\nWho cares who cares and in effect now I care about how my kids act and high school I acted in high school of course you care about how your kid acts at the age of five\nThat's a separate issue you because you you want to form a good person as early as possible I I agree with that but in ... in in the perspective of a life and in retrospect\nWhat how you acted in high school should have no bearing in undermining once assessment of this person in middle age that's my position do you think do you think it\nMatters that's the question what eight Prager seven seven six\nEight seven seven to for three triple seven six\n\nBig stuff big stuff that people left to answer it's hard for me to believe that anybody listening even Democrats\nHiring a person for a an important position in their business who knew what a terrific person this is and then charges arose from high school within say no I'm Sorry\nIt's clear what type of adult you've been put in high school are you uh you you robbed a a candy store right that's pretty serious not not not simply\nNot simply shop lifted some candy bars but you threaten the owner and and you robbed\nBut it is obvious you turn July for rent or otherwise what is what one is saying is people cannot turn their lives around we won't let no point to acknowledge\nThat your turn your life around that is why religious Jews and Christians find this notion particularly offensive because they're both Judaism and Christianity so rooted in the importance\nOf penance of forgiveness\nOf tissue vi and in the Hebrew of of return or that's repentance\nThere's this famous Hebrew statement that I'm ... and I am\nLiterally translating from the Hebrew where a penitentiary stands the most righteous\nPerson cannot stand\nYour a higher level if you turn your life around the person who never turn their life around and it's been good the whole time\n\nThat's how that's how I Am and of course obviously in both religions forgive right forgive us as we forgive those who trespass against us the whole the whole notion of Christ dying for people's sins and forgiveness\nAnd the uh Judaism holiest days the day of of a pen a tense day of atonement Yom ... so religious Jews and Christians understand of course people can turn their lives around\n\nSo uh I emphatically endorsed the notion that when you are already in middle age and the lead a good life that's all that matters I have no interest in what you were like in high school\n\nAnd bribery where where's your cutting cutting off line is el is elementary school right well you know elementary school well yeah that's what people said until recently about high school\nI Won a Prager seven seven six\n\nAnd let's go to will in San Antonio hello will Dennis Prager\nI gotta I [noise] [noise] well I guess\nI could just tell you a little story um I was a high school or college or did you live in California the whole the whole party scene you know pot and coke every day and a half later arrested for a ...\nAnd went to jail and uh it was kinda funny 'cause when I before I got you know for you gotta that's at our website to get away with that and it was easy and uh when I pulled away pulled out I kind of caught at the last second you know and a ...\nThat you know about five six years and I like that for that word just impossible and very difficult\nBut you know worked hard and you know turned my life around and I've been married for twenty five years I've raised three great kids uh one's graduated from college works for major tech company was is a part of your life or the other one is just a sophomore in college\nYeah so the Iraq you're perfect living example of what I'm Talking\nAbout the dentist Springer show much from the relief factor pain free to the\nOkay\nSharon in Dallas either Sharon\nHi how are you real well thank you\nGood okay well I just said hey I never stopped creating and um I have five away some of them were really good in life go some of them I prayed maybe close to God\nAll of them\nWould be great catch it\nSo you know I I think you know they live in the media\nIt's a shattering thing isn't it if it doesn't matter how you've led a full adult life that's what's being that in the United states of America\nThen I worked at a school and I was so sad when people see I just I I was like you've got to be good you know what I think I'm just be a good parent and do the best they can and you know put God in there and you got it\nRight I think it usually does thank you I contended for many years that my mother\nCouldn't believe I didn't end up in prison [noise]\n\nYou you have no idea how often when I was in elementary school she ... she she thought I was going to end up in jail the that was the term in those days as Sean you ever hear the term JV\nNo right if they if they die it's a very interesting juvenile delinquent\nNot a doctor or a jurisprudence\nJ. B. that's what she thought I ended up at J. D. why don't you think I'd end up at jail because they didn't do any homework\nAnd it didn't work in high school either too busy or learning about life including teaching myself how to conduct which turned out well\nBut you don't you don't know you just gotta you gotta you gotta drive you got to work on your kids and then you don't know what's gonna happen\nBut in retrospect you've literally a magnificent life\nYour your high school days are not relevant to they're just not relevant why why why is that an issue ...\nRead my column this week you'll always an issue\nOr right\n\n[noise]
