she is a well known that too many of course is the singer and songwriter\nFact she was at my talk at valley best shallow\nShe's a she's a black woman she's beautiful she's talented she's alive she's great she's bright she's everything\nAnd I didn't even know if she's Republican or not a Republican here she is the less the left is out of control I'm a public figure a new Republican I'm going to

of Native American blood debate\nOf this entire thing is incredible and Elizabeth Warren is trying to collect at least some of the people operating her name want her to collect the million dollars President Trump has promised if she can prove she's an Indian and how does she proves she's an Indian\nOr we will get to that it's deeply embarrassing and it really does show that there are some not many but some points of commonality between contemporary liberals and Nazis\nReally yes really will get to that on the Michael ... show will also get to the a great debate about the civil war at any can\nA President Trump ... did not show in ... when he was talking about general grant and generally to be a particularly sophisticated historian he wasn't hired for that but\nHe absolutely did not inappropriately praise a Confederate general and they shouldn't be condemned for it and the press has helped him they've shown and in fact they were forced to retreat\nExactly why it is so many Americans and it's left right and center distrust mainstream media\nAnd rightly just trust mainstream media and most of all President Trump has been blessed this week at the beginning of the week\nWith the\nElderly inexplicable desire of Hillary Clinton to inject herself into this democratic campaign\nWhy does this is a mystery is she some kind of secret agent for the Republican Party is that possible\nI mean she blew the campaign kind of everybody knows that she blew the campaign against Donald Trump President Trump knowledge isn't and and now she is doing her very level best to uh to to basically\nUm help President Trump and help Republicans and the forthcoming campaign this November OK Hillary Clinton was on CBS on Sunday Morning\nAnd it it's one of those things will posted up at our website at Michael midday dot com\nYou really have to see it to get a a full force of how uncomfortable she looks why submit yourself to this I I don't understand I don't understand what is possibly to be gained here except to strengthen Republicans\nAnd why is that she's not a political newcomer she's been around the block a thousand times she was a problem for the first campaign that Bill Clinton lost and and people forget this this is part of ancient history but Hillary and bill got married bill got elected\nTo be the governor of Arkansas very young man and then when he ran\nFor reelection the first time he lost and he lost because Hillary was the issue because she hadn't changed her name yet she was still Hillary\nRodham she's still have those coke bottled glasses that I remember her wearing from law school and ah\nShe she was a much more of an quote outspoken feminist well then she change and\nShe campaigned alongside bill but given the fact that she has this long long experience in the political world\nHow could you be so utterly unprepared for questions that are very obvious and this this comes especially after we spoke to Ken Starr\nWho's an outstanding American and has just written a terrific book and again I recommend the book hardly to everybody\nThe um the book by Ken Starr which is posted up at our website at Michael Mina dot com tells the story of the impeachment of Bill Clinton and it tells much more tells the whole story of Ken stars life\nBut it does not portray Hillary in a very positive way and when you read that book you can understand why she would be so utterly unprepared for questions like those she received on CBS listen\nWhat role if any did you play in criticizing the character of the women who have accused bill sexual misconduct\nNone no no no real I take responsibility for my life and my actions\nShe also stood by your side as he was impeached after lying about his affair with a White House intern from today have said you should have stepped down\nIn retrospect do you think [noise]\nBill should've resigned in the wake of the Monica Lewinsky absolutely not it wasn't an abuse of power now now there are people who look at\nThe incidents of the nineties and they say a president of the United states cannot have a consensual relationship with an inch or the power imbalance as to why an adult\nBut let me ask you this where the investigation of the current incumbent\nAgainst him numerous allegations had been made and which have dismisses denies and ridicules so there was an investigation and as I Believe came out in the right place [noise]\nOkay I it came out in the right place for Monica did it uh it came out in the right place for those people by the way including very much Lindsey Graham\nWho was one of the leading Republicans in the house of representatives at that time are working on impeachment\nVicious so astonishing dishes eight eight utterly shameful display of what about ism\nLet let me play it for you again because you'll notice immediately that rather than talking about what was obviously an abusive power involving a president of the United states and an intern an intern in his office\nAnd she uh doesn't confirm that and she says oh well but what about Trump but you know what here's the key point and and listen to how how ... Hillary Clinton just you lied said she just moved away from it and doesn't even touch it\nPresident Clinton was accused\nOf miss behavior the kind of behavior that would have gotten any CEO fired and so quickly so quickly you can't work for any corporation I mean anywhere today you can't even work in Hollywood and be involved and doing stuff like this and and come out the other side\nThe accusations about Trump\nHas to do a with a period in his life long before he was directly involved in politics and certainly before he was in the White House by the way I just listened one more time and I want to come back to this because it's very very important\nAnd it's it's so crucial to make distinctions okay here's Hillary Clinton again being questioned about her record defending bill\nWhat role if any did you play in criticizing the character of the women who have accused bill of sexual misconduct\nNone no no no no I take responsibility right where my writing and my actions\nShe also stood by his side as he was impeached after lying about his affair with a White House intern some today has said you should have stepped down\nIn retrospect do you think\nBill should've resigned in the wake of Monica Lewinsky scandal absolutely not it wasn't an abuse of power now now there are people who look at the incidents of the nineties and they say a president of United States cannot have a consensual relationship with an internal power imbalance as to why an adult\nBut let me ask you that she wasn't aware of the nation if the current incumbent against him numerous allegations have been made\nOkay stumped shops up right there I think anyone including the most devoted supporters of President Trump or would acknowledge\nThat if it came out that he was having an affair with a White House intern if you were doing the things that Bill Clinton we now know did\nThat yes President Trump should step down a bit of there's no evidence of that and I am virtually certain that especially given the amount of media scrutiny of President Trump\nAnd Secret Service scrutiny and and FBI school and everything else there's nothing irregular about his sexual behavior since he has been president\nAnd see the point over here is the failure to make distinctions in other words Hillary Clinton and liberals want us to believe that what Brett Kavanaugh did as a Seventeen year old allegedly at a party\nA is a is incredibly serious in ruins him forever\nAnd what Bill did as president of the United states and when you talk about abuse of power there's also such a thing about abuse of power involving the Congress and the government and federal investigators or we will get to that and much more coming up on the ...\nBob Michel ... vigil last summer\nIt's been at the fans

American and I'm One percent\nAre from from uh Australia aboriginal I I don't think that turns up very often\nBut the the entire thing is not\nThe only Democrats do this\nIt's completely ridiculous why are we so obsessed with DNA there's the question here would be was was there any sense in which you grew up with a meaningful identity as an Indian and she didn't\nSo she was a fraud about it you know apologize and just move on I I Do find it embarrassing when the president used the term Pocahontas cause Pocahontas by the way was somebody of real Native American heritage who became a Christian she changed her name to Rebecca and she converted Christianity\nUm look a President Trump was asked about these latest revelations about a\nSenator Elizabeth Warren who is getting ready to run for president that's why she released this video the timing is horrible for her because it will only heard Democrats and the forthcoming elections here's what President Trump had to say\n[noise] why\n\n\nHer read it again I also\nVery easy I also have brought\nA lot of\nGoes well\nI also feel that\nIt is going to be a long process for the Democrats um are there are people who are saying uh well President Trump said he would pay a million dollars\nIf a she could prove that she was an Indian now and there are people saying well he has to pay or a million dollars now because she proved a that she may have had and\nOne Indian ancestor six to ten generations ago sorry here's exactly what President Trump said he said at a rally\nIf I'm debating Warren I'd make or take a DNA test and pay or a million dollars if she can prove she's an Indian\nNo she can't prove that but I'll tell you one thing you can prove is Elizabeth Warren is one of those Democrats who is threatening to bankrupt and destroy or Medicare system how we'll get to that I'm going to write up on them at that show\nBob Michel ... vigil last summer again this is Michael ...\n[noise]\nWhat else are new volleyball I

of the house of representatives the Senate should be fine that that also could be close but it should be fine and things for the house side are turning around\nAnd one of the reasons is stupid mistakes by people like Senator Elizabeth Warren and a former presidential candidate Hillary Clinton and then mainstream media in general\nBut one of the other reasons has to do with the fact that a little bit more and is one of those people out there beating the drums for Medicare for all\nSo for those of us who actually support Medicare and I do I I Know how important it is too many many many Americans are who happened to be over the age of sixty five\nAh why is it that the Democrats have always claimed credit for Medicare or now posing such a grave threat to it and nobody better to talk

appealing slogan a Medicare for all really means Medicare for nobody\nWell exactly and it really is expanding a from Medicare which is a kind of an insurance plan that gun to converted to a socialism plan and here's what I'm Talking about is twenty two million Americans have Medicare Advantage plans\nThose plans this year actually having a decrease in premium because they're operated through independent insurance companies having a decrease in premium\nHowever the Bernie Sanders Medicare for all what lemonade Medicare Advantage plans and replace it with a socialism plan which is similar to what happened in Canada\nAnd the problem with that is they have rationing for example it takes twenty two week schedule a surgery and I don't think most Americans like to have that kind of medical treatment\nOn the ministry of president Barack Obama and I was there for just under a year when I was recruited back to the city of Atlanta about the honorable America St Marie and two thousand and ten and I served him faithfully for five years until I was terminated in January of two thousand and fifty\nOkay this whole story your whole story is a great American story and it's a great story of public service and success\nHow how is it you ended up whether you are say or terminate you were fired was it wasn't because of something that happened in the line of duty wasn't that led to your firing\nWell a a year prior to my termination I had published a book that I had written on my own time and stuff published for Chris Jimmy and the book is called who told you that you were neck it if the question that got ask Adam\nIn the garden that eating ... and I say that because a lot of people don't connect that question with genesis chapter three birth eleven so\nAh so the book is titled who tells you that your neck it overcome the stronghold of condemnation and uh so that happened a year before I was suspended ah but the reason why I was terminated as as a cause I spent a few paragraphs explaining God's purpose for sex\nAnd marriage and that God created a sex for procreation and and and for the pleasure between a husband and I and how they match 'em on it and that any sex outside of that a is a thin and ultimately that's what cost me my childhood dream come true fairy tale career\nOkay now let's get this straight you have these opinions which your opinions that literally hundreds of millions of Americans share and you weren't trying to impose these opinions on some of your men and the fire department where you\nKnow are not at all\nSo it it was the fact is you self published the book he hadn't use public funds\nWhat business is it of the city of Atlanta\nOr the mayor of the city council or anybody or what the fire chief does on his personal time as long as it's not disgraceful what was the argument we're using a passage in your book to ruin your career\nWhere their position was that those positions those views conflict it with the city views are and that I can have those used as much as I Want but when I was an employee of the city\nOr I had an obligation to check those belief that the door is what one council members get and the mayor clearly supported that position\nOkay at this point or this I think most people are listening to us or slapping therefore hands I think this is just clearly unjust and when people suffering injustice or discrimination\nOr a really an assault against their religious liberties and freedom of conscience who you're going to call not Ghostbusters you'd call the alliance defending freedom a David Portman

on behalf of the cheap\nSo the the city argued they were trying to be inclusive believe it or not by firing the chief because they didn't agree with his youth I didn't I didn't quite understand that but we filed a lawsuit on behalf of the chief the good news is\nIs that we argue that the policies they actually required prior permission so they told the chief afterward that oh no you can't write a book on your own time for a Bible study unless you get prior permission from the ... in the city allows you to do so\nWe challenge that as being unconstitutional is only five permission needed is the first amendment and the judge ruled with us\nI'm so that the judge ruled in favor of the cheap and now we're going to trial to figure out where the case goes for there and and how much damage as for the chief\nFor Republicans to keep control of the house of representatives of the Senate or the United states we should be able to\nThat and uh of the White House in the hands of conservative leadership one eight hundred nine five five Seventeen Seventy six what's amazing about this\nIs ask people to uh to determine\nDo you have a great deal of trust in politicians trust and confidence politicians do have a fair amount of trust and confidence in men and women in political lights life\nOr or do you have a low amount of trust in politicians trust has been soaring here's the amazing part\nThe increase it's not only a ten year high it's seven\nThat has wide ranging global interests and we certainly have played a role in toppling of some very evil foreign governments including a foreign government uh in in Chile or under a Salvador Allende\nWhich actually I think we were justified in and taking some role on I Know that very controversial\nBut what does that have to do this in other words if the United states\nIs looking after our own interests uh we we oppose Russia's meddling in our election not because it is profoundly wrong in some kind of cosmic sense but because it hurts the United states it's a hostile act and we want to stop it [noise] so what's what's wrong with that\nI don't think there's I don't think there's anything really entirely wrong with us trying to question our own morality in uh in our current role in the world today but just to think that there are not governments that are trying to influence our our because we are one of the most powerful countries and\nThen of course there are governments that are trying to do it but uh and we are we are right to call them out on it and to try to oppose it and then again I think people are right when when a country acts abroad as apparently Saudi Arabia did\nWhich is why do think that what people are talking about about this being some kind of rogue operation that went wrong that they were actually they're not to kill his show gay and chop them up into little pieces in Istanbul which they did a but to actually just apprehend them and take him back to Saudi\nAnd I think that is relevant as well and yes there's a difference appreciate your call\nI'm President Trump inevitably was asked about the border by Leslie stall there was this interchange\nWhat about the for separation of children from their migrant children from the same as the Obama law you know about him I had the same thing it was on the books but he didn't have ... percent for launch that caused the zero tolerance policy\nTo deter families with children and then everybody decided and courts don't want to separation and frankly when you don't do separate when you\nAllow the parents to stay together\nOkay when you allow that then what happens is people are going to pour into our country will you gonna go back to\nThat well we're looking at a lot of things really what we want to do is changing immigration law because they were there were a laughing stock all over the world are you willing though I think you're saying you're it's under consideration all I Want all the laws change like watches Lesley

making the point that President Trump did so a mock Christine Blasey Ford\nI don't think he mocked her but I Know he didn't mimic her and that was the word that Lesley Stahl use you mimic Christine Blasey Ford here's what President Trump actually sounded like a this is before the final vote obviously on judge Kavanaugh and it was a a a comment that he made during a rally in Mississippi

know [noise]\nWhat\nWas it and I don't know [noise] I don't know [noise]\nAnd I'm at a map\nOkay ... that's true by the way and this is the one thing I I actually agree with Trump in this it is right to challenge\nThe narrative about what a hero in how selfless in house and noble Christine Blasey Ford\nIs I'll tell you when it's appropriate to challenge it\nCan somebody tell me what good it did for the country with Anita Hill on Clarence Thomas even though I don't believe she was telling the truth I don't\nAt least you could say she raised awareness of problems of workplace harassment\nBut really what are you trying to accomplish but says here let me read you one of the descriptions\nI'm\nIn Portland which is long seeing clashes between the far left in the far right\nFor two weeks they've been consumed with Brett black lives matter protests over a fatal police shooting in September those protests in turn provoked right wing groups when video emerged last weekend of demonstrators blocking traffic and beating on a passing drivers car and those videos were horrible\nAnd it it's completely what was so amazing as a police didn't break it up these people were attacking motorists and ... and by the way most of the\nMore we're white most of the demonstrators are white and they were as a tank and motorists were being white people\nHate crime okay uh\nPortland police apparently had been expecting trouble and managed to prevent it for half an hour or so by lining up and tactical gear along the street I'm sure they love this but after sundown things kicked off the anti fascist may provoke violence\nAccording to a freelance reporter were documented the ensuing Malay on Twitter one of them burned an American flag as a Proud Boys and company we're leaving causing the Proud Boys to return another quote anti fascist in Dallas the entire group with pepper spray\nOkay and then it went down from there\nI might might question to folks is what you accomplished with us on either side\nAnd do you really want to make the American people hate you is there somebody out\nThere who sees the Proud Boys broiling with the ... people you think wow those ... people are really brave or go let's hear it for the Proud Boys they've done such a great job\nI honestly this this is this is the\nWorst of what's going on in America right now is this idea that somehow you express your political point of view or you advance your political point of view by beating on other people really\n\nLet's go to a your calls to Christie in Plymouth, Minnesota Christie you're on the Michael ...\nUm high I was I guess I missed what I'd have to say I was I've been listening to your show and my hackles went up a little bit when you when you said that\nIt was just an attempt to kill to block him that's all it was by her her going up there and saying what she said because\nThen the timing the timing why why do you think given the fact\nGiven the fact that this happens thirty six years ago and that Bradley ... has been a very public person for at least Twenty years why now\nAnd that's and that is exactly what I was going to what I was going to say because\nI don't want this man on the Supreme Court deciding things that have to do what what rape cases per se and and ... that that will that will very possibly look at ... ... you know the way that that in law is a is a I\nI was a way ... you know I don't hold on I don't hold on just helped me logically want something that he allegedly did when he was Seventeen but he denies and nobody else\nSays he did it it's just her what does her charge against him when he was Seventeen have to do with roe v Wade\nNo it doesn't have anything to do it throw me wait what I'm saying is he he's going to be on the Supreme Court which could decide laws like we're all the way that would be influential and two women that's what I was getting at but\nWhen you say to when I don't want to move on I don't I don't hold on roe v Wade is first of all it's not a law roe v Wade is a court case and say understanding family he has repeatedly answered questions about roe v Wade and he said he considers to be settled law\nAnd I I don't I don't understand in other words do you think that the fact\nThat if it was somebody else's name wasn't capital somebody else who is accused of misbehavior when he's Seventeen years old that should disqualify him from ever serving on the Supreme Court\nAt absolute it's something that if it's something that like for example she he talked about this in her therapy sessions seven years ago\nYeah but he usually does he do early years after it was it's it's still Thirty years after it happened and Kavanaugh was already famous seven years ago and talking about a year therapy Sessions is very different from writing letters to a congresswoman a Democrat\nTo try to stop the nomination which I think is very clearly what she was trying to do hey I appreciate your call

just a ploy to get you into their office so they can trade you up the coins that are heavily marked up it may seem like these other dealers are offering\nTo pay more but in reality they're

what about one twenty I think it was left in the game\nEverybody in the stadium including a lotta Steelers fans who were there had to know\nThat um it was [laughter] you know that there was a they were going to lose the game um that they had given the Steelers too much time and they were right a mangoes lost another one and they do is get them in Pittsburgh the next time\nIt'll be asked me by the way speaking of what happened yesterday the Steelers are now the favorites in the AFC North come a long way since a few weeks ago when everybody wanted to fire Mike Tomlin though I think they're the favorite to win the division now\nAnd if you ask me the Steelers don't\nNeed levy on bell they don't uh the movie likes to have but they don't need them James Connor was an NFL first team running back you should've seen enough of them by now to know that I Know he's playing against some teams that\nAre statistically among the worst defenses in the league but that's who's in the league and nobody in the league knows how to tackle any more so if you have a running back was decent um\nYou can do well with them and it's a lot easier to be a a good running back now because people forgot how to tackle I didn't see any plays yesterday this is what I watch for um purposely during the game\nBecause I spoke to them to have a good game I didn't see any place where I thought bell would have

tone she came out today with a DNA test\nThat ah she says proves that she's part Native American and the President Trump was ambushed by the media about it before he got on the only go up there today\n[laughter] you know I don't\n\nHer read it again [noise] already that\nThat [noise] I\n'cause I think she'd be very easy I also see is rather than I Do not do that\nHe'll destroy the country that is well I Would that being said I don't want to say bad things about\nI also wanted to\nLong process and who cares about this I mean I Know why she thinks that she had to share her thoughts that you had to care way back because this goes all the way back to the early nineties\nStudents were demonstrating about the lack of diversity and the faculty at Harvard and one professor there actually had resigned because he thought there was not enough diversity\nAnd that's twenty six years ago where they were still talking about about the weather was still there was a lot of pressure to hire women and minorities and the big prize of course would be a minority woman\n... so that my being one thousandth Cherokee going to her grandma Elizabeth Warren fit the bill bill\nUh and now it's obvious that she wants to run for president\nAnd this DNA test a who was supposed to be a preemption it might just turned out to be the opposite was going to be fun as a President Trump says when she has to defend yourself against other Democrats or during the primary it should be it should be fun to watch that but I Want to uh before we go to the break here\nOf the Boston Globe came out with this story it had to had to correct it twice about her DNA and how much of a Cherokee she could actually claimed to be a the Boston Globe originally claimed that the test revealed Warren was somewhat\nBetween one thirty second and won five hundred and twelve\n[noise] Native American so let me see so if she's one let's just give her four hundred and eighty seventh you know like put or three hundred and sixty second something in there a way to come on I mean well so what\nAre they the obsession with this is just nauseating so anyway that's what the Boston Globe came out with so then they issued a correction earlier today indicating\nThat if warns ancestor worth ten generations removed she would actually be one one thousand twenty four Native American not one five one thousand five hundred and twelve\nOr so um the outlet then issued a second\nCorrection on Monday and says ear clarifying that had gotten the entire range of ancestry raw [laughter]\nYou know when you're dealing with one five thousand won five hundred and twelve\nUm and there's a big difference I guess if it's half\nAnyway I'm doing math air a story about what was it with Warren misstated the ancestry percentage of potential six to temper generation relative this is from the Boston Globe of quote the generational range based on the ancestor that that report Dennis ... identified\nSuggestions between one sixty fourth and one one thousand and twenty fourth Native American I'm going with\nI'm going to go I'm gonna I'm gonna go for a hundred and Ninety second I'm just going to take a stab at it and that's what I'm going with she's won four hundred and the second uh Cherokee which makes ... a different person because if he was like one\nI don't know five hundred and thirty seven that would be different from being one four hundred and Ninety seconds so we'd have to ... you know that would have to be taken into consideration the Boston Globe issued a correction early Monday\nAre indicating that uh uh again that of wars ancestor were ten generations removed she would be one one thousand twenty fourth Native American not one thousand five hundred and two aren't you glad that cleared that up because to me there's a big difference between\nOne by one five hundred and twelve\nAnd here's another thing\nAll of this means of ... or whatever it is whatever she is whatever they've come to I I've lost track now what she actually is I guess she's one sixty fourth one thousand twenty four and according to this\n... a DNA expert who's going to argue with them you can argue willing to you know you know you're going to go you got to pay for another DNA test does anybody care enough anyway we'll just do the numbers of the globe finally came up with after two corrections\nAccording to this story this means warrant is somewhere between zero point zero nine and one point five percent Native American not between one point nine and three point one percent as originally claimed but here's the problem\nThe Boston Globe are also will tell you that\n... whatever she is right whatever they've come to right now it's it's this means that is ... she's the same I mean she got different from you everybody is as apparently the average here it is\nThe average European American has zero point one eight percent Native American DNA according to a comprehensive study by the genetic literacy project so she is\nAverage okay so in other words I've just wasted about five minutes of your time you're you're never going to get back worrying about whether\nThey're a little bit of war is won\nFive hundred and twelve or one one thousand and twenty fourth Cherokee now she's claiming Cherokee how do we know there's not some I don't know command she in their Apache a Navajo I I don't know that would that change should that changed my opinion over it anyway I still think he's an idiot\nDon't care if she's full blooded American indian ... she's an idiot and I hope she's never democratic nominee for president so you know what I mean I Do when we come back\nWe're going to hear from another a possible two thousand and twenty a presidential candidate maybe you've

she's got a shot at doing it again running for president again in twenty twenty it's beyond belief and at isn't going to be the last time you hear from her she'll do it again so uh you heard about the Donald Trump did a long interview with Leslie solves on sixty minutes last night\nI'm not going to bore you with the interview 'cause I don't think anything really new came out of body she tried to catch him on lots of different things in the mean wouldn't let her talk and it was just wasn't it wasn't very good television but you know it was the president and he was on CBS which is not where he is very often but the person who did the interview Leslie stall saw some differences\nMostly you've interviewed President Trump three times as candidates [noise]\nCase as president elect\nAnd now as president\nHas an office changed him anyway\nWell in terms of the three interviews he was completely different\nThan the one that really stood out was the one three days after he won the election\nSo uh where\nIt was my impression but he was in total shock\nRight now who is so much more confident\nWho are truly president and you felt that I felt it in this interview\nYep and boy you know home
