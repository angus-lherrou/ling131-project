to be going the ultimate issues hours about we're we're going\nOn about the map of where we are although but to wake us\nToday is going to be a little more political than most are not in the sense of direct politics but the subject has political direct political ramifications I have a have a sad realization that I'd like to share with you\n\nOr better maybe I shouldn't put it is sad realization I have a question to pose and by my earlier statement that said realization you have in my view of what I think the answer is but here's my question\nDo people prefer liberty or to be taken care of\n\nSo you would normally you know my answer even if you have never heard me before just by the fact that I said said realization you know what I Believe I've come to the conclusion that most people prefer to be taken care of and lose liberty\nThan have liberty\nAnd not be taken care of them have to take care of themselves now obviously up to the extreme that you you can find a doctor you can't find the hospital you can find a policeman obviously there's we're talking about within certain bounds\n\nBut that is how that is how people think I Want to be taken care of and if I lose liberty and the process that's OK America was founded\nOn the belief of liberty\nAnd I think most Americans assumes for well I don't know I take that back I think a lot of Americans assume that that was in a chord with the human universal human desire freedom\nBut it it it is it do you know the\nNew York times are you ready I'm telling you this is going to shock you shock you in terms of its stupidity as much as in terms of its politics the New York times had an op ed piece in the last few days I did not mention it\nBut I read it and\nI have to clean it up I mean there wasn't it wasn't that all profane but kids listen to this and I'm aware of that\nThat but also put it in a very general way and somewhat opaque adults will understand it was an article about women who have lived under communism\nAnd then lived under freedom so it's East German women\nAnd then the wall was torn down in the mail had freedom no longer living under communism the article was a serious article you must understand this is not a lampooned is not from the onion it was a serious article claiming\nThat women under communist Germany living in communist East Germany\nHad a more fulfilling sex life than women in the west Germany\n\nRead that correct now the argument was they were show taken care of that the absence of the freedom to even speak did not troubled them as much as they felt rewarded by all the benefits of a communist state\nAnd the New York times about how life in less free societies can be better\n\nSo then there was another article just the let's see what today Wall Street journal what's weeds give up for free\nMoney I moved to Sweden for love not money\nBut I was happy to learn that merely living in this social democracy also entitled me the paid parental leave benefits who couldn't object to free money handed out by the government to all Swedish parents then I became a father\n\nAnd he talks about the you know everything free health care subsidized housing paid leave out employment benefits job training pensions\nAnd you know he said this system of inter laced welfare programs is the government's attempt to realize the political and social ideal that has seemingly universal acceptance among Swedes\nIt as noticed they get the R y doubled G. H. E. T. right\nSo it's it's to feel so comfortable and secure everything is taken care of\nNow\nOne of the prices you pay is that you know pretty much have to think like everybody else you know think of the box\nAnd you just on life becomes this is me I'm not reading from the article life becomes I've often said about Western Europe life becomes really a debate about how many hours I couldn't get off how much vacation time I can have how much I can travel\nAnd it sounds awesome adjust I mean what could be better at work less I'm taking care of this is utopia\nLet me continue six months ago my two year old niece broke her leg the physician who treated the girl told my brother in law that his daughter would be given a full body\nSeat the scan to which you might say huh\nShe broke her leg and the doctor wants to give the the girl a full body seat the scan\nThe doctor insisted that the procedure was mandatory but not for any medical reason I Wonder if a single one of you listening knows the reason the doctor ordered a full body seat the scan of a two year old girl that's a lot of radiation by the way\nA\nTwo year old girl gets a full body scan for a broken leg\nEverybody I Know the reason you don't think there's anyone that I ... I couldn't guess I was thinking why she's getting a full body she peace can write\nThe doctor insisted that the procedure was mandatory get it mandatory he had no choice\nBut not for any medical reason rather the Swedish social services administration\nRequires such scans to look for evidence of child abuse while the doctor did note that the broken leg was the result of an accident\n\nHe told my brother in law the matter was out of my hands\nThat is the doctor saying that it is out of my hands I have no say on whether your daughter get to see the ... when the girl's parents refused to subject to this unnecessary procedure\nThe hidden machinery of the Swedish welfare state spring into action my\nBrother in law and his wife were required to attend multiple interviews with social workers\nAnd to submit friends and neighbors in in their small town for questioning\n\nSocial workers even inspected their phone suddenly decisions is benign is why milk to by seeing potential evidence of parental proficiency my inlaws feared their two children might be taken from them\nIn Sweden the state reserves for itself ultimate responsibility for children's wellbeing as appear at my job is to give my kids the to get\nThat that Swedish term for this great all enveloping security necessary to become productive tax paying members of sweet of society that is why I receive financial support of medical benefits the state is paying me to be a parent\nThis is the key here I Am in effect an employee [noise]\nThat's why people who home school their children are looked at very often negatively but a lot of other parents the states should teach your children who the hell are you to educate your own children\n\nSo this has been a revelation in my life is the ultimate issues our because this is an ultimate issue do we do we want to preserve liberty number one or take care of\nPeople by take care take being taken care of now obviously there's there's gotta be an element of being taken care of we we all understand that but an element is not dominant which is dominant liberty or the other\nHuman being taken care of to the point where I don't want you to have the liberty to speak because what you say\nMay offend me is another example of liberty being downgraded on behalf of being taken care of I I don't want to hear anything that may hurt me\n\nOkay\nAh let's go to a
