hold the house and hold the Senate it doesn't do any good for the country when the other side is just completely off the rails\nAnd and bizarre we will get to that with Governor Jindal and uh I also want to speak to you about the proposition of revolution and civil war their voices on the left and on the right\nWho say we're in the midst of a civil war\nOr a cold civil war and may not be actual bloodshed but when you have people ranging from Carl Bernstein to on the left\nAnd Thomas Friedman of New York times on the left\nTo people like Victor Davis Hanson on the right and they're all saying yup civil war is here we're on the verge of fighting here is uh what Carl Bernstein had to say on CNN about why he believes were in the midst of the civil war listen\nI think one thing we need to understand is larger context of all of this and that is\nThat we are in a cold civil war in this country are then these two events are both lower investigation and the Kavanaugh nomination are almost a the the Gettysburg and and the the\nThe absolutely essential battles of this cold civil war in both the Democrats and the Republicans unfortunately uh own understand that and are exploiting their\nUh instead of having two parties committed to finding out troops in these two important matters we are now into serious tribalism ear\nOkay Gettysburg and anti them\nGettysburg over the three day battle there were over fifty thousand casualties I mean fifty thousand a Antietam bloodiest single day in American history there were twenty five thousand casualties in a single days battle\nAnd by the way both of those battles for people who know your civil war history and I know a bunch of you to do both of those battles resulted\nIn the union successfully turning back\nAn invasion by Robert The late\nRobert de Leon the sounds in the army of northern Virginia had invaded uh Maryland and we're headed toward Philadelphia and maybe Washington DC\nIn the Eighteen sixty two in September of Eighteen sixty two when anti them occurred the union stop them ... by the way and that's part of the story in my book the American miracle and egg battle of Gettysburg July of Eighteen sixty three\nA just a less than a year later another invasion of the north this time of Pennsylvania by Robert ... in the army of northern Virginia and again the confederates were turned back okay here's my question in today's civil war\nIf you think we're in the midst of one who's invading who wears the invasion occurring\nBecause see that's what you had to do it Gettysburg and emptied them you had to turn back the other side\nThey were attacking your territory where is that happening in the United states right now one eight hundred nine five five Seventeen Seventy six is our phone number ... nutty stuff to me and and again it it it represents both\nSides I'm very glad and I want to pose this to our to our website over at\nNational Review there is a a very useful piece by Jake cost who explains why Alexander Hamilton could be\nThe best source\nOf why we are not in the midst of some kind of civil war and now look\nOne of the points that Victor Davis Hanson makes and and a V. D. H. who is a a fellow at the Hoover Institution and Stanford and who had been privilege to me and I'm very glad he's been a guest on this show he's a brilliant historian\nAnd the one pulling that he makes that I think is worth considering\nIs that the reason he believes we are headed toward real civil war in this country is because unlike previous eras in which there were very very grave divides in the United states I just saw this new movie called first man\nWould show with rocks are big Tomlin we went out and saw that film last night and it's a terrific film we will be reviewing coming up but the the the point about that era\nOf the Nineteen sixties and all of a terrible divisions that that wrapped the country and there was actual bloodshed and riots and destruction and all of that\nBut it wasn't geographical it wasn't so clearly delineated no there was one of the things that the civil war people say is the California should secede\nBy the way they're a ton of people who don't live in California who would say bravo go for it or send California whether it's thirty eight million people and uh let them go elsewhere by the way here's an interesting thing and I would just we're just having this discussion over the weekend it at our Sabbath table\nWhich is that if you look at the numbers without California not only the Trump when a genuine electoral college landslide but Trump would actually won the popular vote by over a million and a half\nHillary's three million vote margin was provided entirely by California and it's just California's different from the rest of the country didn't used to be it is now a and\nAnd by the way it part of the idea of different states seceding Massachusetts in\nNew York maybe two and a Connecticut not yet but uh okay so you have a non continues country if they can all be independent countries there's a new revival up in Canada because of the true though administration of people calling for Quebec to be a separate country so why not\nLook I'm not serious about that and for the same reasons that Alexander Hamilton would argue in federalist number Lebanon number twelve\nHamilton says we are by nature one country because we're financially integrated with one another\nWe're making money on one another we are not separated a in a meaningful way we're we're going to make war on one another because we're all financially and injure locked we we had a story like that yesterday\nWhere there was a bar here in Seattle ... cheese and a group of college Republicans over at the University of Washington had said they wanted to celebrate the victory for Brett Kavanaugh by staging a beers with Brett party at this uh\nThis particular bar and the bar responded to those plans by posting something on their website saying we try to be totally non political we don't want to be involved in politics at all\nAnd therefore are the people who want to stage eight beers with Brett or for Brett party or not really welcome okay\nThere was talk that they were going to sue the bar 'cause you can't discriminate in the city of Seattle based upon political point of view and a cooler heads prevail then instead of suing they just went in and have their celebration\nThey weren't thrown out their money was still good uh they didn't\nInsist on everybody putting on a ... hat they didn't insist upon a heck during are bothering the other clients they had their party and maybe there are some other people who are literally crying in their beer about Kavanaugh's confirmation is fine but meanwhile\nThe reason ... did not make a federal case over this was because they wanted to make some money that's a very good motivation now you could ask and this is a very profound question so what happened with the civil war\nWas it that these cells in the north were financially integrated the answers they weren't that financially integrated the south had a completely different economic system in the south\nNearly half the labor force was slaves\nAnd everything in the south in terms of criminal law in terms of religion in terms of politics in terms of the economy was based on defending the institution of slavery\nAnd that was the brutal reality it was profoundly different in a way that California I'm Sorry is not that different from Texas if you disagree and you think we are in the midst of a civil war well I'll I'll give you some citations from people who agree with you\nWe can talk about it they're also one of the characters his civil war it was rather against rather well right now there's a congressional race [noise]\nWhereas brother against brother and sister will tell you about it and more coming up on them at that show one eight hundred nine five five Seventeen Seventy six\nTwenty nine four five seven genes of abusing Michael [noise]\nOkay then you give me can you give me one indication I understand what you're trying to say Melvin I Do but let me ask you this can you think of one\nLaw that either a justice Kavanaugh is going to shore up or a law that he's going to strike down where he's going to act to keep power concentrated for white males which which laws are you most concerned about their\nUh what I signed a law start with or fear those X. equal right um it but\nThat's that's the that's the fourteenth amendment to the constitution and that's where the fourteenth amendment the constitution guarantees every citizen regardless of color or national origin regard the equal protection of the law right and go ahead\nAnd that was a small part of it either how we ended up on our watch it\nYeah but when you ... what what laws do you think right now concentrate power in the hands of white\nMales and your name one because that would be unconstitutional\nAll equal pay what what was right that that's been in the law since Nineteen sixty three\nRight but that's not being put me in a lot\nOf course it is of course it is if I Know I look Melvin if I dared to uh offer a different salary for someone based on his or gender alone\nOr I Would be struck with a lawsuit so fast and they have lawsuits like this all the time but the the point is and this doesn't mean that there aren't cases where sometimes people are opposed to hiring then by the way there are cases where people are a whole post hiring men and some weather imposed hiring women\nBut the idea that that this gender gap in terms of pay is the cause of discrimination it has been answered so many times let me suggest you go to the website of Christina hot summers\nAre a woman by the way who's written about this so persuasively and and the idea that right now this is a problem for our world will get into that a little bit more close to two thirds of all graduates of four year colleges and universities in America are female and uh I suspect\nThat by the time my granddaughter is Twenty one right which is a little while but by that time women will be earning more than men on average\nWe'll be right back on the

is very very small\nNumbers of people who actually in California wants to secede even with Trump is president\nAnd it is not true that Governor Perry said the Texas ... should succeed when Obama was present president a and this kind of talk I notice entertaining it's kind of interesting I find it intriguing anything that brings back knowledge of the real civil war I guess has a purpose to it\nOn this issue a civil war going on\nOne of the things that people\nSaid about the civil war and it was literally true it it was brother against brother Mary Lincoln the first lady the land wife of Abraham Lincoln had a brother who was in the Confederate Army\nIt was a real division she was from Kentucky and uh in Kentucky particularly that that was a ... to Kentucky did not officially leaves the union but there were a lot of Kentucky Confederate who personally did\nIn any event that idea of family division has been highlighted in this crazy situation involving Congressman Paul Gosar of Arizona\nAnd his opponent whose name is Brill\nI just took out an ad\nThat features six ... six of congressman do SARS nine siblings he comes from a big family and the six siblings basically attack their brother\nAnd not because he's a bad guy not because he cheated them not because he's a person of low morality but because he is an outspoken conservative here's the\nAd a that was posted by congressman goes ours on it\nAll goes for the congressman isn't doing anything to help rural America Paul's absolutely not working for his district if they care about health care they care about their children's health care they would hold them to account if they care about jobs they hold him to account\nIf he actually cared about people in rural Arizona\nI bet he'd be fighting for our security for

he were black and I'll tell you why\nIt's two words as Clarence Thomas when cliff Clarence Thomas was charged with a Nineteen Ninety One was more serious frankly because he was charged not for when he

very much worth our attention is the forthcoming mid term elections where we elect all four hundred and thirty five members\nOf the house of representatives and I believe we're electing thirty five new U.S senators because they're a couple of special elections there in the mix and\nUh how's it going to go well it's a toss up and it's close\nThere is some very very sound advice it seems to me that is given to Democrats by a leading Republican and somebody who is one his own house elections by huge margins one two terms also by huge margins as the governor of Louisiana\nHis name is Bobby

waiting periods and bans on midterm abortions they can fight global warming without making obsolete many Americans livelihoods in lifestyle\nIf all of that is possible why do you think the Democratic party seems to be moving in the other direction\nWell Mike I think this is really an important moment for the Democratic party and they have to decide are they going to listen to their vote extreme base or are they going to try to become and remain a mainstream political party in the United states now look I lift those and other policy positions\nThat they're certainly not going to appeal to conservative Republicans like me and I suspect many of your listeners\nI think by by trying to come to the middle of the Democratic party can actually recapture some of those voters who voted for Trump who weren't consistent traditional Republican voter or they can make the decision they want to become angrier and even more radicalized\n... and they look they really have a choice if they pursue things like trying to impeach President Trump or trying to teach\nBrett Kavanaugh they insist on open borders they insist on abolishing ice or Medicare for all\nThose are great talking points and it excites the base and they can raise a lot of money from George Soros and folks like that\nI don't think they're going to win a lot of elections I I think that if anything there to help the President Trump when it ... I think the worst thing they can do is to continue to go to the far left but I think they've got a choice to make do they want to come back to the middle or do we want to continue to be the angry far left party\nOf ... one of the things and I heard this a a theory from a friend of mine is a long time activist in in Republican affair she has a theory that what the Democrats are trying to do is to go so far to the less\nThan a there has to be set up a middle parties somewhere that would run some kind of quote bipartisan ticket\nAnd uh they feel that that that kind of middle party with a celebrity taking the middle was take enough votes away from President Trump to ah to to give Democrats victories in two thousand twenty what do you think\nI I think that if they decided that their plan President Trump\nDidn't start measuring the drapes already I mean my plan on being an office for another six years the reality is there there's at least thirty five forty percent of voters they're going to stick with President Trump to matter what he has shown that time and time again he had those voters in the primary against running against several Republican candidate he had those voters\nOr through his highs and lows with campaign against Hillary Clinton and he had the voters\nDrives entire two years the reality is look the Democratic party should stop focusing obsessing with\nPresident Trump for the Republican Party they should come up with a real solutions to the problems that are concerning the American people if they continue to go to extremes you know the problem that the Democratic party has right now is that they're trying they're trying to persuade anybody they're simply trying to fight and motivate\nThe most liberal members of their base\nAnd they practically given up on the middle class the working class voters\nThat so famously went for President Trump now these are not always reliable Republican voters Republican Party cannot get complacent we don't own these voters they're not going to be loyal voters but they will vote for President Trump and they will vote for Republican officeholders as long as they continue to deliver so as long as you got to cut taxes and cut regulations that you've\nDone what he promised him move the embassy in Israel to Jerusalem is\nStanding with Israel and the international stage is defending their Second Amendment rights is defending the religious liberty right these conservative judges\nSo you know these are the voters that will go and follow and vote for leaders that are actually going to do what they promised they were gonna do President Trump is done if the Democratic party really wants to win back these blue collar voters many of them are union voters and many of them living in the heartland in between those two cos if they really want to get back to those voters\nThey've got to stop the the crazy rhetoric they've got to stop the extreme policies I'm not optimistic they'll do that but I I wanted to leave lay out the choice that the party faces\nYou can already see the Democratic candidates they're gearing up to run for president twenty twenty they're already trying to run that they're competing to see who can go for this to the left and their policy positions are becoming even more radical but one simple example you listed as a few examples\nThey can be promote a couple of them that doesn't mean they have to reject faith or traditional values from the public square\nOr patriotism for that matter you have\nA right that they've almost made it into a ... for some reason the Democratic party think that's a winning issue to put down that the American flag or or put down patriotism or are being proud of being an American and I just don't think that's a winning formula to be being a majority party in this country\nBy the way that's one of the reasons I think is so important that Ted Cruz windows race in Texas because ... is really bad for the entire farm on his support of a kneeling during the national anthem for pro football players and ... again ... this whole idea\nThat we can have American and satiation or I mean you're you're a child of immigrants my mother was an immigrant to this country\nAnd uh one of the things that's great about most immigrant families is patriotism love of country loving America but the Democrats by running against that\nUh it it's it's a disaster let me give you a challenge governor Jindal which is that uh\nWould you write about the Democratic party I Know a lot of our critics there are a lot of people on the left who would say it's even more true about the Republican Party they've gone so far to the right they lost the mental they've given up on the middle or what do you say to people like that\nOh look I think a couple of things I think both parties are absolutely guilty of thinking they're permanent majorities and I hate us in the column and the reality of the voters always have to remind them unfortunately if you think about the middle east everybody remembers\nWho hurt them yesterday and they would they want to get their avenge tomorrow and in both parties are certainly guilty of that\nBut just look at the Kavanaugh hearings as a great counter example look Brett Kavanaugh was not the most conservative justice that the president could have nominated he he's a fairly moderate establishment figure a Republican now I Am not a moderate ... between the two parties\nYeah law graduate yell undergraduate or graduate you know he went to a very good schools worked in the Bush administration\nAnd even before the allegations came out against him he looked at the Democratic history on exist that extreme reaction\nAnd I think what you see it as easy to the extreme overreaction from the left I Would argue that looks certainly there are folks in both parties that that go to extremes\nBut I think when you look at what the president is actually done in terms of cutting taxes cutting regulation in terms of the growth we're seeing the American economy\nThis is what a majority of the American people want it you know the the reason he won election and this is a very important point he didn't say one thing get elected and do something else everything that drives the Democrats crazy about President Trump he absolutely promised on the election trail he was going to do these things\nAnd that's why he won the reality of it is not that voters or or you know it's not that Trump voters are disappointed in him or what he's done they're actually getting what he promised them on the campaign trail so\nBut I I think the Democratic party has got a fundamental choice I think part of the problem is that when you look at the activist base you look at the donor base\nThey will punish Democrats that want to compromise you know look at the Democratic party already made up their minds and cabinet before the hearing started they they tore person on that committee ... almost every one of the months ago came out and said they were going to oppose them\nAnd I think they're trying to appeal to the liberal donors most liberal activist\nWhat they forget that was that's not where most American voters are most American voters don't want to abolish ice most American voter\nDon't think that the police are across the board you know out there trying to hurt innocent people most American voters want to stand for the ... the American flag and most American voters are to your point patriots I'm reminded when asked President Obama about you know he did he think America was except Sean and remember that kind of the wishy washy answer\nYeah he said yes we're exceptional the same way that Greeks increases exceptional and Brits think Britain as ... as an exceptional in other words we're not\nA but I'll tell you is exceptionally Bobby Jindal his piece Democrats try some self restraint adjust appeared in the wall Street Journal and it's terrific a governor I Know you have to run we will look forward to talking to you next time\nAnd we'll be right back on self restraint and politics on the ... that show with your calls [noise]\nYou have been in this place for many many years\nBut one of the poll mold that ... that comes on ... on your show in Houston it talks about war it's all about we're in a war and so and if ... if you listen to talk radio call so we're talking about\nHow the war we're having with the ...\nI I think as as you know I I agree with you that does happen and I think it's unfortunate and I don't think you will hear that rhetoric on this show because I think it's wrong I don't think this is a war I and I'll tell you why David and I said this many times of the goal of a war is to destroy the enemy\nTo kill him basically and\nUh the the goal of politics is to persuade people\nMichael is your friends who it is so don't know I'm a yeah OK you particularly don't see it but if you're friends through for people who you are\nOkay you know what I you probably have some friends who have some strange ideas to right\nThat's right [laughter] wait a minute wait a minute what about better roared\nNot my friend I I'll probably vote for him but you know four of them are\nOkay we'll do vote for him a because again if you do that you're encouraging this leftward drift of the Democratic party David I I'd like to sit down I imagine that you and I would find a lot that we would agree on and by the way I Do agree with your basic point that's why I went to your call first\nIs because I think it is true that this tendency also exists on the Republican side\nBut I'll tell you what was very refreshing to me I think it's one of the most important speeches in recent years when Susan Collins spoke on the Senate floor\nEvery word she said about a justice capital was measured it was balanced it was persuasive it was none of this rhetoric is the other side is all wrong and we're All right\nAnd this is the basic point because even if you leave out the independent voters the people who vote regularly and they go back and forth between Republicans and Democrats\nThe biggest group of prospective voters in America the people who don't vote an aunt who aren't interested the people who represent this ah\nTosh uh who are dumb as blank and don't vote and don't pay attention to try to get people to pay attention it doesn't\nWork to say that we're on the verge of Armageddon and and we're all getting ready to\nKill each other when it actually works better it seems to me saying well we have some good ideas about how we can change things for the better and in the midst of a big down day on Wall street today in a horrible horrible hurricane about to strike the panhandle in Florida\nMaybe we can remember that we all have bigger

think it's perfect\nIt's not perfect you know\nI Would also we what was your civilization to change and improve the question is do you want us to change your improve or a discarded altogether the

the world of ... and ah these things these images were um posted on V. contact which is um the Russian equivalent of Facebook and\nThis is just one of those things where when people talk about American civil war the reason they are so sensitive about anything that has anti Christian stuff is because the Russian Orthodox church has become totally involved with a boot and regime and they're

Michael ...\nHey there Mike all you know they're doing well okay I'll go down a hill of your do your about your era interesting you're saying\nWell thank you try to be\nAnyways ah just started like I told your screener I was just wondering what are we spending so much crime a evaluating and trying to help the Democratic party pointing up of things that they're doing wrong and\nWhy don't we just let them bring themselves to the ground and start over again why the ... the only thing themselves a Democrat thing we don't go [noise]\n... they should like ... they should be and I'll I'll tell you why so that we can get some I told you so rights when they end up losing their dream of taking over the house because if they take over the house this way with this kind of political appeal\nIt will be incredibly bad for the country I mean you could say well it will ensure that President Trump gets re elected 'em because the Democrats will be so so hateful\nBut then we have two years to go through and there's no telling what kind of security damage what kind of damage\nIn terms of protecting Americans in terms of border security in terms of our defense posture foreign policy\nThey can do all kinds of damage plus we have a gigantic problem and this is where we need Democrats there's nothing we can do about the budget deficits and about the national debt without bipartisan action\nThat's why President Obama miss such a\nGolden opportunity with the Simpson Bowles commission during his administration we can't fall into that same trap appreciate your call let's go to Mike
