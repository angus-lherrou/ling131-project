point for America historically and on the short term I think it will have a big influence on the boat coming up in November\nSo it's hard to say that there's not an more important story I mean this is it um which one you want to check first\nWell let's let's first or take a look at what you think the impact is likely to be on the vote November\n... he was gonna be a tremendous backlash\nAnd people um who espouse no presumption of innocence which is the Democratic party\nThe only one Democrat voting for capital on a show managing the senator from West Virginia one so I'm not a you know the other what forty seven of actually saying look we're with a mop\nWere with the people who are accused Kavanaugh without any corroborating evidence with the FBI is all ready now said there isn't any\nAnd we're still with the more we we want to get the pitchforks and the\nAnd the fire porches and march up the hill okay so Americans are getting that they're getting it and they say well what if this happened to my father or brother or husband would I Want no presumption of innocence would I Want the man to be destroyed by allegation\nAnd of course the answer is going to be no thought the Republicans are smart and that's a big\n[laughter] tell you that they run on two things the economy and the Democratic party rejecting that presumption of innocence and I think that both of those things will be helpful to geo care November\nNow one of the other things we now have officially the lowest unemployment rate in a forty nine years with three point seven percent ... you have to go back to Nineteen sixty nine\nTo find and unemployment rate this low that's that's noteworthy to I ... I ... you talked about the presumption of innocence now again you're in a unique position talking about anything having to do with hash tag me to or accusations about\nMistreatment of women because that's had a very big impact on your life in your career\nOr do you think we may be reaching a turning point in this whole narrative that says that anyone who makes any accusations at all\nShould be a ... instinctively support it do you think that is likely to begin to change\nYeah I'm constrain or what I can say because uh I ... I Believe the legal action in play to restore my reputation and of course it takes\nA lot of money and a lot of time to do that so I Can't really get into my situation I can tell you the same people who are now paying demonstrators to disrupt the capital or will behind um my accusations and they paid people to stand out front on Fox News would saut same exact people\nI've seen groups and it's outrageous it's an outrage the problem with the accusation industry and that's what it is now Michael than industry right and it's run by two four six\n... lawyers who are shakedown auditors to know they can uh get money from individuals and corporations just by the obligation because the corporations and individual so I Want to publish\nA shakedown industry has been in place now for decades but now you have the allegation industry used by political people All right so if we don't like cabinet or we can't defeat him on the merits\nIt was going to be confirmed so we're going to put out a a a letter from a woman who says well he he uh molested me when I was Fifteen Years old okay so that's what happened that's what happened that's what they did\nAnd of course the wild card in this was the press and the press is the driver primary driver of the political allegation industry because the press doesn't care what's true\nThey didn't know searching in my case at all none zero and we provided press outlets with the scope of tore evidence that in print it they wouldn't even use it I mean CNN and use the word rape in conjunction with a cabin or more than a hundred times\nMore than a hundred times CNN are associated cabinet with rape\nAnd they none of these accusers uh ever even alleged that he raped anyone did they\nKnow a while one did one did a ... that that\n... went and they said is sweating and said she thought he participated in a drug gang spiking punch and things\nThat girls could be raped by a a line of boys right and which is that in the beginning the cabin always in the line and then she hold back on that\nOne out what I'm trying to get across is and this is very important for people understand is that the corrupt American media and it is as corrupted has ever been in our republic doesn't care what happened\nThey want the salacious headline alright they want to tag powerful people with this\nOkay let me just interrupt you for a moment and a rather momentous announcement a Joe mansion just Santa vote yes\nHe will vote yes on Kavanaugh which means that he has a sure now of fifty one votes he will be confirmed he needs fifty go ahead\nWhat mansion in you know if it wants Collins came across mansion then had nothing to lose\nSo I'm not I I thought I thought Collins was sincere and somewhat brave but mansion I liked mansion I liked your eye on 'em but he just waited back and say oh well now it's the issue with things while say yes\nBecause as you know if it's a pie in the Senate the vice president breaks the tie in a capital it's fair right match without putting any currency on the line now because Schumer the Senate minority leader threatened all the Democratic senators by saying if you support Kavanaugh will cut off all your money\nSo when you run for reelection not getting any money from the national committee\nSchumer did don't you think this is gonna Heidi Heitkamp who's already running I think nine or ten points behind a in her race in North Dakota I held him back and and she'll lose in North Dakota\nYeah but but again it's hard to understand\nWhy and and you see this this was a point when you listen to senator Collins\nShe brought out the point that that look up a Brett Kavanaugh is not some extreme legal theorist he's a respected judge he's right in the Republican mainstream\nEase about as a moderate an appointee as they could possibly hope for from Donald Trump so what's what is behind this this hysterical this\nIs what democracy looks like no no ... got to go\nThe demonstrators and the craziness that they're not all rent or demonstrate is Amy Schumer got herself arrested ... what does she have in this fight\nAbortion what it is the progressive left knows that the state of Mississippi is the latest and Missouri is in there as well are trying to limit\nA timeframe on abortion abortion clinic access things like that\nMany of those cases will go to the Supreme Court and a Kavanaugh will most likely come down on the side that the states have a right to regulate commerce which is what abortions come down to now Planned Parenthood\nA they have a constitutional right to regulate Khan a commerce within their borders so the far left the progressive to control the Democratic party and the media\nBasically say we can't have this guy because he's going to come down on the side of the states to limit abortion we want unfettered abortion abortion under any reason under any circumstance at any time that's what we want it's where they need Schumer watts\nThat's what Hillary Clinton walk and that's what\nThat's why the um Kavanaugh train a picked up speed once it looked like he was going to be confined beats all about abortion\n... let me also mention a Bill O'Reilly is my guest he has a new\nBestseller that is going to be released next week it is called killing\nThe ss the hunt for the worst war criminals in history\nOr it's going to be available next week you can find out about a link to it at our website\nAnd Michael midday dot com\nAnd another fascinating read on a dramatic an astonishing chapter in world history we will be right back with more ... where on the parents victory for Brett Kavanaugh more coming right up thank you Bill O'Reilly\nYeah he's he's yes I think he may be Seventy nine he's yeah they're they're both these\nAre too liberal lions and um the as you said and it could happen any time so but the court now is uh where Trump wants a debate even if you a Republican you voted for him you know like um you know like a style you don't like it handled

Kavanaugh\nEveryone has announced all the Republicans plus Joe mansion\nWith the exception of Lisa Murkowski voting yes that means fifty one vote yes on confirming Kavanaugh\nAll the Democrats with the exception of Joe mansion voting no and uh the Democrats are joined by the one Republican dissenter Lisa Murkowski so pretty much a straight party line vote with one switch on each side\nUh fifty one forty nine vote it's one of the reasons that it's so important to get a better majority in the Senate\nI'd today Brett Kavanaugh wrote\nSupreme Court must never be viewed as a partisan institution the justices do not sit on opposite sides of an aisle they do not caucus in separate rooms as I've said repeatedly if confirmed the court I Would be part of a team of nine committed to deciding cases according to the constitution and the loss of the United states I Would always try to be a team player\nDuring the confirmation process I met with Steve five senators\nThe only reason he didn't meet with all one hundred as most of the Democrats would meet with him they refused and I explained my approach to the law\nHe writes I participated in more than thirty hours of hearings before the Senate Judiciary committee at I submitted written answers to nearly one thousand three hundred\nAdditional questions I was grateful for the opportunity after all those meetings and after my initial hearing concluded I was subjected to wrongful and sometimes vicious allegations\nMy time in high school and college more than Thirty years ago has been ridiculously distorted my wife and daughters have faced violent violence threats\nHe writes I was very emotional last Thursday more so than I have ever been I might have been too emotional at times I Know that might tone was sharp and I said a few things I

I think the other one was named\nBrown which are two lawyers are big activists and they wanted the public testimony to basically try to smear and defeat Kavanaugh the private testimony would have been

to provide free medical care for everybody else\nIncluding\nPeople haven't paid a dying into Medicare it it would wreck\nThe system Medicare is on the ballot this year\nUm and you don't have to be following somebody to be made aware of what they're doing on Twitter obviously it could be someone you follow re tweeting something from someone you don't follow and many times they're retreating something\nFrom someone they don't agree with just because they can't believe that somebody has actually dumb enough or insane enough to say that but that's that's I guess what makes Twitter interesting if you're interested in Twitter\nUm but there are some strange people out there it's kind of nice to be able to see just what kind of an enemies out there as I said and uh and being disseminated by people who have thousands of followers ... some of them hundreds of thousands some of them millions of followers\nAnd they just do the stuff out there and many of them are also the reason that they have as many followers that they do have is because they have\nThe ability to get followers by having columns that reach a lot of people are being on television and you know being on radio or whatever you you get ... hours I think you know how it works in a you might not because not everybody pays attention to Twitter but uh I also like here's what I came across today\nSomebody named Emily Lyndon put this out there for her she's Twenty one thousand ... not a lot it's not nothing but it's it's not a ton\nBut it's what you put on put out their story if some innocent men's reputations have to take a hit in the process of doing the patriarchy patriarchy that is a price I Am absolutely willing to pay\nThough I've never heard of Emily uh of course you'd never heard of me either but I've never heard of Emery ... says what it said says she's an award winning documentary filmmaker I I guess I could\nGoogle it and I didn't have time or the interest in Googling it but she must be out there somewhere on Google if she made a documentary film in one of the war of course Michael Moore also say um documentary award winning documentary filmmaker and he needed the body Michael Moore\nAnyway she's an author two and a columnist and she says the accuser of a of a Brett Kavanaugh is a national hero and another tweet about Twenty one thousand followers don't give all that much power to somebody\nBut the point is people like her were almost put in charge and there are lots of people out there like or not just tweeting that are Twenty one thousand followers but writing columns in producing documentary films that people are falling all over themselves to see\nAnd that's how she this this isn't even what she just she tweeted there\nIs ridiculously radical and stupid but it's it it it should be but in many people don't consider that all that radical a lot of people agree with her lots and lots of people\nAnd she and millions of other people on the left still think that ... and and this is the thing that she was almost put in charge and\nYou know who do you think she voted for twenty sixteen\nShe and millions of other people on the left still think that Hillary Clinton was all the president's you somehow and they still can't believe\nThat Donald Trump does the president to have them and they'll do anything they can to resist everything he does and that includes the spending all belief when it comes to somebody making accusations against whoever you nominate for the Supreme Court\nBut this is out there and when I see that stuff I mean a lot of times I just laugh because I think it's ridiculous and and I'm I feel pretty confident that it's not going to go anywhere\nBut my second reaction at least if it's not my first reaction all the time is\nThe people were almost in charge there are people surrounding Hillary Clinton and the worst of rounding her then the uh during the campaign and for the last thirty or forty years they think like that and and they at the same people who\nUm we talked about all the ... the insanity that's on college campuses and I say it all the time\nThat these people are coming up with these ideas with the safe spaces and I just you know you know this goes on college campuses I don't go into it\nBut the what bothers me about it that these are people that came really really close to being in charge and they think they're going to be in charge again so it's it's kind of scary and so does anybody really think that if Kavanaugh doesn't make it through this process that they're not going to do the same do whatever replaces them\nBe interesting to see how creative the feminist would be if it's a woman who's next whether it's because Kevin ought to make it or because\nPresident Trump has to come up with somebody else and it happens to be a woman they'll trash a woman and if it's a conservative woman it won't matter she'll get the same treatment the cabinet getting and I'm hoping that a Trump gets a chance to uh uh put another one out there\nAfter cabin on and I hope it as a woman just to see what it'd be\nLike the coming up we're going to talk to a woman who wrote a piece a today is talking about how I very very bad precedent is being tapped by what's happening when Brett Kavanaugh will do that when we come back [noise]\n\n\nMarley financial is done and again these guys are just
