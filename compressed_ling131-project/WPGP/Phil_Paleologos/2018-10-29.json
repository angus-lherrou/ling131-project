Woodrow Wilson who was running against him was so a compelled at theater Roosevelt campaigning on this idea of a new nationalism that he came up with his own program called the new freedom\nIn any event there is nothing wrong with the term nationalism is there but if you look at the dictionary or you just Google or anything it look it up what are the Centers for nationalism here the first three Senate patriotism patriotic feeling\nAnd flag waving okay is there something wrong with that\nI I Am not entirely comfortable with President Trump using the term global as derisive Lee I don't know anyone I honestly do not know anyone who describes himself or herself as a global it\nUm and at a a ... and ... and that's a word that's problematic that that's but that's not what people are freaking out about what\nPeople are freaking out about this President Trump saying he's a national is for instance here is Don Lemon reacting almost in real time just moments after President Trump dropped the N. word Don Lemon on CNN [noise]\nI'm a nationalist\nUsed that word we're going to talk about that word tonight it is a favorite of the all right and is loaded with native is and racial undertones and global as well global is\nI've been used as a slur of sorts sometimes even against those in the administration often with anti Semitic overtone\nWhat just happened to make the president come right out and embrace nationalism\nOpenly and cleaned up now would have happened here\nOkay what is the problem with nationalism a a nationalist\nOr nationalism and this is a again common definition a person who advocates Political Independence for a country patriotic feeling principles are efforts an extreme form of this especially marked by a feeling of superiority over other countries\nThan a patriot her patriotism that's listed as a person who vigorously supports their country and is prepared to defend it against enemies are detractors vigorous support for one's country in other words that's why patriot patriotism is listed as a synonym for nationalism\nAnd um do I think this is may be part of a political strategy for him to help\nA push the Republicans over the line and hold the house of representatives and some of these furious house races\nI I kinda think Trump just set it but maybe it is maybe it is and I'll tell you why because for ordinary Americans\nI I mean basically the people who live in this country and yes that includes those all important suburban women you hear that the president said I'm a nationalist\nWhat is so terrible about that and uh the chrysalis are rights\nOn his face Trump seemed to be simply saying that well past presidents and politicians cared a lot about other countries and what other countries thought about the United states\nThat he cares primarily about us and what is good for us the problem of course is that words matter and the American president referring to himself as a nationalist has all sorts of problems wrapped up in it\nLet's start with what nationalism means\nHere's the definition as he found it says quote a sense of national consciousness exalted one nation above all others and placing primary emphasis on promotion of its culture and interests as opposed to those of other nations or super national groups\nProblem there as we do not elect a president of the United states to be a citizen of the world\nOr a public servant for the world we do not we elect a president to represent the United states and\nTo defend our country and to defend our constitution and yes to defend our culture and there is such a thing as American culture now the term white nationalist\nOr if I dare say so the term black nationalist which is also tend to that's the problem let me tell you why it's a problem because what that suggests is that your real nation is something other than the United states\nThe United states obviously has nationalist about America patriots who serve our country who fight for our country who worked for our country\nOf every racial religious and or ethnic background it it it does\nAnd the idea that there is something racist about saying I Am a nationalist America specifically and from the beginning has always been a nation\nThat has not define our nationalism or our nationality based upon race or blood or where you were born I mean going all the way back to before the revolution\nThe idea was you could become an American by choice by picking yourself up and moving here and embracing the American idea\nAnd we've always had that we've always had that\nAnd you know we have we talked on this show many times and and it is true it is documented nobody argues against is close to ten percent and maybe over ten percent of the continental army that fought with George Washington for our liberty\nWhere people of color they were black people mostly former slaves because that's why they were here\nAnd the idea there's the French there actually recorded descriptions of when the French arrived to work with the Americans at Yorktown\nOne of the reasons they look down on the American army was not only\nNot speak the uniforms and the French were about nothing if not spit uniforms but because there were so many people of different complex and in that arming one eight hundred nine\nFive five Seventeen Seventy six [noise]\nYou have a problem with nationalism\nDoes that mean you have a problem with America\nBlue right back on the man that show [noise]\nYour outlet for outrage I'm not going to remind them might be mad vigil [noise]\nNo and we have to come together and fight it and that's why this rhetoric about jobs not moms and that's also why the rhetoric about nationalism it seems to me\nI don't think there are many conservatives who are troubled by the idea of being a nationalist and let me explain to there's a new book about nationalism by an Israeli writer named your um how zoning and it's it's worth considering because one of the point she makes\nIs that nationalism goes pretty directly\nWith the idea of democracy because if you're talking about a nation state is your real tribe than the ideas and that's been very much the way it is in America is what patriotism means is that I find myself as an American\nAnd going back to Theodore Roosevelt again in the new nationalism the whole idea was if you are an immigrant you drop the idea of carrying the flag of your former country you carry the American flag and your nationalism your tribal affiliation which you care about what what do you and give your heart to\nIs our nation not a race not an ethnicity and the fact\nThat that there are so many people out there and the commentary and so many Democrats who don't get that who are offended by the term nationalism I honestly don't think that's helping the Democratic side\nI think of anything it helps on the conservative and Republican side by the way if you're one of those people just offended by the word nationalism give me a call and tell me why\nOne eight hundred nine five five Seventeen Seventy six I'm Michael in San Diego you're on the Michael ... do\nYou like I I'm a I think that America is neither a a a country founded on nationalism nor international is a more global is I mean\nHow can you say that we weren't found it on nationalism a we were founded on individual is nationalism\nOr no no I'm Sorry we were we were founded by a lot of people who came together to a risk their lives and in many cases to give their lives at twenty five thousand people who signed the revolution\nGive their lives for the cause of the ... a nation not a not a school board of the nation stay with me if I Want\nTo let you answer back a will continue what's wrong with nationalism honestly I think it's a beautiful thing and needed in this country and probably around the world tell you why coming up\nAnd I'm quoting here insane catastrophic\nChaos the Michael mad vigil view some more polite words [noise]\n\nDon't pay double for
