I was a manager in charge of hiring\nWashington who was so great that he seems in approachable and almost like a statue and no not Jefferson with his complexities and as many flaws it would be that fourth Rushmore president President we celebrate today\nThat would be Theodore Roosevelt the all American Boy [noise]\nAnd then use it that you're hearing [noise]\nIt'll be a hard time and the old town tonight [noise] was used by Theodore Roosevelt as something of a steam\nWhy because it was used for his regimen the rough riders before they went to Cuba\nAnd the Spanish American war then played it virtually every rally until he got rather sick of it while I was running for governor of New York in Eighteen Ninety eight before he became president of course\nAnd I I Need to answer a couple of questions to the very beginning first of all the idea that I call him Theodore Roosevelt\nAnd uh not Teddy Roosevelt as he's often no\nWell that's because President Roosevelt always lose the the name teddy when he was a tiny boy he was called GD and he didn't like it and he never liked being called teddy and he was declared any why don't hold me Eddie doesn't know me at all\nAnd I certainly hope that by the end of this broadcast you will know President Theodore Roosevelt well there is also great confusion about the pronunciation of his name\nThere are people who say Roosevelt and they will say Theodore Roosevelt and Franklin Roosevelt then there are other people who say no no they know that Franklin said Roosevelt because we have all kinds of recordings of him saying but they'll say Theodore Roosevelt\nHe always said Roosevelt he very clearly did and I have become friends with President Roosevelt great granddaughter in other words her a grandmother was President Roosevelt daughter\nAnd I asked her is there any doubt at all that everyone in your family says Roosevelt she says no it's Roosevelt stop with the Roosevelt and then the last question about the title of this very special broadcast on the Michael med show pulling him the all American Boy\nI I Do that because part of the fascination with President Roosevelt is his boy ... which lasted his entire life he never quite grew up in fact one of the most famous statements about him was made by the British diplomat assessed all spring rice who became a very\nGood friend with President Roosevelt when he was in the White House and he said you must always remember\nAbout the president that he is about six and\nA there were others who are also impressed with his boy ... the only route the gray evidence who served NPR's cabinet um said on the president's forty six birthday\nYou said you've made a good start in life and your friends have great hopes for you when you grow up\nAnd then later six years later in uh Nineteen ten he uh greeted him on his birthday by writing Tim this after a President Roosevelt had been reelected Theodore you are still the same grade overgrown boy as ever\nAnd most movingly of all and I just came across this stunning to me\nIs former President Theodore Roosevelt humbled themselves and came to the White House to beg a favor\nOf a man who defeated him in his last race for the presidency Woodrow Wilson he he didn't like Woodrow Wilson he was referred to Woodrow Wilson as the real W W stood for weasel words which is quite a thing to say but he came to\nPresident Wilson in the White House in Nineteen Seventeen after American entered World War one\nAnd President Roosevelt begged him to allow the president's he begged the president to allow him President Roosevelt to organize a regiment and lead a regiment at the front\nBecause he wanted to spend his own money to recruit people to get volunteers\nAnd and President Roosevelt at the time was in his late fifties he wasn't in perfect health and Wilson said\nNo but afterward he wrote this in his diary he's a great big boy I was charmed by his personality there was a sweetness about him that is very compelling you cannot resist the men\nAnd people felt that way about Theodore Roosevelt for most of his life and part of the reason that he remained an overgrown boy his entire lifetime was because his actual boyhood was at least for his early years so miserable\nHe had a terrible case of Assam as a child\nHe was born to a family of privilege otherwise he might not have even survived but his family had that come here with some of the original touch settlers in what was originally called New Amsterdam they came in the middle of sixteen hundreds\nAnd the family was always successful they were prosperous his father Theodore Roosevelt senior was a widely respected community leader and the successful importer of glass\nAnd generally a a very dedicated community minded businessmen\nAnd in terms of asthma\nOr young GT as he hated being called\nA loose too sick to attend school and his mother took him to various practitioners who attached mustard plasters at one point they massages his chest so vigorously that it started to bleed he got electric\nShocks and none of it seemed to work the only thing that worked was the time he would spend in his father's arms\nAnd he remembered years later I could breathe I could sleep when he had me in his arms my father he got me breath I could sleep when he had me in his arms he got me lungs strength life\nIn some sense of what his childhood was he was considered well enough\nTo go with his family when he was ten years old\nAnd they went on a grand trip of Europe and some of it was fun he kept a diary of the trip and it's amazing to read it\nFrom ten year old Theodore Roosevelt in Switzerland August twenty third he writes in the afternoon we threw paper balls at the waiter and chamber made an rushed around upstairs and downstairs to dodge them he's talking about his sister and his brother and himself\nThan September twenty fourth Venice\nI was sick with asthma it did not sleep it on\nSeptember twenty six ... I was sick of the asthma I sat up for force excessive hours and papa made me smoke a cigar to help me breathe\nThis was his reality and it was also his father Theodore Roosevelt senior who encouraged him to become the master of his own body\nAnd to work out with barbells a with very regular exercise to build up his body and his strength\nNow this is often exaggerated he he never became a truly a superb athlete but he did develop as he was growing up first of all he his height was was never on firing people think of Theodore Roosevelt as this towering figure\nHis height depending on which source you believe was somewhere between five eight and maybe as much as five ten it was probably five eight or five nine\nAnd that was not considered large for the time but when he went away to Harvard\nHe took up boxing and she became obsessed with this physical culture and improving his body [noise] so how is it that this was sickly young man\nBecame America's most celebrated advocate of

Kavanaugh I I Do believe you will be confirmed on Saturday probably with fifty one votes in maybe with fifty votes who who knows it could be fifty to\nA buddy will be confirmed and what would you advise him uh in order to [noise] to rise above and and prevent all and become the great associate justice of the Supreme Court that we both know we will be\nWhere I Am not going to be presumptuous enough to to I think that you need my advice but I'll I'll say that uh we saw his judicial temperament and hasn't packet of ... legal my for twelve years from the DC circuit when he was vindicated by the Supreme Court and unparalleled Thirteen times\nAnd we also saw the last confirmation hearing\nThat he was outraged about an outrageous process as well he should be and I have confidence that wants to use on the bench at the Supreme Court hopefully he will be\nThat we will see the judicial temperament that we saw for the past twelve years we don't have to guess about what kind of judge Brett Kavanaugh will be\nYou'll be the same kind of judge he'd been for the past twelve years so I'm I'm looking forward to that I share your cautious optimism I understand uh you know it's it's the process is so farcical at times that it leads to sell it lends itself to jokes but but I Do want to really you know he's serious that that this people have been hurt Brett Kavanaugh has been hurt\nHis family doctor for that they've received death threats this process stinks\nAnd how do we fix it ... and that's the last question though will have time for Justin Walker professor of law how do we fix the process\nOf my good [laughter] um you know I I'm just do what we former clerk or as we were talking earlier with the Harvard but you have a Yale degree\nAnd I'm going to trust you Michael nice to have the answers to the big picture questions more than just weren't silk procedure but at the Yale I've heard that they just they really learn how to solve the world's problems\nWell again this is a a gigantic problem and I want to get to that and get that with listeners because clearly this process is broken I mean everybody hates this has not been a good moment for America\nLet me tell you one thing and I'm going to tell you this as soon as we come back from break\nI think one thing that every single American can do to help fix this process and to stop this madness for the future what is it
