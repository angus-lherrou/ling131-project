uh my coat in Tampa, Florida hello Michael Bennett's Prager\nWhile I Do I disagree I think you're selling the American people short Donald Trump won a majority of the votes excluding California and these people want freedom but the government is forcing wishing that basically making us cry uncle\nAnd my health insurance premiums have doubled since Obama Care how would you like to live in the ... in the county where no health insurance is so then you know people who say single payer Medicare for oh what what sound very appealing early\nWait wait wait that's my point ... forgive me that's what people would like they ... they would like single payer for all I I I Would be very interested to see if we took a national vote\nOnly on that question would you like to nationalized healthcare every one is covered and doesn't have to pay dues would just take it out of\nThe people now are forced to want that because the health insurance premium for double double right oh\nNo no no we're right so you have no no no no no I hear what you're saying so you have very articulate spokespeople on the other side saying folks do vote for that your premiums will go down if we have medicine the same way we have food and everything else competitively priced\nSo we will have articulate people argue I I hear you perfectly\nThey'll say no no no don't worry you will have premiums obviously because it's going to be a private insurance market\nAnd then the other side will say folks don't you just want to be taken care of and not have this worry every civilized country in the western world after all has nationalized healthcare they're doing fine just ask your Canadian friends\nAnd I I I Would be very curious to see what the voters\nOr maybe that's the direction we're moving into Michael that's the point I'm not selling the American people short\nThe American people are ... are people and they have been the Americanized in terms of values that's what's happened American people who still uh from liberty in God we trust e pluribus unum the American trinity aren't going to vote for nationalized healthcare\nBut people for whom liberty secondary to being taken care of they\nWill and by the way and that's part of the reason is that people who believe in lip more government than liberty walk more immigrants because no matter by the way it doesn't matter where the immigrants come from\n... every immigrant comes from a country on a society that values being taken care of more than liberty\nBecause there's only one country on earth that values liberty more than being taken care of and that's the United states\nSo it doesn't matter where the person comes from from Asia from Latin America from Europe they\nAll the immigrants the great majority of them not all by any means dropped the word all the great majority come from countries societies mindset that value being taken care of\nMore than they value liberty that's one of the reasons for the great yearning for more immigrants if it is more people voting on behalf of bigger government the bigger the government the less you have to take care of yourself half of Americans are now um ... what is it\nI don't remember what is the

for Brett Kavanaugh's going\nYeah so what's\nThe story there we will get to that and also to the arrest\nOf a a teacher for something he tweeted\nAnd it's something that is very very much shows he is

well but first the reactions\nTo what is going on in our\nCountry right now to the swearing in ceremony last night a judge Kavanaugh was already sworn in as justice Kavanaugh on Saturday Night so he's been an official member of the Supreme Court for a while\nBut President Trump I think very rightly wanted to stage a formal swearing in and it was a wonderful occasion\nHe had a judge Kavanaugh's family there he had all the justice was the Supreme Court with their Ruth Bader Ginsburg was there dancing and celebrating and we've seen a few ... uh no that's not true that part but she was there\nAnd uh that's that's appropriate and that's important and I think the judge Kavanaugh justice Kavanaugh spoke very well\nAnd President Trump a\nPresident Trump did not speak as outrageously or as badly as a liberal media to try and suggest and we'll get to that place for you and tell you why but first off on this issue of civility which remains a very very big and divisive issue in the country\nThere was a contribution to civility from a contributor over at MSNBC and this is very much appreciate does it puts the situation and such good focus of this is a big contribution from Eli missed all\nWithin about making a deal with the devil\nBacks up his bargain alright resembled does not ... Trump has delivered for these people on the things that they care about most the of delivered racism for these people the delivered massage any for these people\nAnd now he's delivered the Supreme Court for these people which is something that they've been trying to get for a generation we're going to see if if this way but they now have control over all three branches of government we're going to see if this rain slash for three days for two years\nFor\nA thousand you're right that's a ... vice that's\nOf course what a Adolph Hitler and proclaim than his house in ... guy\nLasted exactly twelve years a look at ... ... ... when he says has delivered for these people are we back to the basket of deplorable is is that where it was only who are the people to whom President Trump is delivered racism and massage any\nAnd where is the son Janine American Life right\nNow is it a the idea that there is a lack of civility on the right how was it civil to suggest that a President Trump is making a deal with President Trump is a deal with the devil or the people\nTo whom he has delivered massage any and racism and corruption and horror and misery and\nAnd just general awfulness are actually diabolical one eight hundred nine five five Seventeen Seventy six and then there's this um Tom Steiner who was invested\nI think it's upwards of twenty million so far I think it's way above twenty million might be upwards of fifty million so far he spent on ads pushing the impeachment of Donald Trump\nHe spoke out on who to blame for everything that is going wrong in America here's Tom Steyer\nA group of very rich very entitled white men wanted to tell the rest of the country we are going to have our way and if you don't like it that is too darn bad\nAs far as I'm concerned the only thing everybody else can do now the the rest of America to go to the balls on November ... tell those bridging titled white men exactly we exist and democracy exist\nOkay just a question um is Tom ...\nA man and so yeah he is I think he currently identifies as a male even assist gender me is the white yeah he's white is he rich\nYeah is he in titled yeah so I\nI don't understand this is this is all the fault of rich entitled white men and with this kind of thing going on on the left basically suggesting that its rich and title white men who are controlling things against the public interest\nOr\nDoes it seem a little bit bizarre for the defeated presidential candidate Hillary Clinton to say that what we need now is a new civility but there's only one way to achieve civility you know what it is here's what she had to say on CNN\nCannot be civil with a political party that wants to destroy what you stand for what you care about that's why I Believe if we are fortunate enough\nTo win back the house and or the Senate\nThat civility can start again but until then the only thing that the Republicans seem to\nRecognize and respect is strength\nAnd you heard how the Republican members led by Mitch McConnell\nReally demeaned the confirmation process\nDemeans the confirmation process where were they the ones who brought up by drinking games in high school\nWhere they the ones who are brought up obsessively looking at a high school yearbook and even at general references in the high school yearbook\nHow is it that Republicans demeaned the confirmation process and and what about this notion that the only way that we can restore civility\nIs um is somehow to ah\nHave the Democrats back in control heaven forbid one eight hundred nine five five Seventeen Seventy six she also in the same interview Hillary said what was done last night and the White House was a political rally\nIt further undermine the image integrity the court and that troubles me greatly it saddens me because our judicial system has been viewed as one of the main pillars of our constitutional government um\nOkay\nIt was she watching what was she wants she may she was watching the Saturday Night live cold open\nWhich showed people celebrating an ... locker room if you actually watch and we should posted on our website Jeremy if you actually watch the ceremony with President Trump and justice Kavanaugh and Justice Kennedy very much in evidence the mentor of justice Kavanaugh who sworn and again\nWhy was that unsuitable I I\nHonestly a jump was asked about this briefly and about Hillary saying that the swearing in ceremony was no good it was a political rally it was inappropriate here's the president\nBush was saying what\nI guess that's where she lost she doesn't get it [noise] she never did I knew that a long time\nHillary never got it [noise] that's why she lost\nAnd and by the way when you talk about political event [noise]\nWas uh what judge Kavanaugh said political about wanting to be a justice who was fair [noise]\nHe said all nine of us just as the Supreme Court review of the constitution and yes that includes Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan Steven Brian [noise] we will be right back uh with your calls coming up on one eight hundred nine five five Seventeen Seventy six [noise]\nAnd the Iran deal bringing attention to the

make American fearing proud\nI this is I'm about as a strong case as you can make and none none of what she said can you argue it it's all the truth and yes she was\nPart of it but all of this did happen under President Donald Trump\nAnd this is one of the reasons I suppose that on the CNN poll a despite the fact that there has been so much hysteria on the left about having on and the the various horrors that are alleged to have been perpetrated by old white males led by Donald Trump\nThe President Trump actually saw his approval rating rising look as far as Nikki Haley is
