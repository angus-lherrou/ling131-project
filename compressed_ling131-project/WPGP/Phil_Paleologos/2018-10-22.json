showing final comments from me in fact we are in an era of good fortune when it comes to extreme weather vicious a topic I have studied them published on as much as anyone over two decades my research has been under constant attack\nFor years by activists journalists and politicians my friends is the left side of the same type of science you should say that at least two three times a day\nIt is still left by the same type of science or you know without a YouTube has put you on the restricted list and as I explained to people your video is against hate\nAnd it was restricted because it's a video\nThat mind boggling I mean honestly it it's All right I'm going to do it anymore but I Would talk\nAbout ... by the ... yeah I it's staggering\nWhat has happened is the left has taken off one of the first writers in North America to acknowledge the left he's anti liberal you are not a liberal if you are all left is is that clear my friends you are not you can not be both\nIt's not possible left is anti liberal is anti the foundations of liberal society if you can't publish the recipe of a cold will be cause a right wing Jews who wrote it you're sick you are sick\n... forward readers who objected are sick but they're dangerously sick their totalitarian we don't even watch your broccoli\nIt's about God working through social media well why wouldn't God works through social\nMedia and two thousand Eighteen I mean it's kind of the nation way of communicating is the president United States does it through Twitter everyday\nUh we'll be talking a little bit about the new TV series God friended me are coming up with one of the producers we will also be speaking about I'm a potential presidential match jump\nThat a lot of people are excited about would be a Nikki Haley on the Republican side\nVersus Beto O'Rourke on the Democratic side more that's how I mean the the media love affair with this guy is something\nTo behold does he deserve all the hype and then we're going to be speaking to Stephen Moore the author\nThe new book called Trump's ... about some of the lives about the economy\nAnd what happens next after the November elections to help Trump fulfill his America First vision of economic reform one eight hundred nine five five Seventeen Seventy six our phone number but first up\nLast night the president gave a a a rally speech\nAnd he was an extraordinarily good spirits he seemed extremely jolly the one aspect of his speech that has gotten all the attention I don't need to play for you because it's in in a CNN and CBS and NBC or all over it\nAnd let me just acknowledge I think it was unfortunate I don't think it was a good thing that the president or said that it was a praise worthy or that that basically congressman Gianforte Greg Gianforte of Montana he was in ... in Missoula\nAnd congressman Gianforte and at the time I thought that John forte handle it very well he lost his temper he body slammed the reporter he knocked off his glasses\nThere were charges brought against him he pleaded guilty he apologized lavishly he made a legal settlement with the reporter he assaulted and I've spoken to Congressman John forte this was one of the most embarrassing moments of his wife\nAnd I don't think it's a good idea for president from to make light of it I don't mean cars when John forte would think that however\nWhat struck me about this is this is that that was a tiny segment of a very long and very substantive speech actually with Trump was doing and I think in a fairly effective way was laying out\nThe way he's going to be campaigning and very close Senate races in very close governor's races as a Republican trying to help other Republicans and Trump last night was in Montana where the Senate races become unexpectedly close\nBetween our candidate Rosendale and the incumbent Democrat Jon Tester who pretends because he wants to last a finger in a farming accident\nNo there's no solidarity there was to show the we're not talking about it because he was lost a finger at a farming accident he's really a moderate Democrat he's a a good old boy and said he's not he's a big liberal\nAnd a Trump was speaking on behalf of Matt Rosendale and other Montana Republican and he had this to say in defining what this election should be about\n[noise] I Know a lot [noise] of Kavanaugh\nLaw and order and common sense that's what it's gonna be\nIt's got to be an election of those\nOkay he's talking about the Kavanaugh the caravan and common sense and I think he threw in off off script the idea of law and order but that that do fine I look in terms of Kavanaugh\nObviously because of the treatment of a justice Kavanaugh\nThat has mobilized lots of Republicans in there are lots of congressional races they are now the official people who do the polling and the banning and things like that say there is a one out of three chance that Republicans hold the house\nIt used to be down to one out of six\nSo right now Republican prospects are surging even in the house of representatives and that's a good thing and part of it is because\nYes with their response to justice camp and all the Democrats show that they're not the party of jobs they're the party of well we'll let the president delivers online\nBut the choice but not be more clear Democrats ...\nRepublicans reduced job [noise]\n\nNancy Pelosi [noise]\nBrian shops [noise] and the radical Democrats they wanna raise your taxes\nThey want to impose socialism on our incredible nation they could Venezuela because that's what's going to have [noise] they want to take away your health care because you won't be able to have in our country will be able to afford it\nDestroy your Second Amendment and throw open your book deadly drugs and vicious gangs because plenty of them are coming across a lot of drugs\nOkay and this is a problem for President Trump because guess what he's president United States Republicans controlled Senate in the house they can fill the apartment of homeland security they control lights\nAnd he is right that there are a lot of people coming across the border I just looked at the numbers and they're set\nThe number of people entering the country illegally has not gone down and went down the first year of Trump's presidency or the first part of the first year of Trump's presidency\nSound like tripled where it was when Trump became president of the rates in September ... the angry\nAnd that's why I think President Trump is absolutely right to make an issue of this caravan and by the way the evidence appears to be as of a half hour ago\nThat there was some progress getting Mexican authorities to move troops to try to block the advance of of what looks to be over four thousand people waiting Honduran flags by the way\nWe're marching their way through Guatemala and then through Mexico and they say they're headed to the United states what do Democrats say\nWe know where Trump's stance from stands on a common sense principle which I honestly who who could disagree you cannot let this\nCaravan in you can feel sorry for these people but if we go ahead and say oh well you march told his way will come and it will process your your applications for asylum that there will be no end to it\nIt will encourage more and more and more and more and look at it a question here not of whether we rearrange our immigration system to make it more sensible\nMaybe even more compassionate but right now the question was this caravan is whether we have an immigration system at all or whether we simply raise the borders any kind of meaningful distinction and uh I think frankly\nPresident Trump is looking at this thing going on how is this going to work out either as he is going to win victory and turn the caravan back\nWhere there's going to be some kind of awful disaster\nAnd I think the incoming president of Mexico Andres Lopez Manuel Obrador um\nHas a ... actually shown\nSome willingness to work with the Trump Administration on stopping\nThis caravan which is crucial\nI've been a Trump ... said this about\nThe economy and related it of course to the fact that there are more and more people coming across the border\nBecause I have such an incredible autonomy I have some money everybody wants to cry [noise]\nOkay probably the rhetoric I've created so much I have done this I haven't and no I that's\nNot ideal rhetoric but look the fact is the economy has done better that's what we're going to be talking about with Stephen Moore coming up and in just a moment the point over here and I think it's very striking\nIs everybody knows what Trump says everybody knows where Trump stands everybody knows what Trump has to say about this has anyone heard a any kind of meaningful democratic response on this issue of the caravan\n'cause I've heard nothing all they do is they attack from and that's not a policy being anti Trump is not a policy and last night\nBeto O'Rourke the new democratic superstar the great hope for Democrats not just for two thousand Eighteen but for two thousand and twenty and beyond\n... who's a talented politician but he blew up his his own campaign and frankly I think his own future with the one answer that was just appalling we'll get to that\nAnd as to your calls coming up we'll also be speaking with Stephen Moore the author of a new book Trump ... of course one of the leading economic thinkers at the Heritage Foundation behind the America First economic reform we'll be right back [noise] one\nEight hundred nine five five seven genes Seventy six the Michael men vigil last one eight hundred nine four five Seventy Seventy\nSix [noise]\nThey claim that the tax cuts that you helped to write and help to design that those tax cuts that have been passed have caused this exploding budget deficit because they've reduced revenues that's just a flat on line isn't it\nYeah revenues are actually up this year so we passed the biggest tax cuts and three years and we actually have a slight increase syrup is not what I Would like to see revenues higher and I think by the way as we get you know as we continue to see this economy\nOr continue to grow you you know the best way to get tax revenues that\nPut people to work at ... businesses profitable businesses back to the United states which has happening uh but yeah look the problem is spending and you know people I say oh you're just a rival Republican I'm not a rubber Republican the Republicans or Democrats this bipartisan spending spree that's going on my caller both parties deserve a lot of blame for this\nAnd you like a President Trump's a idea a vast amount every department to cut five percent yes\nI Love that you know that's what businesses do\nYou know that that's the thing if you're running a business\nAnd you don't have enough money coming in and your expenditures are too high you got to go to your agents and this is what businesses did during the recession they talked\nIn their stomach they tighten their belts they got rid of an efficient workers and inefficient services and things they didn't need and they save money and they became profitable getting we never do that and government and by the way I Would like to hear one listener\nOf your show Paul endear show and tell me you can't say five cents on the dollar\nThat right it well exactly ... what about the one aspect and you mentioned this in your book Trump ... posted up at our website at Michael ...\nThe one aspect of Trump's America First program that he talked about in the campaign was infrastructure that he's really done pretty much nothing to implement a where's the money going to come from to do the big infrastructure improvements that we need\nWell let me go back to what I was just saying about this construction boom that's going on in this country factories and and warehouses and and apartments and that is an for structure and what\nWe need pipelines we need ... terminals we need oil refineries we you know the point I'm making is a lot of that infrastructure and we need in this country you know rebuilding our ports a lot of that Michael I think can be could be done with private money it doesn't why what where does it say that the government has to pay for all this stuff\nAnd I think that's a great ... points for President Trump to
