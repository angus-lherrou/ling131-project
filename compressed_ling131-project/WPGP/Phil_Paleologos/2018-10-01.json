five find Seventeen\nSeventy six I Am a deeply encouraged I'm deeply encouraged not only because the Senate Judiciary committee made the right vote but because the way they did it and by the way hats off here to Senator Jeff flake\nWho actually helped this process and normally I enormously he has now been joined by Senator Lisa Murkowski another vote that hadn't committed yet which way she was voting\nBut she has joined Senator Flake as has Joe Manchin of West Virginia one of the other the one of the only two Democrats who have not come out against judge Kavanaugh so far they are all gotten together\nTo request and it will be up to or the majority leader and the president what happens here\nTo request that the vote on the final confirmation of Brett Kavanaugh be put off from I Believe they were talking about voting on Tuesday most recently\nThat it'd be put off for a week it would be the vote would actually occur next friday I imagine\nBut there will be some agreement announced on that in this it seems to me is an encouraging development as Lindsey Graham said when he was coming out and he said he's never felt better and more confident\nAbout judge Kavanaugh winning the confirmation he deserves a look there's one other thing that is encouraged me greatly\nA President Trump doesn't always handle these situations perfect like [laughter] can we agree on that I mean even people who who deeply deeply admire President Trump and love what he has done for our country and I love some of what he has done for our country\nOr even for those people the president are often becomes very personal and bitter and polarizing\nI I have never seen a Trump responds to a major challenge that has been as good as this this is just about pitch perfect president was sitting down this is less than an hour ago it's um what about twenty minutes or something I was very recent\nPresident Trump was sitting down for a little bit of a press opportunity with the president of chili who was here on very high level a kind of meetings and she'll a is a crucial ally of the United states in this country and some very very well in recent years has been sort of the opposite of left wing Brazil\nIn any event a President Trump was sitting down with President if she lay and of course he was asked about this latest development and the idea of a post moment of the final vote and the fact that the nomination of judge Kavanaugh has cleared the Judiciary Committee will be going to the floor of the full\nSenate and listen to how carefully and respectfully and constructively the president of the United states spoke listen\nWell I'm going to let the Senate handle that film at our decisions and Joe Verde professional [noise] uh I'm just a little bit about it because I've been with the president of Julie we're\nTalking about some very important subjects but uh [noise] I'm sure it will all be very good I I guess the vote was a positive vote for this seems to be a delay I'll learn more about it as the day goes on and I just heard about it because we were together\nOkay and I'm President Trump went on he was asked about Christine Blasey Ford because he hasn't really responded to her testimony and here he responds\nPerfectly\nVoter testimony is very compelling and she looks like a very vital woman [noise] very vital woman\nAnd I thought that [noise] threats testimony likewise was [noise] really\nThat I haven't seen before it was incredible it was an incredible moment I think in the history of our country [noise] but certainly she was a a\nIt [noise] she was [noise] very good in many respects and I think that [noise]\nI I don't know if this was going to continue one word or are we going to get a vote but again I'm I'm here so I'm not out there watching as I get the great respect although maybe we'll do watch together\nIt will work out very well for the country I just wanted to work out well for the country if that happens I'm\nAnd and this by the way was one of the encouraging things today I mean some of the the Democrats on the Judiciary Committee are beyond foolish their robes they're knaves they're losers um they they really have lost any\nLittle vestiges of respect that I might have held for them let me name names Mazie Hirono\nWho has won our poll we put up a poll as to who was most insufferable\nOr who should be voted off the island and I guess Mazie Hirono being from the island of Oahu a sort of one that uh that whole\nUm and then the other candidates for the most insufferable a Democrat so there are a bunch of them were of course camel Harris of California a super silly is an arrogant and vicious uh also Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut or another sanctimonious jerk\nAnd uh and then of course Spartacus who [laughter] is in his own world of a technicolor glory\nBut in the midst of all that I'm a couple of senators and let me name some names on the other side on the Democratic side it's least sounded partially reasonable any clothes from Minnesota\nUh Chris Coons of of Delaware and it was Chris Coons and\nThis is what happened apparently they were getting ready to vote they're supposed to vote or ten thirty\nBut Jeff Flake had gone out with Chris Coons is a friend of his and he met with other Democrats and they were all talking patently Jeff Flake would already announced that yes he was voting to confirmed judge Kavanaugh any still planning to vote confirmed judge Kavanaugh was saying look\nYou guys keep coming back to this FBI investigation how long would you need to delay how long would you need to delay at least drop that things say okay now this has been investigated\nProperly they said one week now some of them will hold to it but some of them will and that appears to be\nWhat we're working toward we'll see what Mitch McConnell the majority leader says I imagine that we will we will get out um\nWe we will get some some answers on this coming up the the by the way it's an tweeted about a on our Twitter account at mid vetted show\nWhich is part of the ... the Democratic faith and the FBI oh the FBI all figure out exactly what happened between two teenagers\nUh thirty six years ago and a house that no one remembers where that house was supposed to have been and it hasn't been a house that was owned by any of the people that Christine Blasey Ford is identified as being part of this group that the FBI can figure everything out\nOkay this is the same FBI that can't\nFigure out what happened involving very powerful and prominent people and Russia two years ago in the middle of an election I Can't figure that out\nStill looking still trying to work on it okay but they're supposed to be able to figure out in a week exactly what happened between two anonymous teenagers thirty six years ago under circumstances that nobody\nCan even begin to pin down good luck with that but if this is what it takes to calm down this this uh talk about rush to judgment\nIf I'm Brett Kavanaugh is confirmed for the Supreme Court of the United states a week from today it will be as President Trump said good for the country\nAnd this is honestly what we should be looking about Kimberly ... going to be joining us on the show next week\nOr had no standing column about the stakes there and volunteer\nAnd and she makes the case that\nPeople have talked about well this is about the future of the Supreme Court it's about the future of the Republican Party yes yes yes all of that is true but it's also about the future of business relationships that private relationships in the United states why\nHere is the point that she makes um [noise] she she says that to right now a vote against Brett Kavanaugh is a vote for Michael ... no senator\nCan hide from this reality there is no muddy middle you remember Michael ... he's the scandal monger who stormy Daniels' lawyer and brought forward the most ... utterly unsupported charges against Brett Kavanaugh\nWhat she is talking about is this is that if this good man with a lifetime of service can have all that ... to buy one unsubstantiated\nCharge about behavior as a teenager\nWhich corporate head which owner of a\nTire store or of a hardware store which American of any gender of any race of an economic circumstance can be free from being totally destroyed by one unsubstantiated plane\nThat's what's at stake here and it's a big big issue do you disagree with that you can give us a call one eight hundred nine five five Seventeen Seventy six\nLimited is go to the current allegations that have been said\nOkay I'm In by the way I'm breaking news from Fox News Senator John Kennedy of Louisiana strong Republican strong supporter of a judge Kavanaugh as he should be in my opinion a says we've reached an agreement on how to proceed with Kavanaugh we've reached in a court\nNow how many Democrats that accord a includes you can't be sure but I Am very confident that this is good and it's a let us go to your calls and to mark in Houston mark you're on the Michael event show\n... Becker McCall sure um I\nLike your show and I respect your opinion but I have to disagree with you about this post ... because it's been my ... my little I mean I'm not real smart about politics but I Do a pretty observer\n... years and I watch these Democrats and I think if you give them an ... type two miles every time\nThey can try they can try but they won't be able to be close again with the buy in here from the votes that Mitch McConnell needs a flake Murkowski Holland's\nUm and maybe mansion\nOr they they simply won't be able to take more in other words and Chris Coons of Delaware was was speaking about this I think they get it that that this will not be delayed till after the election it will not be delayed further than next week\nAnd if that is the price for getting Brett Kavanaugh\nConfirmed I think you mark would it would agree that that is is probably a price worth paying and and the reason I said we've worth paying because look a number of people have made this point I think it's absolutely true if Brett Kavanaugh's defeated\nIf he is not confirmed for the center of the United states gets only forty nine votes he needs to get fifty to win in other words if he doesn't get Jeff Flake and Susan Collins Lisa Murkowski to vote along with them\nYou lose one of those people can't lose more than one\nAnd if that happened and he was defeated the confirmation was defeated\nIt would be a disaster for the Republicans coming up in November because people be so ticked off and so disappointed on our side the Trump base it wouldn't come out and vote we lose the Senate as well as in the house we cannot afford for that to happen or we will be right back with more\nUh Dianne Feinstein what is she up to and the worst of the Democrats and the Democratic propaganda coming up on a minute [noise]\n\nThe one thing I loved about working with him we got to pray with our patients and I could do that without feeling like I was going to get in trouble\nAt the medicine jumps in Oakland hills nurse practitioner Joyce kid continues the legacy of pharmacists mentor and friend Joe DiMaggio\nAnd many people you cannot cure them or make them truly get well if they had something down deep that they haven't ever address stress affects your whole body like when I get fast I have between my shoulder blades my muscles get tight some people it's TI some people can be a rash some people their immune system is down to address that too but you have\nTo address the root cause ... for them to truly one of the things I'm very humbled by is that many of the people that Joe and I saw the gather there are still coming to see me and I just really appreciate that and I'm going to try to have the same empathy and love and carrying any\nI just love is my dream job is what I've always wanted to do every day is different because not everybody the same cold for a\nConsultation today eight eight eight eight to five Ninety five Ninety five the\nAverage person considers estate planning just for the wealthy attorney Michel ... the host of counties law on is the planning for the everyday person has a lot that goes into it people take more time picking our\nCar they're going to buy where they're going to go to dinner as opposed to what happened\nTo my children the state will dictate who get why if you don't indicate to is to recede yourself a money passing we want to make sure we can land appropriately so that they get the best of both worlds they continue to receive the benefits and they get the inherent in the other thing you have to think about is\nWe tried to be proactive in the approach that we minimize any type of tax consequence when somebody dies depending on the value of the state taxes range anywhere from four and a half\nTo forty percent so we tried to make sure that the beneficiary ruler Steve as much as they legally are able to\nHear more on countries will on Sunday Morning at eight thirty here on the answer for immediate help visit county law P.
