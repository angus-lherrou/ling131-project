addition to the Mike Gallagher show you know we've seen two days now back to back\nWhere two U.S senators\nWho have been some times frustrating leave out of touch with the rest of the caucus\nHave been incredibly impressive Senator Lindsey Graham yesterday emerged as one of the most powerful examples of what's wrong with today's Democratic Party that I've ever heard in my life\nBecause what all the smoke clears and after Brett Kavanaugh presumably gets confirmed\nThe world will have to to to look at what the Democrats did to Christine Blasey Ford it'd be trained her confidence and leaking her story\nIn shooting on her explosive allegation for weeks and weeks hoping to derail Kavanaugh's confirmation in the eleventh hour\nAnd Senator Lindsey Graham it was if he had had enough and I don't know that I've ever seen a more angry\nMonologue or soliloquy from United States senator this is cutting number two\nHere Senator Graham yesterday on the floor of the Senate unleashing on his Democratic colleagues and what they have put judge Brett Kavanaugh through what they put Christine Blasey Ford through and what they put America through\nThat you may have they're dying find than on August twentieth I could meet with center find now that her staff had already recommended a lawyer said Dr Ford I did not know that is you know her and her staff had this elegant allegations for over twenty days\nI could not know that at the time if you wanted to ask the eye investigation you've got to come to us what you want to do is destroyed this guy's life all said oh I Hope you win at twenty twenty you said that not me you've got nothing to apologize for\nWhen you see some of them aren't cake and tell them that Lindsey had O L sat voted for the\nBallot never do that and what you've done it this guy this is an atoll\nSet fat then in politics and if you really wanted to know the truth he sure as hell what they've done what you've done to this guy are you a gang or a test\nNo\n\nWow Senator Lindsey Graham yesterday\nI think exemplify the rage that the discussed the frustration that millions and millions of Americans have and as powerful as the testimony was yesterday from the two principals involved Christine Blasey Ford and judge Brett Kavanaugh\nLindsey Graham\nQuite likely sealed the deal Lindsey Graham reminded all of us of how ... believe part is in this battle has been and and I think more importantly\nHas demonstrated the way sexual assault is weaponized is\nIs used as a as a as a as a tool to try to obtain your goal which was to stop a conservative from being confirmed to the United States Supreme court no matter what it took no matter what it took\nWhat the Democrats did was a disgrace to this woman from Palo Alto California it was a\nDisgrace to judge Kavanaugh it was just as it was a disgrace to the Judiciary Committee which obviously bent over backwards to try to do everything to be respectful and fair they they had this former sex crimes prosecutor\nWho incidentally met with uh all the Republicans last night in a overnight meeting and inform them as a prosecutor it would be impossible to bring any criminal charges against Brett Kavanaugh based on her testimony and the lack of cooperation there was no cooperation\nAnd what's frustrating to everybody as we all know in this ugly shortage chapter of America's story\nWe'll never know what happened thirty six years ago but without corroboration to derail the nomination and to ruin a man's life\nThat doesn't fly in America welcome in we're in the uh the the studios of what America news network in San Diego we had a tremendous movie screening last night for the for feel a makeover near as powerful film gods now the story of a corporate guys now\nThe uh the notorious
