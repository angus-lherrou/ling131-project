Dr Sebastian Gorka last night Kaylee Makin any from the RMC to get different perspectives but we're all sort of rowing in the same direction we know\nWe know where the country is today and where we are heading\nAs long as the voters continue to keep employed the Republicans in control of the house in the sense that all all roads lead to November the six\nAnd we've got some real extra central threats going on we got thousands of migrants headed for the U.S Mexico border from Honduras from Guatemala wonder what's gonna happen and isn't it fascinating the Democrats thinks that somehow this is their political moment somehow they think it's to their advantage\nTo thousands of people are doubling down against a president who has vowed to close the border this is as far as many of us are concerned a threatened invasion of the United states in the house you describe it\nThousands of people saying we're going to illegally cross your border and and and come into the United states whether you like it or not\nNot only with the American people not stand for\nPresident won't either and the ones who are out of touch the ones who are going to lose on this issue or the Democrats the crazy Democrats as President Trump called them last night and another one of his political rallies you had to stop and mental Montana more on that in just a moment\nIt's important for me to listen to smart voices and I tried to do that all the time when you call me and one eight hundred six five five Mike I listened carefully I think I Know my audience better than just about any radio host in America\nI Believe I was one of the few radio host nationally who saw the need and heard people say we don't want another politician in the White House we got to try something else I unwavering\nHugh Hewitt by the way has this real weird pension he's got a strange sense of humor he likes to tell a crowd\nOh here's my Gallagher ladies and gentlemen he's been a never Trump or from day one and of course I've got to try to correct him and everybody laughed but I'm always afraid that in a room full of six hundred people fifty or more thinks he's telling the truth\n[laughter] so I always have to correct you know you you're the one who actually wavered on President Trump in the beginning you're the one who had to come along you're the one we had to win over\nAnd for some they still have and what we haven't won them over rather they still haven't seen the light they still haven't recognize the extraordinary accomplishments of the first twenty months got the two great pieces I have in front of me one by Fred Barnes over Weekly Standard and the other by John Dempsey\nAbout how Trump has freed the Republican Party from the media I Want to start with a few I Want to start with a Fred Barnes piece over some facts because I like to argue with knowledge I Want to make sure that his you vote as you encourage your neighbors to vote as you get ready to go to the polls\nDon't believe the lie that somehow broke rock Obama\nSets the groundwork for this tremendous economy we're enjoying right now Fred Barnes says in his column ... is a must read we're going to posted it Mike online dot com if you want to read it read Barnes rights but rock Obama is a proud men\nAnd it was somewhat in Deering when he stoop to claim he had created the ground on which Trump's economy was growing the media sided with Obama no surprise\nTrump counter punch no surprise there either if the Democrats that won the election of twenty sixteen Trump said GDP which was about one percent and going down would have been minus four percent instead of up four point two percent Trump tweeted\nHe's referring before point two percent he's referring to the growth rate for the second quarter of twenty Eighteen\nI opened up our beautiful economic engine was regulation in tax cuts are system was choking and would have been made worse still plenty to do read Barnes writes the Weekly Standard Donald Trump is correct\nAbout the condition of the economy and late twenties sixteen it was weakening the shift in economic policy to the right change the direction of gross from down to up\nThat's what tax cuts deliver\nAnd tax hikes do not here's a Fred Barnes writes about Obama and this lie that Obama is the reason for today's economy and again it spread puts it Obama's proud man\nIt's kind of in Deering that he had such a head makes such a silly claim here are some facts of Obama's successor Trump and the Republican Congress reverse Obama's policies\nThe fact is Obama had to struggle so hard to spur the economy and allow it to grow more than two percent a year that was the high watermark for Brock a bomb in the last quarter of Obama's presidency growth pet slipped to one point five percent\nIt's obvious what Obama's problem was he had the wrong policies will watch of wrong policies from the day Trump was elected\nWe've had a more real best robust economy\nNearly four million jobs have been added four million jobs unemployment is dip to the lowest point in nearly a half century Fred Barnes says let's compare what Obama did with Trump\nWhat he's doing Obama raised taxes Trump cut that Obama was a regulatory sell it Trump is passionate about deregulation Obama's clean Power Plan killed the coal industry Trump is reviving\nObama downgraded the role of entrepreneurs and free markets in boosting the economy and a lot of the wonderful things government does Obama's biggest biggest breakthrough as we know\nWas the Affordable CARE Act a big step toward a single payer government run health care system Trump got rid of the individual mandate the force everyone to buy expensive insurance or be fined a big step toward a return to free markets in health care\nBill the entire Obama economic agenda was systematically reverse says economics writer Stephen Moore\nHis new book Trump ... we've got to get Stephen Moore and Arthur Laffer last on the show one of these days presidents loved to tell their achievements in Trump's case\nA White House report issued recently status administration had produced two hundred and eighty nine accomplishments in twenty months we all know Trump exaggerates and brags Fred Barnes rights but many of the economic gains were impressive\nEspecially the fact that job openings out numbered job seekers for the first time on record being a liberal himself Obama relied on liberal economists they let him astray\nAs they did president John Kennedy in the Nineteen sixties they favored higher taxes to they favored increased spending\nThose policies created an economic downturn but Kennedy was smarter than Obama\nSays Fred he finally turned to his Republican treasury secretary she Douglas dealer who recommended tax cuts JFK grabbed onto them and the result was an economic boom the roaring sixties rankings advisors persuaded him the tax cuts championed by Jack Kemp\nWould do far more for the economy than spending cuts\nThey even use JFK's as an example the sweeping tax cuts of Nineteen eighty one brought about\nYears of strong growth notice the Reagan Revolution Trump didn't need to be convinced obviously he and Republicans led by Paul Ryan believed it was time for deep cuts in the corporate tax rate the Obamas school of economists\nAnd commentators embarrassed by anemic results argued that economic growth was stuck perhaps permanently at two percent annually\nThat met Obama was doing the best any president could do certainly far better the Trump would have done right\nAll kinds of dire predictions Washington Post said Trump could destroy the world economy Jason firemen chairman of Obama's council of economic advisors said Trump's budget assumes three percent annual growth that is extremely unlikely\nWas yeah I mean really now all this thing yeah yeah I I don't I think one of the different time the law I really did okay this is a different time where people are fed up I I don't ... I don't hear a lot of people having a great amount of sympathy for thousands of people marching towards the United states\nIt feels like an invasion even if there are children along with men and women
