for a consultation today eight eight eight eight six five Ninety five Ninety five\nIs the John Walsh show on a um twelve fifty the answer [noise]\nTalking to Jon solving these executive producer of the movie that comes out a week from friday called does now the trial America's\nBiggest serial killer it's about a doctor in Philadelphia is now serving life term for murder and he was an abortion doctor so how do you detect this guy killing babies who were born alive ... how are you able to do that in the movie it's a pretty gruesome thing\n... from the subject matter it is but I Want to make sure you don't it's not a graphic looks at all very careful on the subject matter was difficult\nOh you don't feel anything on screen however at the same time audience of total is done in the ... the job of keeping the tension in the drama there without showing aids in Africa on screen so there's a lot you can do with either the mind is just you know for all we can do\nSo much out of her way not to show anything including the\nCrime scene photos of the children so again of audience are concerned with all the might see something that's graphic they won't it's like an episode of like law and order and I asked you know uh you can watch those shows which ... which are very popular you'd be able to see dogs now\nAnd I saw that one of the stars of the movie uh was pro choice when she signed up and she's now pro life who what character does she play in the movie\nYeah her name is Donna Edwards a dominant was a place that he could win in the film which has caused a couple of different nurses there in the clinic but\nShe's kind of a ... one of the main character she's really the conscience of the film a she starts off the whole film and see it\nShe the first one you see on screen and uh her testimony later on in the court cases very instrumental in convicting gods now but ah she told us when we're screening in Dallas about her own personal journey how she moved from being pro choice to pro life going through this\nThrough this process of making the film and this for us with something that was happening on set quite a bit interested discussion where people were at\nHow what were the laws in various states you know people were amazed in some states like New Jersey it's still abortion on demand um where in other states you know a lot of people think it's just twelve weeks like the ... case\nIt's not each state makes up their own laws and there are a number of states that\nHave very late term abortions still available or and and this is very problematic and this was the situation in Pennsylvania you up to twenty three weeks in Pennsylvania\nI'm In ... doing twenty three and a half and that's what kind of nailed them in one sense is writing that down so you know this is something that was is very concerning is that you know you have this still going on at multiple states\nAnd I'm Tom Ridge was also um I I I got the feeling from some of the things I've read about the movie that he doesn't come out too well and that's what's interesting is he's a Republican and was a Republican governor at the time but he's also a pro choice\n[noise] correct and you know we have a direct line that come from one of those folks for health and Human Services there and um Portland of health in Pennsylvania and that orders were coming down directly from governor which is office but you know abortion clinics where not to be affected\nAnd they didn't want to put you know a woman's right to choose in in jeopardy you're\nA over this even though\nIn Philadelphia a nail salon has to be inspected once a year again that's a nail salon for pedicures and managers and this uh this clinic abortion political mountain investigated for over Seventeen years\nNow how many I Know this was part of the movie I don't think it was um but how many abortion clinics out there are like that that have never been inspected\nThat's a great question um you know I I Know of of cases where you know things are happening in other states like I was made aware of a situation\nWhere there was a clinic that have Dr flying in and find out how many ... which is at a local hospital so wrong you can't just bring a woman over there um they're operating without a medical license um and yet\nThe the for the department of health and Human Services is not inspecting um or shutting down this clinic and that's just one example there are hurting like five different examples of what's going on around the country\nNow what kind of a distribution were you able to get on this uh you know ... because of the subject matter is that going to be a problem getting in the ... the right number theaters\nWell it's been difficult I think that um it's been more difficult than I anticipated I mean that a little cold twenty six feet Obama's America that suits and uh you know we we started that often one theater and grew to two thousand\nUm we were planning to come out a little bit wider on this film\nYou know we're hoping to get around six hundred theaters which he gets a nationwide um but it's been difficult because we can fight in a every for every theater gets gets a story out because we think it's going to be told in the audience just leave the theater there just blown away by this voting\nThe message but everything about it\nWell how how old is a ... I mean who would reason would they give you for not wanting the movie I'm wanting to distribute the movie were or will for a theater not to want it what would be a obviously it's abortion but so what\nYeah I mean it's it's kind of a multifaceted situation I think one at the subject matter I think we're getting some resistance there I think too that it's kind of a bit of a crowded marketplace here in October so they want us to kind of her so um\nBut you know it's very strange to me we've had things can't so an off than we are supposed to be showing that the movie at the Hyatt\nIn Austin are the same day that Planned Parenthood was having their gala\nGot over a foreigner people registered for the I'm screaming to see it and the height of cancelled our screening we tried to buy advertising on NPR because they have a lot of true crime stories NPR would not allow say the word abortion doctor in relationship\nTo ... now they don't you can only say doctor or Philadelphia Dr destroyed them and we couldn't take cover up about what the government had done there so in this from the very beginning to where you know people have been trying to\nStart a business and and not let this kind of movie scene look at we understand we're walking into a charge political climate you know what Kavanaugh's confirmation coming about what a\nTrue to the heart of it as you mentioned at the top of the show and so there's a lot of people that are getting agendas here I've even had people emailed me and tell me the court people from corporate theater chains are telling the movie's rated R. which it's not it's rated PG Thirteen\nAnd then it's very violent and that's completely ally ... pilot at all gone out of our way to make this accessible\nTo folks and it's it's just not five hundred graphic at all\nSo are you hoping for some grass roots movement on this to like a maybe a groundswell especially among conservatives\nI think so I mean I I've seen this a couple of time movies I've been involved in a movie called expelled with guns drawn in which had a lot of support behind it\nUm you know I always joke that you know our marketing budget is the size of the adventures eight or ... or ... um but on a lot of these movies it's true you know and it is no exception here but got no you know you're\nCounting on the restaurant show up in care about this movie again once people see it the word of mouth on it's been tremendous I mean when you rate movies yes go you know how they see this movie is reading in the Ninety percent tile um which is a big deal in our business\nBecause that means that people will tell other friends about it though they'll pay for tickets for people to come see it we're seeing a lot of groups buyouts\nI'm across the country which is great so she churches and\nA pro life groups doing that so you know we are counting on the grass roots to get out there and see it and again people are concerned about the subject it's not it's not scary or gory anyway it's just a great old school thriller I'm In the sense that it just really keeps your attention and you know to harm trauma\nQuestionable about uh if you try to make claims today\nThe big question today is do we get to a vote before this week is up pushes this week it\nLet's go right depending on that so what is the latest on the timeframe we're taking your calls it a hundred and sixty four thirty one ten what is the latest on time for him\nYeah jazz still think we get to a time or to a vote this week leader McConnell took to the floor of the United states and it just a couple of hours ago and again promised an up or down vote or to the American people on this nominee\nI think there'll probably be closer ... night Jay and then votes on friday or Saturday is my guest but I Do think leader McConnell is serious about taking the vote and I you know let's let's say it straight the American people deserve to hear from the United states in in the United States Senate needs to take that vote up or down that's their job and and the constitution or we're\nGoing to take your calls and comments hundred sixty four thirty one tend to be watching the baseball players go get your comments in there as well as a way for you to do it one eight hundred sixty four thirty one ten or if you're on Facebook or on periscope putting your comments are social media team is monitoring that will be back with your calls at one eight hundred six eight four thirty one tent and just a moment\nLot going on the confirmation fight for judge red capital\nAre you ready for less than that [noise] anymore [noise] transitioning retirement might not be as easy as you think about the answers can bound you through the uncertainty joining every Saturday morning informal\nFinal till our strategy to handle the financial hurdle today's retirees get the answers you've been looking forward to retiring confidently that network financial our Saturdays I sat in time and twelve Fifteen ... [noise]\n\nSo let me read that ... one was judicial philosophy the normal things you're having a confirmation battle Harry that's the normal thing you have that took place here that was not successful in knocking him out as a nominee absolutely\nShowed judge Kavanaugh handled himself extremely well during that face he habits that are set up very well be talking about uh he was before the United States Senate for thirty two hours ... answering questions\nThere was a a follow up he answered Thirteen hundred written questions he met with each senator who was prepared to meet with him\nAnd so all of the senators if they were on us would agree that he is well qualified\nBut for his judicial philosophy and so then the Dems we're prepared to move into phase two okay and so\nA man and I think they're I think they're in space to still but they're also into pastry that's my exercise fully correct so that they have in their back pocket\nA phase three and possibly a face for\n... face to Andy was the allegations on sexual assault now the reports are right now that the FBI may well be done with the they're a background check today what does that mean to you what does it mean Colorado is what that means what now happen if it is in fact ...\nIs in fact it as soon as they have now taken all the leaves that they're going to take all the people that are going to end a choir of\nAll the questions that they're going to ask and they have ask those questions and they have committed them to writing in the form of a form of three oh two wrapped it up and already now by the end of today which is Wednesday ride to turn that over to the Senate to each of the senators\nOr who have the documents and then there's no doubt those are going to be leaked I don't have any doubt about that but the FBI should be concluded should have concluded\nA it's background to that space to sue assuming there is no credible cooperating evidence you you're in face to face the way we now are in the story though\n... with a way a prepared for it because they are prepared for they're not to be I mean if they if they want this fight or if they want to win this fight there to prepare for a test to move on in a different strategy brave already done that\nI'm their greatest hope will be subject to those reports say send messages over but it down let up right now it doesn't appear to be the case I mean there hasn't leaked\nNothing is leaf that indicates that well and here's what center Booker said 'cause that's what I think tells you that they that they are moving to pay three because they I don't think they think that the FBI reports are going to be productive for trying to knock out judge Kavanaugh here you go\nOff and mentally not whether he's innocent or guilty this is not a trial to fall from Italy has enough questions the rain that we should not move on to another candidate\nIn that long list put together by the Heritage Foundation and the federal society move on to another candidate because ultimately the Supreme Court is not an entitlement [noise]\nJust because he went to jail or prison in your class doesn't entitle you to the Supreme Court [noise]\nThis is a sacred institution\nAnd the people that should be on whether you disagree with their political or judicial philosophy at all the people who should be on the Supreme Court [noise]\nTo preserve the integrity of the court [noise] and be beyond reproach of easy to all parties and so\nThere you have phase one face too and then a knowledge would that we're in pastry fan I mean I and I know when it's pointing these phrases but I think it's true I think we are in a straight face Jews over but clearly we're I mean Cory Booker speaking for the Democratic base is saying we're in face story\nYou heard senator Booker admit essentially the scenario that you laid out Jay and look senator Booker was someone who is not going to vote for judge Kavanaugh he admits that to this day that his mind was made up of from the beginning he he says that he wanted to get more information from the hearings but you go through the judicial philosophy you go through the assault and I think that comment you just played from Senator Booker was essentially an admission that\nThey were not able to derail him from that day I actually I don't think there's something that can come out of this report on either of those first two pages that will keep judge Kavanaugh off the bench that's why they've shifted the target of but look Jordan alluded to this this is now a universe of three people in my mind is it Senator Flake senator Collins\nAnd center mccaskey he gets to those three votes he's going to be a justice if he doesn't Jay he won't be I we're going to go to the phones ruining what you have to say we\nDo want your comments on this one eight hundred sixty four thirty one tens of you're listening to us by radio give us a call it a hundred sixty four thirty one ten if you're following us on Facebook or Twitter or TV\nGet your comments and also that way in the comments sections on on Facebook or on periscope is where our social media teams looking at those we do want to hear from you let's go ahead and take a question coming in from Alan in in New York on line three Helen welcome to Jay Sekulow live ...\n... what's happening now if you have to think it was sixty and then I never seen this before I was wondering is there a way\nTo override this foolish is the Democratic party\nJudge Kavanaugh I\nKnow you got the role of cases where the constitution says the president nominates\nWhen the advice and consent of the Senate so you have both branches or two of the branches of government involved selecting what will be the third branch of government the dishes article one article to an article three all in play here but now if he did it mean procedurally than let's let's quickly review that procedurally what happens next\nSooner report the FBI reports are done today what do they do them tonight\nThe first thing they will do is what is called file cloture day it's just simply emotion from leader McConnell to start the end of the debate now there will be no vote at that stage there has to be a day in between according to rule twenty two so two days after culture is filed which would be friday if it's filed today they would take\nThe cloture vote which requires fifty votes in the United States Senate after that and Jay there will be thirty hours of what's called post closer debate and then there will be a final vote so ultimately he's got to clear those two votes likely on friday and Saturday boat that if if you vote threshold and Jay goes back to Jordan point about Merrick Garland I mean the constitution says the Senate can vote\nNot vote they can vote yes they can vote now a but ultimately it's there is to decide that votes on friday and Saturday\nWho thing happened to George I think uh I get it all comes down to how if the Republicans hold together or not I mean the I don't I don't think it comes down to any Democrats I'm On the actual votes so it's do Republicans hold together um I I Do believe they will put out statements\nUm clarifying not just say it was here and there but actual statements about how they vote 'em as it gets closer now that made me that they allow a vote on cloture but they they don't vote they don't vote for the nominee\nI'm Talking about Republicans here so it could be a twenty four hour period where um you could get passed cloture because there's there's some who believe that that's you should not a truck and allow a vote and still don't know because that's the that's passed the obstruction part but this\nIs again I think you're talking to three or four people right now probably just three you know I mean I think it's a Jeff Flake Lisa Murkowski Susan Collins I. N. N. lesser suddenly the airport that causes the nomination that'd be withdrawn\nWhat would that be any if there was an allegation in the report how would that come out of ... is what does this report look like\nThe report simply is a statement of the facts that the FBI is eliciting from witnesses that they've uh interviewed and they just said oh conclusions of no I said I talked to John Smith John Smith says I talk to Jane Doe she says this she says she says this she denies this she admits this\nWhatever and it's a two three page document depending on how long remember it's two agents there's always two agents who are going to be interviewing these a particular persons and then they're going to just factually ... if it's done right if it's done right and if it's the FBI that I Know and I remember\nThat's the way they're going to do it and they're going to turn it over and you draw your own conclusions from the fat\nSo if that's the case yeah and there's no cooperating evidence of the sexual assault outlines the question then is it most of the pace three which they're already at the judicial temperament issue\nI Do to make that clear the Democrats are said they don't like his personality they don't like how he handled uh the hearing uh they were never going to vote for him they were all no votes every scene\nOne that he spoke to in that hearing of the Judiciary Committee was a no vote on Brett Kavanaugh was already and announce no vote before he opened his mouth before he had to come back a\nAfter his judicial philosophy here he's into this personality here by his personal life here he's they were they were nose before all that right some didn't even me with\nA a Democrats or he only met with a sixty some odd senators because the many refused that big said that being said it is Republicans who will be responsible for his failure\nNow I'm not saying it's every Republican personally I'm saying it is Republican senators\nWho have the majority it it would be Jeff Flake and when it has been an essay what is he doing playing gays because he's retired so he's trying to make a name for himself before because I mean if you let alone now they know me either weekly\nLet's face it he goes Chris Coons gets in there for hours works on them and the Judiciary Committee he comes out he folds his hands he sits back and he says a vote on how to get advances but there's got to be an investigation so now as an investigator now there's an investigation\nNow he says he said we have to do we have that is their sound from Jeff like saying that part is an issue you know I Want to play that if we have let's go ahead and play it\nI was I was very troubled by the the tone of the of the remarks the interaction with the members was sharp and partisan and that concerns me and I tell myself to give a little leeway\nBecause of what he's been through\nPeople were alleging that he was guilty of rape people forget what they were asking Brett Kavanaugh than I mean I mean he attempted rape\nNo they were always is planning to move on and you know Jay and during that hearing I was\n... when you listen to what judge this she's with you when you listen to what Senator Flake said I mean he defended himself go ahead [noise]\nWell I just could say I was critical of Cory Booker Kamala Harris for running for president during that hearing I look I think that's what Jeff lakes doing you just went to New Hampshire so you know we can criticize a political noted on both sides and I think all three of them I think that's what they were doing type here's what we're doing we're here for another thirty minutes we're taking your calls one eight hundred sixty\nFour thirty one day and so again Russ as we come back we're one line open and there were lines are going to open up so when I get will do some calls even in the first segment coming back in the second half hour eight hundred and sixty four thirty one tend to be not getting the full broadcast

Center for law and justice Jay Sekulow\nSide so here we are in face I mean clearly phase three of the judicial confirmation\nProcess we are going to go right to their bones in a moment but let me just laid out very quickly for those just joining us phase one judicial philosophy that was the first hearing professor ... and said this I'm going to say it again in a short way a concise way he passed the judicial philosophy debt I even knew what he disagreed with\nHis law somebody absolutely I mean it was clear beyond question that's why the Democrats are so prepared to move quickly to face to face three\nYeah so face to was the sexual assault allegations and they were taken seriously and there was an FBI investigation or ... ... and ... and it was I ordered it now looks like it's being completed it may be even be done today let's quickly tell everybody what that's going to look like right now there is no leaks of any cooperating evidence\nThere isn't and that means it probably isn't any but we'll wait and we'll see what a what leaks there are the three oh two that does what happened but that that investigation simply was a further background investigation into the allegations made by these three women and perhaps others and it's a factual investigation made by\nAgents who are in the field to agents interview each person and come back with a factual statement of what they find that out at\nBase three which is where we are right now is the attack on judicial temperament Jordan that's where we are right now\nYeah and his personality I mean like his personality at the hearing um after he's been accused of right now for ... he wouldn't have even Russian on judicial philosophy this was his personality after he gets accused of attempted rape\nAnd are these allegations no cooperation and these Republican senators agreed to allow a doctor for to come testify even\nThough no one will will agree that uh even\nAcknowledge their stories any bit of truth like even a bit of truth to it or who is actually a president at the time or even someone who was a not even president but uh but around her at that time period um and yet they allowed this to happen he he likes them have it yep I'm\nAs usual these senators show they're very good at giving speeches they they're not prepared most are not prepared for responses\nThey don't like being a they don't like toughness or they love to act tough an act right and they're nasty people they're nasty yeah um I think what President Trump says that\nAh it it has a it's a real tone because it means something different to be\nA a mean are kind of obnoxious and nasty yeah I think a good ... to ... to put that up for like\nA Feinstein or LA he yeah they both have this tone that doesn't sound so obnoxious but they are meeting there at the end they are nasty yeah every question is uh is is is so ... about the person uh recently Durbin I think he kind of resolve those states he's more of a tough guy them up but\nHow tough are they where they get someone to go back at them they get all\nThese these are blue state senator ... they don't ever have real opposition to the\nAlright so thin where are we\nOn the timeframe and then we're going to we will get calls right after the break but where we on the timeframe exactly what was what do we expect to happen I got word that there can be a vote Saturday\nI mean I\nI think that's correct yeah I mean I think they're waiting for the FBI to turn over their report those three oh to\nGet Letterman happens today no cooperating evidence what happens\nI Believe leader McConnell will file cloture tonight which would set a vote cloture vote on friday probably late in the day and then a final vote on Saturday afternoon J I think that's the only thing they're waiting for\nI I don't think they know whether or not they have the votes but I think they are committed to study that clock in motion as soon as they have that a report from the FBI and that would be a cloture vote on friday and a final vote on Saturday\nSo it's a yeah you're on a on Saturday in your view [noise]\nThat's right and I think it's important to point out what joined it earlier that did that in most cases if you clear cloture vote you're fine on final I think because of the dynamics here I don't think that's true I think both of those votes or a hurdle what do you think any\nYeah I think as soon as right both of the boats are but I think it's going to clear closure and if he loses it's going to be ... Republicans that did it too and not the Democratic\nYet do I I think it's a subset fear with Democrats will just be bonus votes if they come on board [noise] they're not going to be this way here it is just like Susan Collins and Lisa Murkowski if there's a chance for parents having all that means he got passed this that the FBI Terry [noise]\nSo here's what they're telling you if in fact the Republican stick together and and cabinet is goes over fifty then you may see high camp and mentioned join for their own political purposes to keep their seat\nIf he is short by a boat or to do not expect them as well Jordan said do not expect them to put the Republican nominee over the top\nNo absolutely not I I just I I Do secret a position where any Democrats are going to do Republicans favorite in fact that makes it the no vote easier for um a Joe mansion and I like that to me out of the numbers look in West Virginia for mentioned right now he says oh nearly a nine point lead so again unless\nHe would like to I think vote yes if\nThe Republicans are already there that makes his election a reelection easier if you vote for Brett Kavanaugh but if the if there's a reason if there he will not I don't he will not be the vote for them it's just you're not going to a that would be too much for Democrats\n... let's say look at the end when talking about the Senate for a moment and then we'll let let's say we'll take all the calls are so everybody on the old stay on the line here but the than looking at the Senate seats that are that could switch Republican where do you see right now\nOr the the one that's most likely to switch to Republican is Heidi Heitkamp see that's why she's talked about so much in this process she's down in Florida I think he is he likely switches well I'd put him actually more likely than ah than Joe Manchin a J I think the mansion has a fairly decent lead it but I don't want to\nBuild on it as a ... chance of voting for this now know that that is correct he's already said he's in now right I mean such a thing where it down to just a handful of Republicans that really matter here are kind of let the ... the Democrats matter the sense of their influencing these\nRepublicans that's why the Democrats matter is it there influencing these three Republicans were trying to\nIf I were gonna take it less likely broadcast coming up you know what that means we're take all your phone call so if you want to get a call in one eight hundred and sixty four thirty with the lender jam right now may open up a couple on during the break here so eight hundred sixty four thirty one ten if you're on Facebook and parents couple of good way to get your comments and\nIs it do it right or post them and our social media seem looking at those right now we've got a couple that we're gonna take we come back from the break a Mitch McConnell says he's going to make this is a ... a [noise]\nVery aggressively he's saying that some play this when we come back from the break it's a very very strong sound bite them I think the vote is going to happen I we're taking your calls from one eight hundred and sixty four thirty one and don't bring it also means for it to work at the ACL Jay they seal jaded outlook and follow us on Twitter I've got a Twitter he joined us and the ACL Jay back one more and more [noise]\nThe IRS is claiming they have

are these protesters and all this impact their impacting center of like here's what he said\nI don't care how many members like\nHow many people they harass her at all I Want to make one thing perfectly clear where well a lot ... they have all\nThis is all part of the organizers however\nThat ally\nAnd then ...\nIncluding those of us who may hold and that's the way\nSo how do you listen to that Jordan what does it tell you\nI think that if you listen to that ... and you say that there there's just as much pressure on the other side\nI'm the only outlier I see right now is there yeah I mean we nothing is and then lead to indicate this but we don't know that would be that gives Jeff Flake enough to tell you know if if there's something that is it gives definitely going to tell us we kind of listen pressure value on ... I'm not doing it\nHere's why and none of those of judicial temperament though because there's something in the FBI three oh two\nAnd if there was we didn't know about it by now I can tell you that\nYou think so yeah and I always go out and grab these calls was he as we can do you have a good a camera and Utah on line one camera welcome to Jay say alive\n... yep five costs so all of a role in our own senators\nCan you watch any of that ... Feinstein\nTalking about for the league of the letter yes I think Tom Cotton said something didn't eat than\nDid in ... and Lindsey Graham did as well live here here's why\nA little leery on that Jay ... we know where the league came from it came from either cinder dime Dianne Feinstein or her staff so I'm not real sure what an investigation help us we know it was them\nYeah and I think that's what we're doing the focus is going to be spread Kevin to get on the Supreme Court enough for life or not I mean and then by the way if not we go through this process yet again\nI'm ... even more politically tumultuous time period I think if in fact the report comes back make that there's no nothing and then a thrill to Sandy if there is no credible cooperative evidence I think he gets confirmed barely gets confirmed\nBlow I mean he should because that's what these three Republicans have said they're waiting to see that's what they're waiting to see but I I can tell you this don't count on Jeff's legs but\nI think that's right well that means you got to have the other two you gotta have the other two lines go ahead and are going to look I'll get back to the phones were going to a gym in Washington state live three Jim ... Jim\nShe guy's dream job all energy sensor eighties aimed at great remember a little trouble hearing you should do you want to be a you're a speaker phone going I'm not I had a job offer good\nOkay um you know bottom line I guess I'm probably going to vote but if if uh uh just judge Kavanaugh does not get concerned um it just kind of goes to Jordan's point that\nHe hasn't said this I'm going to say this but so is that the Republicans as the majority of spineless I mean what's the point of voting and Republicans is again\nAnother church I get I get the feeling what we've been kind of getting rid of those Republican Jeff Flake is on the way out\nSo I think there's a good there's actually a case you could make gym to get out there and vote because the Jeff Flake types or on the way out\nThe the uh a coworker who was there on this issue but those types of decided not to not to be there still so I'm I'm not going to say spineless wanted to say the more moderate wing has been leaving so this is the time to fill those those seats so that's what I remember we're not talking about most of the Republicans\nWere talking about a handful one who is who we could replace actually potentially with a much more conservative person there are some you know I think this right here we think\nWell I think Jordan is correct I think most Republicans have been extremely strong with respect to this particular nominee we're only talking about three Republicans at the most\nUm and I think Jordan is correct in suggesting or forecasting that many of those individuals are on the way out or will soon be on but\nWhen I Will I Will say that I agree if there is though Andy in the in the three of two reports if there were to be cooperative evidence of one of the allegations that would also be a game changer I think\nWell I mean obviously that would be a problem for the three who are on the fence and it may cause others as well but I think we if there was you know we wouldn't know it by now\nYou know he I think if there is if there is anything there it's just a it's a withdrawing nomination vote on that if there's something on the list Robert calling Florida admit it but that one of the band but you expend McConnell says do you think that culture and we get the if the FBI reporting comes back in sometime today even closer to night where I think\nThere will be filed tonight though would be friday yes yeah look if people want to look at C SPAN to look and see if the leader McConnell goes down to the floor you'll have your answer then\nI was going to take another call All right back to ... uh we go let's go to Robert in Fort online to Robert Robert\nHi two quick questions wander the FBI or or ... or ... and a elite any different as far as the oil is called\nThe order will make any difference that sees you will now technically this is I Would work when I say we go to the president but it's an executive branch function\nSo the FBI report would go to the executive branch but then it would be part of this process uh turned over to the legislative branch which would be the the Senate so Judiciary Committee and I think that's how I Would go here I think I don't think the president and could you get a preview I have no idea they were born to the president\nSo judges are articles free righteous primarily and then we have the executive branch article to write and then Congress exercises an article one role and it's time for the Senate\nOr to exercise its advise and consent role expeditiously if the uh FBI report is simply not clear you\n\nSon go\nRecall eight nine seven one S.
