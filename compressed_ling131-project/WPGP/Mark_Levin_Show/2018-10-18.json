yet now I Want to play for you a little clip of the guy we have coming up tomorrow at five Fifteen you may be familiar with um sheriff David Clarke\nPresident Obama and I say this I'm with no hyperbole intended is the most anti cup president I've ever seen in my thirty eight years of police he does nothing but sit up there and just tear the American police officer down find fault with us you know I noticed that he was pointing his finger\nSticking actually a finger in the rye I should say a white folks talking about their buys buys things and and things like that he he he's real quick to talk about uh how white folks are racist but it didn't acknowledge the situation in Dallas where you had a black racist\nHe doesn't acknowledge people or organizations like the black ... Black Panther party a racist organization the nation of Islam a racist organization but it's always the white man's fault you know and the Americans getting tired of this rhetoric there really aren't and every time he opens his mouth and just as more fuel to the fire\nThat that is exactly what the United States government is engaged in at the same time gay and you know I've had these conversations as it relates to turkey in this region of the world it is absolutely critical for the United states to have strong allies you have to have to engage enemies like Iran and ISIS and you have to have it\nUp for the defense of your strong allies like Israel in this situation with Saudi Arabia Jay you have to get to the bottom of it but at the same time when you do have allies in the region enter engaging with you in critical measures you have to take that into effect you I'm Glad we have a team like we have in place to handle that delicate\nBalance look I mean I I've said this before when it comes to the middle east or you have to think nine dimensional a we have a lot of expertise in the area because we worked in this area of the world there's a lot at play here and a lot at stake we're going to break all of this down for you give your analysis went also take your calls one eight hundred sixty four thirty one ten your reaction to this story [noise]\nI Would you think the United

you have heard a Jamal could show the Washington Post columnist and critic of the Saudi Government living in self imposed exile looks like\nWhen he went to the Saudi Arabian constantly in Istanbul, Turkey and we just dealt with turkey on the Bronx of matter so and this is all fresh for us to pay to document even need for upcoming wedding he did not leave that conflict\nAnd the reports are that he was killed inside that constantly\nThat's raised a whole host of issues we did that Bruce on Facebook say why are we involved with this at all he was a Saudi national not a U.S citizen\nWell let me tell you why because Saudi Arabia is a critical ally of the United states by the way that does not excuse is ...\nBut my palm pale the secretary of state has said that they give it a few days for the Saudis to investigate there's going to have to be action taken here on some level or either internally or I'm sure the ... world opinion years going to be very very bad for the Saudis\nBut let me give me the relationship of the United states with Saudi Arabia we have full diplomatic relations with Saudi Arabia in Nineteen thirty three\nAnd that is when oil exploration began in the kingdom 'em by a and by the way I talk about some of this actually in our book on um a Syria\nUm we we have the uh unholy alliance but because it's got to Syria you know Iran Russia thing and and and some of that's discussed in there about the oil exploration that was going on at the time\nSince and the United states and Saudi Arabia and maintain a baseline of economic and security cooperation\nThat is kept up the relationship pretty strong both countries have been an ally in opposition to communism in support of stable oil prices and instability in western economies where the Saudis have invested both countries were also allies against the Soviets in Afghanistan in the Nineteen eighties\nNow the Israelis have a a diplomatic absorb relationship with\nThe Saudis which is was that would have been on think about five or ten years ago but they do\n'em both countries have said been allied into variety of issues in the U.S Saudi Arabia were also allies in the explosion of Iraq from Kuwait in Nineteen Ninety One that was the Gulf War than us defended Saudi Arabia against the threat from Saddam Hussein more recently there's been a robust defense cooperation between\nThe United states and Saudi Arabia including arms sales or Saudi Arabia is the U.S largest foreign military sales customer President Trump authorize a one hundred and ten billion dollar\nDeal and twenty Seventeen I'm so very very significant bear that deal a included signed documents with letters adventures intent but it's not actually a contract at this point to some people have been saying that this was already done it's not the U.S had a long physical presents an advisor military role in Saudi Arabia we train Saudi pilots\nSo you've got all of this cooperation an increase even more so a when ISIS situation came up Saudi Arabia is a tried to balance between his role as the leader in the Arab world\nAnd strong ties to the United states that allows us to get answers to what happened here\nSo that's part of what has to happen then what action is taken as a separate issue and you've got to balance the entire geopolitical situation and balance at the same time it's just not easy\nBalance the interest in the region but also you got to get you know the idea that in the bars what would be complicit in doing something like this has to raise serious serious concerns give me I Know Senator Graham and others have been very strong on this already banned I Want to go to our director of governmental affairs or let let's talk about that\nYeah the United States Senate I think probably the most vocal on this has been Senator Lindsey Graham from South Carolina Jay historically a Senator Graham has really put a lot of value in the alliance with Saudi Arabia for many of the reasons that you just describe but\nI Would sort of boil it down to three reasons one\nOther one of the key players in limiting the reach of Iran\nOr to Jay they've uh they're going to be a key base for the United states to push back against ISIS and other radical forces that emerge in the region and then three\nUh you've got to have places in the region where you can provide support for for our allies like Israel and Saudi Arabia is probably the most important player in the region in that regard so that's why historically people like Senator Graham had been in favor of this alliance Jay ... he is very concerned about what just happened\nA which markets Yogi and he has said\nThat he is the facts bear out in the way that he thinks there are pointing to the United States Senate will act of very strongly including sanctions now\nAgain I think if the United States Senate is going to do that Jay they need to do it based on a set of facts and so I think what you'll hear from Senator Graham today is that he's in favor of secretary Pompeo statement of making sure that the United states draws its own conclusions ... you can't take the word of the players in this region at face value the United states to look at the facts\nMake its own assessment and come to its own conclusion but it if it's a if it's a poor conclusion J I think Lindsey Graham and the United States Senate will be ready to act\nYeah so again let me say this or do we have the statement from Mike Pompeo where he says let's give a couple of days here for them to give us a full report I Want to get that one ready 'cause I think sometimes in these we do have it let's go and listen\nI told President Trump this morning that we ought to give them a few more days to complete that so that we do have some understanding of surroundings at which point we can make decisions about how the United states should respond to\nSurrounding this show games\nI think that is the right response we've got to get the facts and circumstances let's go ahead and take some phone calls we're taking your calls incumbents won a hundred and sixty four three one one zero let's go to Michael he's calling from Cleveland, Ohio we like to I might go walking the broadcaster on\nA gentleman I today I just wanted to see in the fall you folks have any information on the show gets passed a possible connections with Saudi intelligence and or any other radical groups\nYou know he's got an interesting path to him that he uh\nAnd it showed some sympathy for Osama bin Laden uh in interviews that he had done and by the way this is just an excuse these actions or he also had some ties to the Muslim Brotherhood and so this is this is not someone that's coming to this without living in that world\nAnd when I said that understand the world you're living in in the middle east these kind of things are unacceptable in our standards unfortunately this is you know the beheadings you saw with ISIS this is the mindset of some of these ... these groups\nBut that does not any change these moderated it's tones over the years he was in exile in the United states and said\nLook you don't want to go to the standards I don't want to say well I just did it so the Saudis did it so that's okay so I don't think that's because we've got one question came in\nFrom ten on Facebook it says it's not America's business to get involved with is putting pressure on Saudi Arabia is wrong in my opinion I disagree\nI think sending Mike Pompeo over as the president did was exactly the right thing diplomatically we need to be addressing this at a diplomatic framework\nAnd that is what is happening here it's a diplomatic framework that's being implemented because you've got to get the facts but you can ignore what has happened here and I don't think anybody that you're going to hear from on our broadcast today is going to say that at all fan I think where you can ignore the realities what's taking place no they're competing\n... number one just pure and unequivocally he should not have been murdered if in fact that's what happened it should not have happened at the same time like with so many situations in this region J I mean there's an extent to which there are no clean hands here I mean some of the association for him in the past have been troubling and you need to look at it so again when you say look at the fat yesterday\nI I just want to say something about uh about this uh because Washington Post reporter said yes that's true ah he's had some some you know I Would call troubling relations in the past none of that justifies the action\nIs looking at a corner and there wasn't a decision this wasn't a you know this was apparently we don't have all the facts until we get we don't know but there was more to it go ahead\nWell and that's why I started there because I think that's absolutely where you have to start and finish any conversation on this it's a very troubling instant incident and that's why I'm Glad to President Trump and secretary Pompeo\nHad committed to getting to the bottom of it but I think the larger point though is that the facts here don't involved just what happened inside the constant litter the embassy a few days ago they are also\nOr you have to look back in history you look at look at the interplay between the United states and Saudi Arabia have to look at the interplay between turkey and Saudi Arabia frankly you gotta look at the interplay between Saudi Arabia and other powers in the region like the Shia Iran so Jay when you talk about getting the facts of the reason you don't have them in a period of twenty four hours\nAre probably the first country to feel that squeezes Israel\nLet's go to take a call here before the end of the first half hour of Joe's calling from like ... Joe\n... thank you for taking my call I've got three short question\nFirst do we know for a fact that he was required to be at the consulate in order to obtain would\nAsk if you get to be easier to get to document he had to be there and\nThen he went there a earlier and they told them to come back on October second\nOkay that sounds like it was pretty plan dumber today today have any reason to be concerned for his safety uh wellbeing while he was\nNow you have a he had he had a criticize the Saudi Government extensively in in in articles so I mean yes um I think that yeah that is no question that that was he had reason to be concerned but but he took these acts and he told his fiance to wait for him and call friends\nIf you did not return that's what he told the fiance I\nOkay All right well it pretty well answers\nNow shows me and I want to go back to to the ban on this and then it looks at what stay on with us for the second half hour here began to drop was the beginning you're traveling today but we want to see if we can keep ... a ... and that's why I think Congress I understand that concern but we've got to be measured in getting to the bottom of all this\nWe've got to get all the facts I mean look look I I think there is inappropriate role for both the executive branch in the legislative branch I think it's probably good that legislative branches spun up so that that that Saudi Arabia to take this seriously and so that it fully equipped to handle the president's doing do you deal with Foreign Relations\nBut at the same time the constitution gives the president their responsibility to balance all of these measures so\nI actually think it's good right now that you have Lindsey Graham and others in the Congress or just sounding the alarm and how serious this is and then at the end of the day the secretary of state and the president well they have to balance all the things we're talking about income to a conclusion I think\nIt was and I think dispatching Mike Pompeo to meet with them was absolutely appropriate and correct thing to do it then cancelling a secretary Mnuchin participation in the ah Saudi Arabia investment for him\nTo some it was the right thing to do as well and I think giving him a few more days to respond is fine but understand or something happened and something bad happened here uh west you mean Fifteen seconds on the importance of the ally here we got to remember that too [noise]\nYeah they are they are they're the leader of the Gulf states there in Persian Gulf and standing you have to malign influence of Iran and and the radical\nShia Islamic law city and we need Saudi Arabia or to to help us with Israel and taking that's now\nAll right we'll be back with more and and just about a minute here at uh they

critic of the Saudi Government went into I Lived in Washington she basically self imposed exile or what is it a Saudi Arabia constantly in Istanbul, Turkey to obtain a document you need it for his upcoming marriage or he did not come out he had his fiance wait outside he told his fiance\nA that and he was very clear on this that a\nWay for them and to call friends if he did not return and he did not return\nSo he may have had a a concerned the console was going to be issuing some marriage certificate that he needed to marriage or marriage Turkish citizen having said all of that here's what we know a week after the disappearance Saudi Arabia said they would allow Turkish investigators to search the Saudi consulate in Istanbul to investigate the disappearance of Mr ...\nHowever the search to not take place until October sixteenth\nAnd then we find out that the walls to the buildings on the inside were completely repainted so\nIt looks like something awful has happened which I think there's no question that something awful happen the president spoke with uh the king king Solomon of a Saudi Arabia\nBut then dispatch Mike Pompeo here's what Mike Pompeo said once he left meeting with the president this morning\nI told President Trump this morning that we ought to give them a few more days to avoid that so that we do have some understanding of the facts surrounding that which we can make decisions about how the United states should respond to\nIncidents surrounding shoving\nWe want to get to the bottom of this because in extrajudicial killings and that's what it is is what's called a colonel Smith called that is exactly what looks like took place you're having said that this is very ... I don't want anybody to think you just say we're cutting off Saudi Arabia and that's it because you're not the way it works\nThis is a very complex geopolitical situation I always say in the middle east you gotta think nine dimensional here\nColonel Smith there are complicating this does not justify what they did and there should be repercussions for that there will be world repercussions word it appears and it may be that this crown prince has to go is that you cannot be the new leader of the modern Saudi Arabia\nBut I Want to defer to colonel Smith I met you served in the region\nYeah I think you're right I think if if it if it's is proven that he was involved in this that perhaps he ordered this hit\nAnd the idea of him being a legitimate leader Saudi Arabia or that that simply cannot be he does have Thirteen other brothers some of which are older than him he was elevated to this position even though he will take off her brother and in some ways he's tried to do some good things\nYou know Saudi Arabia part of the reason that they uh they have a they have such\nA cultural norms and their religious beliefs are so strict and up until recently women drive women basically have the right there is because of the concert in\nSort of the little hobby a strain of Islam that is their religious leaders wield a lot of political power one of the things is crown prince did is he stood against the religious leaders he's trying to modernize Saudi Arabia\nWearing them morally and culturally or to the twenty first century but if he's involved in this in any sense of legitimacy that he had is absolutely gone and the United states needs to be measured very strong forceful but measured in their response to this uh these allegations\nProve true in a part of that will be the that the king needs to select another successor cars up there\nI mean that's the kind of repercussions that could come into play on this and when I Want to say are going to the break here is that understand the scope of nature what's going on here nine dimensional thinking multi dimensional thinking here\nBecause what you have is an extrajudicial killings that's what we're going to call it took place evidently at the consulate Saudi Arabia and its tumbled turkey\nThe Turks certainly have the right to investigate a crime that took place in their country but\nThere's more to it than that the Saudis cannot get away with it with impunity that's for sure\nBut we can't be ever rush to judgment on what our reaction will be other than a terrific and condemn than what actions we take and it may be the removal of this crown prince if he was involved who is the heir apparent to the throne the kingdom of Saudi Arabia that would be a big results [noise]\nWe ... them we have we support their air force right now we're just starting to the rebels in Yemen we they don't have refueling air tankers\nWe provide the fuel for their fighter planes on these missions we have a military personnel who use the air fields and airspace in Saudi Arabia so it's a mutual relationship but they ... they need us as much as we need them and uh I think I think you know the fact is the king of Saudi Arabia\nWhen this investigation is complete is going to have to take strong action in order to maintain that relationship and in order for his his government to have any sense of legitimacy what the rest of the world\nWell I think the credibility of legitimacy of the kingdom of Saudi Arabia is at risk\nThat's what I think um and there's a risk a and the needs to be investigated and he needs to be done appropriately but it needs to happen and if the crown prince again if it's proven that the crown prince order was involved in this execution and that's when it sounds like it was\nIf that's the case he could not be the leader of the kingdom of Saudi Arabia in the world's eyes that would I Would do that I Would think is unacceptable a no matter you know whether the un takes action on it or not we have\nTo understand the geopolitical consequences I'm not one of these ones going out there saying you pull all your alliances get your uh\nA national security teams out of there I think that's that's an overreaction the reaction needs to be this is reflecting the legitimacy of the kingdom's governance\nAnd we don't want to put ourselves at risk rallies in the region that risk by doing

situation and I think when you look at it we have to look at it through the geopolitical lands that again nine dimensional you're west I mean that's what you have to do\nThat to live there you don't ever want to sacrifice you know the strategic interest of the United states which have been you know go zing if you're a step in a part of that region for decades or national security or are you\nDylan's intelligence gathering in order you know to to take a stand against this awful thing that apparently has happened there are multiple options that the United states has to take\nA strong stand or about this killing\nAnd do even punish the people involved without sacrificing\nOur national security interest I think the president and the secretary of state or setting the right tone they're lowering the glamour of the crowds on both sides of this issue a and I applaud him for that because I think they realize more than anyone exactly what is at stake\nAnd that we have to make a statement but on the other hand we have to protect the vital interests of our own country\nSteve calling from Atlanta Georgia in line to Steve go ahead you're on the air\nAnd all and yet many personality like no I Want to get a special thanks to all be finding things though my question is is\nTaking the military alliance out of their wage and you know a lot about rape killing and and the airplanes and all that taking that\nOut of the equation can you explain it plainly what actions we have a bailout assuming that MBBS hat on civility\nWell there's individuals sanctions on them images the act\nThat can be devastating not allowed to come up with the crown prince of Saudi Arabia and the ... to the throne but you get in trouble in the United states that would be a pretty big one so I think that it's it's a diplomatic response in that sense a but again the evidence has to be shown which tablets that but that's I think I think that's where this is the focus of this was going to be found\nYeah and then look again Saudi Arabia needs the United states more than we need them even outside the military brown which is where we focus Jay you not only the Magnitsky Act but forty five billion dollars in trade between the United states in Saudi Arabia access to the U.S banking system without which you really cannot participate in the world economic market gay so look\nI'm you know I I think the question behind the question is is if the determination is that the crown prince cannot be the next leader of Saudi Arabia how would the United states facilitate that\nA a look at the United states said ah we're we're not going to a recognized the crown prince or that will fracture our alliance guess what would happen he would not be the next king of Saudi Arabia us has that much in the U.S\nLinda on Facebook as a good question what would the world look like without a strong relationship between the Americans and the Saudis are this will not\nBe helpful just for our relationship but it would be difficult for the whole relationship or an old region I gave you the history or the United states has had a history going back with Saudi Arabia since Nineteen thirty three that's when a visual ties began and it's continued until today\nUh so I look at this colonels but it didn't say you've got to keep all of that in mind as you're talking about whether it's sanctions or individual's actions are what actually move forward here all of that has to be kept in mind\nYes all of that has to be taken into account and the congressional act allows\nFinancial sanctions against you know the people involved in this as well as for reading answer to the United states you know the thing that that we also don't want to sacrifice and it's just been in the last few years\nThat Saudi Arabia has allied itself with us and our support of Israel yes and in taking a stand against the the the Hamas and Hezbollah and all that ISIS\nAnd ISIS they are our allies and this and so we can't willy nilly sacrifice that relationship but we do have multiple options and I think fans right we have enough influence with the king who is a pragmatic Matt\nA fellow things range for a while or if he will not sacrifice his own national security or his reputation in order to defend his crown brands and that's probably a party or this is going to end up the crown prince is going to have to go\nWell let me give you a for instance so are you talking about Hamas uh west just girls which is much let me get a picture for those on Facebook this is what happened yesterday or two a apartment or in better shape up from Hamas\nUh destroyed it as you see a there were three kids inside and apparently they are I'm In a trauma unit basically for a post traumatic stress disorder or or worse um they they were inside mother and child were three children were inside one was an infant\nSo these are bad actors in this region and and Saudi Arabia while they been helpful on these issues\nDo\nVery over here the save themselves syndrome and the union bizarre comments and then ... I don't know rooms welcome to the program no middle ground and allow because we've got to cut it to say though is guaranteed\n... [noise]\nI Would go\nTo college nice even one S. A.
