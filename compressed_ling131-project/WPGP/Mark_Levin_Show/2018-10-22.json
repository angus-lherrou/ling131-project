take your calls and eight hundred sixty four thirty one ten is it the president is still making it clear that we're not leading from behind that we're not engaging in every global conflict Peter\nAbsolutely so one of the things that the president emphasized in his speech is that the rest of the world has to respect us sovereignty\nU.S interests the president of the United states is putting American citizens interests first rather than the interest of global elites and that is true in a number of arenas including\nA international trade and dealing for instance with Iran and be a rainy and move on as he is not prepared to continue to send cash to oh Ron\nHe withdrew from the Iran nuclear deal and he is\nHas imposed sanctions on the Iranian regime new sanctions take effect a new November the fifth of twenty Eighteen\nAnd this is placing pressure on the Iranian leaders in the European global it's who continue to attempt to prop up the Iranian regime in country distinction to supporting the Iranian people\nYou know what's interesting about that is it there are reports that the Europeans are meeting to try to figure out ways around the sanctions because they know that if they got to make a choice between doing business with the United states are doing business with the Iranians it's a very\nEasy choice right now and it's it's pretty general but the the us going to put together some vehicles they're calling it\nA that all the funds would flow through that would somehow\nOr take these cut make these companies immune from usa should because most of them would also do business have some financial traction transactions to the U.S because we're ... system be so important to our stock market\nOr so that they would create some vehicle that allows\nA this works or that allows them to continue to do business with Iran in violation of the usa should but somehow protects them the truth is though does it you can try all at once the corporations want to make that decision most of the major corporations is Harry's pointed out before this broadcast we talked about the sanctions\nHave decided they're not going to risk\nA business with the U.S or us sanctions and having their assets frozen or in the United states or any trips actually goes to the United states to do business with the country that that is large\nBut let me go to a better here I'm going to play in a moment or the president use this phrase America's policy of principle realism\nOr we're going to get it get get that played in a moment but before we do I ban as our un representative or you go to the un you've been there many times are bad usually ... people being held captive for their fate but on on other issues as well what is your sense of Capitol Hill reaction are we seeing anything yet so far\nA not a whole lot J I think still digesting the speech but I think here's what your gunny here and this is this is certainly would I took away from it after the first time in a long time J I heard a balanced approach with the United nations that said two things that might seem\nTo be in contradiction each other but actually work in harmony on the one hand you heard the president say we're not going to meddle in your business when it's your sovereign a right to engage in an issue but on the other hand Jay he said we're not going to be the world's pocket book so we're not going to find every little program around the world that might not serve America's digits we've seen this\nUh with repeated account you talk about unreal you talking about withdrawing from the human rights council you talked about reducing the UN's contributions to Jay it was the president put in the world in a more appropriate posture leading at United Nations but at the same time not propping up everything I loved this line ... J. he\nSaid going forward we will only give to our friends what a novel idea we're going to support those people who are friends and to Jordan's point J\nI don't think Europe better go down this line of the United states resolve on that point\nHuge mistake now interestingly I like this line I'm going to read it first I'm going to play it\nPresident said that image advance not harmed by acknowledging the obvious facts America's policy of principle realism means we will not be held hostage to old dog was discredited ideologies in so called experts who have been proven wrong over the years time and time again let's listen to it\nThat ... not harmed\nBy acknowledging the obvious fast [noise] Americans policy of friends who will realism\nMeans we will not be held hostage\nTo hold off on this discredited ideologies and so called experts who have been proven wrong\nOver a year's time and time again you know\nAnd the time and time again is important because let me give you a for instance when time to play despite the moment and this is about Jerusalem the president made a very bold move it may have this year\nMoving to recognize the embassy of the United states from Tel Aviv to Israel's eternal capital Jerusalem now there were a lot of advisors previous advisors in previous administrations saying this was disastrous this was going to start a third intifada\nGonna be a new war in the middle east the our allies will be angry you cannot move the embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem with out reshaping the world order I mean it was it was that significant the way people there's going to impact the entire Arab world the entire Muslim world and there'll be no way that this could be reconciled\nAll right so what happens if president moves the embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem\n[noise] and did they did the world collapse did the middle east realignment get injured no corny allies of Israel right now in the region who are thought this Jordan and Egypt Saudi Arabia and a number of the Gulf states\nSo taking Jerusalem off the table as a negotiating chip actually it was really smart\nSo when the president engage that issue he knew exactly what it was going to do it David Mann the ball forward\nGoing well and also those are ... or so called experts thought that the best way to move forward palaces was throwing money hundreds of millions of dollars up to a billion dollars a year and all their program so you know what it's gotten us nowhere\nOver decades like the president said so we're not going to go by just the the so called experts were going to cut that funding\nWe recognize useless cap of Israeli cut off the Palestinians and then we see what changes we it it's all about taking new approaches you don't always know exactly how things will turn out\nI think would Jerusalem that was a long term decision on the funding is ... the Palestinians because what has happened in the past has failed and how many times how many decades of failure do you need on record before you tell the state department and we're not letting you do business as usual elevate let me let me play the Jerusalem because I think this is very important number thirty seven\nThis year we also took another significant step forward in the middle east\nIn recognition of every severance to determine his own capital I Move the U.S embassy in Israel\nThe United states has committed to a future reasons civility in the region including peace between the Israelis and the Palestinians with the\nPresident did do and I think this is very significant by moving the embassy to Jerusalem all we recognize was the obvious sovereign nation gets to determine its capital ... states is the district of Columbia\nIn Jerusalem that Israel is Drew Sloan so we simply recognize what was under the law the rights of the Israelis to do and that they did do through their process they determine where their capital is going to be\nSomething that Jordan was talking about the resettlement of refugees who have been displaced by ISIS and others\nAre Jay this administration has told the rest of the world I'm pulling back a big contribution to the United states is making to that program\nBecause you all aren't supporting an as you should and guess what I'm going to do I'm going to send it directly to the Christian ... as you use the communities that have been displaced by that that is a way he has backed up the words he gave today Jay with action on the ground so as it relates to China if they don't come to the table and contribute in any like fashion\nThe president will just keep pulling the United states dollars back and allocating indirectly\nWhen we come back from the break I Want to get into the issue of the international criminal court the president mentioned that and I've appeared there I Know that when a so they were able to talk to you about a lot of these issues\nYou said I I had the privilege of being at that podium at the general assembly I've been here before the offices the prosecutor at the un at the international criminal court in the Hague are presenting Israel's interests before the icy said so I've done this\nAh we're talking about that were drawn by the president's comments and globalism and take more of your phone calls at one eight hundred sixty four three one one juror that's eight hundred sixty four thirty one ten it was interesting that the president had this statement\nThe Iranian people again just this is drawing a distinction between the Iranian regime and the Iranian people are rightly outraged that their leaders have been basil billions of dollars from Iran's treasury let me play for you sound bite thirty one\nYear right in people are rightly outraged [noise]\nThat their leaders have embezzled millions of dollars from ranch fresh [noise]\nSees the value of ... of the income [noise]\nLooted and people's religious and down it's\nAll over the line their own pockets and send their promises to wage war not\nThat is from the president the United states speaking at the United nations strong words\nOn the Iranian regime that we've got thirty more minutes ahead of this broke as if you don't get the full hour discovered ACL J died or were screaming at their course on Facebook it's Facebook dot com slash a secular were periscope\nYou could run if you can get up there as well and we encourage that course a lot of states now carry the full hour for those of you that are going to be staying with us we've got 'em it's coming up [noise]\nI really want to get into this issue of the global is issue the whole international criminal court now that plays into this and we're taking your calls at one eight hundred sixty four thirty one ten don't forget worth working ACL Jay you do that at a C. O. J. down or back with more than just a moment [noise]\nBoy\nThat's Iran nearly died in the theaters in Washington\nPresident Trump says he's alerted the border patrol and the military about a caravan

president gives a major address to the United nations or Jordan said this during the break a true the two\nThat are always the most uh dissipated at least for the media or the presidents and the prime minister of Israel\nThat's usually it for me to hear the United states that's where the focus goes ah because you will see a lot of controversy surrounding the prime minister of Israel from march in the crowd that the United Nations General assembly inside the building\nAnd then of course we want to see our president kind of lay out the foreign policy issues that are the most important but also\nWhat we're doing is seeing our presidents speak to the world this is a a unique time when it's not the president just addressing the nation he does that you know he addresses our nation regularly right this is an address to the world and world leaders that's his audience there\nAnd of course there are there are things for everybody to pay attention to our Americans to understand the thought process going by a our foreign policy but\nThis is really a statement to the world on where America's going into an Eighteen twenty Nineteen\nAnd where they focused and we're seeing a lot of focus on Iran\nWe're seeing a again I'm the focus on the middle east of the reasons the world that is again still the most uh turmoil I'm ... and then obviously a lot of economics or we haven't gotten to do that there's a lot of economic focused in this speech as well and the idea of the America First idea\nBut also saying you should be doing this in your own country to yeah should be looking out for your own people's interest stop just joining these global institutions and letting them decide for you you're\nHearing what would you say that you took is the biggest takeaway from the speech\nWell among other things uh one of the biggest pick a ways that I took his the rejection by President Trump of the advice and the approach taken by global\nGlobal us are quite willing to prop up horrendous regimes for instance like the Iranian regime the number one state sponsor of terror\nAnd so the question then becomes how does that approach advance human rights\nCoon by is not a solution maximum pressure in principle realism is a solution\nSo the president offered a clear message to global elites who are often willing to trade human lives in pursuit of the illusion that all of the world leaders are actually interested\nIn peace rather than expanding terror and so one of the messages that was clear or to the world and to\nGlobal leaders was we are rejecting past approaches that have failed\nWith respect to Iran with respect to Syria and with respect to any ... regime that ... it's um people's hopes and dreams instead of advancing\nA true peace going forward America is governed by Americans that's where the president said listen to this\nAmerica is governed by America [noise]\nWe reject any ideology of globalism\nAnd we embrace it die\nPatriotism I\nMean this is in contradiction but this is the complete opposite man\nOf the way the previous administration address the world we were all part of his you know global ... a world which of course we are part of a global world but we are protecting here our sovereignty and our ability to determine our own fate it was very strong and very much in distinction the previous administration\nWill and quite frankly Jay that approach is necessary if you want to restore American leadership around the world I mean the president I thought\nUh you know he back that up by saying if their program is not helpful not only to the world but to American interests like unreal like the human rights council we are not going to go along with it just because decades or tradition say that we have to\nAt the same time Jay he issued the red lines for Syria we've heard red lines before but I think the rest of the world knows that this president\nWell when he made those comments did the first thing that came to mind was your book because that was one of the reasons I Know that motivated you to ride it is the actions that we saw the United nations and we did not want our bureaucracy can follow suit but\nYou know it is a hundred and eighty degrees from the foreign policy at the last ... I think it or that policy was fair to describe is one of appeasement where now it's a policy of strength it's not metal lean but it's American leadership through strength\nAnd the other thing that struck me I think when the American president took the lectern in many administrations in the past the rest of the world didn't pay that much attention because they didn't think there would be followed through but this president whether it's the Jerusalem embassy or rude and removing the United states from ... or or withdrawing from the Iran deal or or pulling back Palestinian funds\nJay he has told the world in advance what he will do and then what does he done he's followed through to Jordan's point about anticipating the American president speech I think more than ever before because those in that chamber know the words that come out of his mouth are going to be followed up by actions\nYeah the tariffs that renegotiate trade deals sanctions I mean uh the targeted sanctions the end of the the the more a widespread sanctions the upcoming sanctions on Iran the chicken or how we have treated China but at the same time the trade deal we decide with South Korea\nOr that increased a lot of things that was a big surprise was that the increased us or other experts in South Korea that was not necessarily something that a lot of experts that was on the table even the up and it was more focused on farm in kind of the foods and things like that\nUm and it said also included a doubling of the number of us cars that can go and purr manufacture into the the South Korean economy so are there are positives steps that they've taken a renegotiating trade deals\nThere are the the again approaches that you take a the punishments\nAnd if you see your tariffs on China are fighting to get China to the table these are real these are happening as we speak it is not a threat\n[noise] so when the president speaks about something he is considering [noise] he has a record now\nOf when he says that acting on [noise]\nSo now who knows who these words he uses it to you and you know our our our action items that will be acted on it and\nWhy don't you do that with the with the Kim Jong un saved in the beginning and from last year than where we are today you saw that with\nIsrael and then moved on the Capitol Jerusalem [noise]\nAll of that is very very real high last statement we take

but uh some networks we ... you get a delayed\nBut we think long and hard about what topics to hit and we decided today you know there'll be plenty of time talking about some of the other issues but I thought today was worthwhile to to to really focus on us because I think it was a major speech to the president gave\nUp we're going to order now who is called ... who's been old dodge John and Minnesota on line three John welcome to Jay Sekulow alive I ...\nI guess ... ... go ahead with your comment\nSaw or I have a choice he says the present and see what you think of it um I've been around a lot of getting older past middle age but I really believe that but anyway I'm\nI'm mentally also which means I'm sixty two so I guess I Lived through Adrian and when they come up to about a hundred and four that'd be good okay oh\nI saw a lot of cousins color and go though is the fight and they ... or all these interesting combinations of or that the Bush says that mass there a lot of great writing about\nDonald Trump I just wanted to ask you what you think of this book in two years less than two wars dot walkway through us that he's done so many great things that you got to put him on the list of what other great presidents already so I just want to hear your comment is\nWell I Want to play something I think sums it right up I think you're you're absolutely correct but let me play this for your number sixty two\nOnly going to give foreign aid to those who respect us and frankly are our friends and we expect other countries to pay their fair share [noise] for the cost of their defense\nI think that says it all I think that sums it all up I think that's exactly the right approach and that's exactly another doctrine that the president's laid out here\nAll right yeah back to the phones we go pat in Florida on line to pat welcome to Jay six you alive I bet\nThey guys thing to do everything is a great show as always thanks um like question is for say there is still there he is just wondering what I'm just wondering if there's any reaction to that he wanted her to the president's speech up on the hill go ahead\nYeah I think there's going to be some handwringing in some accounts this not just going to be on the left because the president did something that they had been unwilling to do for a number of years\nAnd that is hold these un programs accountable for what is required them under us that you look we have long called on Congress to pull funding back from some some of these accounts that are not following statutory authority or the president has taken that into his own hands as he has the authority to do the J Congress should have done it long ago so I suspect\nThere might be silenced from some quarters where you would normally expect support but it's because they've been sitting on their hands and not doing with the president and you know what's\nAlso interesting on this John is that if you look at the commentary that's come out since the speech believe me if there was one line they could have jumped on and taken all the way home and said I Can't believe the president said this they would have done it so far I have not seen that\nNo no in fact that the media has again they covered the speech but they've shifted back to the other more salacious there's they ... they could do and I I Do think that's a testament to the speech itself yeah because uh I get this was a speech primarily to the international audience\nRecovery or few because it does impact the United states obviously but you're talking to the entire world this is not a rally speech a at a targeted for the U.S\nA un American voter it's targeted to the world and world leaders more specifically I'm very broadly the entire world so I think that they they have nothing to seize on here\nThere's no mobility of serious disagreement and so because of that instead of spending like we've done at a time actually analyzing the speech they're moving on to the media because it's just there's nothing there's nothing to debate parents of either like this I don't like this\nYou know what do you think it tells us that the reaction so far has been very ... I mean I Would say that but I mean they're not usually they're attacking then you don't see it right now\nAbsolutely so I think part of the action or lack of reaction is a reflection of the fact that President Trump gave a very principled speech respect our interest that's number one\nNumber two fairness in international affairs including a trade is require\nA and number three this respect of American interests comes with a cause\nThat was a clear an unmistakable message that was delivered by the president there were no missteps and clearly I think the president of ... achieved his objective in offering this speech\nAt the United nations and as Jordan said earlier the president's rhetoric now has more weight why because the president has followed up higher rhetoric with what action and that counts locked\nPaying as arguing represented you go to the un you've been there many times are bad usually on behalf of people being held captive for their fate what is your sense of Capitol Hill reaction and we sing anything yet so far\nA not a whole laundry I think still digesting the speech but I think here's what you're gonna here and this is this is certainly would I took away from it for the first time in a long time J I heard a balanced approach with the United nations that said two things that might seem\nTo be in contradiction each other but actually work in harmony on the one hand you heard the president say we're not going to meddle in your business when it's your sovereign a right to engage in an issue but on the other hand Jay he said we're not going to be the world's pocket book so we're not going to find every little program around the world that might not serve America's\nDistricts are taking more your calls are more Facebook questions as well as well outlets going to take another call you back to the phones we go to John in Washington state on line one John welcome to Jason ...
