Andrew Brunson who is now back home in the United states was at the oval office with the president Sisi I was there as well on Monday and Tuesday Sunday and took the day off\nI don't see that one Saturday Sunday and Monday kind of took a day to recover and then I did some media interviews this morning we're thrilled that he's with us a pastor before I say anything to you let me say what Pamela on Facebook says so thankful for your freedom pastor Brunson Andrew welcome to the broadcast\nThank you very much I Want to I Want to I think for on behalf of our entire audience um let you know and you know this because we talked about this was literally had the world praying for you\nAnd the folks that are listening does the millions that lives was broadcast every day and we're praying for you without a CC but can you describe for folks I think this is important for everybody understand you were in Turkey for a long time twenty three years what you were doing in Turkey and and what's your activities were and then we'll we'll we'll bring a current but what were you there as a mission\nCan I can I first say something that we are so grateful to people prayed for us and we are so grateful for a field day a such a tremendous job fighting for us\nAnd uh the the uh high all was tireless and advocating for us and you also J uh effort cc I Know she's a lawyer but she was also\nA personally involved calling Noreen encouraging her and so many ways and\nA and you also Jay and we are so grateful that ... J\nUh took this on and uh we want everyone to know what a what a tremendous uh uh help this was and and I'm grateful we are too\nWill look we are thrilled that the result was as it was we've got another case right now where do we haven't had that result right now and that is a representing is helping to see a Bebe in our office in Pakistan but uh your case ended successfully but you were there in prison in Turkey and very difficult circumstances but I think is a I'll take a call in a minute here\nBut I I Andrew set for the folks what you were ... how long have you been there and what you were doing in Turkey what was your call to go there\nBoth uh we were there for twenty three years before I was arrested and our main goal was to go and priests to this Christ one of the main things we were involved in was church planting we're of all that several church plants\nAnd then in the last couple of years when there was a surge of Syrian refugees because of the ISIS attacks since area a number of refugees came into turkey and we saw an opportunity not\nOnly to show the love of Jesus by helping them a humanitarian aid\nBut also people who never had access to the gospel most Kurtz have never met a Christian or in their lives and in Syria you're kinda preach the gospel it was forbidden so we got involved with a Syrian refugees and we're a started meeting among them and we're doing evangelists unless that\nSo you were there as basically it's a missionary I mean we can safely say that now we could not say that while you were there um obviously because of the situation you're wearing but you would they're sharing the gospel that was what your job loss\nWe did it and we did a very openly we we did everything they opened our churches were open to the public the ... um Misha worked to Syria's what it's all done out of the open\n... before he takes costs pastor Brunson question over those twenty three years any serious issues with the government or local or state a regional government or the national government in Turkey at all\nWell there are cycles sometimes are\nThere more accommodating to churches into Christians that sometimes there's a bit of a a tightening up uh we had a there are often rather than from the government it's from a or other people who will sometimes there'll be threats bomb threats death threats\nOr we were attacked once in our church with a man came with a shotgun\nSo that's always a possibility is that just does anybody who was involved in church planting a turkey can have those kinds of dangerous but\nIt's not from the government\nSo this was this was in a sense a new effort to uh arrest you and try and one of the one of the charges was ... so nothing nothing like this ever experienced these threats experience we understand that in that part of the world but but what happened to you was something that has not happened over twenty three years\nNo it was an unprecedented thing\nYes so you there's one follow up thing we're doing you know I said you can't disclose and that's a great thing 'cause you're home and and and we're going to get into what's what's next for you but she's a you've got an we still one legal issue where you got to finish up with and that was the un commission on arbitrary detention ... we talked about that yeah they engaged\nIn the working group on arbitrary detention on engaged and pay a ... percent of the whole case to them they're still making their decision and then I have to announce finalized with than what the ... went to court that he's back\nUm I'd say family with actually that decision ended a conviction and and what can release conditions where\nOh here's what we're going to do there's a lot of you called me I mean our phone lines are literally jammed Facebook comments coming in El ... says God is so good so happy to pastor Brunson history Christine says welcome home pastor Brunson you're truly year due to answered prayer so we give all the praise

cc I'm thrilled with the work that they invented in Washington and government affairs shop and Greg ... who runs for office in ... and it just a great job in the end and the circumstances\nI was representing you and then ended up representing the president I mean you none of nobody could have put down altogether at the end of the day these though I I Believe that with and not to take nothing away from any one that uh the lord\nWas in this and that's that's how these things happen and I'm Glad that uh everybody I'm Glad for the tenacious advocacy by our legal team by the president by the secretary of state but we do also have to print were credit is also do you not just the way we feel is the inland it's usually\nBut let me do this we've we've Andrew we've got a lot of people want to

I Want to thank him and tell him how happy I Am to hand him back in the United states\nWill do what you're talking right to um Andrew where where do you what do you say the ...\nWell we are very grateful for parents prayers and for a number\nOf people who prayed for us and we believe a obviously a God used as a people are but I think that uh what was moving that's what brought our name up to this level or with the president uh was was periods of God's people and but I also think that\nAs we look at it we think well we're we're not very significant or importance for our name to rise for so many people to pray for us we think that there was much more that God was doing and I look at it as almost like we're looking at a puzzle but from the bottom side\nAnd someday we will look from the top and will actually see the picture right now we don't see the full picture but God was doing much more than just using ... to release me from print prison a I think there was\nHe was just pouring prayer from God's people into turkey and then to the middle east and that there's going to be\nAlso and and partition that as we pray for people God can a pass something spiritual onto a spiritual blessing on and so we we ask God to give us had opportunity when we asked the president and if we could pray for him\nIt's very receptive and it was a great privilege for us to do this\nLet's say one more call before the break here Julie California on line six Julie you're on the air with pastor Bronx or Julie\nI'm gay and who are going to have to burn colonel custom all that's why I'm a member of the hail today\n... ... they care about one individual and they care about is because that's that's the whole world and passed up on her like question is they feel occur Arthur people around the world ... ... ... ... it's how how to lift up their shrimp court ...\nOkay so first I Want to say something about it so they said they they care about the individual and so my wife told me out cc would stay up sometimes through the night monitoring something for us the hearings and then the next day go through a whole day at work\nAnd just the personal care there was a really phenomenal uh uh the question I just forgot what the question\nWas you know no no the question was did you feel the prayers of God's people\nYou know I I was very encouraged knowing that people were praying for me one of the fears that I had an irrational think perhaps\nBut when one one that's isolated the way I was is it I Would be forgotten and that people would not pray for me and I desperately wanted that for her because I I felt very weak and so\nUh as I look back uh\nOn my second year of one God was rebuilding me\nI did it feel God's presence very much\nBut uh I I Know very well that it was a personal God's people that was a there was a grave coming to me that often was not felt right it was like a hit and grace and I wasn't aware of it at the time but then I Would look back and say well I\nCame through these difficulties and I know that I'm too weak to do it myself you know I Know that it was great\nYou know you're absolutely right if I were to take a break we'll come back with Sandra ... runs the moment but interesting statement when you said where you felt like you were alone and there were those times we we've had other cases where people say the exactly the same exact was saying that they feel even though it's irrational they have no it's a rational\nDid those situations there can there be completely forgot\nI Will be back with more of Andrew Brunson in just a moment\n[noise]\nSign now do you are in Turkey state run news agencies instant Saudi console days Campbell has left for Saudi Arabia hours after he said his official residents will be terrorist connection with the Saudi riders disappearance\nJon Alterman senior VP with the anti and since the relationship with Saudi Arabia good chance getting the possible death as\nYou can show the Turkish four engine teams searched insanity constantly earlier today two weeks after ... vanished during these sensational skiers Saudi agents killed in the Nick ...

late to a meeting when we got off the air when I walked into the meeting\nWhich was a dozens of of uh senators and congressmen officers were represented there\nAre they actually stop the meeting and the house leadership was on the agenda to talk about their priorities they stopped the meeting and they should actually we want to use our time to than from UCLA who just got here because we want to hear about pastor Brunson and how he's doing and how he has returned home so\nA pastor I just wanted to kind of conveyed to you\nThat is Halloween to the United states government is on the legislative level to your case it was inspiring to me that they wanted to hear from you are so badly I knew a lot of them are looking forward to to meeting you and welcome you home and I would just say an honor to honor to hear from you and honored to speak with you and welcome home\nBut thank you and for us is very surreal because uh\nWe are not very important people and as we we as I said we've been working at a corner of turkey for many years\nAnd to see this level of interest or we can say is it is God who did this it isn't just a natural thing and uh I Believe God did this because of a purpose is far beyond us or that he thinks he plans to accomplish if\nWe take another call yeah Barbara in New Jersey on line three you were talking to a pastor Bronx Hi Barbara\nHi welcome back to the United

foster\nWhat about you what would you be your word to the persecuted church master\nBut there's very little that I can say that the church in China they're the ones who teach us but what I Do know that God is going to use China to bless the world and they are the next big missions sending there's going to be a wave of Chinese going out into the Muslim world\nAnd they're going to carry much of the weight of the missionary movement so I expect great wonderful things from China\nAll right we're coming up on the last segment with pastor Brunson so I encourage you to keep calling keep getting

every day for years\nShe set time aside and she read the Bible and she just spent time in God's presence and prayed\nAnd I was more sporadic I'd run fast and then I slow down but she was very consistent and uh it's not that she had been credible revelations every day but it was the uh over time the consistency and just feeding herself so that when\nThe crisis came and wear NFL together

it's runs against the idea that he's a racist\nIt runs against the either the term that's like minorities that he's going after her Ronan going after a Maxine Waters going after the usual suspects if you will and politics and it's sort of a racial way in areas that flip it it gives you some people but mainly it's for white people\nBecause white people won't vote for a guy most them if they think

sixteen\nYup it is and it only will raise the stakes for twenty twenty but if they may very well the good old safely get at least one more Supreme Court appointment\nI mean that would bring caught in

couple of this madness then mark ward in the face of the kind of attacks normally that Republican going for cover it puts them in a category of his own\nBut I Would have thought that Democrats would have gotten a bunch of consultants together and figured out a label a word or name a moniker they could put on Trump and because he does it for everybody else I'm just shocked they haven't done it\nWill be pride I mean they tried with the orange hair they try to instill family that that can make fun of his kids they cite the factor late though they write the razor blade but why didn't they
