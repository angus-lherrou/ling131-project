clear harassment is a real thing but it has a legal definition and it's not just every type your ... even the department of education even issued a letter to the to the effect\nWhich is ridiculous the fact that the department occasion actually have to issue a letter to say you're not harassed every time you were offended they're completely different things um is remarkable\nWell maybe I think something else that might be remarkable you told me a ... and ... you're the you're the president of a an organization called fire ... the foundation for individual rights in education why do we ...\nObviously your organization is doing good stuff and uh it's it's in existence why do we need something like that one did you feel the need for that\nWell unfortunately it's it's been really easy to get in trouble for what you say on a college campus um and even if it's relatively tame all a lot of people immediately jumped\nTo kind of like are you talking about it's all you know people engaged and racial slurs and I you know I have to explain like most of what I deal with our people getting in trouble for you know the ... and the famous example that I always talk about is a student was reading a book called Notre Dame versus the Klan\nI've noticed about the the the defeat of the clan when they marched on Notre Dame and the Nineteen twenties but because I'm a lawyer was offended by the Klan and the title at a cover picture of of of a clan Marge\nI'm a ... a he was reported and found guilty of racial harassment without so much in an opportunity to defend themselves now of course if even if it was a pro clan book it would still be protected speech but the fact that it was a book celebrating the defeat of land just made it that much more ironic\nUnbelievable what you know just fun as a side note here are just recently I saw that I was looking up the where the uh\nUh Notre Dame got the nickname fighting Irish because I wanted to stop there was something that should offend me about it you know the fighting and there's something in one of them I don't know if it's definitely in the case but that's one of the theories is that the the name came from\nThere the way they fought against the Ku Klux Klan which was very anti Catholic you know I think anti Irish too and so they came to finding iris because of the clan\nYeah no it ... it was a term of pride yeah\nYeah so um so where do you see this going we've got about a minute and a half left um and I appreciate you being\nIt was but I what I'm it it is it is it going to get is it going to get worse before it

today and that would be Sidney Crosby goal last night um if you haven't seen it I had two of them but the one they had it over time to give the penguins to sixty five when about two minutes into overtime\nUm I've seen most yeah I've seen this guy places he got here obviously I saw just a lot of games played by Mariel um you a lot of them in the ...\nAnd and I've said many times in Mariel amuse the best player I have ever seen\nIn any team sport ever\nUm and Sidney Crosby goal last night was as good as great as anything I ever saw Mariel them you do and it didn't it wasn't some a goal worry\nBroke through four guys and fell on his back and flip went up there it was a ridiculously simple goals scored at a small space or just to give you and if you haven't seen it is only a if you have hockey just we need to watch it he was a man over time three on three\nAnd he first took the buck and quickly did a circle you got around the the avoided the defense men with his back to them then headed toward the net he passed the puck between the defenders legs to himself\nAnd then skated a cross the goalie space and then back handed it over the golden glove ridiculous but the thing that made it a great story\nWas that he was playing in Edmonton Edmonton as a kid named ... day but there was a ridiculously good player himself as spectacular player and going to be at all time great and there are people and have been people for a while saying and he won the scoring title last year people saying that he's the best player in hockey so\nBut yes it definitely should if these are linked because then it will make it easier for law enforcement to find a common source from which they all emanating if I was a ... having to give an opinion on it I Would say would be a common source or from which all these devices or whatever they are in these packages emanating because\nYou looked into the political spectrum that the targets of the devices\nHave received and it's obvious that they were a coordinated concentrated effort to target\nOf those political figures who were left or center left\nWhich would lead one logically if I was a investigating it to believe that he came from those in the opposite direction but who knows that may just be a counterintuitive moved to discredit the ride by somebody on the left a very any mind that would do something like this uh Jordan you

linked and that is to do is that we have right now that I Want to focus the attention or the the comedy uh this this caravan of migrants emanating out of Honduras but people adding onto the care of it every single day St news report your estimated\nThis is somewhere between seven to fourteen thousand people that have occurred how dirty president has asked the people to return he is more conservative but this is being brought on by the left\nIn Honduras to Central America this push to\nOr the one hand come to United States of America or the other hand bird American flags on the way I'm so very political and left this motivate I'm sure their children and women in this care of it being used by this process\nWho are trying to escape a to a better life and we saw that the last time this happened back in April of ... would it dwindle down to about four hundred people\nAnd the majority of those people ended up getting through the asylum process but when you're talking about for that was started with Fifteen hundred dwindled to fourteen to\nFour hundred or so this is starting this is about fourteen thousand people\nAnd we're calling hard Mexico to work alongside the United states in preventing this\nCrisis at the border I let's take a listen to President Trump\nOr talking about how to work with Mexico first they don't want to take your phone calls on 'cause listen folks there they're looking at two different routes\nAnd we got blisters in both the states they're looking at the the San Diego Tijuana border crossing and also ... Texas a border crossing a the ... the Texas border crossing is closer last time around they chose the Tijuana\nUh San Diego area but I mean they get to states or could be in the mix here I I Want to take your phone calls at one eight hundred six eight four thirty one tenth what should be done\nTo stop this wave of illegal immigration fourteen thousand people on their way a and I think it's very sad that there'd be motivated to buy these leftist activists in their own country baby here the United states as well uh let's listen to President Trump\nMet I was working with us there is a movement toward our country is so and they get here [noise] and his group that has around the same all I'm involved and others will have a whole we can not healthy for them is a fairly\nRight now\nThe Caribbean is about one thousand miles away from the closest us border\nThat would be in ... Texas and about twenty two hundred miles away from the border crossing it Tijuana source President Trump said there's time to work with Mexico to work together or with Mexico this I think underscores the need for increased border security and the wall\nIf you have the wall or you can add these situations and certainly you don't want\nFourteen thousand people at the wall you would still have to work on these types of caravans but it would be a big deterrent\nOr because you people would do what they would be up against when they reached the U.S a southern border take your phone calls one eight hundred and sixty four thirty one to this one eight hundred six eight four thirty wanted let me ah I go to\nA Harry ... the idea here this goes to also national security it's not just a humanitarian issue that department of homeland security\nHas said that they in a tweet from their spokesperson they can confirm I'm quoting them that they're individuals within the caravan who are who are gang members or have significant criminal histories\nCitizens of countries are since outside of Central America including the middle East Africa South Asia and elsewhere are currently traveling through Mexico toward the U.S I mean that is from the department of homeland security doing their intelligence work to figure out who these people\nAre absolutely so broadly speaking the caravan is a challenge to the integrity of the U. S. borders it's a challenge to the rule of law a lot more directly with respect to suddenly these individuals' worrying about it and the care of and\nMany of those individuals are a direct\nThreat to US security\nUh some of them are smugglers some of them are drug smugglers human trafficking smugglers et cetera and some of them are perhaps harbor terrorists ambitions and so it would be difficult to look at a mass of fourteen thousand people ...\nAnd then to separate out those who are legitimate a refugee claimants from those who wish to do us harm\nSo we should engage in a full throated a diplomatic effort particularly with Mexico and Honduras to stem the flow we must intervene before the caravan reaches our border\nIt's important to note as you indicated earlier Jordan that many of the individuals who are in the caravan a base don't seem to like the United states so why are they in the Caribbean why are they coming why are they ... up perhaps\nUh putting swastikas on American flags if they desperately our rent a one to be calm\nRefugee immigrants to the United states so there are lots of questions out there uh yes we should enforce our law with compassion are but we should seek to intervene in stem the flow before it reaches our border\nOne eight hundred sixty four thirty one tennis number you call if you want to talk to us on the air is John scholar already in California on line\nThree John welcome to Jay Sekulow live you're certainly in the state where a a you deal with the illegal immigration on a daily basis and the the this caravan could be heading your way they haven't made that decision yet on which way to turn towards California or Texas or they'll get that far but John thanks for calling you're on the air\nLight pole ... wars and also also ... was also a ... couple of our culture war ...\nWell let me play for you secretary of state ... well I think in the ... in the emergency kind of situation like this year could build a wall in this time period a you know there are thousand miles away from our closest border it's it's it's that's not going to happen I agree Congress should have already passed that I think the president agrees\nCongress should have already passed that so the construction could begin but take a listen\nTo secretary of state Mike Pompeo ate a clear message to all of those people in the care of and then I'll go to Andy to talk about really whose role in the U.S government this is at this point when you've got the caravan of fourteen thousand people heading our way take a listen might pop out\nThe United states also has a message for those who are currently part of this caravan for any caravan which follows you will not be successful at getting into the United states illegally no matter what\nI repeat the care of and will not cross our southern border illegally under any circumstances if you come here go through the normal refugee process if you apply for refugee status a permanent solution as possible in Mexico or at a third country but I can tell you with certainty we're determined that illegal entry into the United states from\nThis caravan will not be possible\nBe there I get I think this and he goes to the main point which is that\nAt this stage of the game this is the executive branch role because you've got to deal with a Ford country\nA Congress really doesn't have time to act they can't build a wall or they could authorize it but they can't build it up so it it's now comes up to the executive to work with yet another Ford power to prevent this group of individuals for reaching one of our southern border entry points\nLet me go to Steve in Florida on line six I think Steve got a good point it relates back to the last time this happened in the April Steve welcome\nTo Jay sec you'll live you're on the air\nHey guys do you do they were good Steve our military\nHas your ability to put a temporary we're just showing why don't we have the ability to do the same thing with walls with these people will be at over a thousand miles away it should be able to set up\nI Believe we actually did that when he was the smaller groups so back in April there were wall set up a to make sure that individuals or that was a much smaller number again that we're talking about uh about Fifteen hundred total ... ended up being about five hundred that made it to the wall but there was a wall in\nPlace I I don't know if it was a temporary structure put there by the military or certainly one that was reinforced hairy so yes you could Harry certainly have the time with a thousand miles out or twenty two hundred miles out depending on which border crossing a this group decides to go to if they split up to go to different\nA border crossings there there are certainly times to reinforce specific areas of the border\nI think you're absolutely right Jordan ha it's important also to note that the border between the United states and Mexico is very very long yeah and so the U.S military or to the extent that they are able to put up temporary structures to impede\nA border crossings are they will perhaps have to wait a bed in the sense to find\nOut what direction of the caravan is going to take\nA but there will still then be time to put up some temporary structures to impede the caravan from crossing into the United states but I also think we should focus um most of our efforts at the moment\nOn diplomatic ah ... efforts with respect to Mexico um I think secretary of state pump pale according to CNN News just said that the caravan will not cross our southern border illegally under any circumstances you know\nAnd so that is why I think again very important folks to ... this is a this is the executive branch issue right now\nCongress could certainly pass federal laws prevent this in the future but right now the executive has to deal with\nWhat they're dealing with we come back we'll take more your phone call second half hour one eight hundred sixty

secular we are taking your phone calls at\nOne eight hundred sixty four thirty what had just an update you briefly because I Do all the news networks recovery right now so we're not going to adore it they're suspicious packages that have been intercepted uh that we're going to the hopes that President Obama\nA former President Bill Clinton and secretary of State Hillary Clinton uh George Soros I see it in water sitter and if there's even a potentially in Florida to would've Debbie Wasserman Schultz is the Congress will but\nOne of her field offices in state offices in Florida it appears that there's certainly some kind of leak\nBetween the individual or individuals\nWho put together a these are devices a thankfully no one has been injured none of these devices has exploded a but there's still an active law enforcement ... going it appears to be leaked\nAll these devices do appear to be leaked we will continue to update you throughout our show today\nAs the news wards are the biggest news is probably the Thai border center in New York called Columbus Circle is evacuated that includes a what a ... major hubs includes also a a major hotel the Mandarin Oriental a shopping center restaurants\nA a grocery store and other offices so that is significant that it is shut down such an important building\nAn area in New York City the other issue that we're focusing on the most take your calls about the ... is this caravan\nOf fourteen thousand a day that's what the estimate is fourteen thousand heading towards\nA U.S border coming down through Mexico a but had it been eating out of the Honduras or add a this is much larger than the care of it that was dealt with back in April which edits biggest point was Fifteen hundred we do their political motivations behind this caravan from the left\nOut of Central America specifically out of Honduras\nThe conservative president of ... ask people to return and offered them assistance it help to get back on their feet ed does so they're doing the right thing but they don't have the power\nTo get these people back so we've got to work with Mexico before this ends up on our border or the estimates are there about a thousand miles away from the closest Porter a tree it Texas\nEnded a couple of thousand miles away from the border a tree in California we're going to take your phone calls on it now one eight hundred sixty four thirty what did I just called for Pennsylvania on line one I welcome to Jay Sekulow live\nA happy Wednesday they\nMy question is could be a couple of the first they would stay in their own troops also provide some type of care provision for the court\nAnd it would eliminate some of the responsibility and some of the pointing going on towards the U.S and this is more than just the waste issue\nI think right now the U.S is doing reports that an estimated the number of people I don't ever it in fact\nPatsy on Facebook right wrote it will the U.S tried to get involved so she was taking the safety I\nAh I see that what is troubling is that whether you it gets involved or they will start telling everyone who has to take you know ... the numbers at city of refugee camps and I don't think that's the situation we want to be at right now I think this could be handled\nBy two major powers the United states and Mexico\nWho work side by side this is not good for Mexico the U.S could provide the support to make sure the Mexican authorities have the support is a scary to prevent this from causing more trouble in Mexico it ultimately trouble on our border in the United states to by the way we talk about\nWhat's happening towards our border we're talking about what's happening in Mexico that they're dealing with because until you cross over your in Mexico so this is they have a serious interest\nBe much better than the situation for you it Honduras so you have\nThe obligation to declare a that that that is where you will declare your refugee status but it does not appear that those laws that are all the books are being strongly allied forces off by the United states that's something Congress could tight but it's also something the ministry she could do a through customs and border patrol\nAs well as you know when these caravans you're passing through multiple countries why didn't you declare refugee status earlier Joseph has a question about that called in for Georgia on line to Joseph welcome to Jay Sekulow live\nThere and ... and came on I was just\nWondering I drove to our National Guard down here I Know it's not an or not they put up a temporary structure I was wondering if when you send the military can we just try it out or get some coordination with Mexico and set up something ... water where we could provide food shelter clothing that fat and the other\nSo that people that do have like a immediate need need this kind of things that need water or medical supplies can get taken care of and pulled out of that ... that kind of broken up ...\nWell it depends on how far the care of it gets I think a Joseph ... I'll go to\nHarry first go around I think this is for everybody to answer ... briefly if the caravan get that close the U.S border yes there will likely be some kind of supplies set up in the U.S wants to start process a process see uh some of the people are but the idea is that it will not get\nA be allowed to where he was actually ... get to that point\nI think you're absolutely right so our objective should be to send the flow of the caravan while they're still in Mexico or in Central America that's number one and then number two we should have\nSteps in mine or should they moved further and closer to the American border as why not\nTime right now to get Eddie ... let me just say this there's also thousands of humanitarian groups the U.S and Mexico could work with to provide the humanitarian need so that it does it become a direct country it's incentive [noise] like if I reached the U.S border they're going to take care of me that\nBecomes an incentive so I think it's best for the nonprofit world who should rush to these kind of a situation regardless of the politics of player the immigration politics to play and if people are indeed help those who are in need and we could that these countries can facilitate that as well and we will come right back much Jay Sekulow alive\nHe can ... from a half mile away here with\nPinpoint accuracy and detect the slightest motion with a three hundred and ten degree field\nVision but with an Oak Ridge hunting blood from ... backyard structures that here we'll never know you're there are a solid silent sank controlled satisfaction guarantee you this is one perch he will fall out of ... delivered and set up free of charge\nTake your hundred to a whole new level users backyard dot\nCom [noise] this is Chris Abernathy of Abernathy in Hagerman you don't want the government deciding what happens to your state or how much they will take at Auburn Afghan Hagerman state administration is the heart and soul of our practice we have the experience to help not only plan\nBut administer your state properly to protect your assets minimize taxes and ensure that your inheritance gets to the ones you love beside for yourself\nAbernathy in Hagerman legal help that lasts a lifetime visit a dash H. dot law\n[noise]\nToday say you'll live you know what our last segment the broadcast we take as many phone calls we can one eight hundred\nSix eight four thirty one ten if you had time to join us on the air you got a call right now one eight hundred six eight for three one zero that's one eight hundred six eight for three one what is your let's listen to New York up is doing a press conference right now the mayor speaking ...\nCrashed against locations in New York City [noise]\nI Want to let all New Yorkers no go about your daily routine knowing the N. Y. P. D. and all these other agencies are here to protect you [noise]\nIt's important to note that this is ongoing as we have more information will provide [noise]\nThat I emphasize there is no specific threat against any other location\nThere you go it appears that it was very targeted\nTowards maybe CNN\nOr the Clintons a a George Soros the Obamas in Washington potentially Debbie Wasserman Schultz is a Florida State office\nAs well ah thankfully none of these devices exploded no it has been injured a security measures that have been put in place a bit of work so far we pray that they continue to do so and let me just say if it's the final time we address it on air today\nUh we can ... the fullest extent this kind of activity especially it appears ... somehow motivated just by putting these leaks together\nIdeologically there's no place for that the United states we can have vigorous discourse we do not do this to each other\nAnd whoever or if it's a group of people who is behind this should be prosecuted to the full extent of the law\nBe put behind bars for very serious violations of crime in the United states uh back to the phones we go we're talking about this issue with the caravan only Thirteen Days after the midterm elections you cannot\nAgain you just can't uh uh\nI Try to say that well you know tried to divide a I guess divorce the issue of the midterm elections\nAnd the care of an issue and the immigration issue it's all coming to a head at the same time by the way it would be see news reporter uses suspicious package was also intercepted there was addressed the former attorney general holder this is unacceptable folks uh\nI don't care what kind of politics you have this is unacceptable\nAs an organization that also has received these kinds of packages before\nI'm a ... it's it's always not acceptable regardless of what side of the ... at all it's criminal you should be prosecuted or add a and they get thanks to our law enforcement officials\nAnd those officials who intercept these packages or before they make it a a two are there to did targets a it take for that so far has been what is happening today let's talk about the caravan a lot of calls coming in about that\nLet's go to Chris to California or lied for Christian welcome to Jay sexual alive\nAnd well thank you for taking my call um I my comment is I I don't see any thing but\nThat Noah taping sent to the border and I think the hippie my question is I read something about a state governors participating and you know president meeting their support what can it anything\nJerry Brown do here in California to keep my center at writing these people come across the border I\nHave to stay out of the way maybe let his as state guard\nAssisted the national guard or any other U.S forces of border patrol that were necessary uh instead of letting politics or a dominate his decision making unfortunately I think there are two days out from mid term elections\nI'm at a very liberal a governor is likely not going to to make those decisions so I think it best he can stay out of the way\nLet a local law enforcement there in California do the right thing where she would the federal government or who is there to provide the main support when it comes to our border it's the federal government uh that that are defending our border and also deals with situations at the border but but yeah I could I I\nSee where you're going with is what could California's governor do\nAt some of the state government officials there who are very liberal do to try and help a ... and even encourage these kind of care of ads in the future and I think that's a serious problem\nLet me go to a ... that it did not to say I've been an anti first the idea that politicians we looked up the group behind this they're based in Oakland, California does surprise there and it's a village Without Borders is what it translates to take your donations they organized these caravans right out of California\nRight now I agree with it what you said your and the governor of California needs to stay out of this right now he is a very left leaning political a person in the in the country is\nOf and behind the California sanctuary state ideas sanctuary cities that everybody come in open borders no restrictions whatsoever on immigration come on come all that is not the attitude of the administration nor should it be\nA and I think that the best thing for a brown and and those who support his position is to stay out of this and allow the president the United states who is really the chief protector of the borders of the United states the executive branch of government or do what it has to do right now in the face of this tidal wave of humanity that's coming in\nWe're taking calls at one hundred sixty four thirty one too but I Do want to go to say but it'd be his than I think we're just too close to election day or should have been terrible actually people are voting all over the country already right now cast the votes were seeing higher turnout than before of early voting or what do you think the impact this has on the midterm elections I mean this is a\nTop issue for President Trump and a congressional Republicans\nWill join I already thinking played a major role in the election of President Trump he ran on a on securing the border on building a wall on having a

nine seven one seven to for three but I Want to have a conversation now\nA with a good friend who has a new book out and who is pulling no punches he does not pull punches in his writing he does not pull punches when he writes columns for\nA town hall ... he's a senior columnist there and he does not pull punches in interviews he also does not pull punches on Twitter and he got a lot to say which made me say courage liquor author of military\nNormal regular Americans are the\nSame our democracy on the on the reality shows\nSaid let's do this thing to have you back my man how are you [noise]\nHey man great to be here\nMan I there's so much ground to cover I Would like to do the pleasant trees and everything else I Want to talk about your book but I wanted to talk about all of these issues going on Tucson diving right in\nDo you buy the right wing pipe bomb conspiracy or with all of these things being center Soros Obama's Clinton's and CNN because China weeks two weeks before the election Kurt I Do not buy it for one second I smelled false flags being plan to go ahead\nI think it is more likely than not not a right wing conservative outlier viewing this look\nA it is one of three things at the right wing conservative outlier it is a nut who was a political and just wacky or ... is uh someone uh allied with a lap attempting to do exactly what's happening now which is a conservative suburb violent Bob guys\nUm if you look at the evidence we are constantly for how a random shooters are going to turn out to be you know and are a Christian you know what can they may never or never we know that are Democrats have been urging violence and off the grid tactics we know\nThat the law has a history of bombings just look at the Nineteen sixties and seventies it's indisputable\nOr that they did it all it's also indisputable\nThat we did see a nearly endless series of hoaxes mostly hate crime hoaxes on campus or the animal where someone did something horrible y'all idea swastika or news or something and it turned out to be the very same a social justice warrior Victor\nUh trying to create a pressure I don't know the answer you don't know the answer but I Will tell you this I Am not going to allow the meat to tell me that I Can't look at the facts and fake it is a viable possibility I were\nTo blame Donald Trump and sixty three decent Americans who are built this country feed it you'll end up ... a a face on the the the the the sketchy narrative I think what we might occur in real life\n[noise] Kirk but the president came out yes or to today rather and did what a president should do so did the vice president by the way and they called for an end to this they called for civility they called for a no more violence\nHe said very clearly quote in these times we have to unify we have to come together in some one very clear strong unmistakable message\nThat acts or threats of political up any time\nHave no place in the United states of America what I was absolutely true\nThat was of course it's true but but but hold on ... this is what I wasn't really react to\nThe response to that from Senate minority leader Chuck Schumer and house minority minority leader Nancy Pelosi was to rip President Trump suggesting that he didn't mean it saying quote from President Trump's words ring hollow until he reversed is his statements that condone acts of violence they well this statement perks the party that\nActually has Maxine Waters and Cory Booker and Hillary Clinton and countless others out they're calling for acts of violence and instability in the public forum they're the ones saying that it's Trump and the Republicans who are responsible for violence going\nOh look they are ... are they are blind and stupid because they missed the ... oh gosh I've always someone wrote a book called militant normal element Amazon about this very subject\nThey think we're stupid they think we're stupid because Democrats are used to dealing with the people that is for rank and file Democrats [noise]\nIt's not going to work this is going to have the same effect as they thought can always a great idea let's track this guy\nAnd a drink beer and you know had fun in high school that's pressure and the ... that destroyed their way\nThis is another example of a situation that they laid it like sensible adults could only benefit them politically but they will not do it they will apply to bigotry and prejudices against normal Americans and try and paid ... marriage\nAs some sort of a set of violence psychopaths and normal Americans are going to say that's just not true you know whoever did this clearly needs to go to the weather is a right wing outlier a yacht well maybe you need to go that not house\nOr a leftist trying to disrupt um\nAnd there is not a single conservative out there who condones this violence there is not one\nWell I heard that that's that's a big part of this because\nThe moment even when Nancy Pelosi God's shouted down by a bunch of people calling her communist just a few days ago kind of echoing and Mary ... there's been done to\nTed Cruz and and and Mitch McConnell and Elaine Chao and it's a Sanders and so in the summer of immediately conservative condemned condemn condemn cannot you can't do that stop that nonsense we don't like it when it's on to us do not do it to them dishes bull crap we're better than that\nNow this uh these these ... you know explosive devices potentially we don't even know by the way right now what they are or or where they came from we do know immediately we condemn condemn can never get them\nWhen the left is doing all of these things Kurt over and over and over again when these leftist mobs and cheaper it's so cetera et cetera are carrying out these actually I'm Still waiting for the first word of hey don't do that from anybody in a in a position of authority on the American last none\nWere you won't you won't see because they're not against it they're poor ... they're there for\nThat that's the difference in normal people that they've got about hey had about good six eight hours a day where where they could have taken the high road and maybe maybe scored some political points and it's a political season or ... or ... points\nBut once again have overplay their hand because they hate us normal people so much\nThey don't even bother to try and understand where we may be coming from so that they might be able to craft a message that appeals to us instead they say you know Trump's encouraging violence and they look at Trump and he's not encourage and they look at themselves and they're not racist sexes hate filled and they don't like buying\nA and they didn't like it when as normal Americans do they went overseas and defended their country they are\nImmediately said this is more democratic alone and you know they are not going to discount the possibility this is some are too clever by ... crying by sending you know bombs and apparently don't work very well and uh uh to people who ... who they know we're going to screen them and catch up\nAnd you know that that is entirely off and they're like a discount that costs about ... once chickens count that possibility\nThe the the truth is what the facts are and you know of actually either this person will never be caught or the secret service would that be either grab them and we will find out who this person is\nAnd you know why I betcha it's going to be like every other situation where we had one of these where we were told we were responsible for some warm all\nAll those things and then they find it somewhat sympathizer\nYup planning on all sides in order in order to to make conservatives looked at right before the election I got to get
