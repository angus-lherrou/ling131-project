we're going to talk to an expert in tax in the state planning to find out whether or not the president and his family engaged in law ...\nIn tax avoidance schemes or did they do something illegal\nLet me just read you part of the articles of very very long article some of us would probably prefer to wait for the movie\nThe contrary to Trump's assertion that he received one million dollars from his dad and turned it into a ten billion dollar fortune it says that he received in today's dollars at least four hundred and Thirteen million dollars from his father's real estate empire ... much of it through tax Dodgers in the Nineteen nineties into Fort\n... participated in dubious pack schemes during the Nineteen nineties including quote instances of outright fraud\n\nThat greatly increased the fortunately receive from his parents investigation by the New York times has found that we're going to ask my expert did the Trump family engage in quote outright\nFraud\nSaid that much of the money came to Trump quote because he helped his parents dodged taxes she and her siblings set up sham corporation to this guy's millions of dollars and gifts\nRecords indicate that Mr Trump help his father taking proper tax deductions worth millions health formulate a strategy to undervalue his parents real estate holdings by hundreds of millions of dollars on tax returns sharply reducing the tax bill when those properties were transferred him and his siblings\nThe article said quote be maneuvers met with little resistance from the IRS calls but what does that mean met with little resistance you mean it was lawful you mean the Irish didn't care I mean the IOC didn't challenge it what are you saying\nSays that Fred and Mary Trump from parents transferred\nOver one billion dollars in wealth to their children which could produce a tax bill of at least five hundred and fifty million under the fifty five percent tax rate than imposed on gifts in an inheritance is but the trumps paid\nOnly about fifty two point two million or about five percent of that\nQuote according to tax experts it's unlikely that Mr Trump would be vulnerable to criminal prosecution for helping his parents he paid taxes because the acts happened too long ago and our past the statute of limitations\nThere is no time limit however on civil fines for tax fraud I'm going to find out from our expert whether or not the president should be worried about a civil fines for quote tax fraud court\nNow what is it based at one\nTime says the findings are based on interviews with Trump's former employees and advisors and more than a hundred thousand pages of documents describing the inner workings and the men's profitability of its empire they include documents from public sources mortgages at the deeds probate records financial disclosure reports\nInvestigation also draws on tens of thousands of pages of confidential record bank statements financial audit accounting lectures cash disbursement reports invoices cancelled checks\nQuote most notably the documents include more than two hundred returns from Fred Trump his company's in various Trump partnerships and trust\nWhile the record do not include the president's personal tax returns and review little about his recent business dealings at home and abroad dozens of corporate partnerships and tax returns offered the first public accounting of the income he received for decades from various family enterprises\nFifth Fred was a relentless in finding creative ways to channel money to his children that Trump when he was three years old already earning two hundred thousand two hundred thousand dollar from his dad quote the most overt fraud\nWas all county building supply and maintenance\nThat's a company formed by the Trump family Nineteen Ninety two cars in New York Times all counties ostensible purpose was to be the purchasing agent for ... for Fred Trump's buildings by everything from boilers to cleaning supplies\nIt did no such thing records in interviews show instead all county siphon millions of dollars from Fred Trump's him empire by simply marking their purchases already made by his employees\nThose millions effectively untaxed gifts then slowed to all these owners Donald Trump his siblings and a cousin Fred then use the padded all county receipts to justify bigger ... increases for thousands of tenants\nAgain I Will ask my expert in just a few minutes did\nDoes any of this melted something illegal doesn't amount to fraud I'm holding in my baby brown libertarian fingers and article from force magazine data July eight year of our lord twenty fourteen headline held the one billion dollar Kennedy family fortune defies death\nAnd taxes\nQuote protected by a labyrinth of trust as well as tax credits that would make jokes at the Kennedy proud because before Janelle spans approximately thirty family members including the surname Schreiber offered and Smith\nThe bulk of the family's wealth is held in trust which range and value from tens of thousands too much at twenty five million nearly all are managed by Joseph keep the Kennedy enterprises\nLocated in New York City the trust also protect the family after it from another set of prime fingers uncle Sam's by holding assets in so called dynasty dynasty trust which are passing air to air for decades if not longer the Kennedy family is largely insulated from the estate tax\nHandled correctly a dynasty trust could potentially maintain and on taxable fortune indefinitely the oldest Kennedy trust on record dates back to Nineteen thirty six and then they talk about the sale of the family's most\n... ... s at the iconic merchant my merchandise marching in Chicago\nOnce thought to be the largest building in the world and thanks to a carefully crafted deal the Kennedy family deferred or possibly voted completely capital gains tax or nearly half the value of the sale\n\nThe secret sauce however is accepting partnership unit in lieu of cash diverse capital gains tax\n\nIf the partnership units are placed in trust capital gains taxes could potentially be deferred\nFor ever and difficult\nWhen one of the Kennedy family members who and handled this trust was contacted Christopher Kennedy said and I'm quoting we are a very public family with a very private investment philosophy you wonder how many reporters the New York times ever\nPut on the Kennedy family and how they had their money in these so called generation skipping trust to the for taxes indefinitely if not forever [noise]\nWe'll put another one up on Larry over dot com called Joseph Kennedy and generation skipping trust in this article written by a truck in the state lawyer about what\nThe Kennedy family has done and how they ah got the attention of Congress for it\nSays that Congress a became aware of these so called generation skipping trust and try to do something about it but whatever they did critic other loopholes that other tax lawyers are driving Arnold Schwarzenegger's Hummer through did the president\nOr his father engage in illegal\nOr did they simply hire very shrewd people to minimize their tax liability the way virtually everybody does including John Kerry who say five hundred thousand dollars from his yacht by arguing that he's more and get in Rhode Island even though he really has it in Massachusetts because Rhode Island doesn't have\nThe same amount of taxes did the president or his father engage in anything illegal but talk to an expert about that when I come back also the vote on Brett Kavanaugh maybe this week and the FBI report could come out any moment now I Am Larry Elder do not leave town\nLarry Elder all through all the other [noise]\nIf I knew all the facts I might be able to disapprove mhm so I'll give you an example if you if I make sure I'm suppose that I buy a house for half a million dollars I put twenty percent down and I borrow with a mortgage\nThe remaining four hundred thousand dollars or the purchase price\nNow what is that worth to me what is that included in my network if I if I gave it away at that point what would the value of the if the well the value of the gift will be a hundred thousand dollars because it would be subject to that mortgage and\nSo now let's say there's a downturn like there was in the Nineteen nineties or two thousand three or two thousand eight when everybody lost value in the real estate and now my real estate is worth only four hundred and twenty thousand dollars\nAnd like a lot of clients of mine decided when the downturn came that was a good time to give away real estate to their children mhm so now it's worth four hundred and twenty thousand dollars\nI give it to my children what is the gift that I report on my gift tax return was four hundred and twenty thousand dollars minus a four hundred thousand dollar mortgage and twenty thousand dollars left that would be the value of the gift\nNow a decade later\nThere's been improvements all around the neighborhood knew Tony retailers developments of of of various sizes\nAnd I sell my children's sell that house for seven hundred thousand dollars\nOr have to pay off the mortgage so they keep three hundred thousand dollars I'm not even going to talk about taxes at that point\nBut they kept three hundred thousand dollars and then one could say\nThat they got Fifteen times the valuation of the gift but you see that was perfectly legal they didn't but the article doesn't explain leverage of real estate and so as a result I mean you you can easily said my gosh how could that ever happened how could you ever invest in something\nAnd then sell it ten years later for Fifteen times what a value was when it was given\nReal charge recharge is my guest season attacking estate planning lawyer or read you said there were a couple of things that that jumped out at you and if they could be proven to be true would be problematic what what's the most serious one\nA well and the one that I really found to be a very serious is there's there's a there's a statement that when Donald Trump's a casino was in very bad shape or you know just ... drowning in debt\nThat apparently his father or sent an emissary to buy three million dollars worth of chip\nRead them and put you on hold for for ... for for this we're gonna pick that on the other side I remember when that happened some

for many decades I I just I just can't imagine that suddenly they're going to say oh look what we found\nAnd now they're civil penalties there is one thing that you should know though and that's if if

the New York times article did anything occur to you they gave you an idea of what to do or what not to do it did anything pop up where you said wow I never thought of that or boy that's a bad idea\nNo I mean ... the the article does talk about the most important part of their\nA movement of wealth downstream was to do things to the value\nThe gifts because our gift in a state taxes are what we used to call in Latin class at the lower them they're based upon the value at the date of death or in the case would get it on a date of the gift and so there are techniques which are used to diminish the value of the of the gifts so for example\nIf I were to give you a twenty percent uh ownership of my house just a deed for me to Larry Elder over twenty percent interest\nBut instead I I that that's one value twenty\nPercent of whatever the value is because in California we have the ability to shoot to sell the property if you are a partial owner fractional interest on the other hand if I put it into a partnership or limited liability company the whole property\nAnd in that in the uh organizing documented says nobody can partition this and reduce the only person who can make decisions about the property\nThen you have in your twenty percent you cannot sell it\nAnd you cannot a manager so I have the management control and I have the ownership control and that diminishes your twenty percent so if you went out and tried to sell your twenty percent interest in our partnership\nIt would be far less than a twenty percent of the underlying real property so I've just diminished the value of that has been accepted by the IRS on the courts and the only thing that the IRS argues with practitioners like me is what is the discount that is allowed\nVery commonly it's twenty or thirty percent that's a kind of a safe harbor these days\nWe have just one minute left of the Washington Post I'm Karen ... ah she's a reporter with them described the New York times report as depicting a quote criminal enterprise close quote what you call what you read a criminal enterprise\nWell and if you want to call virtually every ... every closely held building us criminal
