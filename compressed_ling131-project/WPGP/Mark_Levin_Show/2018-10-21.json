laws are obviously racist according to Trevor Noah and of course are targeting people of color and are therefore disproportionately affecting blacks\nRight\nBecause it's not right\nAnd holding in my baby brown libertarian fingers were going to put up on Larry Elder dot com and article from the national review August twenty three twenty sixteen the majority of minorities support voter ID laws\nDoesn't mean that the voter ID laws weren't racists right doesn't mean the aren't disproportionately negatively affect the people of color just means that people are colored too stupid to realize\nAccording to Gallup Seventy seven percent of American spandex and Seventy seven percent of blacks support voter ID laws quote the figure is essentially the same among whites eighty one percent back voter ID laws into quote now regarding the effect negative effect on minorities\nLet me tell you where Mr know a very likely get this from it was a study much researchers University of San Diego Michigan State Bucknell use two thousand six two thousand fourteen data from something called the cooperative congressional elections studies to study the effect of voter ID laws she'd what they concluded quote\nThe analysis shows that strict ID laws have they do for originally negative effect on the turnout of racial and ethnic minorities in primaries in general elections in difficult right smoking gun\nMary likes data and here's a study that shows the voter ID laws are in fact negatively affecting minority voters therefore Larry you must be wrong when you say that they're the institutional racism that people decry does not really exist in America\nExcept there was another study\nResearchers at Stanford Yale University of Pennsylvania looked at the original study this is a ... based on surveys that were quote extremely unreliable which skews the results\nLooking at the broader research article in a publication called box which is not a right wing a publication to left wing publication quote looking at the broader research the empirical evidence has tended to find that voter ID laws have a small impact on the elections\nData just does not support the conclusion quote specifically they found out that the data just do not support that conclusion\n\nThis thing on the other thing about this\nDo you know anybody that doesn't have ID\nRaise your hand you don't you\nKnow anybody that doesn't have ID and if you know somebody doesn't have ID does that person not have\nThe ability to get id and if you don't have id you really think that\nSuch a person's motivated to vote in the first place army Horowitz went out to ask white people what they thought about voter ID laws and on and on and on these are white college kids start to voter ID laws racist why because they thought black people were just two incapable or stupid to get\nId then at the end he asked why people did they know anybody that didn't have ID\nKevin opinion voter ID laws they're usually pretty rapists and [laughter] they're I think voter id law their way to perpetuate waiting for them to say there would you as far as it was a racist for sure it is definitely\nA because they're less likely to have state ideas minority voters are less likely to have the kinds of I mean I'm described\nOr required to be having people don't live in areas with easy access to the employees are the places where they get identification always can I Do\nA do over the Internet that also would make it difficult for the black people in particular\nYeah you have to have access to the Internet you have to be able to pay an Internet service provider for certain things you\nThink that's harder for black people to go on line they don't have the knowledge of how like how it works out ... phone data from us they don't really know why is out there just because they're not aware that important I also think there's a question of like letting with them\nAnd how they how if you're a convicted felon like you're not allowed to have it and everything and when you look at the same states like Florida that's a huge population of the like African American\nNow I'm here in east Harlem that black
