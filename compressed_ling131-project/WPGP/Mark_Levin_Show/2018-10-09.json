history in school is that\nThey're also teaching in many cases the wrong history\nAnd they're they are portraying ah there's they're concentrating on the fact that the founders owned slaves and and uh we had a a kid on this was not a high school kid we had a a college kid on I think he was from Clemson\nAnd he worked I think he was a contributor for the college fix and he was a black conservative

common thing\nNow and it's completely gone that's in large part because of the United states\nAnd I think this kind of negative history this become so common in our schools is incredibly corrosive and destructive I mean it's really dividing us\nI mean as as one nation we are we are going to disintegrate and we're going to fall back on on our ethnic identities were going to fall back on identity rather than our our our uniting identity as Americans who believe in the American dream who believe in the ideas at the heart\nOur constitution of the declaration of independence these were things

Supreme\nCourt and that's the Supreme Court or Pakistan that we've been involved in the American Center for Law Justice for a long time we have an officer lower Pakistan and there is a case involving a Christian Woman named I see a baby and she has been charged and sentenced to death\nFor blasphemy let me go first to skip past year senior counsel international expert bless me in every one of these cases we've been involved in skip there's always something like a blast recharge that's made or level\nAbsolutely and this is a a a charge that his level very often as a way of getting back at somebody so we have a situation where if you have an end the tea or somebody especially a Christian which are second class citizens of Pakistan\nIf you have a ... hour them some argument very often they will alleged last Sunday and blasphemy is a death penalty case if you're convicted last me you're supposed to get the death penalty so what that does that intimidates people and they normally\nAre are so afraid of that that they will give the Muslims what they want so this is exactly the situation we're in countering here and let's remember this poor woman has been in jail since two thousand nine is now twenty Eighteen so she's been in jail waiting through the appellate process for nine years\nCharged again would last me for offering a cup of water to Muslim co workers the person that made the charge against ... was considered a prayer leader mom from this particular village\nHe hasn't actually appear at the hearing and did not give evidence that cheap judge pointed that issue out on now these the pressure these judges are under our\nIt's just the ... we're going to answer your questions by the way\nUp you're Facebooking periscope you could either call one eight hundred sixty four thirty one ten or get your comments in and we'll answer him or social media team is monitoring those right now we'll take your calls at one eight hundred sixty four three one zero let me go to the inventor office in Washington DC we have raised this case Pakistan as an ally of the United states\nWhat's been the Washington response here\nWell this has been a multi year effort for us Jay both internationally in here domestically domestically the lead in this effort in the United States Congress is being led by Senator Rand Paul who has a resolution are called asked read one of seven it demands Pakistan release to see a baby and reformist blasphemy laws\nA JD important thing here about this resolution is a bipartisan nature Sen Paul has eight cosponsors on it\nFour of them are Democrats it and they really range across the spectrum Sen Cruz senator Baldwin Senator Durbin in center mansion have joined with him in that effort\nYou know ultimately Jay we would love the United States Senate to move this piece or as a this resolution of course the United states can't in itself a mandate that Pakistan release her though that's why we've taken it to the human rights council I knew we'll talk about that in a minute but here in Washington the tip of the sphere is this resolution from Senator Rand Paul\nHere's what's interesting go back to the facts on this for a moment to share her ER it says one of the chief justice said the witness testimony did not state that she had used blasphemous language for the holy Koran these are no black blasphemous words were used at all\nOh see in her statement said that she could not even conceive of committing blasphemy that's what the lawyer said the chief justice that seems was wondering where all this so called evidence was Jerry are\nRight and and and that's one of the most important thing I think what happened today was the justices were looking for evidence\nAnd the other side's attorney actually started when when he saw that the justices weren't convinced by the allegations he started courting the chronic versus\nAnd the justice has stopped him and he they told him they said look that we understand that that's the sanctity of the prophet is it is important but that's not what what's going on here we need evidence we're looking for evidence you have to prove that she's guilty of a crime\nSo it's interesting we got a a a Rosanna on Facebook by the way if you've got comments get them into social media teams looking at those and we're taking your calls as well and eight hundred sixty four thirty one ten if you just sort of your papers the baby let us know that pray for those judges do\nVery very important to pray for the judges involved in this having to sharing was high risk and the international community step in or is this really a Pakistani governing issues is Rosanna well there there's both\nThe there is an international pressure being put on both were going to get to the un mom in a moment with a band Bennett who is our a designated representative to the United nations for the European Central injustice our European affiliate uh bought a international community pressure is the reason to see a bb is alive we have found it time and time again with\nThese cases professor Hutchinson that keeping international pressure up is what keeps these people live absolutely\nSo international community pressure is absolutely necessary absolutely essential to maintain the life of a ... baby\nOr it's clear beyond question that there are many people but within the Pakistani community who are prepared to allow these blasphemy charges to go forward with out evidence as a way of course in the minority Christian population within their country\nAnd I think it's absolutely essential for westerners for people from all over the world to mobilize against this effort if we're going to sustain a C a BBC life and sustain the lives of Christians where ever they are throughout the world\nSkip let me ask you this is our international law expert here and the ... runs or international legal group\nGive me your sense of the nature in scope and the importance of his ... obviously we're fighting for this woman's life so you there's nothing more important but this blasphemy issue is he really serious problem on a global scale\nIt really is for instance even in Pakistan we have determined that when you can get a fair trial in Pakistan provide that the issue is not one of these very sensitive issues like last Sunday\nOh this is a problem we have to recall the twenty eleven the former governor one of the states came out in support Abbas yeah baby and he was assassinated because he just took the stand saying that she wasn't getting a fair trial so the pressure on the judges are amazing\nNow what they are what the international Islamic community though is concerned about is that this type of thing and bring discredit upon his law and I and I think they're as concerned about that as anything else and therefore the outside world needs to race and keep the pressure on\nSo that we say this is not what you claim Islam to be\nBut look at why as we look and see what happens in Pakistan we see this law being misused being applied primarily either as to to get a vendetta against somebody or to keep down the minority populations so we have to keep pressure on them so that ah her name is constantly\nUh before the government of Pakistan and before the courts of Pakistan so they will operate in the correct way\nAs I said we're taking comments coming from Facebook and periscope as well as your number of calls that went in hundred sixty four thirty one done\nMaybe in on Facebook wrote this can the u._s. put pressure on Pakistan to his holding international have fan\nHuh yes the answer is yes and we've asked for that on this case in a number of others Pakistan actually gay as one of the largest recipients of us\nAre foreign aid I'm a human rights have have long been something to the United States Congress has done a poor job of of of drawing money down on for Jay we have consistently said if you want to be an ally the United states human rights especially agree just violations like this one\nShould be one of the criteria to continue seeing those dollars Jay we will make that request again next year we think that this should be something that should cost Pakistan or usa\nJerry I'm I'm getting a lot of people I'm looking at some of the Facebooking periscope feed is coming up before a lot of people saying they're going to pray for the judges let's\nSkip mentioned that the governor that came out in favor of a C B was assassinated what's the pressure like on these judges\nWell just by looking at today's hearing there were a lot of Muslim clerics present in the court I just received an email from a from her office there in which a they have told me that\nA Pakistani Muslim group has released a video in which they have noticed this uh this hearing and they are saying that\nThe a false accusing the blast me is in itself a form of blasphemy and then that can put people to be more careful in the future about making ... ... per se accusation\nGym on periscope asked this question if you had a question of ... for getting her social media teams looking at right now can the un do anything I feel like\nThey're a joke when it comes to these types of cases actually they can be quite helpful in these types of cases I've got issues with the United nations but they they can be a very important force than to utilize international as you said international leverage it can be very important\n[noise] well I think there's a reason to be frustrated in frankly those frustrations where the ... region to the United states officially left the human rights council we talked about this many times have you put the wrong members in the human rights council their effectiveness to officially stand in the way of actions like this is very much\nUh to the detriment so I thought the United states leaving was the right call there but we as the ISI L. J. engaging\nThrough formal intervention sometimes they're written and sometimes they're oral Jay is one of the blessed platforms that we have uncovered for keeping a case like this in in the in the visibility of the international community and look I I'm I'm at a ... if there wasn't visibility on this case I'm convinced you to see eighty would not\nBe allowed to know that yeah I was gonna say she'd be debt I mean ... professor ... she would be without an international attention that sense would have been executed absolutely so if\nYou look at this from the context of the domestic political atmosphere in Pakistan this would be an easy case for the justice in other words they could throw out the presumption of innocence they could throw out the rule of law because they're under intense pressure\nFrom Harare clerics and activists or to execute someone for a crying she did not commit so it's absolutely essential to maintain international political pressure or so that the outcome of this case can be reversed\nIn her paper All right we've got thirty more minutes of this broadcast so if you want to stay with us we appreciate that and ... you know how to do it you're listening on radio just go over to a C. O. J. dot org or Facebook or periscope broadcasting it there wouldn't be back with more than just a minute but again [noise]\nPray for these ... of course her family to pray for these judges that are going to make that decision could come out of any literally\nAt any moment and it's that important\nThat we hear from you on this really critical that we hear from\nYou on this uh and that you're

Monday reserved it's judgment on the final appeal against the execution of a sea it'd be but the hearing went very well uh normally Ninety percent of cases as we've said that they get a decision right away this one they're holding we think that's where security purposes\nJordan has been following this case sports a lot of our international work especially in the persecution issues he's been heavily involved in this area to say when I asked\nHim about it for to have a special report on a C a bb this is the case involving the Christian Woman who's been sentenced to death\nIn Pakistan or for sharing her faith they accused her of blasphemy case she's been in jail for eight years she's a mother we had been heavily involved in our case where her case we have an office in Pakistan has been involved directly in the case\nAnd um I Will tell you how heated it's become when we sent out a request for people to pray about a pray for her and her family in the lawyers are handling the case I I did this over the weekend because the hearing was today\nUm that we started this we saw all of a sudden I'm moving the technical term I guess it just is what they just the people that were writing really\nHorrible things about a sea of baby we were saying pray for people were say hang on for ... hang a C B but\nYeah I mean there's multiple in English is hashtags running through in the U.S has spoken in Pakistan as well but\nUm it's a again to anything positive about a sea of baby so I wouldn't be enough you tweak things out and only ... with your Twitter account that but it's happening worldwide not just to our Twitter is ... I'm ... this call for what section of surreal all to do it under a as we said this is the death penalty case\nAnd are these are Pakistan primarily a a Muslim Pakistanis who are calling for her to be executed ... so its hang her execute or kill her punish her\nAnd uh and again this makes it so a dangerous for the judiciary there because they've judges have died in the past that the court as well as other cabinet members who have expressed support for a sea of baby has now been in prison or eight years so difficult\nTo you I mean I'm going blue we'll we'll do this in the moment but we'll get back to the top of a bond that see a bb cases for a moment here this was I mean this is the hearing this was the hearing ...\nYes sir we because we talked to sharia are Gail from our office right he said this is I mean this is\nYeah it's just that they X comes a verdict and there's no timeline on that most cases in Pakistan even the Supreme Court so very I'm like ours\nAt the highest score their language this three judge panel or the chief justice did sit on this one we know that um that's a pretty ... Ninety percent come\nThat day yeah relatively right ... yeah um this is it important cases so the other ten percent they do take time but I don't it's not usually the time like here where it could be months and months and months from our screw court\nThis this could happen at any moment there's probably a lot of security concerns that risk here there's geopolitical issues at risk here um and I get nervous because of what these judges face so I'm a what we saw before is is even like you get to this point and judges start leaving so you don't have a core um so you can have a verdict\nYou got to go through it again I get nervous about all of that because you know they're under sound like you're hearing one very well the hearings have gone well for her is that the judges have either been killed or have quit\nAnd and again I think that's ... that's a ... we get people more and more update on the news comes in and we're gonna we're gonna give you a full ... hour on that Mars that big of a case I Would prefer the judge is\nIn a situation I mean that's the only ... and even the prosecutors ... the government officials at the police um her attorneys as well of course her family but I Know you're doing that uh but but especially for those judges not none of the decision a but but John or their safety um even while they're\nUm they're deciding a because what we know the other side is that has tried to harass or kill them\nBefore they got into a decision points\nSo the ...

A. G. eat triple late nights have been one to four three very oh the relief effort dot com studio the United states ambassador to the United nations Nikki Haley has hindered her resignation the president has accepted it here's what she said\nWell I Want to say on a first of all I Want to thank for just you know allowing us to come out and talk to you the way it is then and honor and a lifetime I you know I said I in fact I'm lucky girl\nAnd keep in mind she did not support him during the twenty sixteen campaign\nAnd then I Want to leave the state separate and to serve our country I Love very much\nHas really been a blessing and I want to thank you for that but I'm not a big sign and we'll get to work at what has happened in two years with the United states on foreign policy now the United states if we're back this country's may not like we do stay with that what we do\nThey know that if we say we're going to do something we follow it through and the president for that whether it was with the chemical weapons in Syria whether it was NATO saying that other countries have to pay their share I mean whether to the trade deal forgive and amazing they get the pie\nThat means that ... and they followed through with it\nWhether it's his promise to move the American embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem she should've included that but he's done so much now you can't expect me to remember everything\nBut then if you look at just the two years in the last one point three billion and the un by we've made it dawned on me and made it more so than we got an arms embargo which was a long time coming green North Korean sanctions um\nPackages which we're the largest and generation done in a way that we can really work for the music or I think North Korea and the Iran deal bringing attention to the world that every country need to understand\nYou can't overlook the fall of the bad things they're doing do you have to see them for the threat than they are [noise] um I think you look at the anti Israel violence and the strikes\nAnd courage that the president showed in moving the embassy and\nShowing the rest of the world we had ... are endless things where\nWe want to put our and [noise] you know all of those things had made a huge difference in the U.S stands out I can tell you that\nI'm\nThe U.S has a strong again and the U.S is drawing in a way to make all American fearing proud and\nI Do want to say that it's not just surprising I Want to thank the family in general and the first lady has been nothing but very very kind to me um I Can't say enough good things about Jared ... dairy is such a thing you know and understand I mean to\nA hidden genius no one understand wow\nWhere do you do the NAFTA deal the way he began I'm what I've done working with him on the middle east peace of\nMind it is so unbelievably well done and an office in just a great friend and they do a lotta things behind the thing that I Wish more people knew about because we're about our country because there and I'm a minister I should also just have to say for a\nBetter country because Jerry ... in a bunker in the administration wow and Nikki Haley is one of the probably the cabinet member who is the most respected although the United nations ambassador is not typically a cabinet level position but of the top\nOfficials and the Trump Administration to people on the left she probably is the most popular\nI'm certainly and that's great on the curb of course\nMy family Michael at the same\nAnd um my two little ones I adore than entertaining us un yeah they sacrificed a lot a lot of time and energy into it [noise] um but\nAs they have a lot of heart and really wanted to make\nAmerica a proud and so with that I'm not leaving\nUntil the end of the year my goal is that we make sure that everything is in good flakes and on that for the next ... to come in but it's a great day in the United states and I'm proud to have been part of the team and now I don't have anything he sat on where I'm going to go I think that um the main thing was\nI was got an hour or six years and we've dealt with a hurricane a thousand year ... shooting a school shooting there was a lot and then to come in and you can hear of Russia and\nIran and North Korea it's been eight years of intense time and I'm a believer in her mind that's I think you have to be self what's enough to know when you step aside and allow someone else to do the job so they can\nNot surprising in a lifetime and I will tell you this um if are all in here that are going to ask\nAbout twenty twenty no I'm not running for twenty twenty\nI Can't tell me she when I'll be doing as campaigning for this one so I'll look forward to supporting the president and the next election is I\nWanted to do this because politically ambassador to the United nations has been very special to me she's done an incredible job\nShe's a fantastic person very important blame but she also is somebody that gets it and she has been [noise] at the United nations from the beginning with us\nFrom the beginning and work with us so they can pay and it's been really a long time very intense and she told me probably six months ago she said you know\nMaybe at the end of the year the end of a two year period but the end of the year\nI wanted to take a little time off a little but she's been a very successful you know governor of South Carolina for years and then she uh she did this and this is possibly even more in tune with what's going on in the world is very dangerous thing\nA lot of things what she's doing a fantastic job and we've done a fantastic job together we solve a lot of problems or one of the process of selling a lot of problems at the beginning of North Korea was a massive problem we're moving along move it along really nicely I can speak for\nSecretary of state Mike Pompeo is things\nIn the world of nicotine and so we're all we're all happy\nFor you in one way we have to lose hopefully it will be coming back as someone\nWho is this is gonna be a different capacity to that effect but uh I just wanted to let you know so at the end of the year next year will be leaving home\nDay will be in constant touch I Know that whenever you have an air there's you know all the players that I was doing the thing I think she did vested in either they should she got to know the players [noise] she got to know China Russia\nIndia she knows everybody very first day basis or they like it\nExcept for maybe a couple of minutes left I get all like it but they do they really like how do I think maybe more importantly they respect her [noise] so the gear just wanted to tell you that we will miss you were speaking all the time but we will miss you never do is have you done this at this job but I Want\nTo thank you very much [noise]\nNow are competing friends in the media really really really wanted her to leave in a hot\nTo suggest that she was not happy with a boss like Donald Trump instead she thanked him she was grateful she said she intends to campaign for him and twenty twenty no intention to run against him and twenty twenty to primary you\nSpoke respectfully isn't interesting how people read the Trump Administration this turbulent chaotic administration in states such nice things about it\nAnd as for why I Believe she's leaving her that she just burned out I think it's a difficult job and he's difficult boss he's demanding he puts a lot of stuff in the box and I think a lot of people can't keep up the man sleep four or five hours a night\nHe's frenetic he wants to accomplish a lot and I think for people to have to do the stuff he wants to do with a lot of work a lot of pressure\nProbably two years under this president is like four years on any other president people come and people go is a story about two new rock knew the legendary coach of no reading\nAnd he was ill one and he had an assistant coach the game in the in the system won and won pretty handily and new rock and he admitted to one of the seniors at the college that bothered him that uh this assistant won the game and his dad\nAnd the man said well we are all useful but none of us is necessary\nAnd that includes president United States\nThe sun is going to rise in the eastern set in the west irrespective of what happens we keep going [noise] people come and people go into the ministry\nAnd those who don't like the administration always looking for the ulterior reason doesn't appear to be you know to have a reason she doesn't have another job so parents who does not have an offer that's substantial she decided to quit I think she just wanted a break all that travel all that stress\nPresident to always complained about how the NATO countries and not a pony up the amount of money they're supposed to this president complain and\nDid something about it [noise] ... job Nikki Haley triple a nine to one is a teachable late night to the ones that do fortunately\nI'm Larry

but this is a different order and ... Democrats are pointing out only as a way this was handled by in the history of partisanship on the Supreme Court your decision to block Merrick Garland a is something they see is that as having kicked off on a new stage in the partisanship associated with the Supreme Court nominees\n'cause I don't know much history you have to go back to Eighteen eighty to find the last time a Senate controlled by a different party\nFrom the president confirmed a Supreme Court justice to a break on the creative in the middle of a presidential election they also conveniently forgotten the Joe Biden said and I think Ninety two when he was chairman of Judiciary Committee Democrats control the Senate Republican in the White House if a vacancy occurred they wouldn't fill it also conveniently forgot that\nChuck Schumer and Harry Reid Eighteen months before the end of Bush forty three set up as a Supreme Court vacancy occurred\nThey wouldn't fill it out or ...\nRight but Mr later I don't think that's right in Nineteen fifty six Eisenhower nominated Brennan and data for Congress was a Democrat controlled and also on the vitamin rule Joe Biden was talking in the abstract there was no nominee no nominee was blocked and he said to not have the nomination come up before the election but that it couldn't come up after\nThe election and so a Democrat say when they hear you're doing this as they say he's creating new rules just actually knew what he wants to do and as you've written in your book the long game when you do that it actually hurts democracy\nYeah well that's not exactly a thought at all what happened John you're completely miss controlling what a lot I got to be with the history of this I Know the history of this I've spent a lot of time on this throughout my career what I did was entirely consistent with what the history of the Senate it's been in that situation and going back to Eighteen eighty\nSo John Dickerson CBS says no you're wrong because the Democrats approved an election year Supreme Court nominee in Nineteen fifty six John King of CNN\nThey also conveniently forgotten the Joe Biden said and I think Ninety two when he was chair of the Judiciary Committee Democrats control is a Republican in the White House it was back in the uk or they wouldn't fill it\nI don't think that's right in Nineteen fifty six Eisenhower nominated Brennan data for Congress was a Democrat controlled and also on the Bible rule job I was talking in the abstract there was no nominee no nominee was blocked\nInto a thought at all what happened John you're you're completely misconstrue and whatever\nI'm a college right on the history of Eisenhower gave a recess appointment in Nineteen fifty six the formal nomination\nFor that it didn't happen until after the presidential election year than McConnell is right or the ...
