you love children and you care for them and you want\nOnly good things to happen for them and you do not want their parents in society at large using them as pawns in scientific experiments that are

around later tonight no not really I don't know where it is but I don't how many people they are but it's it's building and it said it this way and it's going to be interesting to see what happens when they as they get closer to the border\nBut you know there's there's one very prominent Democrat who has\nA he's had enough of this this illegal immigration and you just have enough\nNot only of them trying to get in but the people who are already here and he's a Democrat and a ... this is a must really be upset about this caravan but I Do know that he does not think it's right that we have so many people getting into the country illegally and so many people who are here being allowed to stay or listen to this\nVery generous and welcoming people here in the United states but those who enter the country illegally\nAnd those who employ them just respect the rule of law and they are showing disregard for those who are following the law\nWe simply cannot allow people to pour into the

he said I think he put her chances of winning it eighty nine percent about twenty minutes before the the polls opened up a back in two thousand and sixteen so I wouldn't worry too much about what a what Nate says\nUh and and I think one thing that everybody should have learned in twenty sixteen but it's pretty obvious that nobody did\nIs that you just don't look at the polls are people just ah

take your calls at winning hundred sixty four thirty one ten let me go to a quickly here really quick to west Smith curls for so what's what's your initial reaction to this\nYou know what what is happening Jay we're witnessing is the lack of unaffected domestic policy that these are the immigration reform is creating a true national security issue because of the lack of reform and lack of border security and it does have serious implications\nNo question about it All right we're going to take your calls one eight hundred sixty four three one zero the national security\nEmergency on our borders a caravan of people on their way to the United\nStates no possible way to process that amount of people is going to be a rush to the border we don't know we'll take your calls at eight hundred

interests so he switched and say this year's story has a happy ending\nAfter all am twelve fifty the answer the answer [noise]\n\nSome ... some call it an attempt an invasion let me tell you what the president said\nWe want people\nTo come into our country we have a three point ... percent unemployment so is this better more than fifty\n\nSo that's what the president said he's declared that it's a basically a a national emergency but there's an interesting issue here and I want to point this out uh we had an interesting a comic coming on Facebook\nOr that I wanted to have met a west address because he made his point already and then as soon as you know Facebook said how can the mixing with already deal with the caravan of this size and as soon as a go ahead what's got him when you said it's really important\nYeah well they sent down five hundred Mexican federal police to try and stop them at the southern border of Mexico and they were incapable of doing that was going to happen is if if this crowd of people thousands of people are allowed to come to our border as our own border patrol is overwhelmed and they will be\nThe drug cartels and human traffickers who use are porous border on a daily basis\nThey will take advantage of this distraction with our border patrol being ... you know over power in distracted and they will use other crossings to continue their drug trade\nAnd to continue the human trafficking that goes on there so they will take full advantage of our own border patrol being overwhelmed there's no way the president border agents we have can handle a crowd of this size\nSo Harry let me ask you this let's get we're going to take some calls him over here but let's talk about a policy standpoint what do you do if you present the United states and the governors of these states on the border if there is a rush to the border well further may well be\nFirst whatever the administration dogs and whatever those are state governors do must be done in a carefully calibrated and morally defensible manner\nAt the same time be over all objective ought to be to defend our borders it's important to note that defending America's borders used to be a bi partisan activity\nOf America's borders were strongly defended in the past by President Obama mice a secretary of State Hillary Clinton but today it seems like there is only one party that is interested in protecting the American people\nFrom an invasion of individuals'\nWhich includes drug smuggling and human smuggling and human well the ...\nI'm Sorry to hear the last thing that we want to see is a mass brutal slaughter at the border that's the last\nVision in my mind and the terrifying\nA vision that I see of something like that is something that we don't want to see fire opening up on these people will be no has some of them are legitimate asylum seekers and they're being used by and they're being manipulated this is a manipulation of the governments of these countries and that's the last thing that we want to see but it is border control that is absolutely necessary\nHow do you do that and and in these very challenging waves that you see coming in is the question yet to be answered\nAll right let's go ahead and take a phone call we've got Robert calling from Detroit Michigan on line one Hi Robert\nHow ... how are you know we gave the number you know and everybody every one of the crisis if somebody gets hurt it's going to be all over and you know the reason why the Guatemalan election on with everybody can't stop it ... it because it very weak alive\nYou know all of our police and out because you know that was going to get hurt and so\nYeah but you can you hear the prompt here's the problem Robert ... the problem is and I I think it's wet and he said his right you cannot author I mean unless there was fire on coming at you you're not going to authorize firearm approach here so I mean I don't know\nAnd this is a it is a very serious political issue it is a very serious serious human issue\nIt's a very serious national security issue that is what we're looking at here\nAnd west when you look at you know you had to deal with this in the military when you went to a border regions\nYou know most countries are pretty tough on the border we haven't been but this is going to this has become can become a as a president said is a national emergency ready because it's almost like an approaching they call it a caravan whenever you can just imagine fourteen thousand people that's the right number of\nSome of them are Mexican media sources are saying we're we're the un is saying seven thousand Mexican media sources are saying fourteen thousand but the ... that can be very dangerous and very hard to deal with\nYeah absolutely it is a national security issue for the reasons you just mentioned also it is a fact that out of the tens of thousands of people that are intercepted crossing the border illegally and those only the ones that the border patrol catches\nHundreds of them every year are also from the middle east and they pass themselves off as being Hispanic and uh you know the the president in saying this is a national emergency has said he's going to send the military I'm assuming by that he means the active duty forces to that\n... Neal is what that would mean what would that look like what's your ... your other call you colonel Smith when we talk about the military what does that look like Arnold Smith\nYou know the his critics will say well he can't do that because of the ... of Eighteen Seventy eight that actually was at the end of reconstruction following the American civil war the actors very clear and says you cannot use\nFederal military to enforce domestic laws and policies but by the president I think rightfully seeing this as a national security issue\nIs no longer a domestic issue it's a matter of protecting our borders protecting the homeland so I think he will kicking be justified if he chooses to do this in sending active duty military troops at the border but then the question becomes\nAs you alluded to Jay what do you do with them we are not going to authorize it will be a horrible thing to authorize and it wouldn't it won't happen to to use live fire against people trying to cross the border illegally and yet at the same time\nYou put soldiers on that border to border is a violent region border patrol agents are routinely attack many of them killed from time to time\nSo are you going to put us soldiers without ammunition on the border to stop me from crossing and at the same time the same soldiers' lives at risk there is not a good answer uh as far as how to handle this\nLet me go to Kim was calling from Arizona she's on line to like him\nOh hold on to talk on my car my girls can isn't it true Buffett catch and release program that's going to allow the woman with their children to automatically become are able to come in to the country\nYou're talking about through this caravan walk\nYeah so I don't think we know the answer to that I don't know what the I'm\nA I'm sure they're looking I Know I Know what's happening I mean we all know what's happening there looking at any here you have a ... various scenarios you want to stay away from anything that looks like armed conflict but under under reminding he's done a very sympathetic for people in in in in flight and people that are are fleeing bad situations but if you don't have an orderly legal approach to this\nLike the way my grandfather came and you end up with anarchy and fourteen thousand people or seven times but rushing the border I mean\nIt's going to be a horrific situation that I don't like the way\nI I'm trying to see how does that play\nNot talking about politics how does that help anybody in the situation is\nWell it doesn't I mean it's it's it's it's just ...\nAnd ... and his wife was alluding to or not down there to start shooting people and slaughtering masses of people but we want to protect our border patrol agents in our military and supposed the horrible scenario occurs that there is fire from the horde that is coming\nIs fire to return we don't know the answer to that is our military and border patrol to be protected then firewood have to be return if fire is initiated fire would have to be return that would be a terrible scenario but this is not the kind of immigration\nThat broaden your grandparents Jay and from ... from Eastern Europe and mine from southern Europe into this country in the teens and twenties of the last century\nThere still is a system that needs to be respected we nobody has a right to just ... come into America and just set up camp you shouldn't have that right in any country a country is defined by its borders\nA country that is also defined by the rule of law which has has violated candies calling from Las Vegas Nevada\nHi candy on beer\nCans Hi Jay thank you for taking my call 'em you know a few\nIssues going on here I've been watching this the last year actually and um there's a lot of and I know they're coming in from California\nSide in Texas side there's a lot of ranchers alongside the I'm going to say\nIt may sound inhumane to some people but that's not lie light theory at all my theory on this is so that nobody gets shot or killed heaven forbid\nThere's a lot of ranchers in California and there's a lot of ranchers in Texas\nWhy can't we have a few days before they ... they reach these destinations why can't\nWe cake and\nNow we're not going to look or when we're not going to do that I mean workers were the United states of America so we don't do that\nI mean that's not the way you handle this we have got to utilize see what people are ignoring here is the diplomatic efforts that and if you need to be going on I'm sure are going on right now\nI was just that the state department on a pastor Brunson matter but I can assure you I mean I did not discuss with anybody but you know there are diplomatic efforts going on right now with our our\nPartners whether it's in in in Mexico with their counterparts at the state department this is a national emergency but we don't round people we got to protect the border and I I I Wish I could give you the answer on what to do I'm we're not doing I mean I I completely think that the the last call was this\nWas was a liquid that was going on and I think the ... the reality is what\nWe need to have happened here is we got a look at this is going to impact world opinion on the United states you let's not be naive let's be smart [noise] okay\nLet's be smart it's an it's a seven to fourteen thousand person problem that significant which they are still thousands of miles

announced\nThat he has the lord of the border patrol and the military that the caravan heading to the southern border is quote\nA national emergency vet number of people involved it ranges from seven thousand that's what the domestic news outlets are reporting here but uh outlets in Mexico are saying upwards of fourteen thousand\nSo it is a significant issue there is also a a concern I think a a legitimate one at both the ... you can be sympathetic to the humanitarian crisis which I get and I but you don't know who else was in these\nIn these caravans mean fourteen thousand people I mean when you said earlier I think it's important to say it again what could be going on here from your experience in the military\nYeah as as our our people on the border right near the border patrol agents as they are overwhelmed\nA and distracted the human traffickers and the drug cartels will use this opportunity to go to other places along the border to fly their trade into crossing illegally you know Jay looking at this whole situation it is a shame that it has come to this\nUh and you know me I'm not a Democrat or Republican but because the Democrats will not work with a GOP owns a really meaningful immigration reform what the dams would rather do they want an opportunistic we use it as a political weapon\nInstead of solving the problem the problem can be solved with a border wall and we're more security and by having those two things in place you actually protect people who are coming across the border\nThis was a humanitarian crisis because of the failure of having ... immigration reform in a secure border and it's a shame that the people coming to this border earned applied there in it's a shame that we have not done more as a country to fix this issue\nI'll tell you something else here and I'd say there's there are people that are legally trying to get immigration status in the United states of America right now I understand from a policy standpoint how this taxes our capacity Harry absolutely\nAnd so one of the things to keep in mind is the loser all need for immigration reform and it needs to be a bi partisan effort\nOne that includes the American people in addition as you mentioned earlier out we need to step up our diplomatic efforts are in the short run\nAnd we should notify are countries that currently contain migrants that their unwillingness or to stop\nThe migration right now we'll have long term consequence jumps on our relationship with those governments including Guatemala Honduras and Mexico and perhaps El Salvador so uh I think you're absolutely correct jak\nWhile I'm One of I Want to follow up jammed what how are you just said because Guatemala Honduras\nEl Salvador Mexico these governments need to start taking care of their citizens you know\nThey get billions and billions of dollars in in funding from the United states from the United nation from all sorts of agencies for these types of purpose isn't and so often Jay in these third world countries\nThat money is looted it stolen by the leadership and like Nikki Haley said when she was ... the un you know we just stopped giving money to these countries that vote against us that that spend our money in ways that are unlawful that that that steel and it's supposed to go to the people said this humanitarian crisis\nIt is is being generated by these countries that are taking care of their people so that's why we have the caravans we need the wall but we need these countries to step to the plate\nI don't think there's any question about look I mean here's the reality of what we've got there is no one that's on this broadcast as not sympathetic with the plight of people coming out of these countries that are cannot take care of their own people that are misusing the resources that are given\nTo them having said that you can't have fourteen thousand people were seven thousand whenever the numbers of actually being rushing the borders of the United states and just open them up [noise]\n[noise] well I don't know if we're on or not we lost a week apparently lost audio on our and I'm I'm assuming that we had my\nPets this conversation there but what I think that's clear what Mike is saying is talking about the border security in a border wall I think that's great but the reality is that there's that is not going to happen today Andy\nNo it's not it's not going to happen today it's gonna be something that is a long term consequences in something that we definitely have to address because I think that\nAs I said before we do not want a confrontation and I think the what you said these you know this position is that we have\nThe intervention before it reaches the border before it reaches crisis proportions in prizes dimensions\nAnd that's what that would ... and I think the president has said we don't know the the last time that it can be said that we have faced a national emergency of this caliber of this quality or a low quality terrible quality ah\nAnd you know the invasions ah and I keep going back to historical precedent when we talk about invasions that have occurred uh in history no invasion that hasn't incurred in history that has been on mitigated that has had no control has ever had good consequences\nHarry what's in your view what is the the the first investing that can be done right\nNow well first we should be negotiating and I'm sure that we are with those countries that we've talked about previously I think ... absolutely correct we do not want to see the borders situation become a crisis\nBecause if it becomes a crisis then it's a no win situation for the United states and it's a no win situation for the migrants so we should use every arrow in our quiver\nTo make sure that we stem the flow before it reaches our border that should be our number one objective longer term we need to reform immigration laws are and we also need to recalibrate our relationship\nWith Central American countries based on their response to America's interest [noise]\nWell these are exactly I mean I think these are great points I I'm going to go back to what I said at the at the outset it's kind of the position that were advocating hairs there needs to be an intervention before we have a border confrontation\nSo whether that's the diplomatic channels or whatever is done to help the Mexican authorities get control of the situation we need to avoid a border confrontation that's not good for the United states not good for the migrants not good for the people seeking asylum\nWhat gives one company the edge over another maybe it's not one thing\nMaybe taking care of lots of things set up a business runs smoothly\nIn other words into the U.S has products that help you people stay ... programs that can be the right image they service fire protection equipment deliver and stock wrestling supplies and make sure facilities are clean and ready because when all those things work together you're in business ball\nSits in tough and getting ready for the worst day from coast to coast\nAnd I'm seeing to shining see some beautiful country out there\nThis cover it all in a new RVs from camping world America's number one Harvey dealer at your local camping world you'll find over three hundred and fifty new or a piece in stock and never changing selection from America's tongue friends including favorites like Coleman in our every classroom size mall\nAt wholesale prices and say hello to a whole new world is a camping world of Pittsburgh dot com\n[noise]\nSo everybody's acknowledging that this is a this is a really tough issue\nBut I Will tell you this ah it is a tough issue but we got to think through this and be very strategic and very careful in how we engage it I again because my position is we should be doing everything I'm sure we are\nRight now to avoid a confrontation at the border and that means intervening now with Mexican authorities or Guatemala and Honduras Venezuela wherever the individuals are coming from or where they are now to see if you can contain it\nAnd get humanitarian aid to them where they are rather than having a confrontation on the U.S Mexican border which serves no one's interest including those he can come to the United states\nSide that's my position on this we're going to go back to the phones at one eight hundred six eight four thirty one ten one eight hundred sixty four three one zero now and go ahead you're on the phone you're on their\nFacebook or to get under filtration okay let it go we have the rule of law and when you want to do an intervention we simply informed the papal not the government the papal coming toward the border that our laws\nSay you cannot enter illegally is our troop because we want to protect them they will fire there well trained the than truth and tell people if you enter the country illegally you will be arrested you'll be photographed\nYou'll be by electrically fingerprinted whatever and you will you never you know what the ... go ahead go ahead\nPlease wait it never enter the United states again that the penalty for break no us\nI I get all of that but I'm I'm telling you I'm going to go to west Smith on this with ...\nNow some people hitting your border within let's say a couple of hours or even if it I don't know how how do we have a link will of how far the from the front of the Caribbean to the back how what's the time differential when people reached that point so when I'm trying to figure out is what is the number of people\n\nShooting at multiple waves of this and this puts it just a tremendous amount of pressure on the on the border go ahead west\nYeah and they're not only walking many of them are being given rides by people in trucks and cars and what have you yeah and um you know it it's one of the things that that we we we really need to go in and be proactive about this and go if if the Mexican government will allow us to do it to go on the underside of the border to help them out\nUm this has the potential to be really really ugly if it gets to the U.S border what I'm Amazed that Jay is that that you know think about national security and this is the hammer that I use all the time but\nIf you to terrorism and the threat of terrorism if people crossing our border illegally that's a big deal I mean a few years ago we could not imagine people using box cutters\nTo to hijacked airliners we are not really understanding the threat of a Porsche border how the people who wish to not only do us harm but to topple our government can come through with weapons of mass destruction if for example across the border\nBut take that out of the picture terrorism take the drug cartels out of the picture if for no other reason than the human trafficking issue\nThe Democrats should come together with the Republican counterparts\nHave meaningful border security immigration reform\nBill the wall because the human trafficking I think is the moral blight that that is in the center of all of this I agree ... calling from Texas ...\nHello sir\nHello is this is from Texas how can we help Mexico separate this massive group smaller or manageable groups\nWell that that's a great question so one of the things I was asking our producer if they're they're they're they're talking about waves the question is uh from the beginning of this\nWould it would hit the water in the United states to the end how long of a period of time as we don't have a clear answer on that right now is it is a days or is it ours we don't know it doesn't appear that we know that information yet which we don't know I Would but I think it's the intervention before it gets there and\nThat's the whole idea is to prevent it from becoming a mob scene at the United states border where you have this\nPotentially disastrous slaughterhouse of a clash between these uh\nUh migrants if you want to give them a charitable or the nomination and the and the sovereignty of the United states as the president says we've got to have border control\nAnd we've got to if we're going to be a country if we're going to be a nation we have to have borders and we have to respect those borders the challenge here is what do you do when you have seven to fourteen thousand people\nClamoring along in a thousand miles line this is how long they've taken to get here\nTwenty two hundred miles away some say they have now\nReached the point is there's still a thousand miles away from the border but they continue to move and they continue the mass as they move\nThe mass gets bigger the mask gets crowded bigger therefore you've got to stop them before they reached the border and intervene to recreate manageable groups of people and to provide them with the humanitarian assistance then I think would be appropriate for on America to do but before they reached the\nGood news is there are thousands of miles away so there's time to figure out how you can engage just because right now we don't know how the how the run what is the plant of of uh uh intersection so to speak at the U.S more what were the what were the people coming over planning on doing\nWhen they planted just walking over where they planning on running the gates I mean I don't know\nBut we've got time to intervene there's there's ways to do that diplomatically and politically and edits across is a bipartisan issue that should it's a humanitarian issue too but you've got to be able to protect the borders or else was going to be anarchy Clyde calling from California go ahead you're on there\nI think he is so my question is are we ... a bipartisan support particularly in California with you know we know how the leaders here feel about the state they declared it a sanctuary state or so how are we still democratic support on this issue you know because it's such a large scale\nSo far I I don't think there's there's been much mean Congress has out this week so we it's it's hard to get a read on the here and our executive producer will have have we have we seen any comments from any Democrats or Republicans a matter of saying what would you do hear\nI don't have the job I was a car I Want the wife I Want the spouse I wanted to date I Want it because they screwed match when\nWe were following\nHas been ready to DC or politically correct attention dismayed learn so let's say\nLarry Elder [noise] both\n\nVery over here that said from South central the union the lord of the great ... I don't know rooms welcome to the program known as the Kremlin while because we've got a credit to St Louis guaranteed\nDry [laughter]\nGo running\nLate nights have been one S. A. G. E. triple eight nine seven one to four three very elderly factor dot com studio coming up we'll be talking with congressman Dana Rohrabacher California congressman one of seven congressperson suits in a very difficult race against eight opponent who wants to Medicare for all types and I were just now talking about that [noise]\nThat's coming up and just a few minutes President Trump today [noise] defended his use of the term nationalist which he said at a rally last night he call himself a nationalist and therefore that meant that people that hate Donald Trump he was saying white nationalist nudge nudge wink wink I'm a racist\nIn Studio the\nCo producer and co writer of the book and screenplay God's mail the untold story of America's most prolific serial killer please walk into the studio\nAnd mega mackerel how I got it you know I I hear [laughter] macaroni staying there you go that's perfect thank you and thank you for coming back on you and I talk about the movie a couple of days ago\nOne of the things I didn't mention is that God's Neal had separate better facilities for white patients they differ black patients what's that all about\nRace is to me that's called racism you know yeah he's black\nAnd he's black yeah yeah and I think it was really you know with with God it was all about money\nSo it you know a lot of the black people I think that we're coming to him were from very poor neighborhoods so the white women were coming from nicer neighborhoods and had more money but yeah he was an ... and you know even understand some of his staff or black we're ... we're asked like what was that about what did he say but I think that that's just the way the world is just how things are done\nNow is a little confused about some of the other the various activities that he was doing was he was he's selling drugs what's he explained\nThat to me yeah so in fact that's the only reason he ever got caught by the way so went undercover narcotics officer Jim what was the one who actually eventually caught up with them so when he was doing was\nYou know this whole ... opioid ... drama the ... the tragedy by the way that's happening across America you need you need to get prescriptions for that right so he was selling prescriptions to drug dealers and under fake names and he had such an elaborate ... set up that he was probably the third I think he's the third most\nAt the biggest opioid supply or in the whole of Pennsylvania so you would turn out but he would he would have people turn up at night and get like Fifteen twenty thirty prescriptions but then they could sell on that they could go to ... to to pharmacists get settled and sell those until those up that's how we got caught it's the\nOnly reason they got caught and in the film his home seem nice but not particularly popular it will be making a great deal of money huge so they found they found that two hundred and four fifty thousand\nDollars in cash in the house and I don't know I don't know what you're doing there at Lowry but I I don't think you've got that kind of cash hanging around I don't need as many of your listeners have that kind of cash hanging around\nAnd he only Seventeen homes he will not loaded I Can't get I can get a diet Pepsi out of the you know every five yeah I mean it was a lot of you know it doesn't does a real sense of at the very center of the story with greed you know that he was very and he liked the money you know and that the house\nWith like a hoarders episode like the house was really disgusting but in the house to were boxes of things that had never been opened a lot of shopping you know a multiple things both the same type of thing that would never that ... packaging was never taken off of um there were big shoppers\nNow regarding abortion he was convicted of a boarding babies that were born alive yes and convicted of a boarding babies pass the time that the Pennsylvania law allows you to\nDo it yes yes but he ... really he's in prison for three life sentences based on three children that he that were delivered alive that lived to Christ moved to try to swim out of a toilet ... am and he he and his staff were were cutting their next with scissors at a routine basis\nI'm Talking to and macaroni a she is the co writer and co producer of the movie ... nail the untold story of America's most prolific serial killer not only is it a interesting story about gods now it's also got some mystery to it because it took dean Cain to kind of say what's going on over here and the feds\nOnly cared about the drug violation couldn't give a report about what he was doing a boarding these babies yeah I mean it's incredible ... at the very center of the ... I just mentioned the ... ... detective gym would whose undercover narcotics officer she's the one that made this all happened if it wasn't for him\nNone of this would have ever come to light and in fact as you said you know and it's true the FBI and the d._a. we're only focus very much on the drug case\nBut Jim Woods said what about this woman who died this woman kind of my mother who died why don't we why are we talking about her\nAnd because eventually because of gyms perseverance and they actually ... opened up the ... the the the the homicide investigation into the death ... once you once they did that um are allowed to search for evidence a connection with her death\nThey found everything else the other of course big point of the movie is that initially the mainstream media didn't care about this case yeah it's amazing and the reason\nI didn't hear about it because it makes them have very unpleasant thoughts about abortion yeah and they want to go there\nNo no they don't want anything that might in fact you know real you know have any effect on roe v Wade and this film certainly dozens and portray abortion in a very good like because you get to hear about abortion and you don't hear it for a pro life activist you hear it from two of the you know during the trial too good abortion is to legal abortion and for us to understand to describe it good abortion\nAnd when the when the jury heard what a good abortion sounded like they didn't see much of a distinction between that and murder\nMhm [noise] um I ask you this before when we interviewed a golf now regarding the the drug stuff I'm sure he he he's aware that was illegal I'm sure yeah he's got conscious of consciousness of guilt about that but about the abortion I got the impression he didn't think\nHe'd done anything morally wrong no not at all in fact you know he feels vindicated that he was helping the poor women you know that he you know he really as a hero to the poor\nYou know at some level he ... a certain claims that that's the case you know when he I mean even worse by the way and I know we're at Salem Radio station I mean can you imagine he also had scripture passages he's given me scripture passages that justify abortion to justify what he did he's written poetry pruning when one of the homeless he wrote pruning and you can imagine\nThat reference he was using that that we need to prove and for things to grow well I mean I really extraordinary but he's\nYou know mad to me he is a complete lunatic\nBut it's all the people that are enabled him to make a make for very chilling reading and very chilling knowledge and\nMedical him he is my guest gee is the co producer of the movie ... the untold story of America's most prolific serial killer I've seen it it is a moving beep disturbing film I urge you all to see it did you ever speak with Dr ...\nYeah I've been in the prison so I spent about three hours with him and um\nYou know it's it's amazing he actually lives up to all the cliche for the serial killer he's like Hannibal Lecter he has this very soft voice he's very highly educated tea you know how the whole thing about its hands you'd have to look at how big my hands or his whole thing about his feet which of course becomes very chilling when you realized that he cut the feet of children and kept them in jars\nHe sang to me twice he touched my leg inappropriately continuously\nAndme and he has this really soft voice and he has the demeanor he so he really is in prison forever and never going to see the light of day again\nAnd freedom and he has a demeanor like he's just come off the golf course he has this very\nRelaxed and he's smiling all the time and but every now and again when I asked him hard questions he would do this kind of brain freeze and go oh you knew about this like in an extremely creepy weight you know so he's yeah he's every kind of creep actually I don't\nBelieve your movies showed his wife no that's correct or he was married\nYet for she aware of what was going on they're not ... not only was she aware of what what was going on she was involved so in fact it's actually one of the most awful parts or whether we leave her out of the movie\nBecause you couldn't include everything so we'll have to you know there's plenty of stuff to an R. movie him she was one of them I mean and also actually bringing her and makes it really dark because she was involved in what's it called the Sunday babies when the clinic would completely empty of every of all the other workers and he and her\nWith the what they called the most difficult cases which was people up to nine months and we knew about that\nAnd because people would see some of the remains the following day and stuff so she actually went to prison ... but only for a short period because she cooperated with the authorities children\nYeah seven children from three different by any of them involved\nNo none of the children involved um seven children three different wives yes\nYeah but none of the children you know in terms of the children were involved in the youngest child the youngest child was with a high school student too and you know was there during the raid on the house\nOr we don't have a few seconds left and what is his reputation now in Pennsylvania specifically Philadelphia black community what's his reputation now\nWell I think you know he he now has the correct reputation for being a for being an animal in a monster but I Would urge people to go and see the movie and they can find a local listings of Gulf no movie dot com and don't be scared don't be scared because I Know you're hearing me failed and stuff but actually that's a lot of that from the book the worst stuff in the book the movie it's PG Thirteen anyone could\nWatch the ... and ... the movie is called God's mail the untold story of America's most prolific serial killer I urge you to all the un and thank you very much for coming in first grade C a thanks emitted Dana Rohrabacher ... uh marry older Larry Elder\nAll through all the other [noise]\nCongressmen what about this migrant caravan how big a factor is that\nWell I think that that ties right into what we're talking about was Trump\nWith people begin to understand that we have a guy the tough guy like Trump as our president it gives us some kind of confident that we're not going to our ... our country will not be invaded\nAnd are Democrats or doing nothing but attacking attacking open other Republicans these folks are their their act as if this invasion of our country does the U.S in fact my opponent\nUh this guy earlier Wilder uh as ended up saying that it off here or there are here illegally we're going to be you have written about Medicare and all these are terrible the benefits will surprise surprise\nWhat we usually do we looked at Latin America we have families what we do anything to get them to hear\nIf we got the politicians all the time the finance health care and education and other benefits what were the trader on people can't do that we got to be loyal to people like your father my father worked so hard to make sure he had a good education\nAnd they could if I people overseas they went overseas and save up for the Japanese ... but the fact is they loyal to the American family which is a United States every race every ethnic group we are Americans that's going to say a lot of people\nThat our president is a tough guys watch out for us and some people on the other side of the line or not watching out for America they have some kind of interest or other addressed\nMy guess congressman Dana Rohrabacher California forty if he's running for reelection in tough district your opponent got the endorsement of progressive Democrats of America and he signed off on every one of the groups uh books positions on their questionnaire including things like reparations for slavery Medicare for all I mean\nThis guy should be pretty easy to defeat in your district I Would think\nWell they accept what God is a ... incredible propaganda campaign or your do have what President Trump called fake news it's out there and Larry you're you're a big player in trying to make sure the word gets out\nFifty fifty light the faith Fifteen seconds Fifteen seconds congressman\nAll right well that's the I Will just say I think that we're going to win this as hard as we all get out of sight their\nCongressmen will will will the Republicans retain control of the house\nRepublicans will ... reclaimed control the house because he will not get all all of our money
