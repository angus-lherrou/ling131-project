I mean I Know that the\nMedia would have you believe that Ninety nine percent of the women in the country are outraged and think that this was terrible and they believe are and they and and and they figured it was a you know a a tantamount to a rape and then all that\nBut that's not what most that I don't know I don't know what the percentages are but it sure ain't a hundred percent there's a lot of women out there who are not buying the story at all and others who are buying it and saying it she's making she's exaggerating it as you said\nThat in that way I think even worse case scenario\nHer not right\nCarrie yeah I'm On a white\nPerson right there and that's what it is for example I wouldn't want to work but he didn't get it\nYou know\nWell I'm kind of within ... with Dennis Prager on this he's a he's a host on this network or and he's on during the day and I are he wrote a piece last week or so and he basically said um I don't care if it's true I just don't I I there's this sounds to me like something that\nI'm not he when he says he doesn't care if it's true remains not necessarily her what seems to be in some people's minds and exaggerated version of what happened but what happened happened\nHe says it's just ah as you said at a girls who run into that stuff at parties forever and it's just not doesn't raise the level of keeping a a you know anywhere in other words you should the guy should be judged on what he's done for the last thirty five years not what he did when he was sixteen\nAnd I agree one hundred percent okay thank you Chris John\nMakes a lot for listening to okay now\nI'm One other thing about this and um\nThis is this this story about him of throwing the the ice the guy in the bar um they actually had the guy on the uh CNN ... who says I'm ...

I just give up on men how could it it's a ... who hasn't wasn't man hasn't been at some point\nIn college or even in high school in a bar\nIn a situation came up and somebody had too many drinks and something happened somebody got pushed a fight started I was in I was usually hiding somewhere but the but I was in plenty of\nUh situations in bars were fights broke out I might even have caused a few and then what then gone and hidden behind my big friends but I mean it happens a lot and you know it's ... to ... to think that anybody who might have been involved in one of those\nSomehow disqualified himself from being on the Supreme Court because of something he did back then it's just insanity\nSo please if it's if you're a man ... ... I Hope you're ashamed to admit that you would even\nThink about that as an issue and have that ... would have any bearing on your decision on whether a guy should be in the ... he considered much less a nominated for or or approve for the for the\nSo the Democrats are going to continue to ask for more and more uh investigation yeah they won the FBI to interview more and more people so he faces a difficult hurdles going forward\nI I'm I think there's going to be a shift you're seeing a shift of strategy on where this is going in the next twenty four hours and we're talking about that after the break then you just came out of a series of meetings or give us what is your best assessment\nRight now where things are [noise] well Senator McConnell said there would be a vote this week and joins correct it needs to happen this week Jamie ... can we do I do believe it's going to because here here's why the president wants all the information out rightfully so but ultimately want that information is out Jay the constitution gives the United States Senate the duty to decide they need to vote and I think that both going to happen\nThis week we're talking about all of this where this is actually going what I think the next area of attacks going to be and where to take your calls to discuss all of this at one eight hundred and sixty four three one one zero that's eight hundred sixty four thirty one ten will take your calls we come back from the break if you're on Facebook and first go get your questions in right now or social media teams are evaluating\nHow reviewing those comments as they come and we'll be back with more in just a moment [noise]\nThis is Chris Abernathy of Abernathy and Hagerman you don't want the government deciding what happens to your state or how much they will take at Auburn Afghan Hagerman state administration is the heart and soul of our practice we have the experience to help\nNot only plan but administer your state properly to protect your assets minimized taxes and ensure that your inheritance gets to the ones you love beside for yourself Abernathy inhaler been legal help that last a lifetime visit a dash H. dot law\nI think is happening let me give you mine and also the first thing you had was when there's a nomination went under way they attack judicial philosophy they say that you know we don't like his positions we don't like the uh they too conservative we elect among these particular views you've got three hundred opinions is a judicial conservative he doesn't believe in a living constitution that was the attack\nHe goes to a hearing that's not successful then they bring up the late last minute allegations are regarding doctor for that hearing goes and a creates a issues\nThat are have not been again no cooperating witnesses on Dr Ford but lo and behold ad that's unfolding\nTo other witness or two other potential uh individuals come forward A M ms Ramirez and uh the the client of a a sweat Nick missed what the client a Michael ... they come forward\nSo now you're saying that it's not just allegations of what their sexual assault which would be serious enough itself obviously but now it's also a judicial temperament credibility did he make false statements under oath about his activities in college this is where I just say you're never going to get those that are opposed to his nomination\nOn board with him what you're trying here to do with the Republicans are trying to do is can they hold three senators flake\nBeing one of them a center Collins and Murkowski that's what they that's where the focus is right now yeah absolutely\nIt's you're talking about a handful of senators if this is going to move forward that too is important um because it's either I think it's very clear those those those handful vote over then I think you get ... probably maybe a couple of Democrats or the nomination goes down\nAnd the question also would be is why we're talking about this let's be honest or will there ever be a vote\n'em or will the nomination should be pulled that also political calculation right now it appears I'll go say a bit of Washington that it appears that we're heading towards the vote\nEven if it's even if it's like the health care I compared to like that situation than like the health care vote where um we didn't know until the late Senator John McCain voted where it was going I mean but they decided to have the vote and and uh and things change I Would imagine though unlike that than\nThis is somewhat different I Can't imagine a college or Murkowski not putting out their statement before they voted 'cause this is so serious\nWhere do you think that I I think I think that's a great comparison joined I think there are a bunch of senators and the Democrat side of the aisle probably senator Manchin center Heitkamp senator Donnelly who don't want to take this vote so you know you have to ask a question to all of area and whether or not it's called I agree with you on senator Collins and Murkowski Senator Flake is well by the way because remember before consideration\nAnd the committee he did put out a statement so I think they will make a statement one way or another\nBut I come back to this bottom line there's more information coming out the president's imported more information coming out at the end of the day the constitution gives the Senate the duty to vote yes or a yes or no on a nominee I think they need to take that but you can have that information they should take the vote\nWell here's what but here's what I go back to I think this is you've seen this and three phases here Harry this is what I'm looking at you got to repay scenario first it was judicial philosophy\nThey couldn't really\nMay they disagreed with it those left of center but they knew that that was not a disqualify her right right so they that that didn't work then you had the late allegations regarding the sexual assault serious they have a hearing on that reopen the hearing that's that space to of this I Would say and that goes and in ... and it's kind of a drawl last week I mean it was\nThere were allegations\nThere's no credible cooperating evidence of that time but Senator Flake then says I Want the FBI to investigate the the\nFBI investigation men as the president now says should be a comprehensive\nNow I'm starting to see it's not so much and not that it's not about the allegations on sexual assault but now it's about veracity under oath and what he did in college or didn't do in college and how we perceived as issues so now you're moving into what I call these three of this and\nThe problem is time in Washington is never you know the longer it goes the better it gets it's not usually how Washington works absolutely knew lived up soon northern Virginia for a long time you know that absolutely\nSo if you look at the latest round of attacks on judge candidate a judge Kavanaugh essentially they're grounded in his performance or the last week in defending himself and defending his family\nAnd so now some Democrats including professor Larry tribe are arguing\nThat judge Kavanaugh has this qualifies himself even if he were to be confirmed yeah why because he's attempted to defend his family against arguably scoreless attacks\nOn and so uh Larry tribe argues judge ... justice cabinet if he's confirmed could not operate as a justice\nOf the United states and clinical fate that's a face for attack yes his pay more for attack is if he gets in what can they do do cabin him whether it's\nYour course the recusing is completely after the justice there's no standard or the judge justice of the Supreme Court they decided they should recuse or not not some panel not some judicial calm personal ethics charges but they're trying to cap it this way they've got this\nIt's a multi prong attack now with the strategy of what you got to give them credit they're they're they're not they're not smart yeah go ahead and you\nKnow I mean they're doing a great job of doing what they set out to do and that's to resist because for Kavanaugh's nomination delay means defeat\nYeah yeah I Would just remind people that Elena Kagan came straight out of the Obama administration on to the Supreme Court and and did not recused herself on the health care case say right and so uh that you know\nAnd it was handled by her office suggested her for her up there it's\nTo her so they can they can complain all they want\nA but guess what if it's the highest court in the land you you've lost your place um art that's it I mean there's nowhere else to go now I I Do think that I don't like to use the word I think that would be\nLevel five impeach if but they would have to have again they'd have to super majorities they're not there yet but I think that the question is like for most Supreme Court justices even controversial\nLet's say justice Kavanaugh is confirmed\nFailsafe confirmed they try to look this up for a little bit longer in two years from now like is this going to be what people are electing a president over where we have another presidential election are ... most people can't ... a district court a Supreme Court justice not alone pick them out in a group of pictures now they might be able to pick Brett Kavanaugh for a few years yeah but ask\nThem for three years from now if they can question no probably not\nSo let me as saying give us the ... under best case scenario what's the timeframe here which and realistic timeframe results you'd say what is it realistic it\nWell the the Senate debating unrelated bill right now Jay and they cannot get off of that bill until tomorrow night so the earliest the leader McConnell could file cloture would be tomorrow night which would mean it would set the cloture vote for friday more down I mean\nYou know we I report by tonight well by tomorrow night Mara nights when they get done with the un other bill right so then you have to have the intervening day according to rule twenty two you get up to cloture vote on friday morning and then you have to have that that thirty hours of debate\nThat we all know about it would set up a final confirmation vote Jay for as early as Saturday Night so friday morning for cloture Saturday Night for final confirmation that's really the fastest time line you could have here is a Saturday Night the earliest now ...\nThere's a ... and Blumenthal is already saying delayed delight and let's go ahead and take a phone call one eight hundred and sixty four thirty one\nTell us get some oh yeah right to the phones or we go ah Chris is calling from California on line three crystal welcome to Jay sexual live across the\nGuy loves health I loved every all that and ... thanks I quit my plan is\nSince the president already ... ... ... ...\n... go longer or like pickled costs and ... says judge Kaplan I had any requests again for and whether or not he get that ... or ...\nWell on on the question on timeframe so the FBI's got at the president said he wants to return than a week they are capable of doing that Andy Beyer resources available to do something that's not a criminal investigation no they're not interview and and but they're not trying to recreate the crime scene there trying to find you know the truth here as to what allegations are\nIs he going to be confirmed I I\nThink the vote will happen I think there's a greater chance than not that he will be confirmed Jay but look\nJust to underscore the point you just made I think if it goes past this week you have crystal clear evidence\nThat what is being pursued here is not the truth I mean because you were just a matter of days ago that Chris Coons and Jeff Flake made this deal that said look we're ready to make our decision if you get the FBI one week\nTo look at these allegations then we'll have the information that we need to make a vote or J. if that goal posts just changed again I Will tell you a certain due to the United States Senate does the detractors of Brett Kavanaugh are not looking for truth or evidence on which to base their decision they just never want to take the vote so I Do think the voters going to happen\nAnd I will tell you that if it doesn't happen I think there is a commitment inside the United States Senate to just delaying until the nominee is withdrawn and frankly I think that's an affront to the constitution\nYou think that is an ... you think that's a possibility here\nYes it's a possibility but I did the scheduling of the voters up to one person and that's leader McConnell and I think\nHe knew we had that he's editor of time here we don't because we don't have culture\nWe don't you will know the answer to that tomorrow night Jay when the FAA bills finished leader McConnell files cloture tomorrow night I think\nYou can hear they will close to ... be I investigation complete without the three oh Tucson beard\nHe could but I don't think he will but basically you need three days after finally cloture before\nYou here's upon them you can go right into next week yeah I mean they just look at it this I mean everything has to line up perfectly for this to go to be done this week\nYou you're absolutely right I mean that's really where we are at meantime of course the Democrats are coming up with more and more fresh allegations which may not necessarily be grounded in any fact [noise]\nAll right we're taking a break up you don't get a full hour the program go over the ACL Jay dot org or any of our multiple social

give you a sense of where it is a as we were on the second half hour of the broadcast I I'm looking this thing now in phases and I this is something I work on last night in this morning but I think this is where it is\nPhase one of his a confirmation was judicial philosophy and he passed it reluctantly by the Democrats they're not going to vote for maybe a few on the floor well but he you could argue with a judicial philosophy is judicial capability his qualifications to be a judge that did not work then you get the last minute eleventh hour base to\nAttacks on allegations of sexual of salt it starts with Dr Ford ends up to others so you have faced too and that expands out if they choose ... all these other um allegations against him so there are serious allegations they've got to be investigated president authorizes an FBI check after three Republican said no\nI'm we're not going to vote on him until you have a bull FBI investigation he authorizes they were his words president's word comprehensive a investigation for background that's background check not a criminal case that space to\nThen you're starting to see now I think we're in a phase three basic needs a little bit different they're not so much going to find it looks like cooperating evidence on the sexual assault or at least so far they have it so what do they go to where their statements that judge Kavanaugh made under oath that maybe were false rumors construed basically a\nA what we would call it a thousand one violation if it was a federal case\nA a false statement to me that's where it is their space story then there's a face for we're not at base for yet but we're clearly and phase three and delay his defeat I think that is what any kind of was said earlier and that fits right in with the scenario that I'm putting together and that's exactly where I think there's cases right now if I was looking at this was a lawyer in charge of this\nI Would say you're in the story\nAnd the way you respond to phrase phase three is get this FBI investigation over with\nRapidly put thoroughly making do what they have the capabilities and vote yes or no if it's no it's no if adjusted jets get the process over with now Vance telling me that he's up there right now dealing with the staff that it's not like it there is a chance it's this by friday but that's not a guaranteed by any stretch of anyone's imagination\nYeah I think the sense that I'm getting Jay is the Senate Republicans believe that Senate Democrats have as many phases if we want to call them that as they will allow them to have but I think leader McConnell has decided this is the last one Senator Cruz and Senator Flake made a deal for the FBI investigation and when that runs its course there will be a vote I Do think that's accurate Jay\nBut look as Senate Republicans decide not to to force it through and I think Senate Democrats will bring as many of these pages or as they allow it\nThey didn't get into face for pay for it becomes very difficult phase for becomes not only it's it's ... it's a ... that's what happens in face for here it becomes a pile on an ... you know face so if the Republicans are trying to get the nominee confirmed and if they're willing to wait for the FBI investigates which is supposed to be done expeditiously get it done and vote because we go to face for I don't see how this goes forward\nI think that's correct so it's important to know too much violence\nThere is really only an audience of about five individual veteran I mean that's really important free moderate Republicans to moderate Democrats and I think all five are\nWavering at this particular point and so if we go to space for a that may be enough to cause the collapse what are you in on the ... politically here\nWas the FBI airport will will\nCome out this was the deadline is friday the vote so that would trigger the time to have thirty hours and all this a procedure that must go on a that would be very telling itself it should be enough for us to know\nIf the votes are going to be there or not I mean that that's it I mean they're they're either going to be there or not based off this um I don't believe there should be any more\nUh FBI investigations pass this of I don't think that there should be any more testimony [noise] uh there should not be weren't they just need Hollywood is hearings or anything like that it is they gave it over to the FBI Congress\nUh now he keeps getting rattled all these reporters say he's rattled he's route so even when they tried to get his confirmation and what did you mean that yeah we can't have that kind of parts of the ship on the court and then he tried to say rushed away by handlers being rattled his house reported um I wasn't referring to him I mean\nYeah this is again this is why it's up to the air and this is where I could throw a heads up his your watch a face with your parents go because you cannot figure out a these shows will take another call before we get to the break\nPeople hold on a Robert calling from New Jersey on line three Robert welcome to Jay suck you alive\n[laughter] thank you for taking my call quick question are we knew there would be more allegations more knows\nMy question is the FBI or they fail to investigate or interview all of them or can they draw the line\nYou know the envy the FBI does not have to investigate every single name that is put forward I mean you could give a two hundred names and go out and do that that doesn't make sense\nWhat they need to do what they do is their supervisors say these are the most viable the most critical persons that need to be investigated\nBecause of their allegations are there are potential knowledge of what Kavanaugh's did or didn't do while he was at Yale or other places and this is what and then they cut it off and then because there is a time constrained here I Hope\nUh by tomorrow night Wednesday so it's not an open ended let's just go on and investigated for the next you know nine months and see what happens so the there are constraints on the FBI based on the rule of reason\nAlright um we've only got a minute left or the ... when we come

out of the senators you just see fifty because the vice president can vote and and the tired or he could be that fifty first vote so\nUm we're already there there's a super majority necessary I Want that just clear to everybody\nIs you need a a a just a a normal majority vote\nAnd the vice president can be the tie breaker so uh you get but it's just the way that the city worst right now the patches together say people talk about I I don't like doing it by the way like the sexist way we're we're cascade college like just because they're women they're going to vote this way if they are two of I'd say they're the\nThe most moderate members of the U.S Senate who ... who are Republican uh and uh and Jeff Flake is kind of\nMoved over to that world over over time it's certainly towards his retirement so I I we don't just talk about that because they're always you know this ... cast to save vote it's because they have kind of cast themselves together in this situation and allowed it\nTo happen so that's why I think it it would be weird to me than to see one of the vote one way and one of the other even though they they represent very different states Maine and Alaska\nYeah it would be strange Jordan they typically vote together and actually early in this nomination process they were pretty much the public comments that they thought they would be voting together along with a couple of the Democrats I Do think maybe it's changed a little bit now Jordan because\nUh look I don't think that mansion and high camp are going to deliver you the deciding vote so I actually don't think the vice presidents boats going to be needed here because\nLet's say you do get two of those three Republicans and you get to fifty votes and it becomes clear that Brett Kavanaugh has been going to be confirmed I think at that point senator mansion and send her to hike camp would probably vote yes especially center hiking you down ten point to North Dakota and more than sixty percent of North Dakota and support the confirmation of Brett Kavanaugh so\nIt's it's weird how the politics work but once you get to fifty I think you're actually going to get to fifty two or fifty three\nAll right so I mean I get we try to explain it off for you with this vote occurs which we expect the earliest would be this week at a so it'd be a Saturday vote which is interesting too because the American people's attention\nIs usually not as focused on the news in Washington on weekends all of that has impacts of this of people because they're worried about you know a who's watching it ... it with is watching but but he had very important to note Kelly in Wyoming online five Kelly welcome to Jay sexual alive\n[noise] hello [noise] Hi Kelly for taking my call I just want to say as somebody who is fifty eight and has been watching and an active participant in politics\nAnd the woman I don't find at um [noise] I didn't find that testimony as Ford credible at all and\nI uh I just I think that McConnell will take a vote and I hope he does so that that senators will have to be on record\nWell I think that that you know that's an important point Kelly will be a political calculation ah to make I mean this is going into a bit terms I think very quickly and then we could go round the horse but I think we all agree there's a calculation they're off do you have a vote foresee the senators to be on the record um even if Brett Kavanaugh goes down\nA so is it the last ... can be used positively uh for the Republican Party to say see this is what happens now if it's Republicans doing it I mean it becomes a little bit more complicated right I mean so I think that ... that is a political calculation\nThat Mitch McConnell along with the White House wanted to make it I think that's a changing a potential to I don't think that you could say today on Tuesday that that or if it was going to be likely vote down\nThat ... that it occurs on that sometimes you got to go for it uh but you got to hold\nPeople speak to the fire let me get right back to the folks that want to get through so many of these calls ... that hold on market brass on line six this if you want to do it to go around the horn on bark walks the J sexual alive\nI um I thought of another question but I was on hold and first as an American bar association a west drawing their support of of a judge Kavanaugh\nNot fully but they wanted an FBI investigate and I think the president wrote a letter saying that so they're actually be a of a position is still qualify yeah so the it's all it's gotten a little ... year\nUm but that being said we're kind of ... you know we talked about these phases before we're past those phases now I mean we're we're past the really the the faces the Senate has given us back to the FBI\nThe FBI will they be of this this is not about judicial philosophy anymore that's you know and about how you ... your ... even as a judge on the bench\nThis private life mostly focused on college years even high school years I mean Harry that the truth is that a BA rating they did pull that stuck on Brett Kavanaugh to try it didn't even make a lot of news 'cause that what was breaking were so salacious says the FBI they said if I Will do enough background check\nBack\nVery over here the say the south syndrome and the people you know the great ... Marines welcome to the program the Clinton allow because we've got to get her to eat [noise]\n\nSub go AAA nine seven one eight gee triple late nights and one seven to for three very over here will effected dot com studio next segment we talked to attorney Larry claiming claiming the founder of additional watch I think he's representing virtually every one of\nThe accusers of Bill Clinton except for one [noise]\nHe conducted a number of deposition [noise] and he knows all about the role that George Clinton was played in helping to orchestrate the so called nuts or slug strategy was used to malign women like Jennifer Flowers\nWas called a saloon singer Paula Jones drag hundred dollar through a trailer park no telling what you're going to get [noise]\n\nWhen he'd abroad with too much as she was raped by Bill Clinton and two weeks after the ... was written by Hillary we're going to talk to every claimant about the role that Mr Clinton novelist play because\nOf the sanctimonious where he interviewed Sarah Sanders and sort of sanitary grace not to bring up his behavior during the Clinton years\nLet's let him tell his side of the story before we allow allegations to determine hasn't higher\nFuture seen though the president has already reached a judgment about their stories and there does seem to be a pattern here when Roy Moore is accused from Bill O'Reilly is accused when Roger ales is accused when Rob Porter is accused and that one very Kevin always accuse the president consistently every single time takes the side of the man\nYou know it's interesting that you say that it's not a lot of Democrats that like to ignore Keith Ellison and Cory Booker they love to fight and champion women until they disagree with the U.S how Frank and lost his job in the Senate side\nAs I said Sara had too much class to mention Mr putting up ... behavior back in Nineteen Ninety two let's revisit\nThe government has a character problem but I take it that you're alone and has no ... is that it's only ... is is not denied that he is engaged in Myrtle infidelity is not as as soon as he had problems and is that right and he uh he was talked about the draft into some people's character brother\nBill Clinton's passes character tests throughout his life and throughout this campaign and he's just showing it through his commitments to real fights and what isn't doing this campaign is focused on the floor and the American people on the jobs and the education that's what the American people care about they want to move into the future they don't want to be diverted by sight issues in Iraq and all that Republican attack machine divert\nThat was then and this is now\nAnd a number of other Democrats should have the same type of for it they look the president is her family to my question every\nSingle time the president is taking the side of the man against women is accuser sets not truth isn't that\nAn amazingly annoying to me go back again Nineteen Ninety two George putting up all is\nWhat is named it just I can send your facts with names addresses phone numbers of you in an affair with\nThis is from the documentary war room he's talking to a reporter who's calling him about an allegation that Bill Clinton had an affair\n[noise] it wouldn't make a truce get is completely [noise]\nIf you went on the radio\nAnd it said the bill Clinton is a father illegitimate black child he would be laughed at people would think you're crazy I guarantee you that if you do this [noise] you never worked in that will pay off again\nNow you're talking to a reporter and you're saying if you report this you'll never worked in democratic politics again what is a reporter doing working in democratic politics\nYou're crazy I guarantee you that if you do this [noise] you never worked in politics again\nSo you were threatening to people that do what you do right now isn't it ironic\nMaybe don't want to say a matter of you will be embarrassed for the national [noise] people will think nobody will believe you\nThis is again George Clinton was Nineteen Ninety two threatening a reporter who had apparently a story on Bill Clinton Governor Bill Clinton\nAnd people will think his comedy [noise]\nWhy is that the alternative is you don't do it causing some temporary again people who've tomorrow I'm going to matter and you have a campaign\nThat understands within a difficult time [noise] something right [noise]\nAnd that was then this is now and in this case the president knows Brett Kavanaugh he's heard his story there hasn't been a shred of evidence ... the other individual stories and there's been a lot of individuals that have come forward and talk about the Brett Kavanaugh that they know\nA and they're confident that these things that happened final question was the first of All right\nJulie sweating it is the one who claims he observed Kevin are participating in a gang rape or being near a gang rape or she says she herself and she was victimized but can't say whether or not a Kevin I was one of those who assaulted her\nCan you tell me what happened was as you're comfortable telling us what happened to me is probably the most horrendous awful thing that could happen to any human being my body was violated\nMy soul is broken uh I Would not able to have somebody stop when I said no stop [noise]\nYou know I felt like somebody took me and basically said you're worthless there's\nNothing to us you are disposable I was at a party and I remember that I started not to feel very well and next thing I Know I was shoved into a room and I'm having my clothes torn in\nDifferent directions um I was touched everywhere\nUh I was physically assaulted in every way you could possibly physically assault Taiwan then it was horrible I had no way to fend them off\nYou know what I'm going to ask everyone is wondering if one of those people with Brett Kavanaugh [noise] I cannot specifically say that he was one of the ones who assaulted me but\nBefore this happened to me at that party I saw Brett Kavanaugh there I saw\nMark judge there and they were hanging about the area where I started to feel disoriented and we're the room was and where the other boys were hanging out and laughing I can share them laughing and laughing\nAnd very hard for me to talk about that but it's important that somebody said something because\nIf Brett Kavanaugh was one of those people that did this to me there is no way in the world that he should go Scott Free on this and that he should be on the Supreme Court he just I think ... if he does I there's no justice for world\nShe said that she saw him standing by the door\nOr ... or the punch containers I don't know what he did but I saw him by them yes\nIn her declaration sweat Nick also wrote I also witnessed efforts by mark judge Brett Kavanaugh and others to cause girls to become an ... an disoriented so\nThey could then be gang raped inside rumor bedroom by train as numerous boys I have a ... recollection of seen boys lined up outside rooms at many of these parties waiting for their turn with a girl inside the room these boys included mark judge and Brett Kavanaugh what\nDid she say for you to say well and so what happened and he happened to me I didn't put two and two together\nBut I Would see boys standing outside of rooms congregated together sort of like an outlet and I didn't know what was occurring out that I Would see them laughing a lot of laughing I'm standing in line outside or in line that definitely huddled by doors and I didn't understand\nWhat it could possibly be and and your declaration you describe Brett Kavanaugh and his friend mark judge\nStanding outside seen them stand outside the door yes with other boys\nSenior suggesting that in hindsight yeah you think he was involved in this behavior I Would say yeah I I it's just too coincidental\nNow here's what NBC's Kate Snow said about the things that's what makes it on camera there were different for her written statement\nWhat we want to do here is lay out all that she said her story our reporting we want to be very transparent because these are very serious allegations Kavanaugh has\nCalled Julie sweating story nonsense and as far as the president today questioned her credibility and NBC News for the record has not been able to independently verify her claim there\nAre things that she told us on camera that differ from her written statement as we've been trying independently to reach out to anyone who were members are tending parties with Jewish sweating again Brett Kavanaugh and we've been asking her attorney for names so far we've not found anyone who are numbers that she's also unclear\nAbout when she first decided oh\nHey well as just Tuesday we still have a whole week we come back Mary claiming what role did George ... numbers play in the lining the futures of Bill Clinton and how very effective only has right now I'm Larry over don't leave town\nCalled for

course now you know he's a multi millionaire lighting hide in DC\nAnd now he feels a duty bound to take a shot at the president simply because he defended judge Kavanaugh\nLarry claiming a you said you had a seminar plus under deposition twice did he ever admit under oath to doing some of the things that you claim you've done\nWell I had a very good memory the memory you know the the favorite phrase of the Clinton people was\nI have no specific regular recollection is our number is something I Can't remember now on the front of the ... justice so no he wouldn't have the right thing and like I said he he was found to rely on those\nWere given the fact that he won't admit to anything how do you know that he himself has done these things how do you put his fingerprints on these things\nThat's been widely reported him in Reno because actually ... you wrote a book called the war room which became a documentary\nWhere in that book he admitted to working with a record for him to address\nFalse allegations by your accusers by Bill Clinton's accuses the women that I represented now ironically Robert today's world from the left has judges rotted patrol\nHopefully denying an allegation is enough to say that you think someone in fact the correct It's got to lawsuits right now because he denied that he sexually harassed any women\nHe's probably lessons ... forward in time
