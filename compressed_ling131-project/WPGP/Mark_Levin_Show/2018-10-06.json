Republican attack machine diverse\nThat was then and this is now\nAnd a number of other Democrats should have the same type of sprint they look the president is for her family to my question every single time the president is taking the side of the men against women is accuser that's not true\nIsn't that amazing we annoy can we go back again Nineteen Ninety to George ... is what is named interest I can send your facts name address phone numbers of us who unit affair with this is from the documentary war room he's talking to a reporter who's calling him about an allegation that Bill Clinton had an affair\n[noise] it wouldn't make a truce get is completely [noise]\nIf you went on the radio\nAnd it said the bill Clinton is the father of illegitimate black child he wouldn't be laughed at people would think you're crazy I guarantee you that if you do this [noise] you never worked in Delaware it's obvious again\nNow you're talking to a reporter and you're saying if you report this you'll never worked in democratic politics again what does reporter doing working a democratic politics\nYou're crazy I guarantee you that if you do this [noise] in other words that would probably call again\nSo you are threatening the people that do what you do right now isn't it ironic\nMaybe don't want to or not they are matters you will be embarrassing for the national [noise] people will think nobody will believe you\nOnce again George Clinton was Nineteen Ninety two threatening a reporter who had apparently a story on Bill Clinton or what Governor Bill Clinton\nAnd people will think discovered\nThat the alternative is you don't do it causing some temporary pain with people who tomorrow I'm going to matter and you have a campaign that understands on a difficult time [noise]\nDo something right [noise] um\nAnd that was then this is now and in this case the president knows Brett Kavanaugh he's heard his story there hasn't been a shred of evidence ... the other individual stories and there has been a lot of individuals that have come forward and talked about the Brett Kavanaugh that they know\nA and they're confident that these things that happened final question what is the president or if it's All right\nJulie sweating it because the one who claims he observed a cabin up dissipating in a gang rape or being near a gang rape or she says she herself as she was victimized but can't say whether or not a Kevin I was one of those who assaulted her\nCan you tell me what happened what is your comfortable telling us what happened to me is probably the most horrendous awful thing that could happen to any human being my body was violated\nMy soul is broken a I was not able to have somebody stop when I said no stop [noise]\nYou ... I felt like somebody took me and basically saying you're worthless there's\nNothing to us you are disposable I was at a party and I remember that I started not to feel very well and next thing I Know I was shoved into a room and I'm having my clothes\nTorn some different direction um I was touched\nEverywhere uh I was physically assaulted in every way you could possibly physically assault a woman it was horrible I had no way to fend them off\nYou know what I'm going to ask everyone is wondering if one of those people with Brett Kavanaugh [noise] I cannot specifically say that he was one of the ones who assaulted me\nBut before this happened to me at that party I saw Brett Kavanaugh there I saw\nMark judge there and they were hanging about the area where I started to feel disoriented and we're the room was and where the other boys were hanging out and laughing I can share them laughing and laughing\nVery hard for me to talk about that but it's important that somebody says something because if Brett Kavanaugh\nWas one of those people that did this to me there is no way in the world that he should get scot free on this and that he should be on the Supreme Court he just I said I think ... if he does I there's no justice and the world\nShe said that she saw him standing by the door\nOr or the punch containers I don't know what he did but I saw him by them yes\nIn her

judge Brett Kavanaugh\nWhat did she say for you to say well and so what happened and he happened to me I didn't put two and two together\nBut I Would see boys standing outside of rooms congregated together sort of like a gauntlet and I didn't know what was occurring out that I Would see them laughing a lot of laughing I'm standing in line outside or on the line but definitely huddled by doors and I didn't understand what it could possibly be\nAnd and your declaration you described Brett\nKavanaugh and his friend mark judge standing outside seen them stand outside the door yes with other voice\nSenior suggesting that in hindsight yeah\nYou think he was involved in this behavior I Would say yeah I I it's just too coincidental\nNow here's what NBC's Kate Snow said about the things that putting it said on camera there were different from her written statement\nWhat we want to do here is lay out all that she said her story\nOur reporting we want to be very transparent\nBecause these are very serious allegations Kavanaugh has\nCalled Julie sweat next story nonsense and as far as the president today question her credibility and NBC News for the record has not been able to independently verify her claim there\nAre things that she told us on camera that differ from a written statement as we've been trying to independently to reach out to anyone who were members of
