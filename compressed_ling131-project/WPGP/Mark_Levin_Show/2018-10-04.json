[noise]\n[noise]\nOkay so the FBI report has been delivered from the FBI to\nThe White House to the U.S Senate senators are reviewing it right now some already have the word out a from both sides is that there is no information to operate any of the allegations gets spread capital what does that mean\nEnemies as as of now as everyone the distributed so far the public's has not been able to we have not been able to review that yet I'm this information has at least it's being kept a very close to the best uh by the U.S that it\nIs that this will now interface three of the attack on Brett Kavanaugh said well this doesn't matter\nWe don't like his temperament we don't like the fact that he was tough on us because we made allegations that we now know could not be cooperative by our nation's top law enforcement agency the FBI and a ... and uh and they didn't like how Brett Kavanaugh active when he was being accused of that\nBy those Democratic senators who made this extremely partisan process\nBeverly on Facebook writes this though neither cloture vote that motion has been a\nA filed that should happen tomorrow the confirmation votes should happen on Saturday the Beverly unfaithful crisis we're getting the phone calls ready to go what can the Democrats do now to obstruct or has their game run out there and I think their their games close but I stay very guarded and Vince vigilant if your eye Brett Kavanaugh supporter\nBecause I'm though Susan Collins has made what could be interpreted as positive comments after reviewing a the reports say it seems to be very thorough I'm incomplete that's the opposite of what Democrats what a ... are saying so she's not calling for more investigations I'm Jeff Flake same that there's nothing there\nBut this war is not yet over we talked about this phase three which is already happening this was still face to the the sexual allegations faced three is temperament and they're still focusing on that I think that we'll see that shift happened in the next few hours\nYeah and and look the the the Senate Democrats aren't going to be convincing theirs joined so they're not going to stop the targeting and they know they know just as well as as as you and I do that the three Republican senators that they need to convince they need to get an edge to the three the Susan Collins Lisa Murkowski\nOr Jeff Flake and Jordan I don't think it's going to stop all the way through Saturday and here's why I think they will make an argument to those three senators that even if you vote for cloture tomorrow you think there's enough information out there you think there's FBI investigation was Thoreau that's reason enough to stop the day\nBut we want to convince you that this is not the right nominee for the court and and I think they will still continue making those arguments\nTo those three senators all the way up until Saturday but Jordan\nAt some point those three senators have to step into the well the Senate and do the job to their constituents elected and do and by the way\nThe job that the constitution requires them it doesn't require a yes vote or a no vote but it does require that they provide advice and consent so at some point or come Saturday they're going to have to come down and put their money where their mouth is yeah\nLA writes on Facebook will McCaskill vote for Kavanaugh she's in a close race that's right but the real clear politics average has her down a\nHalf a poison ivy in a very close race in Missouri [noise] that being said than\nWe don't believe that that like Claire McCaskill would be the vote to confirm Brett Kavanaugh or the vote to get it to ... so the vice president can be the vote confirming what we do believe is that if you get flake\nCollege Murkowski that it's very likely that you'll get maybe a job at should at Claire McCaskill because they won't be the deciding vote but it will make their constituents back in ... better vote for them to take in a red state like West Virginia and Missouri\nAnd politically speaking Jordan and all three of those states I I think the constituents of those states would prefer the senators to vote yes I mean the polling we have out of North Dakota in West Virginia is overwhelming a judge Kavanaugh has eight plus thirty favorability there which is almost unheard of\nYou know you've got Joe Manchin probably up by six or eight point you've got Heidi Heitkamp\nWho's racist really falling away from ... in the last poll I saw a she was down twelve points are there in North Dakota she would really like to be a yes vote a Claire McCaskill the same way that the races running towards a Josh Holly there I think she would politically benefit from a yes vote but here's just the reality you set it and I think it's basically an ironclad truth\nNone of them are going to provide the forty ninth or the fiftieth vote for judge Kavanaugh\nAll of them might be willing to provide the fifty first the first fifty second or the fifty third but ultimately Senate Republicans are going to have to deliver fifty votes on judge Kavanaugh if he's going to become justice Kavanaugh\nAlright one eight hundred sixty four thirty one to the talk to us on the air that's one eight hundred six eight for three one two one zero the breaking news here is that we are moving very close\nTo actual votes on Brett Kavanaugh votes the better the cloture vote matter stand that vote is is that let's explain to people get a we will do it throughout the show but a couple of types of people understand what's happening this cloture vote that will happen tomorrow or how many votes required to move forward\nAnd and what happens in the meantime between that cloture vote and the actual final vote to get Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court\nShould the only way you can in debate on any measuring the United States Senate or Jordan is either by unanimous consent or by taking a cloture vote which is a vote to agree to end debate now clearly there's not unanimous consent to end debate on this nomination there never would be so leader McConnell had to file a cloture motion last night\nUnder rule twenty two of the Senate there has to be an intervening day which is today before he can take that vote on the cloture motion so tomorrow at any point and he is said it will be before one o'clock he will call the roll on that cloture motion so centers will go down to the floor\nAnd a yes vote would mean yes we are ready to end debate on this nomination a no vote would be we want to keep debating this nomination so it takes fifty votes\nYou have a tie breaker from the vice presidents do you really only need fifty votes to end debate\nOn that cloture motion if it's approved Jordan it immediately sets the clock to thirty hours you can have thirty hours of posts cloture today\nBefore you take the final vote so you know hypothetical if that vote was at noon tomorrow in theory\nOr the Democrats could continue debating it until six pm on Saturday Night or they could use some of that time back but at the bottom line of vote tomorrow morning or up to one o'clock on the cloture motion which will set a thirty our time clock in motion before the final vote\nGood question coming in from Mike in Pennsylvania on lied five talking about the process here we also talked about what do you think is\nComing next I don't think the Democrats are ready to back to uh get Chris ... codes kinda sounded like that that he expects the confirmation by slim majority but I think you'd get they would like you just to put your guard down there like Brett Kavanaugh seemed to put his guard that bike or for Pennsylvania you're on the air\nThey might [noise] you're like oh it's okay great I can add that I have to think that way but I Would get your theory is if\nThey tried to take it out and act like they were actually which were forced to change their mind the last man which would give the vote but not the confirmation that legally what could they do that\nYou can absolutely have more votes for cloture the confirmation than I mean uh\nUh it's unusual ah but ah but I I think there would be unusual this or would get through and\nEnough would drop drop through a but there are there is always with that argument that you should have up or down votes that would be that vote cloture vote to allow the up or down vote a but things have changed since we went from a sixty votes threshold\nAnd at the filibuster to a fifty ... vote threshold\nYeah this is the conversation I've had with a bunch of people today Jordan and typically you're writing cloture vote or the ... the tally on that is going to look very much like the final confirmation that is not necessarily the case on this because I can see a Heidi Heitkamp\nOr Joe Manchin saying look I really wanted a thorough investigation the FBI gave us that so I did think it was time to wrap up to date but ultimately I couldn't just I couldn't get there\nJust oh I disagree with judicial philosophy but are qualified\nTo be adjusted Supreme Court which all indications ... per capita than yes\nSo they could really do that had to be very part is we don't like his judicial philosophy that doesn't sit well with American voters though\nSo what they do ... he's a criminal except for care corroborate that\nSo what's next by like his temper I don't like the way he he responded to to me typical us there's I think they could just scream with people all the time ... to people all the time and you got to treat them with kid gloves that's uh that's just not the case they're ... they're they're politicians\nDon't forget that there Paola ... state wide elected office holders um I I think again one eight hundred sixty four thirty one to the people and talk to us on the air there is a lot to go through about how how this moves forward\nUm there'll be a lot of debate in America I don't think there's going to be so much for the FBI report honestly I think that it's\nA ... operation there may be some tidbits here there that are unique but the I don't think there would be those kind of blanket statements coming out of both sides of the aisle\nIf there was anything there\nThat is the best case let me repeat that again for Brett Kavanaugh\nThey were not going to come out say Dr Ford is ally or these other people liars they could have come out and found people who agree with the story no what did that\nNot a single person no cooperation of the serious criminal accusations against Brett Kavanaugh so now the light of attack for Democrats is we don't like the way he acts or we don't like the way he sounds we don't like the way he responded\nThis is again just listed for temperament and temperament and temperament over and over again from the left in these next twenty four hours they're going to have time to take to for the U.S sit and talk they're going to do the cable news interviews are but I think\nWhat is so telling Diane Feinstein said\nWhich is that what is a was most interested in or was it was not there that's because there was nothing there to report about Brett Kavanaugh and these are horrendous allegations we come back in the second half hour the broadcast\nTo take your phone calls I brought up the discussion is well we could continue to explain what will happen next which is so important I think people are ready for this with to wrap up [noise]\nUm and we're moving that way in positive direction [noise]\nOne eight hundred sixty four thirty one to the talk to us on the air it's one eight hundred sixty four three one zero follow the

Democrats are\nAt all on the ... and ... they're going to all you know for the most part B no votes except for a couple which are which may come over after a break cabinet reaches a fifty one votes\nIt's abundantly clear during that no matter what Senate Republicans do it's not going to satisfy the Democratic caucus inside the United States Senate I Would say this though even within the three Republicans that we've been talking about\nI think there's a difference I mean I think if you look at senator Collins or statements from the very beginning frankly uh she has been very sober she's been very deliberate she's been very thorough and she has consistently said she wants to see as much information as possible and today she said\nThat this investigation was very thorough I think that is\nA very reasonable way to approach this I I I Will say I take a little bit of an exception with the way Senator Flake handled this during committee number he came out and said I'm satisfied I'm a yes vote and then I think it might be fair to ask the question whether or not he was trying to appease his friend a center Coons\nThey knew you were telling me what that might have been doing for the following has been ready to DC or politically correct attention dismayed learn something it said Larry Elder\n\nLarry over here that said from South in from the ... the union bizarre comments in great health ... dome Iran's welcome to the program no friend allow because we've got to cut me to say though is guaranteed [noise]\n\nI have some go manipulate\nNine seven one s a GED triple late nights them in one of the two for three very able to release that good outcomes duty or we're talking about the\nFBI report that the senators apparently are reading as we speak is\nSupposed to be Fifteen hundred pages long I assume they have summaries [noise]\nFair to call into one of the undecided\nPronounce the investigation quote thorough into quote that seemed to me to suggest that she might very well vote for the confirmation of Kevin but there may be another defection and the Republican side I tell you about that later on this hour [noise]\nLindsey Graham was quoting James Carville [noise] at that lab a forum that I was talking to Dr Sebastian Gorka about I Wonder we play that for you then we're going to talk about it\nIf the president of listening to uh to you right now what could be ... watches a lot of ...

what they did to the women who made accusations\n\nThe Paula Jones reference was made by James Carville drag a hundred dollars to a trailer park no telling what you're going to get they didn't give a rip\nGennifer Flowers publicly stated that she and Clinton had a long standing affair what happened putting goes on sixty minutes and accused her of lying\nYesterday was cash for trash since she sold

Steinem\nSuggested that women should be a stronger stuff woman up she said if it's true and\nHe stopped after you told him to stop no harm no foul the White House even release letters carefully Willie wrote to the president after the incident suggesting that she was lying\n\nDolly cow browning tax lawyer had a decades long affair with Bill Clinton and when she publicly admitted it she says and a lawsuit that the president\nTried to suffer from publishing a novel President Clinton did in the Irish audited her and later on gift is the risk even apologized to her for their excessive so you\nNeed a Broderick since you've been raped by Bill Clinton two weeks after the alleged rape\nThat Hillary verbally intimidated or let her know in no uncertain terms she said but to keep your mouth shut or else where were these people\n\nBy the way after the dateline NBC appearance by Broderick fifty four percent of Americans believed her allegation only twenty three percent found the charges untrue\nAnd after the impeachment trial in the Senate eighty four percent of Americans believe that Clinton both committed perjury and obstruction of justice yet he had a sixty five percent approval rating when he left office\nWhere were these me tours well the movement didn't exist that so you were soft on rape soft on sexual assault until the me too movement came along are you kidding me are you kidding me back to Lindsey Graham\nYoung to remember the uh the bottom line is I Know what can happen to a woman comes forward and political environment\nThat before it I thought was treated

knock it off you're not help but it handiwork and you can actually kill somebody and kept in touch with their cars to get him to shut up\nHe's referring to allegations made by caffeine will do that that's what happened to her by Clinton operatives and of course the crowd was silent because they have no clue what he's referring to\nSo uh you know what he said I don't even understand what that means well and don't really want\nHere's the Atlantic magazine moderator understand what that means obviously he he doesn't know so you know this crowd doesn't know\nMade a product that you can do I do I I don't ever think about the cat what what what's the well they want her to the point is that Donald Trump would have become an even worse\nMary claiming told us just the other day about the things that were done to a Catholic will including killing her cat\nSo we know of all and as we've come a long way we'll come a long\nWay or if I can buy it now outweigh\nWhat do you like it or not I

don't have the temperament to have the job and it's just a job interview if you're getting fired for being a professor after forty years and what's the difference you're innocent or guilty somebody has said you're a communist this goes way back to the inquisition when they would call you in first\nAnd make you testify and then they present the evidence\nLook once you're accused the most heinous crime imaginable it turns into a trial where you have due process here where the burden of proof is on the other side where the evidence has to be clear and convincing in America we don't allow people to destroy other people's reputations in careers based\nOn it in print some guilt the way the ACLU now says he's he'll use as we should presumed guilt not presume innocent\nAnd we come back even the
