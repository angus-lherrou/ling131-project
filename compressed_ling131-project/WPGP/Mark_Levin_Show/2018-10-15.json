thirty one tenth tomorrow\nJust as a reminder pastor Andrew Brunson will be joining us live here on the broadcast on Jay Sekulow alive\nRight now see see how a senior attorney with the ACL Jay and the lead attorney\nOn the Bronx in case a is joining us in Studio and she was with the family are actually in at joint base Andrews when the plane landed\nIn the Bronx is a arrived in the United states I was with him at the White House in the oval office when uh the Bronx and uh met with the president and and other major leaders of the United states as well as with pastor Brunson\nDealt in prayer but they were private moments as well ah so cc let me go first you and just to explain to people what it was life or the Bronx is to finally touched down on us soil\nAnd it was on the line I mean it was a very emotional moment I was on NBC the night before with the children on the ... making arrangements for Andrews Air force base and um you know when they first announced that the plane with a writing we all went out to greet the plane and\nAt the door open and we watched a pastor Brunson and his wife Noreen walk off a plane um at least I don't think there was a dry there between and obviously the children and myself and it was it was extremely emotional that's two years in a hard fought battle coming to an end\nThen he comes off the plane and and what was that experience like who was at the who was there at joint base Andrews\nIt was just literally has a three children and and Jacqueline is married so studying law myself and then on Marines brother brother in law\nAnd then you know you can't you make your way to the White House\nIt did it we had just a little bit of time on at injuries and then we went for the meeting on in the oval office with President\nFairly overwhelming though when meaning that we saw on television ah I've gotten out and meet with President Trump in the oval office it's it's a unique experience for for any one and then the American but what for what we saw me walking and there was quite a quite a group of leaders in that room edited started that way to the meeting start that\nWay we actually did um actually Noreen patch trained her and the rain had a chance to meet with the president did separately yeah it's important to the right and so they had to separate meeting and the children and I met with 'em all the congressman says Senate and represented as that had worked so hard on that so now it's a great time to just ended and for all of their efforts\n... stare on both tenuous air so all those people had a chance to interact with and then we all went into the oval office and that's when the president interact with an answer and ...\nAnd we have some some of the exchange you but I thought what was most powerful and I see about it was\nWhen pastor Brunson asked to pray for President Trump and actually a nail down that this was twenty four hours or after he has released\nA from captivity and turkey is under house arrest ultimately at the end was a bracelet on could have gone back to prison friday\nOr could have been a taken out of house arrest them back at a Turkish jail is studies at the oval office and he thinks a to do and how about yourself as it stands said a to kneel and pray for our president who did so much for his release take a listen here's the prayer but God\n[noise] for us\nFrom supernatural wisdom accomplish\nFor this country and [noise] I had said you give him with some of the leader [laughter] right [laughter] you'll get some perseverance and insurance than than truth [noise]\nYour mind [laughter] you make him a great deal with your wisdom and scream and we left [noise] maybe less or [noise] she [noise]\nThat was it so cc you were there at the oval office already powerful place to be witnessing a this experiencing it what was that moment like\n... ... it really I think the whole room I was going on at that moment that here in as pastor Princeton like you said he's standing president for almost two years just last month or so and house harassed\nBy that his first concern was teeny all down and pray for the president everyone in that room was touched and and you could see it differently\nThe a pause Facebook right said that this outcome encourages me even more before to pray for those persecuted like you see a bb I wanted to ask a SEC how are the Bronx is doing I mean there was a world where the probably a lot of adrenalin flowing\nBut he was under house arrest you for a few months so things much better than being in prison in Turkey a but still that uncertainty and ... inability to leave the house have the\nThe ankle bracelet on have just having that removed on friday and it but uh what is what is it this experience been like and how is their their mood and what would have liked to be with\nA obviously they were over ... to be reunited with their family and he looks very healthy\nI'm very ... ... and you know when asked about that he's he said I I feel good obviously because he's back on us soil and ... and with his children so um and I would say he would absolutely give all credit to the prayers people all over the world that had been praying for him and he's two years that that's how he's been sustained\nOn and been able to just returned his handling such good condition\nMarry an Facebook right since she's emotional just listening to the description\nOf his homecoming I Know he plans to do some interviews I'm\nA ... be on our broadcast march from others as well and people will get that information out for people but I Would suspect after that the family will want some time together\nYeah I think it's just you know they want they want to be with their kids and they want to come down time to\nBe a family and and be alone so and I think they'll they'll pay these interviews and and and they're going to try to go back to just kind of normal life and and I know he had said multiple times you know they're praying about what what's the next step is to learn what happened to him\nYeah because it had been at twenty three years they had served I Know that they would take sabbaticals in time back in the United states for twenty three years their children were in the United states but were raised their of it now living the United states but after spending twenty three years of your life\nWorking in another country um and that being your primary home I'm though the U.S is is was always you know their home uh it's it's got to\nBe a unique I mean ... is Debbie rights and continue praying\nWe've always said this before for these other cases individuals in these kinds of situations\nThat we often celebrate and that's right to do\nAnd it's the right thing to celebrate their release but then we kind of move on and you don't realize that there is a lot going on emotionally and psychologically after you've been imprisoned in going through this experience of house arrest and persecution and um you know they'd have to come to a new place in the sense that you were not expecting to make your permanent\nHome after ... after living in another country for twenty three years or so a praying for the family now is probably more important than ever before especially once the interviews are done and and uh the the the uh the meetings are over with and uh and life has to try and go back to figure out what normal is\nRight and and he has requested that you know just prayers for direction at that time that he and his wife arena praying for just direction as what they should do you know how to use and and obviously his heart is still a foreign ministry and you know he has a pastor's heart and and that's what he wants to continue down\nYeah he's only fifty years old fifty years old right I mean is it ... ... young man and and uh has a lot to accomplish with a young children twenty to twenty Seventeen years old if you want to talk to us on the air one eight hundred six eight four thirty one tenant that just reminded the pastor Brunson will be joining us tomorrow or live on the broadcast\nAnd the United states that that's actually proven true on the house side as well now obviously it's a lot more granular you're talking about district sensitive states candidates really really matter and I would say a national wave is probably less impact in the house than it is and some other places\nAre but I I think if you're the Republican Party in Washington DC a month ago you probably would have conceded that the Democrats were most likely maybe in a private moment you would have conceded to the Democrats were most likely to take over the house or Jordan I think most both parties would now tell you if they were being honest that there's a real fight on your hand this one could really go either direction\nYeah it was based on Facebook writes in Jordan or polls dependable some more than others I like how real real clear politics does it they do with an average of polls or she can see the latest polls but also you know what came out of four days before that\nAnd different polling groups um ultimately they just kind of give you a sense of a race is there a total blowout happening in a race and then I should should resources be shifted somewhere else has something significantly changed\nObviously if three more polls come naturally Marsha Blackburn with a fourteen point leads instead of five or six or at least something significantly change and the voters that are being contacted by the polls\nBut let me remind everybody out there that mid term elections\nAre all about turnout it it is very different than trying to pull 'em a presidential election and instead you mentioned just in North Dakota for instance that Heidi Heitkamp maybe down twelve points in the latest poll it might not be moved to a lean GOP race shoes the incumbent Democrat\nSenator voted against Brett Kavanaugh a lot of people thought that may be the end of her political career\nYou said it's just a few hundred thousand votes that will be cast that day\n... yeah twelve percent is not the same in North Dakota as it is say California only going to be three hundred and twenty five thousand votes cast or so in the entire state of North Dakota Jordan suggest a few thousand votes or can eat into that twelve percent lead very very\nQuickly yeah so you see how [noise]\nGet out the vote efforts to take you to come down to it in a state like North Dakota to to victory\nIf you if you got to people on the ground and the resources to do it\nThe second half hour coming up you got one

welcome to Jay sexual alive\nYou're on the air ...\nGreat thank you very much for taking my call I really appreciate it ...\nYou might concern with the comments about the Republicans chasing him was that says about ... and the polls is is that they're going to become lazy and lacks a day in terms of their boat\nYou're getting to the polls [noise] I'm more concerned with what we do to get people out what can we do is local guys I'm a guy that drives a scooter because I have MS and I don't I don't pass anybody anywhere\nBefore I ask them what their stances and why is it the case\nSo who do they like in the election who'd like and the judge Kavanaugh situation I'm In in trying to uh um necessarily preached to them but certainly wanting to get into a dialogue with everybody I mean on the street but it seems like there's just not enough so he should be doing just a little bit more [noise]\nYeah well I mean you know it all the ... a lot of these depend on where you live so California's state wide very difficult for Republicans\nThere's a gubernatorial race there uh that is contested I'm not saying that it's not money being spent there is but it is very difficult for Republicans federally statewide um and then uh so you look at ... districts there's plenty of congressional districts it really depends on where you live but uh just to give you a a a an indication wrecked\nA tossup races\nIn the house include let me just count one two or three four or five five different California uh seats\nThen if you actually six that if you move into leaning a Republican it includes a few more well leading democratic who's a few more I mean is there a lot it just depends on what district you live in a if you are seeing those kind of efforts are run by those campaigns because then it is these are turnout\nElections I don't say this on the air to to uh listen I I think you always want to run a campaign like you're down ten um uh but you've got also got you have to be able to encourage people to vote they don't want to feel like they have no chance of winning and the big picture to say it's a balance between ... between\nAlways feel like you're in the fight but also the idea that you can win the fight\nYeah I'm In California is a good example of this Jordan I Would say a couple of things first of all I mean I think you're right that you could probably look at more than a dozen races there is being at least somewhat competitive\nBut if you're going to if you're going to paint them all with one broad stroke you would paint them\nAs seats that are currently occupied by a Republican but in traditionally Democrat territory and I I Would wager that probably eight or ten of those districts that you rattled off\nMeat that criteria to get a Republican that either running for reelection or Republicans running for election as he currently held by Republican but it's a district that is usually won by Democrats that's the dichotomy or that is going to be decided in this midterm election and just to the caller's question Jordan whether you're a Republican or Democrat\nAnd the reason that a mid term is typically one by the party out of power is because it is much easier to motivate that voter to go and make a change in the seat that they are casting a vote for so I think it's natural that Republican\nVoters us started behind in the enthusiasm gap but I Do think that the Brett Kavanaugh thing really close that gap but the colors correct\nThere's always going to be a disadvantage as far as the enthusiasm goes up for the party that is in power if the party in power though Jordan closes that gap and the enthusiasm gap is essentially equal going in for the party in power is going to win that seat then\nYou just you know for for our audience who aren't in California that's a good Republican candidate for governor running against new ...\nYeah and I had friends that were anti trust that ice to argue with the but they used to have chocolate the passion and now they're even say you know we got a Mitt he's doing a good job and they're voting for costs because everybody because everybody knows gathering you look at preschool preschool is like the worst city in\nCalifornia he ran into the ground so imagine what he'll do all with all of California so I've seen a lot even some Democrats say that they're going what Cox\nYou never know it'd be California you go to our elections I mean certainly Democrats are favored state wide and California in any race when it's a statewide race but there have been you know Republican governors in the recent past Arnold Schwarzenegger one of\nThem and I again they they can get competitive in these kind of election years in politics has changed significantly since President Trump's election I mean let's just remember I think it changed a lot with President Obama's election\nAnd then it changed if he'll eat with President Trump's election as well and then all of the house seats in California there are play a for Republicans that are important for ... to ... for any way for Republicans to keep control the house of representatives it does I mean I think that I think both bases\nHave something to get excited about a a and to be enthused I Know we focused on the conservative side of makes sense because\nWe were in that move it more I think to me to to talk too much about what's happening on the left is just not fair because I'm not a really a very inside that movement now what it does appear like is there's a lot of anger\nAnd there's a lot of I don't like this person or I don't like this I don't see so much about the candidates\nThemselves there's a ... or ... you know in Texas that if a lot of play but again the polling not looking great for him again turnout matters so could be a close race for Ted Cruz a but but but ultimately I mean those are just a handful the knaves seems like and that's important uniting\nAround candidates is important to actually when I'm just being against things is typically not enough or in the midterms there's the bigger picture which is that where you know it gives them for\nOne or ideology of the political parties or to put it in a very kind of the most mildly a but it but then you've got to actually like the Kennedy because that's what drives you to actually show up\nOn election day even if it's raining us bad weather even if

Smith\nWho was a again a at the hurt on the chaplain in the U.S army a show or when you talked to a number of times about the situation turkey is updated people and pastor Brunson is\nA situation but I wanted to get your thoughts on his release you know as a minister seeing him Neal and prejudice just your reaction to those that twenty four hours of of a release of from uh what was ultimately house arrest in Turkey after a year and a half in prison more than a year and a half a prison\nAnd uh you know stopping over in Germany at the military base than landing at joint base Andrews which you were based in and then um and then being in the oval office with depression United States in prayer for the president\nYeah pastor Brunson a spiritual in personal integrity or was really on display in not in Nebraska doses we on his part but when he prayed for the president and then just this whole demeanor his attitude\nHe very quickly said that he gave his captors and the officials in Turkey who not only arrested in under false pretenses but they miss treated him part of the time he was there\nSay that he gave them immediately was a powerful powerful witness that in addition to him praying for the president in the oval office it shows the the the real a character of the man himself\nYou know I'm going to make sure you all had a chance to hear from everybody in our team who had been working on this comedy or this to the radio broadcasts already get west west comment on that and was pastor Brunson but coming back to be on the air with us live tomorrow or on Jay Sekulow alive

tell you as soon as worked on a number of campaigns young people play a very important role and the grassroots efforts of the campaigns are\nNot taking away from any of our anybody older but you know knock it on neighborhood doors a it takes a lot of time energy if you're out in Nevada and the heat a you could imagine or in other places where it could be called\nUm it's somewhere between uh you know a hills I listen to it they they they fire up campaigns young people and that it is important that you you see that kind of enthusiasm around a candidate is not everything grass ... grassroots plays a very important role in midterm elections and saying that race in Nevada is key\nYeah the Nevada race Jordan as we talked about that is one of the races the Democrats absolutely have to win if they want to be the majority in the United States Senate and that race like many of the others are has moved decidedly and Dean Heller direction I think if you look back a couple of months ago I think you would have probably prefer to be Jacky Rosen in that race I think right now you prefer to be\nA Dean Heller Ernest followed the national trend that we've seen but er during the common I Would make about that raises if Democrats don't win that seat\nThey won't be in the majority in the United States Senate that's ...\nYeah I mean let me let me go to west south west you're you're you know your thoughts\nJust as the it seems like the mood has changed me\nYes one of that is the president's back on the campaign trail and doing what he does best which is a those rallies and they are a now happening you know almost every day or or or even sometimes too and one day they will continue to ramp up we've heard from a ...\nA White House orange she made clear the president will continue to be on the road even you know today's surveying the damage in forties do his job as commander in chief is with pastor Brunson on\nA Saturday but it was back at a campaign rally or you know that\nI followed that showed me he is he is out there um it does seem like there's been just a shift I I and I I don't just say that because I I'm a conservative it just it just seems like with the Kavanaugh what happened there everything's just started changing ... going the opposite direction for Democrats who were all the optic at least electorally\nAbsolutely they were producing a blue wave and I think many people you know are believed it I certainly was concerned that they might be right but here's the thing Jordan the American people by and large or a decent in kind people\nAnd the political climate has changed and it's been so ugly you mentioned ... ... you know justice Kevin all that happened to him look at recent statements by Eric Holder in Hillary Clinton and Elizabeth Warren are that are really mean spirited kinds of things\nAnd I think the American people are turned off on that and when they see these kinds of things going on not only does it energized the GOP based to get out and vote which needs to happen but it moves independent voters also\nIn the name of decency and kindness which is a value most Americans it moves them also to vote for the Republican candidates the Democrats really I I think are looping when they ought to be running because of their own miscalculations\nThey're ignoring the values and the concerns I Believe that the average American a middle America in southern America and I think it's going to come back to to bite them and the mid term elections as a real possibility of that but the answer your question is the political climate and the ugliness\nThat is on the one hand turning off American people but on the other hand energizing name in the midterms to go out and vote\nYeah let's go to Joe in New York on line one Jonah welcome to Jay suck you alive\n\nSub go cripple eight\nNine seven one S. H. G. E. triple late nights them once every two or three marry older relief after dot com studio Kanye West being slammed as an Uncle Tom a Sambo in other words I Can't say on the air for his visit\nTo the oval office see President Trump President Trump of course it's racist for not having more blacks and his administration [noise] Wexler called sellouts and Coons and uncle Tom's\nSo you wonder why there aren't more sellouts tuned to Michael Thompson demonstration we talking about that later on as well and Hillary says that Bill Clinton should not have stepped down over the Monica Lewinsky scandal why ... says Monica Lewinsky was an adult\nAnd therefore it was not an abuse of power [noise] and Trump on sixty minutes\nSo he did not make fun of Dr Christine for all of that and more ... late nights and one is a GE triple late nights every once in a two for three but first Elizabeth\nWarren says that she took a DNA test and according to the Boston Globe the DNA test found quote strong evidence close quote a warrant Native American ancestry going back to six to ten\nGenerations you have very very special people you were here long before any of us were here\nAlthough we have the representative in Congress who they say it was a long time ago that caller Pocahontas but you know what\nI like you because your special your special people you are really incredible people and I have to from the heart\nNow the Cherokee Nation has responded to reports are the results of orange DNA test in what the Cherokee Nation said it was quote a DNA test is useless to determine tribal citizenship\nCurrent DNA testing not even distinguish whether a person's ancestors were indigenous to North or South America\nSovereign tribal nations set their own legal requirements for citizenship in while DNA tests can be used the term in lineage touches fraternity to an individual is not evidence for tribal affiliation\nUsing a DNA test to lay claim to any connection to the Cherokee Nation or any other tribal nation even vaguely is inappropriate and wrong it makes a mockery out of DNA test and it's legitimate uses\nWhile also just honoring legitimate tribal governments and their citizens whose ancestors are well documented and his heritage is proven Senator Warren is undermining tribal interest with her continual claims of tribal heritage into quote\nA mentor I'm coming up and elections\nHistorically whoever is president I don't know why this horse but\nPeople get complacent with just one the president they now two years later we have an election so they're complacent and then we always win and the next one which is as you know the presidential election\nSo how many of them\nI see those candidates before my eyes [noise]\nEvery night before I go to sleep\nWhile I'm sleeping I Love the show\n[laughter] [noise]\nOh God this guy [noise]\nI've got more Indian blood in me how God\nAccording to David her sunny at the conservative federal is that the Boston Globe report was quote Luther ludicrously an skeptical\nAnd said that the percentage of Native American\nBlood in her is quote a far cry from any reasonable threshold to embrace minority status for job close quote but that's exactly what Warren did she applied for a job with Harvard and mentioned that she was Native American\nPeople in New York Times said\nQuote the average white person in America has nearly double the amount of American indian DNA as Warren there's little genetic data available for Native Americans and these tests merely rely on some guesswork\nBy referencing the DNA to people from South America to suggest warrant dubious ancestral claims had been vindicated is an assault on reason into full that's in New York Times\nDid you step across the aisle and and maybe a try to convince Senator Warren from Massachusetts to come in and be the ambassador to Tom golf or someplace like that [noise]\nYou know she wouldn't be my first choice you know she's been a very very for senator she has which is where you are away little legislation she has been not you know the funny thing about Elizabeth Warren's has been a lousy southern should a terrible yeah because I'm In a low of this president's yeah where she she's done a ... here we are right\nGreg calling Pocahontas the regret that\nDo I do regret calling a folk artist because I think it's a tremendous insult to focus so self conscious I Would like to see high so I don't see a lot of reaching across the aisle but who knows\n[noise] meanwhile Hillary Clinton has surrendered her security clearance\nAny of this all goes back and forth to the state department's ongoing review of the mishandling of classified information related to Hillary Clinton's use of a private email server and it also kind of gives you an idea of how slow some things moving government because almost a year and a half\nAgo the chair of the Senate Judiciary Committee Republican Chuck Grassley sent a letter to the state department asking about the status of Hillary Clinton security clearance in that letter Grassley stated that any government workers who possibly engaged\nIn such serious offenses quarter at the very minimum have their security clearances suspended pending an investigation well\nThree weeks ago the state department and finally responded to Senator Grassley twenty Seventeen letter saying quoting here\nAt her request former Secretary Clinton security clearance was administratively was drawn on August thirty is twenty eight teams letter went on to say that on September twentieth the security clearances of five other Clinton researchers had also been ... vote\nOnly Clinton a Cheryl Mills was lifted the other foreign names were redacted of course at the time was a pro Hillary Clinton was running for president and no charges were filed this summer President Trump Bruce vote the security clearance of former CIA director John Brennan\nAnd at the time the White House said it was reviewing the clearances of several other people so about Seventeen months after Grassley sent a letter he finally got a response from the state department\nSo it looks as if we did a preemptive strike by surrendering her security clearance as opposed to having a remote Byron York is a conservative writer and a Fox News contributor\nOf a key issue of course are in her a secret email server was that uh she did send classified information\nOr over this unclassified basically an secured a system and there's really no doubt about that I suppose you could argue whether it was super important stuff or not but the the fact that it was classified she did send it in a casual way over and an secured system seems pretty much beyond dispute now\nNow speaking of Hillary Clinton did bill abused his power because of his relationship with Monica Lewinsky the Internet there are people who look at\nThe incidence of the nineties and they say a president of the United states cannot have a consensual\nRelationship with an intern the power imbalance as to why an adult\nBut let me ask you this where the investigation of the current incumbent against him numerous allegations have been made\nWow you see your husband was not investigated because he had an affair and the oval office was being investigated for whitewater\nAnd they came up during the investigation and he would not have been in ... not lie about it under oath and which he\nDismisses denies and ridicules so there was an investigation and as I Believe came out in the right place\nAnd once again Hillary was not asked about the allegation made by now we have to rape survivors name Juanita Broderick the two weeks after the alleged rape by Bill Clinton you Hillary Clinton verbally intimidated her that somehow never came up he didn't do that to the man\nThe Kavanaugh hearing also turned attention back to the me too movement which complicates Clinton's place in women's history\nIn the Nineteen nineties she stood by her husband Bill Clinton as he denied allegations of sexual harassment and assault\nWhat role if any did you play in criticizing the character of the women who have accused bill of sexual misconduct\nCheck out her answer what role

need to projects it to ... you really intimidated her what about that\nAlready have their opinions about\nThink that you know take advantage of\nThe law the hat on for a minute\nOkay so that's what I was going to happen because you know you kind of figure\nYou know it was from the get on the\nWhite from\nKanye to reach African American or as a\nAnd I I don't know you know I uh [noise]\nBut I mentioned he did a rap called cop killer and I could take a pig out and blank blank blank and now plays picks on TV and I just mentioned\nI really think both of them are very\nYou know I think he would never go down [noise]\nAnd you would stand by that because you have like bringing bringing in comparison to ... that there was\nNo no no no no like in in a way as a husband and wife as a wife standing by her husband\nAnd\nI didn't want to because you know can still meeting Trump and you know with her agenda but you know look at it as a hurricane\nReally serious meeting with her\n[noise] I Wonder what kind of activities were going on when President Obama was meeting with rappers like common and PIN\nJay Z oh darn Brazil way down on ... um when she's not revealing the question for debate I guess you have time to observe popular culture\nBased on this is an interesting thing and maybe maybe Trump is is bucking the trend have seen other president to people get tired of looking at them

Hillary the debate questions ahead of time therefore shifting Bernie Sanders shaft in the other Democrats who wanted a fair competition does he gives you a nomination but again\n[laughter] and look
