he he was against anchor babies I guess is what they're called\nSo but if tomorrow Donald Trump or the issue is the executive order what happens next\n[noise] well you would almost certainly see lawsuits immediately that they would\nAlmost certainly be played out in court I can because we don't really know what the executive order would say\nThat the specifics of what the lawsuit would be over as it's hard to imagine a\nBut it almost certainly there would be ... injunction that they would try to have issued to stop all off and going into effect a it till the Supreme Court can can rule on it and kind of deal with that issue and flush it out um\nBut it it it got it it's just hard to say where it will go other than the fact that it's likely to take the same path as say the\nThe the previous executive order regarding immigration from certain countries and putting a hold on that you know where you'll have various courts going back and forth until ultimately the Supreme Court deals with it um but again the specifics are are hard to tell at this point\nSo I'm going to be the the the talk of the executive order is just the way to start the conversation\nOr would Donald Trump of going out to the degree do you think and ah you know just the ... because he thinks it needs to be tested but he wants to get it resolved or is it just so purely political move on his part do you think\nYeah I I Can't read the president's mind I I Do know that this has been something the president said repeatedly throughout his campaign that that he was focused on doing that he's hinted at executive orders during his campaign for that\nI Am looking at various legal routes that he could take a it\nCertainly has had an effect and Congress Lindsey Graham came out or just today that this morning and saying that he wanted to introduce legislation or to go through Congress to to that effect to eliminate birthright citizenship a which again because we don't have the text of that bill like\nIt's hard to know exactly what it would report to do a my guess is that would be something to the the effect of of stating congressional intent that it this is how we understand the fourteenth amendment to to ... and how would you\nApplied in regards to certain subsets of of individual such as the children of illegal immigrants or non permanent resident alien I'm Sorry yeah I mean I I Can't read the president's mind but it certainly having all the political effect of it but it is something that he has talked about repeatedly and attack\nCould you make a case for this being a good move if nothing else comes of it other than just finally being cleared up\nI mean it it certainly would be I think that for every one cat it cleared out that it's something that Congress has had the opportunity in the past to get clear up a ... something that the courts have not really touched before in ... in many ways\nLike direct that conversation and and it's kind of force that its conclusion like ... yeah and that's all speculative because we\nDon't know what that executive order will say and what issues that will raise um but yeah it's ... again I without that tech it's just hard to know\nI got a little less than a minute maybe a ... should conservatives be uncomfortable with the idea of executive orders like this no matter what the the reason\nI think in in this limited case where it is that the president saying look\nWithin the scope and my presidential authority this is a very unclear area of law where the Supreme Court has not ruled at where Congress has not clarified it and this is not the president trying to make\nPolicy necessarily edits him saying like I have the job to ah to enforce the law to enforce the constitution it is unclear what it means in this regard and so I'm going to utilize this good faith interpretation and that's a far cry from you know thinking not enforcing the law or that he's ignoring the law\n... which is something that we saw with with DACA and and other sorts of deferred action policy is where it was just to attempt to ignore the law down and force it um it really is it different limited focus of it's unclear what the\nWhat the correct interpretation is that at least in regard to that hasn't been clarified and and so it is something that is certainly within his purview to do\nPay any amount of time I really appreciate you clearly not up for us I think it's clear it up but at least is cleared up more freezing it was Fifteen minutes ago I appreciate it always griping like\nYeah okay thank you and we will be back and they

interview\nThere'll be airy or later on HBO\nMentioned the idea of\nBirthright citizenship he's asked a question about\nAction through executive order when it comes to a those board a from illegal immigrants so we've got a question company Christine on Facebook\nSure George what is the difference really illegal immigrants and undocumented immigrants\nIt is a matter of choice of words the left typically likes to use the word a documented immigrate it's seen as more PC uh because uh again I documented the truth is what does a doc you to be read your illegally here so there's no difference I just try to use both terms because people\nAre sometimes hear one antique well maybe the other doesn't apply\nApplies to both because they are they are in effect the same thing at take a listen to President Trump he he was asked to have you spoken with as you plan on on on this executive order\n'em and again there's different ways to write this executive order I mean we're just getting the very ... general statements for President Trump\nHas he consulted council take a listen by to\n\nTalk about the ... you know I have to wear in the process in the process\nSo I mean they say you tend to process it will happen I I Believe the focus will be a primarily on those who have no legal right to be the United states so call it a documentary called the illegal who didn't have children and\nI just to give you kind of sub statistics about that uh this is peaks but uh just back and I see it was there's been three hundred and Seventy thousand of these children according to a ... a study\nOr so the numbers are kind of all over the place depending on how you define the term in twenty four teeth\nThere were about two hundred and Seventy five thousand babies were Seventy five thousand babies were born to unauthorized immigrant parents so illegal immigrant parents that's about seven percent of the four billion birds that year US citizenship of course is a grant of of it is it's very important\nThe difference between getting birthright citizenship it'd be naturalized actually has long implications for what kind of office you can hold\nIn the United states should he be president of the United states but also the rights of responsibilities that come with it or all emitted from one part of the constitution it is the fourteenth amendment which reads all persons born or naturalized in the United states\nAnd subject to the jurisdiction thereof are citizens of the United states and if the state of where they reside\nThat is the big question west and Harry are you subject to the jurisdiction of the United states in a positive way where you are here illegally\nRight and you go back in and look at at one can versus art Eighteen Ninety a case where which was the last time the Supreme Court definitively dealt with this they put qualifications in their decision that the the parents of this Chinese American\nThey were here legally and we're doing legitimate business in the United states is that what we're looking at and I know a lot of people just assume that it's law\nThat if you were born here no matter the status of your parents you're automatically a citizen while that is sad or practice Jordan it's really not settled law because the Supreme Court has not dealt with this directly since Eighteen Ninety eight\nYeah I mean you look at it really wasn't until the Nineteen sixties till they started becoming\nAcceptable that we just kind of said okay well if your parents were here legally that doesn't matter you were born here so you're a citizen we're not really I don't think the president to do to change this for lawful permanent residents and even people who are here temporarily but lawful a but instead for those who are here totally illegally\nWithout any kind of proper paperwork that they are not subject to the jurisdiction there of of the United states in a positive way you look at Harry the constitution the positives and negatives of law\nAnd and it sits if you're here illegally if it it's the negative that you're facing as the jurisdiction and the jurisdiction is you can be deported but at the U.S government owes does speak to you other than the deportation proceedings itself\nYour analysis is spot on Bruce writes citizen trip is tied to the fourteenth amendment the fourteenth amendment codified the Eighteenth sixty six civil rights act\nThe Eighteenth sixty six civil rights out quite clearly exempted from automatic citizenship or children of parents who owed allegiance to a foreign power\nI eat those were in the United states only temporarily and particularly those who were in the United states illegally\nConsistent with that analysis in Eighteen eighty four\nIn the L. versus Wilkins case the Supreme Court rejected the citizenship claim by an American Indian who was born on a reservation and subsequently moved to a non reservation territory because the ... claim it was not subject to the United states\nUm the jurisdiction at birth so the key question is\nAre the parents subject to the jurisdiction\n... of the United states if they are not then there's some doubt as to whether or not their children their offspring or indeed citizens of the United states and lastly let me add that the United states is one of only two developed countries according to ...\nInternational Monetary on that allow or birthright citizenship is also really early this policy is questionable\nAnd not only that Jordan a number of countries in the last ten or Fifteen Years have changed their laws to explicitly forbid what his productively called anchor babies in their country through that you're not automatically a citizen if you're born there and that includes the United kingdom Australia New Zealand France in India\nThose five countries have said no longer are you automatically a citizen if you're born here\nIf you talk to us on the air what's your opinion of this the president doing it by executive order give us a call one eight hundred sixty four thirty one tended how this could influence the mid term elections I mean with the caravan issue\nWith this issue or the executive order front and center one week out from the mid term elections his people are voting right now in the early voting all across the country or how could this impacts the mid term elections as well I think you can't take that away when you're talking about the city on Facebook that really gets his votes\nAsked this way I think it's a great question can individuals from another country come here to the U.S visit so basically tourists FISA\nHave their child be bored here so that they will be American says this is called birth tourism though the Obama administration has cracked down on this right now under the current laws yes you could if you came here to a tourist visa\nHappened to have the birth wow you were all that tourist visa a you did or your child would be or could be if you do choose a U.S citizen by birth absolutely\nSo essentially what we've had is a deliberate pre meditative practice why some visitors to the United states to ensure that their child would indeed be born in the United states and then they would take the child back to the home country of the parents\nSo that the individual could later claim the trial citizenship and the United states and perhaps citizenship in China or Japan or some other country\nIt's important to note that at least one of the nine eleven terrorists\nAh I was born in the United states in the state of Louisiana\nHis parents then moved abroad I believed to Saudi Arabia he was raised abroad and then he came back to the United states to do what\nChildren born to illegal so in twenty sixteen the number approach four hundred thousand or that is an absolutely huge number and so policies have consequences\nSo we should seek to deter birth tourism and\nThere's a proposal would as you correctly point out Jordan not affect those individuals who are all ready here the focal point\nHe's on ending the practice going forward yeah uh and so I think I'm there is perhaps some unwarranted\nFears that have come up with respect to individuals who are already here the president has also proposed a ... ... legalizing some illegals\nAll over time or in the ... with the cooperation of Congress ... what we're talking about is a proposal\nUh that would look at new births are and in this practice and I think at least\nBased on my legal research it's clear beyond question that the United States Supreme court has offered various opinions on that particular question going back to Eighteen eighty four\nI think this is what we can answer very quickly Larry and Indiana has this or a question for slavery welcome to Jay suck you alive you're on the air\nThank you I'm I'm a I'm a supporter of changing correct or immigration laws a summons part of it but I Believe it would have either have to be down through through legislation and land or the amendment process for this reason these rate you know it it for\nFor many years now that the people that were born babies that were born even possessions yeah it's basically ... you have to ship yep markets were considered\nTestified in the U.S code right\nRight second um if so if someone comes out of the ticket scenario for male male illegal alien comes to the United states across the border and then does not marry but as children\nBy a U.S citizen of the ... the child as a U.S citizen one parent is enough and that is to find also even if you were born abroad are there some time issues there but if it happened in the United states and the parents is a U.S citizen or one of the parents that that child as a U.S citizen that is not an issue here\nOn on what President

what does it mean to be subject to the jurisdiction of its does it say or a uh it's it it is a requirement\nThe were subject to the ... that means something that phrase so it's more than just be bored in the United states that phrase subject to the jurisdiction of is there for a reason both did the constitution the fourteenth amendment in the statutes that have followed that\nHas a meaty how far does is what is at issue here uh for let's say I I see his record is already been clear if you were a lawful permanent resident have a child here\nOr there US citizen right now if you are here legally ah those children are us citizens I mean even if you are here legally that is how the U.S has been treating those situations it's the Nineteen sixties\nThe president looking at doing this uh by executive order appears to be limited way to a limited group of of individuals that are here illegally there's also this idea of this birth tourism\nThe idea of these people who are planting birds around at companies to set this up\nThe Obama administration really fought down a fought back against those companies as well because those people would get tourist visas and then have the children I think that's the issue as well or to talk about here so we're going to get it all that one hundred sixty four thirty what tended let's not forget\nWe're a week out from the mid term elections we've got this caravan issue as well but people have a lot to say\nOn this topic and I want to go right to the phones Greg in South Carolina on line three Greg welcome to Jay sexual alive\nThank you for taking my call I'm I'm a resident in this country and what I originally applied I applied for a temporary visa while the word processing like bring 'em\nOne of the things I could do was appear in front of a judge and agreed to people's facial processes all habit actually in place that I've been deported should I write the laws of this country you know what question is how could anybody given it to that position of timing citizenship\nWhen the laws are already broken\nA you know it gets to that issue of it is the child does be bored breaking the law\nOr at what point did they make the decision now it's so that's where it gets fuzzy Greg just to be honest with you legally that's why there will be battles over this discussion the heated discussions over it on both sides the out but I think what you brought up Greg what I hear too for so many people as those who came here legally those\nWho went through the process to be either become ultimately maybe ... play the ultimately become a U.S says it takes a long time we went through the ... the the temporary status to the permitted set us those really to the citizenship status they are who are ... there who are most affected\nBy these laws that that people could utilize this to to jump for it I Will talk about we come back to the break but to me it's always interesting to hear from those callers who've had to go through this\nAre here legally his father's here legally I Know there's issues there are ... shoes I Would have if you will consulted attorney they would have told you Rob that because he was an adult and not a minor there were some issues there but he withdrew her written this process\nAnd his father's illegal US citizen and you all to at least said after that who were this process or just go through the system he got granted the citizenship got put on the list this is how long it will take you before you could cover it start that process but you can\nThat's what I keep pointing out I just want to go to both here was here he is very difficult for those who want to come here legally already and they go through a lot to to get US citizenship is important to them their\nUS citizenship we as as Americans who did not go through that process sometimes take it for granted they don't and when you hear those kinds of stories David stories of\nDifficult immigration detentions until you said they'll go back and do it the right way we got your granted citizenship ultimately have years to come these the kinds of stories that should be focused on a because these ... these are very poor this should be just as\nThe the ... as well instead of just the illegal immigrants crossing over to bypass people are like his his son\nYeah we are a compassionate country I'm a compassionate person I understand if I Lived in one country and I was poor and I looked across the river and I knew that I could go there and better my life I Would want to come\nBut you can be compassionate and yet we must

I just want people to know I agree with cars and my grandmother was born in the United states in Nineteen online to parents is that green card and until they took out the best and shipped their children that were here I Can't go at the times\nA day later headlined none of them were considered tennis and then tell their parents want of that or they can tell that I agree with what counts doing\nYeah I mean a lot of us have this experience the laws have changed since ... Tito died or been clarified says they died would there were those big immigration waves there in the Eighteen hundreds of green cards were given out you are correct that the children are especially if a at the children were born in the United\nSave some were so we're not ah ah but if they were born of United States had to also apply for\nCitizenship as well but laws have been changed\nWe could say brought it out as well but I think you know a appreciate your history and realizing that based off this constitutional provision\nThings have changed soups are significantly really starting to Nineteen sixties really that that time period we started to allow this idea of the border the U.S to totally ... parents would do we go right to be here\nA caller legal immigrants called the just a passing through illegally called a documented\nThat suddenly that child as a U.S citizen back to the phones we go to get that they teach sixties uh before that we did not have policies like those are much different process Israel calling from Arizona on lights for Israel welcome to Jay sexual alive\nIsrael are you there yeah ... yes I'm here earlier hello\nYeah a a high a binding as they show I'm calling from actually Arizona [noise] ah what happened is I just want people to understand an immigrant myself I came here a naturalized and I'm a U.S citizen but I just want people to know that uh people out of the country\nKnows the U.S laws better than people who live here I don't know how to mend nuclear laid it saves them well and then the tea all Americans\nI just could not believe it let me give you that for an example for for instance Liberia in Africa I was born in Africa yeah Liberia in the constitution people it's that the white man kidnapped will be citizen\nWhether you were born there or and I think it said you you even if you're married to one you can never be citizens you can only be able to own land\nBy Mary into Liberia so when you see all these things like China for instance you better be Chinese to Chinese rule fail and whatever you bought one thousand children that they all can that be citizen so I think Americans need to be educated\nTo rules outside of this country and maybe they were on the stand what you guys are talking about\nBecause it's unfair to Americans that we can't come here we can have to also this shapes but Americans getting out how to office tapes what these ... countries\nHere you know it's interesting some countries do a lot of dual citizenship for us but I think what you said they show which was dead on\nI'll let our guys disgusted that we want to get to calls is it what we have these unbelievably open last year where a country that welcomes civic groups because the British based so they were gracious enough by\nWhat race you are but nationality you are or were a melting pot but ... what is most important is that people outside the U. S. though are laws that are that we do and they know how to manipulate them\nYeah there are so many loopholes and inconsistencies and our laws and I think the average American the caller's right we do not understand that people that are trying to get here they understand it very very well but there is no real definitive statute that deals with what we're talking about today and they're certainly not ... not a Supreme Court precedent\nAnd that's why I think what the president is doing will force our hand as a population to actually do with this and to come up with something that that can be articulated and that is understood by everybody\n... or call illustrates the necessity of reforming\nThe U.S immigration system so I think President Trump is right on to suggest change change is necessary in part because many foreign nationals fully understand the loophole that already exist in us\nLaw heroin color from Austin, Texas I lied to Carol welcome to Jay sexual live\nThank you address my point I think in that I really do yeah I Am in total agreement that something has to be done about that the um birthday that well understand why President Trump wouldn't do it I guess you'd order playing out in early in the end I like her\nTypical kind of let us of operations\nOh how he wants to govern he has said that but sometimes it's the only option um you you could do this was a short term if if you got if\nIt is ultimately decided he has the authority to do this this would be a stopgap it does not guarantee the future presidents\nWill not do an executive order but he could start the process to do legislative reform and then ultimately um I get this before the U.S Supreme Court even even if it these constitutional reform as well or or or\nDo\nGo matriculate\nNine seven one S.

A. G. E. AAA mentioned in one seven to ... for three but first please welcome back in the program\nJohn useless former dean at Chapman University school of all their former law clerk for Justice Clarence Thomas [noise]\nEspecially if you're very much simpler time I really do appreciate it\nLarry ... is always a pleasure to be on with the great the age of south central\nLa thank you I Want to talk to you first about the care of him and then I Want to talk to you about President Trump's assertion that can change the interpretation of the fourteenth amendment which has been interpreted to allow an illegal alien to come to this country have a child on American soil and that child automatically become an American citizen but first we'll talk about the care of them\nTell me what legal authority has not to put troops on the border\nAbout ... ... troops stopping in a date and in the United states has one of the primary reason we have troops are dating back to the civil war there's a federal law called the ... comic heart attack\nThat says the U.S military can't be used in the interior of the United states for regular police activity but that's not what President Trump is proposing to do is proposing to put them on the border to stop folks from illegally invading our country\nProfessor how come previous presidents haven't done this I mean this this so called invasion as you put it has happened year after year after year not quite as large would want to have another president's done this\nAbout because they don't like our immigration laws and they're not willing to enforce them and they don't they don't think about the consequences of what this lawlessness is doing to our society\nLet's talk about consequences professor what happens if somebody get shot\nWell that's a terrible thing and you know uh I I'm hoping that that doesn't happen that's clearly what the laugh that is a funding this caravan is hoping will happen or even better interview would be that it were a child so we can get the nightly news running constantly and tell them between now and election day\nBut the fact of the matter is these people are putting themselves and their children in harm's way\nAbide violating the laws of this country or they claim that they are refugees and we have an international law obligation to\nConsider their claims for asylum but as far as I've been able to tell not one of them is making claims that actually fit the definition the legal definition of refugee they're not fleeing their countries because they are being persecuted because of their political or religious\nOr race or ethnic views\nThey're playing our country because they want to go to a place that has a better economy that's not one of the ground for refugee status\nWhy hasn't Mexico stop them even after Donald Trump has told them to even after Donald Trump has said he's going to withhold aid from Guatemala and Honduras my resume I have some sort of economic punishment to Mexico Mexico hasn't stopped them\nWell in the same international law that were require us to consider their claims for asylum required Mexico to consider their claims for asylum as well uh in Mexico should be stopping now because that was the first country that they entered into illegally to\nMake these refugee claim um but but some of them have and I think Mexico with profits profits NGOs but some of the we don't want to stop and Mexico we want to get all the way the United states which is just further proof that this wasn't concerned about persecution in their home countries\nIt's if they want a different economy to live and and that's not a ground for refugee status\nWhat would happen professor if we're allowed fourteen or seven thousand so call migrants to to transport themselves through our country to go all the way up to Canada\nAbout candidate would stop him as well same reason that you know there there are legal processes in place here and\nCountries have the ability to define a you know what their immigration and naturalization policies are if if you don't allow that then they're ... you have no such thing as a nation you have no such thing as sovereignty President Trump is absolutely correct on that Without Borders you have no nation\nExplained the grounds for which people can apply for asylum\nWell you've got to have a credible claim that you are being persecuted or under threat of persecution based on your political views your religion your um your race\nOr your ethnic background those sorts of things that's being poor and wanting a better life is not a ground for refugee status for asylum under international law and certainly not under any other law the United states\nThe president professor has said that there may be some bad guys there including maybe people from ISIS or even al ... is there any basis to believe that\nWell we we've seen some reports of that I I'm not\nPrivy to the intelligence but it wouldn't surprise me what that border it's porous and if you're stopping people at the port of entry on the east coast in New York or what have you and vetting them properly uh than than folks that are aiming to come here to the United states to\nDo with terrorist harm ... feet a more poor ... entry and that Mexican border is right now the poorer than tree so it wouldn't surprise me to find a significant number of potential terrorists in this group\nMy professor John Eastman Chapman University school of law professor what about funding you mentioned that this Margaret chairman as being funded by the last what do you mean\nAbout you know it takes a lot of money to transport seven thousand people to feed them every day uh you know over the span of space that they've gone and that's ... I Want to know\nWho's funding it and if they were poor and our country that they couldn't you know you gotta living who's paying for them to eat on the ... along the way somebody must be doing it and quite frankly it's most likely\nYou know you you just kinda go to the explanation that makes most that it's most likely somebody that is trying to interfere\nWith the U.S election by setting up a confrontation that then the news media can turn a contrary to President Trump and his supporters\nLet's turn to the fourteenth amendment here's what President Trump said\nOn the immigration some legal scholars believe you can get rid of the practice and ship\nWithout changing the constitution Wade executive order exactly right\nOr have you thought about that is totally mall it was always told me that you needed a constitutional amendment ... and you don't you know number one number one you don't need that nobody can actually you know very much into well you can definitely do with an act of Congress but now they're saying I can do it just was an executive order\nNow how ridiculous we're the only country in the world where a person comes in as it may be and the baby is essentially a citizen of the United states for eighty five years with all of those benefits to kill us history they just and it has to end maybe you talked about that with counsel young yeah where in the sense in the process it will happen\nWhen an executive order that's what you're talking about things that I didn't think anybody but I knew that but me I thought it was the only one China is\nProfessor Eastman can he do this with an executive order\nWidely because let's let's be real or first principles the president cannot amend the constitution by an executive order Congress can amend the constitution by an act of Congress and the Supreme Court\nIsn't supposed to be able to amend the constitution by issuing a judgment or ruling in a cave but that's not what the president is talking about here the constitution doesn't require birthright citizenship\nIf there's anybody born here and subject to the jurisdiction are citizens all he's trying to do with clarify what that phrase subject to the jurisdiction mean and it doesn't mean anybody who happens to be subject to our laws because they're physically present here it meant something much more complete them at all in the lead into the country being part of the body politic\nAnd that's what the debate of the fourteenth amendment make clear that's what the early Supreme Court decisions on that's made clear and the Supreme Court has never held otherwise are we now so so that would mean that the children of citizens or the children of lawful permanent residents are automatically citizens by virtue of the fourteenth amendment\nBut the children of temporary visit or whether it's a tourist visa or student either ... or or or or certainly the children are people who are not lawfully present in the United states at all or not automatic citizens according to the constitution\nAnd the president is trying to faithfully apply that clause that it was drafted and ratified in an ad that meant to the people that path\nThat forty five seconds left professor I thought there was some sort of Supreme Court case that came out in the early eighties have some sort of footnote which people point to to argue that anybody who's in the country even illegally has a child on the American soil a is an automatic citizen isn't there some sort of case that people point to ... rightly or wrongly they use to make that argument\nThey do it's called ... and if the ridiculous case had said that states have to provide free education\nTo the children of illegal immigrants under the equal protection clause and excited a footnote that says look they're they're they're awful citizens if they're born here but that was not a holding them\nThey say suicide at issue in that case it was just what we called ... that the Supreme Court just with the back of the had added something\nProfessor gonna run thank you very much of it I really appreciate it All right\nSo there's no there's no sense in which um there's ... there's absolutely a housing crisis in California and people are becoming very very upset about this and they're looking for government or to put in place policies that will make it easier and less costly to build a increase supply and bring those prices down\nYou might remember a few years ago professor I I got a fact check when I was on CNN when I talked about\nUm the ... the high cost of a of a of regulations and said that if you add up the taxes and regulations are all those things government takes about fifty percent away from the American people I've got a phone call from from some fact checker\nAnd they said how do you know the cost of regulation is what you say it is\nA and I'm a I recommended them to a number of people and I recall you telling me that if anything I probably understated the or the number and the argument they gave me was that regulations also have benefits and and you're not taking the exhilaration the benefits at these regulations produce what's your reaction to that\n[noise] well regulation exist to provide protection and it's supposed to provide protection to consumers\nRegulations in the housing market [noise] when I look at them I really can't see much a protection for consumers um let's take California's latest folly which is to require\nBy two thousand twenty of virtually every single family home will be required to have solar panels on its roof top this will raise the cost\nOf a building that home by about thirty thousand dollars [noise] all for the purpose of generating solar power we already have so much solar generation that we are paying Arizona to take solar power offer hand around around noon and one PM [noise]\nUm that type of regulation feeds into\nA small number of people in the state who think it's just absolutely wonderful if we do everything we can under the sun\nTo be green um but it punishes people who have to pay those housing prices um so the residential housing market in California is not a place regulations really benefiting the consumers\nI'm Talking to UCLA professor Leo hanging in the teaching economics his piece he co wrote is called California housing policy reforms up on Larry Elder dot com professor
