show is terrible because I predicted it would be based on just my knowledge of television and which what she was good at and what kind of a show they were put Iran so I was surprised that it didn't work\nBut I didn't think she should have deserved to be fired for what she was fired for but now a there are store the daily mail has the story of the uh the Megan Kelly is denying\nThat says that she now wants to ten million dollar bonus on top of the sixty nine million that she's saying that she's old based on her contract\nAnd she also there the the the media are really a torturing her on a and

one o'clock in the morning east coast time to break the news um we got the news\n... gill is a senior counsel for the ACL Jay he also overseas are office which you may not know we had it lure Pakistan or we do have one uh sharing let's go through some of the facts of the case before we get 'em before we get into the particulars of the ruling let's go through the facts of what this case was about\nRight so the case started in two thousand nine or when ... was working at a farm and she was picking berries uh she got some water for herself in a cup and she offered the water in the same cup to two of her Muslim coworkers\nWhich who then told her that she was and clean and they would not drink water in the same cup and then asked her to convert to Islam and then they wouldn't be able to drink water in the same club and ... basically refused to convert to Islam and affirmed her faith then Jesus Christ\nAnd there was an argument over that and five days later\nThe Muslim cleric from the same village files a case against us yeah Bebe after they had brought her book before a mob of Muslims beat her up and made her to a to confess I'm of the crime of blasphemy basically\n... ultimately sentenced to death by Harry ...\nShe was after a year later she was sentenced to death after a long trial of of full of errors and sentenced to death and the high court a which is the first level court of appeals upheld her conviction\nHow old is the Supreme Court decision in Pakistan a release her versus the conviction to release here\n... ... well ... ... ... ... that can be seen just by looking at after a few minutes of announcing the decision I got a call around a twelve thirty at night and a few minutes later there was news that they were ... uh tires burning in the in the capital\nThere were protesters mobs had already gathered and so so that shows the significance in boldness of the justices who have written this decision\nAnd people have actually lost their lives Jordan over this will be the giant or of the\nProblem of tests here are the governor of the province of well known a Pakistani\nA politician a leader was a gun down by his own bodyguard who ended up being executed by the government for that crime is found guilty of murder\nFor that crime is you know it's interesting you get in the opinion which I go to it should because we don't get a lot of opinions like this favorably out of a system base it Islamic law\nOr that the statement said according to the opinion here is a paid fifty three the statements made by the two women who made the allegations before the trial court field or the alleged blast ...\nHad been committed by the Christian appellate after her Muslim coworkers\nHeaded soul to the pallets religion editor injured her religious sensibilities only because she believed it was a follower of Jesus Christ from that perspective insulting the appellate religion by her Muslim coworkers was do last blasphemous that blasphemy laws should be off the books entirely but this court\nWas unique Sherry are utilizing Islamic law I Believe to kind of throw it back in the face of these extreme as low as in Pakistan who are trying to causes uproar the streets cause of violence in the streets are not just to get ... but it gets any Pakistanis who support this decision\nThe government does specifically there these justices and say our own Islamic law go to it and it says what these people did was wrong and it was close to blast we itself\nYeah so ... that was I thought that was very significant in the opinion\nI I I agree that's very significant and if you look at the ... page six Fifteen the court actually mentions the mob violence and it says it is not for the individuals are gathering or a gathering mob to decide as to whether any act falling within the purview of blasphemy has been committed or not\nAnd that and then the court said but at the same ... at the same time false allegations regarding commission of such an offense is equally the testable besides being a culpable\nSo Harry what ... what I mean I I was able to shore up the opinion last night uh I read it and it starts with a with Islamic jurisprudence 'em to justify the holding that she was not guilty and and as Jerry are just said uh the whole aspect of\nA false statement accuses over blessed we as equally culpability and then they the ... when I called in English common law approach to the rest of the opinion\nYou're absolutely correct so what we have is a full integration if you will of Islamic law and English common law so it is clear from Islamic law that last ... violates a Islamic law are equally clear false\nCharges of blasphemy are testable under Islamic law\nAnd the facts clearly do not support the charge of blasphemy against to see a beat me are quite the contrary it's her coworkers that arguably engaged in blasphemy against her religion or and so I think the Supreme Court of Pakistan got it right\nAnd it concurred in the decision to reverse uh the conviction um and I think this sends a message to everyone in Pakistan one that is sorely needed\nA that false charges of blasphemy or will not be tolerated under Pakistani law and I think that's a help will development for all Christians and bless me oh I'm Sorry all Christians in Pakistan going forward\nYeah I'm raises issue up and we talked about this at the Senate or the the subcommittee on appropriations let me play first a misstatement I made this is a number six\nIs he a baby is a Christian mother of five she remains on death row for offering water to a Muslim coworker person after advocating reform the governor of the area was assassinated and killed\nSo this is ... don't forget this port portion that someone was assassinated in killed or because of this Jerry are I mean people have lost their lives over the\nGovernor was actually helping us the baby and he was preparing a petition for clemency for her when he had called blasphemy laws the black laws and his own security guard shot him Twenty one times over that statement and just because he was supporting us yeah baby\nAnd also to hurry are the number of uh judges in this case including the high court it would get to the stage and then they would um they would no longer they would start resigning actually some resigned their seats rather than hear this case it'd be responsible for the outcome\nThat that's correct or if you remember that one of the hearing that the Supreme Court actually was postponed because one of the judges recused himself\nA bad because he said he was ... involved in a prior case that ah of ah the the the governor's assassination case even the legally it had no bearing on this case he still had to recuse themselves because they don't they don't want to touch it\nIt took these brave I mean I think it's it's it's fair to say was ... when the ... you have to be\nReally acknowledged took very brave the ask a judge is on the ... the high court here up north Korean War to Pakistan to take the stand um publicly put their ... their names are on it um and so I you really have to be a prayer for not just to see a Bebe and her a safety but the safety of these judges\nBecause they can't trust as we pointed out their own security right these kinds of situations of volatile very ... this increases\nMakes it a very volatile type of Pakistan at a place that could uh a match you know the it could like very quickly and it has I think to underscore the violence has broken out was immediate Sherry are said\nKnow go to Jerry calling from Rhode Island on line three Jerry welcome to Jay sexual allied hired ... New Jersey\nI Know a great Thanksgiving news not only Bronx and and so on and I think I think Jordan and professor or do we need to pray for\nOngoing not only the clocks that would take me there we already heard about the safety of her family hopefully but the judges and lawyers involved in here I guess we need to play for this and and the last caller\nJust the money the players involved the Puritans involving they work together carrot and stick\nAbsolutely so is your Harry R let's talk about these judges this was a bold move for them in a bold move for the government we don't really understand it that way we're going to sprinkle it makes the decision if you don't like it that's the way it is it'd be like it that's good but you know we don't have this kind of activity but there is an older mom this was a very bold move on their part\nThat that's absolutely correct It's a very bold move I mean the way they have written opinion and especially the concurring opinion I mean the heat that justice ... he he's very very smart and he his opinions or\n... I mean are they are full of wisdom and on page fifty five he says that it is ironic that in the Arabic language the applicants Palin's name I'll see a means sinful\nBut in the circumstances of the president case she appears to be a person in the words of ... a Shakespeare's king king Lear more stand against than sending\nSosa that kind of puts a a stamp so to speak of boldness of this opinion toward the end up end up the whole judgment so I think they they just went all out\nThey they said mob violence is not acceptable false allegations are not acceptable and and people who make false allegations are themselves blasted\nScarier and twenty seconds here to explain to people we have an office in Pakistan\nYes we have an office in Pakistan ... and we have a a a team of attorneys and other staff members who actually work on very similar cases we have a couple of blasphemy cases that were working on currently we have of\nCases that involve church property being taken by Muslims and murders rape cases so we're doing a lot of warfare that needs a lot of prayer\nOr will be back with more if you don't get the full out of the broadcast is going over to Facebook or parents go for ACL Jay dot org and don't forget support the war could be ACL Jay you could do that at a C.

American Center for justice was logged on this\nMatter and the first time we raise the issue was in two thousand eleven she was in jail at that point we published our first piece on it and then on October of twenty four to eight I Want to play a flashback for you on this very broadcast for most people are even talking about this case here's what we said\nWe've got a troubling development that we wanted to bring to your attention it's got not getting the international news that it deserves and that is the first Christian Woman to be sentenced to death under Pakistan's blasphemy law had her peel rejected by the high court in Lahore, Pakistan on Thursday of last week or a C a bb is the name she goes by but it's actually a CEO\nOn marine receive the death penalty twenty ten after she allegedly made a derogatory comment about the prophet Mohammed I'm her first she was first rests in the summer of two thousand nine to spent five years in prison she is\nThe mother of five and is now sentenced to death by hanging\n[noise] now we just got word from Theresa May the prime minister of Great Britain here's what she's had to say would you got news of the release\nAnd he's out like a comic relief that the the I think we'll have more than welcome to have found an old is she was kind of hanging around the world for having me\nAnd I see again that just underscores the international attention all of this case\nFor a Pakistani Christian a woman and ... in Pakistan and never will be no and uh and again and many people who ... who spoke it out of the international levels the pastors representatives will ever be this well this was a fruit picker\nYou know doctors said this was not a pastor this was not a leader of the Christian Community a shit this is a is it the way that\nIs an interesting turn of events a lot of with Pakistan and India divided a lot of Christian said this could be better for us living in a majority Muslim countries in the Hindu country with a caste system so they went into to Pakistan and overtime the radicalization of Pakistan in Islam there\nHas turned it to be a very different situation for Christians\nWho shared are typically at a treaty to kind of the lowest levels and you saw that in this case still justice for someone\nBecause the world kept fighting for for one of the the weakest\nAh people the least of these if you will a it is see it'd be someone who would not have the resources would not have the name recognition ah without ... was that it didn't have a whole country was this rise to somewhere else back her up but had to rely on internally Pakistan an extra early world pressure\nAnd shit Harry are again explained to the people the boulders that took the justices of the Pakistani Supreme Court to come to this decision\nRight of this opinion is just a bold in the sense that the justices own lives were at stake\n... not just the not just the defendant or the Palins here I'll see a bb here but the justices decided the case there have been protests are going on I have received recently received a call from our team that went to the court they are actually stuck on the highway from Islam about to lower\nIt because the highways shutdown yeah and the entire country the protests are going on\nAnd then when you were working at the un and I know a great Gore and Chris off in our offices in France this sense was that we were building we know this was a long process but we were clearly building international support so I'm Glad we already have three somebody's comment\n... and I think that sound from Theresa May highlights well we've been saying that really the eight hundred thousand people that signed a petition and the ability then to put international attention on this case I really do believe that that's the only reason to see a bb is outlook\nWhat what's your sense of that you're not obviously it it elevates other Christian target said see a baby's is secure location may already be outside of the country\nOn her way to join her family so it elevates their churches there's Christian communities in Pakistan that are um that you can point to as an extremist and say okay there's a there's where we target that's where the extremists would target too and so again there's kind of two fold I seek outrageous an outrage amongst\nUh with with extremist Muslims against other Muslims yes it recovers inside the country saying well there's that the Supreme Court justices or miss my arm and there are Christians and the government so\nThat that is the one hand but by the second is the weaker community the Christian Community\nWho could face the wrath of these mobs who has in the past face the wrath of the mob so as Sherry are said it is really up to the Pakistani government nationally local governments as well to protect Christian communities\nFrom these mobs while this is a still firing of people the streets you\nKnow we had filed a multiple appearances at the un and then we also move legislation forward or we've dealt with the blasphemy laws that there was a lot of play here\nYeah well if you listen to the end of the sound you played about that the crust off presented to the United nations the last part of that was in advocating for Pakistan to repeal of reforms blasphemy laws\nIf you look at S. resolution one oh nine which Senator Rand Paul Put forward that was the second part of this the first part of it was that Pakistan release to see a bb the second part really relates to the caller's question what is the risk of the Christian Community still in Pakistan it's quite great Jay because the blasphemy laws still are not where they need to be\nA frankly Jay that's where the United states which comes in they've been very good on this in recent out of the last couple of years and frankly that's where this fight news now in Pakistan\nIs very very bold opinion by the Pakistanis before we can't underscored that enough absolutely particularly in\nLight of the fact that Meyer brand ... clerics are stirring up the Pakistani people moms are already on the street and they are going after the weaken the disenfranchised in Pakistan\nAll right we'll take your
