to Donald Trump\nAnd that of course he was guilty of ah being a black person who doesn't buy into the total victim blood and the dependence on the Democratic party so of course his visit there got a

your calls we come back from a break [noise]\n[noise] how can a fully staffed restaurant improve your image\nOf service fire extinguishers or first aid cabinet make your employees more prepared and

because housing keep business well equipped clean and looking they're mad that's our business\nSyntax and getting ready for the worst day [noise]\nHe went back to the wrong\nThere we're taking your calls one eight hundred and sixty four thirty one time asking this question is\nUh Nikki Haley's going to be leaving at the end of the year a surprise to the American people not a surprise to the president a but it's important to understand\nThe role that Nikki Haley has played a advancing usa interest in supporting our allies especially Israel where she's going to a tremendous job and she's been tough on North Korea too I mean she's she was she was very tough a following the administration's guidance age I think she was a very effective advocate\nFor getting the position of being a distraction to the world I think that he had one of her if you say what is one of the hallmarks of Nikki Haley's tenure as you and the best I think that clearly\nMy number one a hallmark is when she announced that the U.S would no longer be giving out aid to countries who voted against us interest that the UN that we would no longer be supporting countries\nWho were taking opposition's or a position to the U.S and that we're all related to the recognition of Jerusalem as Israel's capital by the U.S and the move our embassy and she said the times have changed that the U.S is no longer going to be your piggy bank where you can come to the UN or denounced the U.S\nVote against our interests and then assume that we're going to give you a millions upon millions of dollars so I think that change uh American leadership it's a total shift\nFrom how the state department it from the diplomacy in the U.S\nHas has existed for decades it was we used to have the idea of kind of placate everybody with cash now it now the new strategy is we take that cash from you and you can come begging to us when you change your policy I think that's exactly right is number one I think that deserves that relates to all of those issues\nAre actually we're taking your calls at one eight hundred and sixty four thirty one town we want to know your thoughts on what do you think the main issue that we should be focusing on view in the United states and I my I start with Israel but I Want to get other people's and that North Korea certainly in there as well Iran another one I mean you're talking about hot spot so you went back to the ship ban you you are un representative\nFor the ... it's a big role I mean and look through years is a longtime service uh in that role she's worked very very hard I we had a chance to work with her a closely last year and I've been a and I've I've seen her a on and off during the last a year and a half and I will not see that you could tell she is working on it and I think she did a great dissipated that's their job\nIt's a huge role Jay because of how many leverage point to exist inside that chamber and in Jordan talked about the financial aid when I totally agree with that I also think\nAh in in terms of foreign policy team everything comes back to that signature move of moving the embassy but think about the other leverage points Jamie no longer has the United states deferred to other caucuses inside the un I mean the organization for the Islamic cooperation do you think they're driving the agenda now know the United states is\nNo longer have they declined to use their leverage to things like vetoes and the Security Council which the last administration declined to do a no longer had they been afraid to withdraw from ineffective un bodies think about unrest\nAnd then again back to the financial support both dollars to the United nations in two countries who don't align with the United states to get all of those ... points that essentially the last administration had laid down a President Trump an investor Haley pick them back up and use them over the last two years yeah I think that you know you're exactly correct\nAnd you know I I think very effectively All right as I said well taking your calls and comments eight hundred and sixty four thirty one ten let's go ahead and take a vocal\nYet right to the phones we go Jerry in Rhode Island on line three Jerry welcome to the United states have ... ... I was reading about that we're getting welcome do their job\nI think I think you partially answered the question like\nI mentioned do so when when you put an ambassador I'm assuming that even the agenda by the president really like to see so what part of it as a reactionary or for the rest of the world so when you ask us what we think\nWhatever we're just now with Aaron broke don't fix it\nSeems that way but it comes from a leader\nWhat's your so here's what happened to the United nations up sometimes is a cabinet level but not always under this administration it has been a cabinet level I think the bronco bomb was it was not\nUm so independent she was a cabinet members that meant you had to go through the confirmation ... investors do anyways but she didn't go through a confirmation process but the agenda is set by the administration she works closely with the president the secretary of state where she was extremely effective is her advocacy at\nThe United nations itself both publicly and behind the scenes\nYeah that's right I mean she again I think that she showed this idea of strength\nShe changed the way the U.S foreign policy was going to move forward or from the past administration so the Trump Administration and she put it into action so she called the you went out for what it was she called the Russians out for what they were doing Chinese what they were doing the Iranians stood with Israel\nAnd when the administration decided to recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel and move our embassy to uh to is to Jerusalem\nThe remember there was a voted the way of all these countries condemning that\nAfter that even before she said you better what we're watching how you vote after that she announced the new U.S plan which is that you would no longer receive aid if you regularly voted against us interest at the United nations anywhere you want to get that if you're a country that came to the un\nAnd bashed the U.S and and then voted against her interest but you received all this a humanitarian aid right oh more humanitarian aid for you if you continue to vote that way and act that way\nWhat would you say fan or from your experience in dealing with the state department on this issue I actually she's a very effective advocates both publicly and behind the scenes what's your sense\nI think the most effective we've seen in recent times she and look at it comes back to the ambition level of the ... the ... the engine is not very ambitious to position is not that important but this agenda was\nIncredibly ambitious all the way from the embassy moved to the financial aid to withdrawing from bodies and back to the last caller's point I think it really answer this question Jay the president\n... the agenda but then the ambassador has to implement I'll just give you one example\nWithdrawing from the human rights council that is a decision that has made it to presidential at a level\nBut then ambassador Haley had to actually go down to the human rights council and implemented in and I'll tell you the fallout was tremendous around the world and I would say in an extremely important in a positive way because that council has has has ceased to further\nA human rights agenda for a long time now but the president decides investor Haley has to actually go into the well into the chamber and implement that agenda\nLet me play for you what a Nikki Haley said this is a former announcement yesterday for like\nAnd I both on foreign policy now than I\nSee if we were going to have a brief our private for whether it was the chemical weapons in Syria whether it was made out of the country for ... whether ... than a naval vote ... ... ...\nSo I think the legacy that Nikki Haley creates is a very positive one but look it's an important role I Know there's a lot of people complain about the UN and believe me we are critical because they they their policies on Israel and others have been ridiculous and they're fake red lines and and you can\nGo on and on the fact of the matter is that we need affective advocates there and we've had that with the gay guy late so again what we want to know kind of what your view on what you think the top aspect topics you should be that we're addressing it to you and I mean what does this way to the middle east\nAnd this isn't at any particular order I I think these are the big issue points it's the middle east so it's the it's the it's the Israel Palestinian conflict the greater Middle East that would include Iran because you have to look at the Iranian situation that's part of that then you got the whole Russia\nIssues with the Ukraine then you go over to China you've got the issues with China and then particularly been into the Korean Peninsula as you look at that agenda you understand that that UN ambassador has got a broad swath of what they're dealing with yeah when you deal with an expert in a lot of\nAnd there was a Russian you deal with Iran you're also dealing with Syria and that conflict there um and then of course the broader issue which is reforming are corrupt United Nations\nSo we looked at the uh defunding of unrest and those other kind of a un programs that have been a a so so poorly run and uh again so this out of control you and I think all of that is very important but I'd love to hear from everybody up there one eight hundred\nThat Nikki Haley had a unique ability and why she has been so popular in that role of standing tough\nWithout seeming gratuitously tough yeah at the United nations\nIt's yeah I mean we're awfully here and we may be able to hear from a bachelor daddy didn't own the Israeli ambassador to the United nations during the second half hour the broadcasts will keep you posted on that are taking your calls eight hundred sixty four thirty one time I Want to ask you a quick question if they got to throw up Mary ... from eight people are asking already on Facebook\nWhat's the compromise you know because they've just been through the Brett Kavanaugh's confirmation process what's this confirmation gonna look like\nWell obviously depending on who it is Jay but look I think you need expected to be contentious I think you're going to have to appoint somebody that is is qualified ready for the job so that they can get through look I I think this is one of the reasons jade that you're not going to see somebody who is already in a spot that require confirmation because then all of a sudden you have two people that you've got to get through the confirmation process\nI think those are probably going to be somebody that's not in a confirmed spot already and Jay all predict that there's two qualities that Nikki Haley had that the next candidate ... it's gotta be somebody that's tough as nails because they've got to go into this venue and be prepared for people to walk out when they're ... you know gender\nBut then they're going to also have to have that diplomatic characteristic that Jordan talking about Nikki Haley leaves it very well liked inside the United nations to and that's tough to do when you're advancing it engenders aggressive if she has she's\nBeen very effective uh Elena Facebook said Nikki Haley's resolving strip changed the position of viewing the bachelor we need something like that to fill that role I think that I think that was exactly right here I think that's\nPrecisely correct so we need someone like Nikki Haley someone who is a clear coat your id advocate of tough American policies someone who demands respect on the world stage\nAnd someone that advanced who's our interest how hard do you think the confirmation fight for this one could be depends on the person but it's very hard I could be very hard difficult in this will like this will be after ... [noise] yeah so I think to tournaments or that's what happened another impact and they let me see if we can\nControl the U.S Senate though it'd be a tough confirmation but not as tough as a Supreme Court which is what\nWe're taking your calls the one eight hundred sixty four thirty one set up because we are here for another thirty minutes if we're not going to pull out of the broadcast [noise]

years and that's a that's a significant amount of service\nTo make sacrifices for the government officials when they go into government service like this financially uh it's it's you know it's an expensive undertaking as you can imagine but she's been a very effective one of her most effective advocates in us history I think Nikki Haley will go down as one of those effective un ambassadors in us history I have no hesitation and saying that\nYeah I mean think about what we have done I mean the U.S has accomplished under ambassador Haley we recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel finally and we take it to the world and say you know what a a you can condemn assault you what\nAre you better watch your aid money uh we've changed the u._s. foreign policy approach to diplomacy where we used to just throw money out I'm even countries that would oppose us at the un oppose our foreign policy\nAnd throw money out to try and appease them and that has been changed a show the the tone or it's been ... I Would say it's not just a tone change from the Obama administration it is a complete\nLee new approach to diplomacy at at the United nations that has been done by any previous administration in modern history what do you think very\nWell um I think that's absolutely correct I think it's important to recognize that during a Nikki Haley's tenure the United states has withdrawn from the Iran nuclear deal we have responded with top rhetoric to North Korea and that has drawn\nI'm a real thing is that a ... and we'll continue to impose sanctions on\nA mini regimes including Russia Iran and North Korea and I think that has drawn a real response of throughout the world\nHow the level of respect for the United states has risen immeasurably we are getting a lot of calls are a lot of ... notes posted on Facebook and periscope a fan about what's gonna happen\nLet's walk people through 'em but\nWhat the process looks like the this is another one I mean we just came out of accomplishment Supreme Court justice ambassadors are also confirmed and this is the president nominates that's his authority Senate advice and consent\nWell when we already heard from the president on this day that he expects to give us a name and the next two or three weeks he said maybe sooner he said he's down to a handful of named already but once he decides\nUh yes it will be sent to the Senate or there'll be there'll be confirmation hearings that will go to the floor I think Jordan is correct that it's not going to follow the protracted timeline of the Supreme Court nomination ah but I Do expect a just a just because of the nature of the Senate right now I expected to vote margin\nOr will be slim I think that whoever is nominated will probably get all of the Republican support and probably a handful of Democrats so it probably won't be as razor close is this ... ah but look I think you saw the play by play book from the minority in the United States Senate right now\nUp until the elections and maybe even following Jay they plan to oppose any one significant who's nominated regardless of who they are\nI mean during that were just taught me that I think that look we can it can be a bruising process and it's going to depend on who it is now the president is going to he he picks people that are going to carry the agenda administration forward of course you almost starting with forty eight objects as before you start\nYes I think the votes going to be close I think we just went through a really horrendous process for the Supreme Court and and so a comparing it to that is is is probably not fair it to get it is always the person is ... is qualified\nThey will be confirmed um you know let's just let's just issues you know about um that that uh again it appears that the Senate will remain a Republican has that'll be the key because that's when this will happen is after the midterm elections I'd after those\nPeople are in place so because she's staying until\nA or the end of the year so that that means it will be the next Congress that will be confirming or this or this investor to the ...\nGosh thanks shock and everything you're doing a prank on the Gulf states Florida Georgia Alabama\nI'm you know when the first thing and then when I was saying I Will absolutely completely miss the graceful demeanor and presence of Nikki Haley Ewing with extremely difficult issues in the UN and one of those you talked about the hard uh the difficulty of being a UN ambassador\nIn your opinion [noise] um what if any shovel a person like John cherry or in his state men's or his activities meeting with Iranians or any other um what what kind of weight is up on you have the war in ...\nWell I think that they see Haley came in and had to make it very clear and she did\nThat this was not business as usual with the United states anymore that was her job\nAnd I think that's why she could leave all that high note uh this this uh at the end of the year\nHer job was to reverse the years of the John Kerry types or who who by the way he's been following decades of U.S foreign policy practice of trying to appease everyone and not be critical about their votes and not actually care about them condemning us a and keep giving millions of dollars\nHer job was to reverse that and make it clear to the world that we were we were telling the truth will be so this wasn't just words was backed up by actions so similar to President Trump who helped doesn't just talking about terrorists would influence them a a a and a ... and things like that\nAt the same goes for the un funny so it was her job to fundamentally transform the U.S position at the un and how to do the body the un saw the U.S and the individual countries themselves\nAll right we're taking your calls during the last segment the broadcast at one eight hundred and sixty four three one wonder we'll be joined by ambassador Danny ...

about protecting either the Security Council or by beet green or the ...\nAbout passing that Russia is going on I mean come on if you look at it with a family or the cleaning out your window I got it for all over the weight of computers within ... step in\nThe you mentioned something ambassador I think it's important for people understand that says you know what it's like being the only person in the room and so does she explained that a little bit for audience\nWe're losing Vassar\nI mean we have All right so one of the things he did say was that this idea of alone in the room and you know this was your world\nAnd the ... and get you there in the U.S really unwilling to take a stand uh to speak clearly for Israel I mean you know they were reluctantly do it and honestly the Obama administration's we send those final days who's going to be very uh a dangerous and they were I mean they they allowed those resolutions to move forward Israel was Standing Alone\nAt the un and the Obama administration's final days that need the we talked about Harry this shift that took place between the the way it was in the way it is now um this was a major shift and it really it could happen in pretty record time when you think about it\nYes it happened very quickly and very expeditiously or an itch approves one thing that Nikki Haley will indeed be a tough act to follow um she was a leader in with drawing a U.S funding\nFrom UN agencies that were indeed corrupt uh we also with drew for for instance from the un human rights Council on her watch and so we must continue to push such agencies to either change or they're too or alternatively collapse from a like a punch\nAmbassador let me ask you this ... ... when you think of the legacy of Nikki Haley as a U.S ambassador to pass through the United nations what do you think was the most significant or the if you were going to go through a couple of what do you think the most significant achievements were [noise]\nWhat I I think we approach a few days after all when you look at this time against North Korea or the way that you know\nYou ever lose or losing ramble a technical problem uh getting ambassador noted but now the UN didn't North Korea was another one we talking about the middle east but the north Korea was another one yeah I mean again\nA very key very ... here that are ... that even the best or from Israel's the U. S. is talking about how the ... who said it wasn't just about Israel um and obviously their interests he which she represents\nBut what the US was doing it on the on on other issues as well very significant ... so I think we played at first they again since we had trouble ah getting an ambassador lived with his he's moving around our response but he had this to say about Nikki Haley set aside the record take a listen\nWhen you look at the U.S today after standing on the U.S in a different face people respect the U.S today in the UN\nBecause of the matter with a lot of ... to stand firmly even when he won that she was in the minority even in a way to the votes she was afraid and I think today you got that we've set for many countries in the sea duty counsel in the general assembly\nBut and that's important because if you want to be relevant anything to respect you at the un and international community and today I mean more respect to that but none of the United states so that means station and they take a stronger today\nSo thin looking at was look ahead here because you have to look ahead I mean you know ... will stay for basically ten more weeks and then work and in that time period we're going to have a new nominee I expect there's going to be a fight no matter who it is um because they're going to be supporting the president's position and there's forty eight senators that won't\nYeah the the president's taken a very aggressive position of and foreign policy was needed Jamie we needed a dramatic shift in foreign policy specifically at the United nations and looked at as you know generate a lot of opposition inside the United States Senate and it will be a fight I suspect it's a fight\nOr that President Trump in the new nominee will win but I Do think it will be a fight and ... I I think it was so important than a bastard a known mention North Korea 'cause he's the Israeli ambassador and yet he sees that\nAs one of the main agenda items and I also loved\nThe fact that he reference that sometimes the new ambassadors going to have to be the only voice in the room I Would tell you a couple of things first of all sometimes that's absolutely literally I mean it takes a single veto on the Security Council you've got to be willing to stand alone\nAnd then sometimes while it might not be the only voice the new ambassadors gonna have to be prepared when mask countries a stand up and walk out with a advanced the proper ... they do the next ... has to be willing to stand for him and that type of situation\nWell she had a certain boldness Harry that I'm a ... and I I Would say grab a toss\nAnd when we were with her out and and and what you are an action I mean I met her both on a in a large sitting at the U.N General assembly we're both made an address uh but I've also been ... you know at the at the White House from time to time I've seen her and uh she just has a tremendous residence\nAbsolutely and so I Would add she also was a clear and direct speaker you knew where the United states stood on a particular issue when Nikki Haley spoke\nThe following who's been ready to DC for politically correct the tension dismay learn so it doesn't say Larry Elder [noise] do\n\nA very over here that said from South central the unit the lord of the great ... the dorm rooms are welcome to the program known as the Kremlin loud because we've got to cut into St Louis guaranteed dry [noise]\n\nSan Diego\nRipple eight nine seven one F.
