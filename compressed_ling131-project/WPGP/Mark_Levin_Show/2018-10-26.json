Smith Schuster did a a couple of weeks ago\nYou know you you you can't act that way\nAnd then a wonder when people look at you a little bit differently I think a Thomas all the great philosopher and maybe the smartest man in America are I think it was he said\nI'm culture has consequences they want to have fun and it's it's great they're having a good time up there but if you if you don't want to be looked at it differently then Tom Brady or a Aaron Rodgers then don't play a game of hide and seek after you scored a touchdown within which Antonio Brown did\nOr I I think it was he did but they are a bunch of guys who were involved in the in the ...\nOr ... maybe that's fun and nobody cares and maybe a lot of people like it but you know Tom Brady and Aaron Rodgers don't play hide and seek after they scored a touchdown so he can't do that and then wonder when people diminished you a little bit because of your hum\nBehavior Jim Brown is are the greatest player in the history of the NFL who also happens to be black\nHas set it many times that that black players who do that kinda stuff diminished themselves then they they bring back the the minstrel show um mentality any any he talks about slaves\nAnd uh I'm sure we'll find out more about this person whoever they are are they are someone who should be prosecuted\nTo the full extent of the law um politics aside here even though this seems politically motivated in with an ideology there's a place where there's an American politics we have vigorous debates vigorous disagreements but we never resort to terrorism or violence and full extent of the law the ... the law should be thrown at him\nAnd this person says spend a lot of time behind bars we'll talk about at one eight hundred and sixty four thirty one tenth we get into the caravan as well so if you've got questions about the\nPipe bombs give us a call the caravan one eight hundred six eight four thirty one ten and then we're going to get into electoral politics one eight hundred six eighty four three one one zero give us a call on Jason you'll live [noise]\n\nWhen it comes to your pain many of you might be skeptical like I was\nAbout ordering really factor that

skeptical any longer and the\nThree we started now discounted only Nineteen Ninety five while you let us see if we can get you out of paying two at relief factor dot com\n[noise] if you are just joining\nUs we have breaking news the suspect has been arrested in these\nPipe bombings and we have a name now are just a name is ... is our say Iraq I think I oppressed that right ah in Florida someone with a ... criminal history or for grand theft back in twenty Thirteen or he's been arrested as the main suspect\nIn these twelve pipe bombs had been delivered so far there were two more devices delivered\nA this morning I attempted to be delivered they were all you know intercepted or those who are going to Cory Booker or the senator and James Clapper a scene in contributor and former director of national intelligence that went to CNN again um the the so far this started on Monday\nWith the pipe bomb at its Soros home um none of these have exploded no one has been injured but it has caused a lot of tear member the evacuation of the time we're talking about the significance that the\nHotel with the office buildings with the apartment buildings with the grocery store shopping um with CNN located there I mean they it in effect has caused terror\nEven if these devices were voting or just were built correctly a and that would be a good thing that thankfully no one was injured there's no place for this or politics eleven days out from mid term elections certainly puts things into perspective\nUm but it does not mean we can't have vigorous debates and disagreements in our country or without resorting to not just violence but tear\nWhich is what this is is that acts as a domestic terror and the tempted uh to to terrorize the people and again we condemn it to the fullest extent oh so we have a name now a again of the suspect we know the location in Florida sunrise implantation Florida\nI'd up here's a vehicle was in one of those locations homeless and the other location a such a north of Miami kind of inland from Fort Lauderdale\nAnd ah we don't know yet or if there were other people involved this is the suspect\nSo I get it may not be over the president is planning to address this that happens while we live on the air we will certainly cover it I Want to take a your your comments a Nancy on Facebook it remember to your phone calls as well at one hundred sixty four thirty one ten\nOn Facebook writes in what kind of consequences does a person like this face Andy well\nOf course the obvious ... and then most appropriate and prudent and proper consequence is that he's put in prison because someone like this is not\nFit to live in the society of human beings and they're locked away for a period of time because they've obviously committed or attempted to commit the most terrible crimes are and and then the worst scenario this could be considered an attempted murder\nBecause you're doing everything you can to to ah eradicate the life of a human being by means of an explosive device if in fact that's what it was and even if it didn't ah explode the the fact that the perception of the recipient is what counts so the ultimate penalty here\nJail yeah I mean this is again what we hope is that this will bring it in\nA two this time period after this week in the United states of a these are devices being delivered even as early this morning with two more devices so a total count at twelve but the postal service law enforcement said that they have no reason to believe that's all the devices 'em and\nOther by apprehending the person that will stop them from sending more but how many more out in the postal system is is still the question so you have to remain vigilant\nUh let's see we have listeners on both sides the child is obviously a focused on a lot of uh left uh those on the left um if you work in those kinds of officers in in Capitol Hill or in regional offices for members of Congress or be vigilant you know is going through mail M. if you work in the postal service\nBe vigilant as well or we want you to be safe because while some of these individuals are so high profile their mail get screened at special facilities others are not and they're going through the regular postal service so again I we've got to remind all the people who could be in the light of danger\nBecause of an individual like this we condemn it to the fullest extent I think you put the politics aside because that may be their purpose or their ideological purpose behind it but obviously a something seriously wrong with a person whether it's their criminal\nOr or or just insane or criminally insane\nI used to put it altogether or they should be facing serious law enforcement penalties that they'll go through the process but again this because the disruption the use of the mail service or the people who were targeted a very serious and now we expect that President Trump\nWill address that as well as ... will cover that on the broadcast if it happens while we're on the air department of justice is also going to speak to it later on today a show or taking your phone calls one eight hundred six eight four thirty one hundred sixty four\nThree one one zero we're going to get into a little bit\nOf this caravan issue out got Andy here as well as a caravan of migrants heading towards the border or are they are in Mexico now their looks like they're heading towards either a Texas border or a California border Texas border crossing it's closer\nThe president Andy yesterday's authorized\nEight hundred additional troops through a a General Mattis a Secretary Mattis department of fits that includes that would then up the number two ah they're already Twenty one hundred National Guard troops there that could increase to four thousand this eight hundred could be more as well so the U.S is preparing\nA for a for a border effort for this to happen at our border if it is not able to be stopped before in Mexico but that is the hope is ...\nWork with the Mexican government and get this stopped and dissipated because the numbers are still in the thousands of ... estimates anywhere between three to fourteen thousand people that there's a lot more than the last ... we experienced in April twenty Eighteen so and so again and I mean it appears that the Trump Administration is preparing for two things one\nPossibly uh having to deal with this or their own to try to get Mexico to work with us to deal with it together\nRight as we said the position of the scale Jay has always been that we want to have an intervention prior to the arrival of this a heat wave of humanity at the border and by that I mean the intervening with Mexican authorities to stop them to turn them back to put them into a\nCategory is perhaps of those who are\nLegitimately seeking asylum which says really available in the first state in which you feel safe and the first nation who is you feel safe which should be Mexico in this case and then ... out those who are here to do ill to the United states\nUh people who are not here seeking asylum but the danger those who are engaged in human trafficking and so forth and we're working with the Mexican authorities to do that\nOn of course as you said Jordan we're sending troops to the border but the ... they're they're only to support the civil authorities and they are not expected to come into regular contact with the migrants if they carry arms is solely for purposes of self defense\nAnd of course the law in the United states currently prohibits the routine use of troops in on foreign routine law enforcement activities I don't expect that that will happen I anticipate and hope that they will not be confrontations at the border between this wave of humanity and the United states troops you never know I Hope it doesn't happen\nLet me remind you of the president's executive order that was ultimately okayed by the U.S Supreme Court after many legal battles on a a immigration and preventing a certain individuals certain from certain countries\nAh for periods of time off from immigrating or being granted visas to the United states there's discussion now being reported\nThat President Trump a one idea is to use that executive order\nBecause it can be expanded on the list of countries that\nBut the vast majority you should be able to claim asylum in the first places called the first place you land first place you touch foot in the outside of your home country when you're under the jurisdiction of a new law enforcement I'm at a in a new country or the new sovereign territory\nI can take your phone calls one eight hundred sixty four thirty one to remember our second half hour\nWe're talking all midterms

security has reported that there are known criminals gang elements middle Easterners or people who are not from Central American descent and obviously those who would use a caravan like this to take advantage of it for bad any legal purposes\nAnd are you talking about the disease issue there's this these are all issues you have to face\nIf it makes it to your border and you decided to open those

[noise] and now\nWe're going to get right into the mid term elections ... some people\nJoin us or just the beginning of the second half hour Jay sexual alive but me up to you with the biggest breaking news the day and that is that they suspect has been arrested\nIn these ... that have been intercepted or to some high profile individuals occurred and former\nGovernment officials well some celebrities a suspect has been arrested or they again does that mean there's not other devices that can be out there still remain vigilant or the president is likely to address this if it happens while we're on the air we will go to the president's comments\nBut we do want to focus in and give you an update on the mid term elections right now we're only eleven days out there is a you know we've covered the caravan a which obviously has an impact on the election or we covered the devices\nObviously has an impact because the entire week of news has been on these devices are but now we want to look right into the mid term elections were eleven days out\nFrom election day but let me remind you of many places including my home state you can already vote many people are I'm actually planning to vote in the next few days um so you people are already making up their mind casting their ballots\nA lot of votes will be in before election day so we're at a time period now in America where we have election day but it really is like a two week period where you can go and vote and convince people to get out there to actually cast their final vote for candidates that they don't want to start off in the U.S Senate\nOr because that is where it looks like Republicans are having to potential for the most games and there's pretty shocking news\nOut of New Jersey a Senate race there are pretty blue state those elected you know people like Chris Christie there'd been Christie Todd Whitman types and in uh in New Jersey the Senate race there Bob Menendez is in some trouble in the race has been moved by the cook Political Report to a toss up that would be a huge victory for Republicans\nMe monumental Jordan I mean this is one of the races that you and I have talked about several times on this broadcast and keeping an eye on it because if it did move into a competitive territory it was going to be a clear sign that not only the we're the Republicans are going to keep the majority in the United States Senate but it might be a significant majority now pooling inside that state\nHas it in some cases within the margin of error with Bob Cuban closing to within five five points of button and then ended it Monday and as of course Jordan abundant as has been plagued with scandal over the last couple of years ... has run a very\nGood campaign he's a businessman he appeals to people that are maybe a little tired of the political process but the fact that New Jersey is on the map\nTells me that the Republicans dinner or in a very strong position in the United States Senate Jordan as we've talked about most of the political battlefield in the United States Senate is in Trump or states that were carried by Donald Trump in Republican states as of this ... New Jersey which certainly not be one of them and yet it's in\nPlay let's go to the president right now he I Believe is addressing the issue involving the type\nOf that law enforcement has apprehended the suspect and taken him into custody\n[noise]\nCredible job by law for us\nWe've carried out a far reaching federal state and local investigation to find that person or persons responsible for these events these terrorizing acts are despicable and have no place in our country\nI was struck this authorities to spare no resource or expense in finding does responsible and bringing them to swift and certain justice [noise]\nWe will prosecute them him her whoever made me\nSaid of the law\nMust never\nAllow political violence to take root in America cannot have and I'm committed to doing everything in my power as president to stop it\nGranted I mean listen in most polls Marsha Blackburn in Tennessee running for Senate against practice and has got like a six point lead one still has Brett is in a recent poll with a one point lead and other shows black or with a fourteen portly extensive people ... voted early maybe before that British and controversy about Kavanaugh\nSo favor certainly going in Marshall blackbirds direction and then the gubernatorial race there favoring the Republican as well Billy uh in that race so again it looks like that is no longer really in play\nFor the Democrats I Will tell you a full bred says a lot of resources so he's up on TV there and tend to see it will be through election day\nDon't take anything for granted polls are\nPolls they just kind of give you the sense of momentum you could see when things have really shifted it certainly has in Tennessee and let's go to Texas day into because that was another one where a again a very liberal congressman or a beta O'Rourke a has amassed this huge campaign war chest\nA but President Trump came down a things got a little more serious and now Ted Cruz's every single poll has got a lead outside the margins just barely but outside the margin\nYeah look anytime you raise funds like better or rock has it's going to be a race that deserves a lot of attention because then you're going to be all over the airwaves you a national money pouring in a you know the ability to have aggressive get out the vote a key may so did the dollars that bed or raise really were remarkable Jordan but look\nA in a in a in an environment where it's at the state that is probably the most concerned about border security\nI think his position on immigration and and the borders and the wall is probably gonna prove or politically fatal to him as well so look I think the pulling their shows Ted Cruz opening up their six to eight a vote lead\nA I think it'd be the day he will carry that seat or the look if you're living in Texas Jordan you are going to see commercials nonstop because Beto O'Rourke has dollars to spend like we've never seen before\nA couple of states that we will get to give you a little preview Arizona Nevada these are really\nA seats that are running margin of error that very tight races there or we will talk about when we come back and we had a quick question is Ted Cruz is sit on Facebook doing\nEnough to be made a ... it looks like he is I mean partnering with President Trump also has a big campaign war chest [noise] they do that he's got a lot of money to spend in these final days\nIn early voting and all that but it's printing and Ted Cruz's direction he'll continue to work hard we know Center for his well he's going to not take anything for granted but I Do believe he will carry the day there so were eleven days out\nFrom the election and made or certainly put together something if you will be right back\n... this is Dr Sebastian Gorka President Obama's\nEight years of leading from behind left of the world and fled from Russia's invasion of Ukraine to North Korea's missile test how to grow and ISIS ...\nOther presidents from American leadership is being restored\nBut that doesn't mean our enemies have this uh [noise] that's why I wrote my new book why we fight\nFeeding America's enemies with no apology [noise]\nAs a former deputy assistant to President Trump's strategy life blamed the threat posed by enemies like Russia China and the global jihadi move and we must know our enemies and have the will to defeat\nIn my book why we find fault with political correctness lines of the Obama and how we feel vanquish fall and\nCalm the best thing for his new book why we by defeating America's enemies with no apologies is available now Amazon had Barnes and noble\n[noise]\nThis is a segment we take phone calls so we've got great\nCause all on the midterm elections we're going to get right to him\nBut I wanted to address the too close Senate race is right now or in the country eleven days after the midterms and we're going to go right to your phone calls those are in Arizona\nAnd Nevada let's start in Arizona than a this is an open seat because of the the passing of Senator John McCain tell us about uh the two candidates they're both both members of Congress\nThat's right Martha McSally versus cures and send them a door and I I'm I'll be honest with you I think there's going to come down to one issue in the state of ... of Arizona that immigration and border security there's a a very big divergence between the two candidates\nAh Martha ... closely aligned with President Trump on his efforts to secure the border and then work on an overall solution here since cinema just quite frankly is not and I think that has been the driving force of\nOf really having the numbers move Martha ... way a matter of a month ago it looked like a two three four point advantage for cures and send them a\nA now it looks like Martin ... up by about a winner to uh the early numbers there as far as registration sure do look like they're favoring her a but again Jordan go back globally this is one of the two Republican seats the Democrats absolutely have to have if they were to take majority\nYeah I mean so again this is these are important races and they are down there within the margin of error either candidate could win a but there's some momentum going behind the Republicans right now I take a listen this is just interesting the Democratic candidate congressman or ... or she said this in a radio show this is coming back to haunt her a bit by thirty three\nNo no I mean by more than he has ... ...\nIsrael if I Want to go fight in the Taliban army I go over there or not you know I'm I'm fighting for the Taliban that I'm saying as personal decision and I\nMean I don't know why she said something like that find it I don't care if you go fight for the Taliban but as a member of Congress and then she says this about her own state like thirty for speaking to the very liberal this year that route station just a couple of months ago\nAnd the hand that say they found a laboratory democracy and then my hair and come in here and in that class\n\nThat line and they have to have it here and it's out of hand\nYou know that's not funny if you're running for you to be a singer in your state where you've got to issue serious stuff like that just to please a crowd I'm so again that is coming back\nUm and I know that those those are bites are being used and said speeches are being used to remind people that just to these people are just\nSo many times says the syndicates they tried to change who they are less finally let's get to the vet and then it gets these phone calls the vet a Dean Heller is Republican incumbent are facing a challenge from a Democrat Rosen or what does it look like they're\nYeah Jacky Rosen a congresswoman or from Nevada again this was one of those ... states the Democrats are really focused on early on they thought they had a great job to flip the seats as senator ... numbers were down a little bit\nUh Jordan I think President Trump is actually played a big role in this state as well\nOr the three now for Dean Heller are the numbers of turned around and it looks like he's got about a two point lead there again a lot of national dollars are going to flow into the state Jordan I think Dean Heller is in a better position than Jacky Rosen is again it's one if the state the Democrats have to have if they have the majority so if you're in Nevada you're going to be inundated with ads over these last eleven days\nOkay we've got lots of calls [noise] try to keep your comments as short as possible so we can get to all of them let's start with Joe and North Carolina on line one Joe welcome to Jay Sekulow alive\nIs I'm a manager in an apartment complex in North Carolina and I've been asking residents you know how are you feeling I vote and then\nI've only found two Democrats who say they're still going to vote Democrat the other ones it's told me they're Democrats or at least Fifteen said after the cabinet thing they just can't vote Democrat\nYou know that is an interesting point right there I think that I Want to get as many calls as possible but I think we cannot forget the effect that Kavanaugh a behavior by the Democrats\nReally is what started this Republican beginning of the I I wouldn't say the red wave yet but a comeback for Republicans not just in the Senate especially in the city but also potentially in the house as well which we can get to it later show because there's a lot to talk about there as well focusing on the Senate today\nEleven days out back to the phones we go but I Do the capital it was it was the beginning of this Republican kind of resurgence in uh the midterm elections are along with President Trump hitting the campaign trail again are doing what he does best surely in Michigan on line to Shirley welcome to Jay suck you alive\nI ... a couple of minutes go ...\nSaid that one state's gonna be the soccer and I think that could be Michigan ... up against Debbie Stabenow two to three weeks ago he was cool points down he's now seven and in some competitive area the they're even or running ahead he is a rock star if you have any listeners and\nAll the ones in Michigan ... website and definitely tell I had I convinced several people already just telling about him that are changing their vote for him so we we need to talk and communicate with our friends and neighbors and make them aware he has a wonderful opportunity\nThis so we're a lot of military experience right then and again was twenty points down just six weeks ago is surging right now in Michigan states that President Trump did carry\nI I agree with surely I think this could be a shocker was on my list with Bob Menendez remember Donald Trump won Michigan Debbie Stabenow should be able to win that state but John James has run a terrific a campaign but I won't be surprised at all to wake up and twelve days and find out that John James ... was editor for yet in\nA stab at all or admitted as losing for Democrats would just be stored for Republicans\nI Will put it that way those would be one of those to shock or ... I think um maybe maybe both of the people he could have too shocking states or let's keep going really in New Jersey on line three ability welcome to Jay suck you alive\nWe can just been reading the sea to correct it tends to somebody learn something [noise]\n[noise]\n[noise]\n\n\n\n[noise]\nFeeling of someone named ... years when you say in the summer from\nOf Akron you instantly into Laurie I'm

Dennis\nSaw the plane in\nAnd I always root against\nBecause of a regional from Brooklyn and when people here that the goal\nOf human life too and I\nWhat they did do that to us by taking your calls after\nEighty eight nine seven wants the agents for those are just joining us the first hour we were talking about the bombs in the butt of Tuesday and we didn't mention his name that's important so they don't get that kind of publicity if that's what they're seeking\nWhat after we did that and said that how I originally was and we acknowledge that\nWe got into the idea that the press obviously wants to blame President Trump for everything and anything everything is just fall that goes wrong and everything that goes right President Obama has your hurry we'd like to take credit we we played a clip of seeing a minute or two of them in the last hour\nAnd it was hard for me to take because I forgot what do you get all the time which is set up strong dummies and then tear it down like you said in the clip we have\nThat you know we want to risk babies waiting for a lot from the arms of immigrants no they're illegal immigrants and we don't want to risk babies away was your policy by the way Mr former president\nYou know we didn't change the policy needs to be changed obviously what was your policy in the first place\nAnd we don't want to regain his way in fact the real answer is don't come here in the first place if you're going to come illegally come here legally and there'll be no wish and setting up this caravan who's paying for all of its how they're getting here I've heard all kinds of rumors but the fact is\nHe's got to stop them it's an invasion you can't allow this to happen\nWill be followed by others but again he can't do anything right and of course the things he says part of the reasons that the suspect in custody did what he did it because of President Trump\nThen we evolved into the point\nThat you know why they hate him so much I'm On the other reasons because he's the first Republican that I can remember in years standing up to their nonsense who's willing to cold like it is it's reasonable to ask as I mentioned last hour whether Hillary should be indicted for what she did she committed crimes\nAnd when I was sympathetic to her eye on another station on the networks people getting away with me because I said if they agreed to leave the scene forever maybe we could agree not to indict Hillary people said\nNot above the law that's reasonable but that's what they see lock her up that is not violent that's just following the rules and principles that we all in this country are subject to the country what is so radical about\nBut but yet when President Trump says he's absolutely outrageous and what else I Can't even remember what else they pick on him for what was the other issues besides lock her up that they say you Trump keeps inciting the audience when I think of it I'll let you know but what everything it's just it's just terrible like all the press\nIt costs the press a fake press a press\nPeople to me that people are not going to do objective journalism courtesy has tremendous power\nIf they can make something you know some people can't get the news in an object away I never knew when I was growing up with the politics was\nOff the journalists reporting it that's not true that there are gender so clear he's tried to call them out on it I think this is insanity when when the Obama\nCould be outraged send in theory the rest of us and say things like it'll keep your doctor you'll keep your health care and you know we're we're ... we we care about race of people on our side and we judge people by the color of skin I don't know\nI've often said give me nine black women on the Supreme Court core conservative somehow campers where the guy said oh we see race and gender and uh you know sexual orientation don't talk that way we see individuals much more than a dentist and Laurie always talk about what you see people as people\nYou guys do this kind of stuff\nPart let me know what you think and we'll take your calls and eat it eight nine seven one say age and I hear I have an article Sean just gave me journalists

this point a to me the end of this a bomber individual both have some very calm and it features a paranoid schizophrenia\nAnd I'd start with these ah [noise]\nSo maybe a nuts are saying oh the Trump is responsible for all of this a bomber stuff and all these responsible for the bomb well you know\nThat's not only mind reading but it's thought insertion they believe that Trump inserted thoughts in through the bombers mind for him to go\nAnd bomb of course well are you know it's fought broadcasting and he's having a conversation with Trump through with television or maybe he looks out a picture of him in the paper you all were so I get the water [noise] tell me what the hardware store to get the pipe or what about this other stuff [noise]\nWell the reality is is that individuals are responsible for their own behavior and speak just moves air and people their motivations me long to them and what they do is their responsibility\nAnd speech is protected for the president just as it is for everybody else\nAnd just like we've been talking we can blame a Bernie Sanders for what a guy a without a phony or you know Chinese a cave rifle good in nearly killing Steve\n... school lease

were racing sent home of folks that's the problem we there we know there are nuts likely the guys up the pythons we understand that but we all do guilty of that\nBecause of it we we don't take responsibility for\nPresident Trump hasn't done anything outraged look he's not a perfect package you doesn't always say what I wanted to say\nBut he's standing up to the other side which hasn't
