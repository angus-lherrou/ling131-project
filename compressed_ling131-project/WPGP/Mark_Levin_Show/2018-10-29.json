for the value of the shooting condemning anti Semitism in an understanding that as an organization\nUm we do a lot to condemn the other boycott divest in ... in the United states\nA lot of this anti Semitism on college campuses which is exactly what it is in the form of being anti Israel I edited and these distinctions that that these groups try to make which are just absurd um is getting something as organization we combat some of these individuals we should all combat\nAnd acknowledges it is an issue that's been a ... in the United states as it is in most of the world unfortunately\nI'm as just the beginning of time and ah today on the broadcast Russia focusing in on what Israel has been doing in response to\nThe tax on the Jewish state of Israel I think it's a unique time to point out there has been an escalation over the weekend in fact just this weekend in Israel out of the Gaza Strip so targeted Israel thirty rockets were fired by God's up based militants have this group is called\nPalestinian Islamic jihad or sometimes just referred to as Islamic jihad\nTo Israel as a government holds for most responsible\nFor Islamic jihad activities at ... am Austin Islamic jihad work together often but there are times when ah they are separate\nAnd so you'll see that Islamic jihad is also based in a Damascus is where a lot of their leaders are headquartered to get protection a so that they are not actually in harm's way directly and so I ... their leadership there the mosques leadership\nMuslim Brotherhood leadership both groups emanating by the way from the Muslim Brotherhood out from Hamas but interesting enough even though it's coming out of the Sunni world\nGetting a lot of its funding from the sheer world in Iran so first let's talk now this weekend I'll go to Henry Hudson here this weekend we saw really escalation ... just specifically between\nA Islamic jihad and Israel says comes out of the Gaza Strip but thirty rockets being fired at the state of Israel and Israel responding back with that specific attacks\nOn eighty targets absolutely so this is an important ... an ominous development\nOr these attacks are coming from gossip suggests that loss is working with the Islamic jihad it's working with Syria and ultimately it's working with all wrong which is the source of much of them is just\nA in the middle east so in response to provocation essentially by Iran and its surrogates including the Islamic jihad has well law\nMilitants are in Syria Israel has conducted an aggressive military campaign across\nA Syria against Iran backed militia groups and in ... this is highly necessary Israel cannot allow a these militants to build up an arsenal a as a basis of continued attacks on Israel\nAnd it could lead ultimately to another outbreak of a small or perhaps a large war\nYeah I mean you're talking about a a a good organizations that it made out of again the God primarily here you've got the Gaza Strip though the Islamic jihad group unlike Hamas operates pretty heavily in the west bank as well so that is why they are a do a mosque because they are the governing power\nIn Gaza Strip so if these are rockets are launched Israel holds for mosh responsible for not preventing the rockets from being launched by these or other groups and sometimes working in tandem ... again it's the middle east things can get complicated but I understand Islamic jihad group also operates in the west bank\nAre controlled by the PLO or the Palestinian authority and so the date but what is unique to uh to what kind of ties them all together\nIs the funding that they receive from Iran and specifically Iran's revolutionary guard forces where those funds flow through they flow through Damascus now even at a time when you would imagine that Syria\nIs extremely unstable that has been one of the headquarters for these Islamic ah a Palestinian Islamic terror groups SOS we're seeing an increase not just between a attacks in the Gaza Strip\nAnd Israel but specifically over just the past Eighteen months uh the really an escalation what Israel is doing in Syria and and targeting the Iranian forces there have been one of their primary goals is to prevent Iran from having to have an occupying force inside Syria\nYeah exactly I over the last Eighteen months uh Israel has lost they think about two hundred airstrikes in Syria\nOr in what really Israel is trying to do they're trying to to head off\nWhat would be a major major war in the middle east and they're doing that\nOr do these air attacks first of all they're trying to stop Iran from having a permanent military base near the Israeli border they're trying to hit it off the major war because they realize\nThat if Iran had a permanent presence there and they vowed to destroy Israel or if they have to get increased weaponry to Hezbollah in Lebanon that again could lead to a major war\nAnd uh they're trying to block weapon shipments coming to Lebanon ah there are a lot of ground Congo is going through Iraq across Syria into Lebanon to arm Hezbollah\nAnd also to to arm Iranian backed militias so he was trying to stop that but the frightening thing you're talking about the the missiles being fired from from the Gaza Strip or just last week Israeli intelligence or released a report\nThat once again around is using civilian airliners to ship weapons weapons components the missiles that have been fired from Gaza into Israel and from Lebanon in Israel\nThey have nothing guided missiles there sort of lobbed into the territory hoping that they will hit something\nHowever last week it was revealed that some of these civilian planes are now delivering sophisticated guidance systems to Hezbollah\nSo they can take these guidance systems installed within the missiles so that they can actually pinpoint specific targets in Israel that is a major game changer in this conflict Iran is really a behaving in a dangerous in reckless fashion\nAnd uh the terror groups in that you and here he talked about\nThey could not do what they do without the financial support of Iran and also the weapons that are supplied to these groups by or on a Iran they they try to use their proxies so they can have plausible deniability threat but their goal is the destruction of the nation of Israel\nYeah and they receive guided shows like they just give all these resources if it's if you do what you want their ... coming with that that's kind of the parents so that Iran is able to control these groups whether it's Hezbollah or you're talking about a group like Islamic jihad or even a boss\nI they want to be able to control them and their actions so they do this at the ... you talked about the weapons as incentives\nBut understand Iran's role of this I think just to underscore what West is talking about using the civilian aircraft\nA as a military a way of a delivery military good to recognize terror organizations take a listen to the general Jack Keane as well he was discussing how this has been uncovered and this is something newly uncovered that Iran has started to do\nWhat's happening is Iran has been very aggressive because Syria means so much to them so they fly on charted airplanes or their military aircraft in in Damascus a missiles ammunition commodities they also use commercial airlines to do that very same thing and then they're driving\nOn an American a Sunday news program CBS face the nation tasteless\nI think I could support the u._s. for watch to see how they view on to Israel has enabled them to catty out atrocities that will do that\nAt all to exist this ...\nAnd I I mean Harry I'll go right to you there that is the Iranian foreign minister tying these two groups that are two countries together as the U.S works with ... and different and unique ways but trying to tie publicly what\nIs is not putting knowledge by Saudi Arabia publicly but that they are somehow a working together against Iraq that's why he's tried to go after them obviously\nYou're absolutely correct essentially what the Iranian foreign minister is trying to do he is trying to deflect attention away from the rainy and\nMalignancy be rainy and atrocities in the middle east by blaming the cross cities that are on building in the middle east and Saudi Arabia\nAnd Israel oh so essentially it's outrageous ... is the number one state sponsor of terror in the world period\nAnd it's clear beyond question that Iran has a plan and money they are attempting to master mind control of the middle east in Syria and Lebanon\nAnd in Gaza as the launch pad for future wars for control of the middle east or extending to Yemen and essentially to the Saudi Arabian peninsula\nBut a lot of people also started to ask it on Facebook and we've got a call about it as well we'll get to our second half hour of the Russian role in this [noise] how are they aligned\nWith Iran why are they

condemned the attack that occurred\nIn Pittsburgh on Saturday I use the Jewish community there at the tree of life synagogue with Lebanon innocent people killed\nSix or injured some critical including law enforcement officials who bravely responded to a a load a gunman a who was fueled by anti Semitism something we must always condemn\nAnd uh we work on the American civil law and justice our work gives the boycott the rest of the sanctions moving in the United states and on college campuses as well and this idea ideological anti Semitism uh but that helps you could see how that again that ideal ideology can be uttered\nUnfortunately into or this horrendous or to fuel this kind of horrendous attack\nSo we condemn that uh it condemned fight anti Semitism wherever we see it but also I again must be praying for those who have who have\nBeen innocently are those people who were killed uh uh who were there to uh at their house of worship for various reasons that day\nAnd so I get a a thoughts and prayers with that a community as we focus in on what is happening around the world there's a we've seen you know whether that was the the Bobby incidents that occur you know explosives it safely do was injured that person gets apprehended in Florida who was responsible for that\nThere's been a lot going on in our own country that is taken away a rightfully so to some extent obviously you've got to focus on what's happening in your country\nBut to understand what's also happening around the world because then we had a ship back into politics is well mid term elections but all this affects us as Americans so what is happening inside Israel what is happening in the middle east very important has it got as much attention\nIn the last few weeks I think it deserves so\nToday because this increased by Israel and their response to ah the radical groups are operating out of the Gaza Strip meeting who are headquartered in Syria and also it increased their Israeli actions inside Syria big backed by the White House be backed by the Trump Administration wanted to go to the phones about this as well because there's another factor this\nWe have it yet address on air or we should just during the break because we got coverage coming in from Jason on Facebook and also call coming in from Phil in New York or lied to feel welcome to Jay sexual alive if\nYou're on there very much for taking my call it means to me it takes you into my question my question is is close to Ninety percent they Christian nation why are they say it's a theocracy into Iran\nYeah so what I Would say you've got to kind of divorce the people oftentimes from the government especially in\nOr we see this off the ties with in countries like Russia or where the foreign policy of the government off the Dodgers don't match up to the views of the people so that that that the idea here again\nIt's not so much Russia's be anti Israel west it's rush or the Russian government because they work with the Israeli government when it's in their interest is the Russian government are working for their own interest there they like China I Would see more and all these countries\nUm they they are not ideologically tied to a anymore this idea of spreading around this view of communism or they don't have that anymore so it's all about their own interest or fear that they don't have the other ties of a like A Rod's got the ideological tired to to why they want to support these groups ... Russia's doing it for themselves\nAnd somebody that their opportunistic you know they're looking for what will what will you forward their own national interest in Russia what they're looking for in Syria to the ... to the caller's point first of all\nThe while the people of Russia or Ninety percent orthodox Christians the government is not a Christian government but in addition to that Russia they want to have a warm water port permanently in Syria on the Mediterranean so that's part of their strategic interest\nBut also Russia is supplying Syria they're trying to prop up the Assad government with anti aircraft missiles [noise]\nIt's a volatile part of the world and maybe we can talk rather than a moment but it's a tinderbox uh it's it's it's hard to predict exactly what will happen there\nYeah you'll see there's something to be aware you've all travel around the world where you ... you will see that there are obviously there's these top lied manufacturers there's your boys and the United states is Airbus for as\nA civilian aircraft but there are many countries that are not able to purchase those some because of economic reasons that the airline you know the cares could afford it\nOr or second because of sanctions so then you'll see the aircraft ... that you may be flying on\nA is a actually manufactured in Russia or China I'm as so often but oftentimes it's the carrier would still be followed by a domestic national so not by foreign nationals he was acquitted that that that was sold off by countries to either didn't have stations so at the time they weren't as broad\nOr the inter they weren't international sanctions that has been one of the issues with the Iranian nuclear deal is that\nDo the US's re imposing very tough sanctions and that will affect it already has affected European business as a ... and the countries and businesses that are based outside the United states\nIt is how a Russian military I mean a Russian made aircraft gets into Iran a civilian uh uh uh their their commercial airline industry is because the international sanctions that are that were that were so dramatically\nPulled back by the Iranian nuclear deal [noise] yes\nAnd in addition it's important to note that the reach of American sanctions for instance on her on may in fact be somewhat muted by virtue of the fact that we are dealing perhaps with Russian manufactured\nUh um planes on but it's also important to note by way of background that the United states has also impose some sanctions on Russia\nAnd hopefully those sanctions will continue to\nBite folks we have a lot to talk about our final segment want to get into the midterm elections as well just a eight days out of tomorrow's officially one day out\nBut many people with early voting is the uh the the voting votes are already being cast many hundreds of thousands of votes in each state have been cast we'll talk about that we'd love to get your thoughts on that one eight hundred six eight four thirty one Ted is issues like Israel like the caravan in Mexico which we could get you on as well\nHow much of an influence you think they will have\nThe midterm elections are just eight days away and give us a call me on the air one eight hundred six have for thirty one to the time to kind of let your views on politics one eight hundred and sixty four thirty wanted we'll be right back from\nMultiple rape WorldCom when did it become OK for men to be lazier softer fatter we need to bring the better of his country back to greatness and it's easier than ever with aids lists male Macs a patent pending formula with an agreement that helps boost your total testosterone\nPromoting greater increases and muscle size and twice the reduction of body fat percentage that exercise alone\nPlus an amazing sixty four percent increase in nitric oxide which can be handy in a gym take your manhood to the max by try your first dirty diaper bottle free shipping and handling\nNot ten days not Fifteen days for the full thirty day supply free when you text the word best to Seventy nine Seventy nine Seventy not\nFiling a formula that boost total testosterone if you'll results with ageless male Macs are too intense please decrease you for your free bottle text best is Seventy nine Seventy nine Seventy nine text B.

what you said you do it I appreciate your face I appreciate her audience which engages all these issues and gets updated and did you do want to have a underscored to all of you\nThat the way we're able to kind of can put this together for that totally live broadcast and have these discussions or is that off the Web you know it's not a you've got to have a lot of a ... a base of information\nTo be able to to have the updated discussions that go along with the news of the day involving Israel gotta have a lot of knowledge behind that to be able to just jump right in and discuss the Saudi Arabia is a roller Russian role or running role in these regions of the world\nAnd of course ultimately our own interest as the United states government so James I really appreciate that we're going to talk politics or in this final segment as well as people again are are already voting are preparing to vote as the midterm elections are officially eight days away that count down\nThe river back of your fifty days away sixty something there's ways just eight days away now\nThere was a lot of because of what's happened uh the the the uncertainties around that that those are those devices that were being sent last week that personal to really be captured thankfully that situation no and get a get your it but then that horrendous attack Saturday in Pittsburgh there's not as much focus really the last two days\nOn what's going on in the mid term elections sometimes with the President Duterte rally there's been a renewed focusing in ...\nIt goes back to uh what else is happening but we're only eight days out now so I Want to get people's thoughts on one hundred sixty four thirty wanted Joseph calling from New York on my one just welcome to Jay suck you alive\nYou know he just\nI just wanted to say that\nUp here in New Jersey public\nCause of satisfaction with the bill\nSo people were yeah explain that to a similar audience\nJust because they may be surprised who just said that people were would be dissatisfied with tax cuts\nCuts that class homeowners actually going to see a big tax increase to the woman ... why the nation's capital of the state\nOf the focus again on the rights that was one of the focus it I kind of explain this to justify it this is how you get into these issues that are affected is why I appreciate these phone calls\nWhat's affecting races that we may not all the ... national issues per member where the tax cuts were coming through there was this idea that blue states where the ... you had much heavier property taxes\nAnd you were able to you but you write that offer you no longer able to do that to to the the numbers you were able to do does it affect people and a lot of the I'd say more moderate states or red states but in the blue as the blue states are\nThese state these huge state bureaucracies would tax we have these massive taxes that they they would expect people to be able to kind of say get haven from ... through their federal taxes but you're talking about how this will impact specifically this New York congressional races\nAnd I looked down at just real real clear politics with the toss ups just in New York New Jersey and I I'm counting up there for their uh right down to the top category that's that are critical to\nHow the house of representatives ultimately whether it remains Republican or not um and then if you look at leading one way or the other or you could add another ah three are actually the other five\nSeats in New York and New Jersey that are up just in the house of representatives so I Do believe it's important that we get updates on especially as we we will continue to talk politics as we move into a ... ah just eight days away that everything is not about a national issue\nOr the big kind of got a big picture issues that that politics is local\nTo an extent as well as it sometimes you see that even more so I'm Out out in the congressional race in a house race the specific region and it may not get as much pickup nationally as the big issues about you know economy but what are the sub issues on to that or tax cuts and what are the sub issues are under that\nAnd how it affects how people will vote and that you've also got the you know they like this issue of the caravan\nThere are people talking about this all over the country I mean we're talking about it to all of all of us the now that includes people who are calling from upstate New York\nUm and people were calling on our southern border and everybody else in between you know for for it so so those who were directly affected it sits by\nThe individuals who would be making across and then the whole country how it's affected as well take us this our our department of homeland security secretary Kirstjen Nielsen updating on and I want to remind people there's been an increase now the amount of troops authorized ... eight hundred to five thousand\nA ... there will be along the border prepared for this\nAs a
