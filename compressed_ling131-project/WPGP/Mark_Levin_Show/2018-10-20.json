anniversary of the black power salute remember that in sixty eight by Tommy Smith and John Carlos he's calling for politicians to have a more civil constructive conversation about race relations\nQuote we're politician to our divisive with their disingenuous cynical approach that is disgusting\nAnd he goes on and on and on about this time for politicians to have a civil conversation about race relations now coach I Know you listen to the show a period in San Antonio appreciate the\nCoverage me tell you something you're not helping you're making things worse\nWith the poll that came out a few months ago that said that six out of ten Americans feel that race relations are getting worse in America but the most of them never discuss the issue with their friends or family and I think about that\nRace relations are getting worse people agree that they're getting worse but they don't discuss it with friends or family\nThat would be something on the part of the people like pop of issues that people are discussing it because it's such a sensitive topic because America steel seizing racism the legacy of slavery and Jim Crow ... let me tell you why people don't talk about it first of all most people don't think they are racist they don't\nMost people think they're fair where people think that there give people a and even shot\nMost people consider themselves to be Christians and the whole basis of Christianity is the golden rule cream people that way you want to be treated most people think they do that so they don't think there is number two if the greater diversity of right and I am that racism is not a major problem in America anymore\nDespite the fact that you feel things are getting worse doesn't mean it's a major problem is it ruining your day is a stop and you can going into a marketing ordering something if the person behind the counter happens to be a different race than yours of course not\nWe're getting along just fine here\nIn this country the third reason people don't say anything you say\nYou tell the truth about how you feel and you're going to be called a racist or an Uncle Tom witness what's going on with Kanye West witness their retreat that we've already had to give you a quick story buddy of mine just told me the other day he's in a bar my buddy is white everybody in the bar is white and it's a sports bar is normally there are sports things on TV for some reason with local news\nAnd they were doing a story about how a bunch of ... every year uh for for several days or Lynn their services for free to poor people are and they interviewed some woman happened to be black holding her baby and\nShe was saying I my baby needs braces my baby needs braces and some white guy said what about your baby 's husband what about your baby's father what about your husband what about your boyfriend where's eat\n\nAnd then some guy a table to over said hey that's racist and the guy that argument and the guys who hate us races eventually left because I started to escalate to the point where who knows what might have happened so here you have all white guys one white guy saying out loud hey where's\nYour where's the baby where's the father of your baby how can we can't help you that's what he said how can the father of your baby can't help you\nStill have it perfectly agenda question he's called racist by another white guy\nSo the point is people don't talk what's the upside I'm going to say how I feel it's going to be politically incorrect and\nNext thing you know I'm a bigger around when I go to our\nIdeas that Jeff that racism is not a major problem in America and I'm Talking to somebody thinks it is what's the upside how am I going to prove it what what what am I supposed to say\nThat's why\nSo coach you're not helping anything and Matthew is Chris Matthews expose the game listen to this\nIs for white people because white people won't vote for a guy most of them if they think they're racist so of his show you're not in some\nCartoonish way you get them off the hook you know what I'm saying\nNow Matthew is making two points although he doesn't realize that the first is\nMost people aren't raises sorry not\nSecondly since most white people will vote for somebody if they think they're racist if necessary for us to characterize that person as racist the brand Reagan his races to brand George W Bush's races the brand Donald Trump is racist because most white people will vote for him to get in the heat races therefore we're going to care to identify races\nThat's the con exposing it\nMost white people coach are not racist or your friends races are you a racist or your friends' friends' races\nKnock it off Nineteen Ninety seven time CNN poll poll black teenagers in white teenagers have talked about this before\nBoth were asked do you think racism is a major problem in America more whites team started wasn't black team\nBut then they asked this do you think racism is a big problem a major problem or a big problem a a a ... ... minor problem or no problem in your own daily lives eighty nine percent of the black teens that racism was a miner or no problem in my daily life\nGrow up knock it off you gotta do three things get to the middle class coach you know this\nFinish high school don't have the kid before you're twenty get married before you have that kids you

the country forty percent of kids in this country are born outside of wedlock that is a massive problem Seventy three percent of black kids coach outside of wedlock that's the problem\nNot racism knock it off\nTo be talking with Dr ... just a second one of the things we were talking about uses the abduction and apparently the murder of this Washington Post reporter here's what Jake Tapper set about\nThis afternoon the president is denying he's giving cover in any way to the ... the thing he definitely wants to find out what happened but that's about as top of the president was willing to get he has had\nHarsh words in the last week or so for Stormy Daniels Senator Elizabeth Warren and Taylor Swift than he has had for the Saudis responsible for the likely butchering and water of a Washington Post columnist ...\nBattle that's going I mean well a CNN's defense guy mud to this\nOne with more that's only half the bombshell here I mean the the really interesting part of this is an addition to the typical prosecutorial side of this\nAs you report and the opening we're talking about a potential report a draft report a narrative if you will\nFrom other going over Rosenstein let me play this out Washington Rosenstein gets the narrative that says not only this is what we found that my violate the law this is my picture of what happened during the investigation\nThat Congress I bet it's going to turn around and say we want to see that in the Congress is going to lead there's going to be some dirt and there are so in addition to the indictments I really want to see what's in that narrative of worked at a federal\nSo we're going to talk to Dr ... about CNN reporting that we may see more indictments from Robert Mueller and has the parents as president been dismissive about what's happened to the Washington Post journalist I Am Larry Elder do not leave town\nLarry oh they're all through all [noise]\nSo you're a veteran you say you stand for the flag and you are denounced

not and and I can tell you that even just last year\nWhen the Pittsburgh Steelers decided to stay in the locker room instead of come out for the national anthem\nA one player villain a waiver who's an Army Ranger came out and stood by himself with his hand over his heart and he was not considered a racist so this even as much as a year ago or it would not have been unheard of to hear somebody a leader in the party defend the flag\nSo what I mean you're the executive worthy executive director of the party you obviously know a lot of Democrats in your town in traditionally democratic county what if what if your ... your former coworker said two years since this happened\nI haven't heard from many of them I understand the party line is that is a personal matter and I can respect that however are those that are elected officials or party members who are not tied with my direct sort of chain of command if you will I have not heard from many of them\nThat's a shocking what is the stadium about how the parties change\nWell it makes me wonder if there is room for moderate Democrats and the Democratic party nowadays\nUm there were some elected officials who said that they acknowledge that they've known me and I'm not a racist however was insensitive and unfortunately if my patriotism and standing up for family friends has become insensitive\nOr that I think we as Democrats need to stop and reevaluate exactly what we stand for\nStanding up for the flag is considered a racist then what happens to the country do you think going forward\n[noise] that's that's a good question I'm a little worried about that when you're going to do\nWell um I'd like to continue to bring this to light and continue to voice concern for this very issue um and then in the short term um ironically my son is going in the air force than sixty days I'm going to spend some time with him and ... and I will continue to fight this cause as long as I can continue to clear my

Democrat or you're not\nI wasn't very happy that I changed to a Democrat I ...\nI see and the reason I I assume that you're a Democrat is because many Democrats have said things that have been far worse and I'm Wondering whether or not you're equally outrage for example when a Howard Dean was chair of the DNC he says the contest between Republicans and Democrats is good versus evil and we're the good you have a problem with that\nI I don't recall I I didn't I didn't think you did I'm not I'm not trying to ... or ... or the gay but I didn't I didn't think he knew that and my point is when

of their news of Trump has been negative even as the economy is getting\nAll time high unemployment all time low stock market all time high\nYou think maybe they can do a little better than Ninety
