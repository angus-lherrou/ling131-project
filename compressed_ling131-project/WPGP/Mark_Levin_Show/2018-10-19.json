Allegheny county democratic committee who was a fire ... last week a mark sorry about that uh I I just want her\nSaid I just wanted to finish up with you um are you were talking about being a moderate in the Democratic party and I'm Wondering if there is a less and less room for people like you and the Democratic party these days because let's say you know I mean I'm a conservative\nThen I'm hoping the Democrats get their clocks cleaned up two weeks on Tuesday so I you know I'm I'm not a I have no sympathy for whatsoever but I'm just wondering as a guy who's been in the party you know your whole life or is there room for people like you\nI think there is um I think the problem is mainstream Democrats moderate Democrats like myself\nI'm as a whole and and this is just my opinion I read some a little bit of research about it and and I could be wrong but I think most of us are just too busy with day to day life an activity\nTo really get involved with what it takes to protest or to call attention to something or cause or bring light to an issue\nUm so what you tend to see is that the smaller groups who are more organized more passionate they tend to have a larger voice or what the issues but I think there's still room for the moderates and my goal my hope from all of this is that I can sit down with\nOther moderates and sit down and say how can we have a voice how can we have a seat at the table um how can we stop this nasty I'm discourse that's taken place in politics and how can we get back to sitting at the table across from the table with\nRepublicans and whoever else and finding common sense solutions to the issues of that is a place not only can Allegheny county but nationally\nAnd are just as an expert or you work in the Democratic party give me a little predicts you know what's gonna happen on Tuesday nationally\nWell nationally I think uh this is just maybe again but I think we're going to the house John medical benefit the house I think that's going to be a little harder to get 'em but I think there's going to be\nA better than average turn out just from what I see on the ground um and I can tell you that maybe I was a little biased because of being insulated amongst the Democratic bubble if you will because I worked in the party\nAnd happening since left and been contacted by a lot of people from the other side now look to walk away movement things like that mhm I'm I'm impressed with the passionate up the other side as well that leads me to believe that we're probably going to have a\nBetter than average mid term turn out uh I think some of the races are going to be very close as usual I think some will be a surprise but I think the Democrats will have a very close very slight advantage of the house when it's all said and done and the Republicans will maintain the Senate\nAnd this is what they're supposed to do this is how it works I mean in just about every every president does that does happen to them in the first you know after the first two years right\nYeah usually about twenty five to thirty a house seat swing based off of you know in the mid term election now this is just so this is an unprecedented if this is what takes place\nWhy mark I appreciate you being armed with is a it's a I'm Sorry but you're losing your job there but uh you seem like you're handling okay ... thanks for a clear up force

C. but can you describe for folks I think this is important for everybody understand you were in Turkey for a long time twenty three years what you were doing in Turkey and and what's your activities were and then we'll we'll we'll bring a current but what were you there as a mission\nCan I can I first say something that we are so grateful to people who paid for us and we are so grateful for a field day a such a tremendous job fighting for us and uh the the uh high all was tireless and advocating for us\nAnd you also J uh effort cc I Know she's a barely lawyer but she was also\nA personally involved calling Noreen encouraging her and so many ways\nAnd a and you also Jay and we are so grateful that ACL J\nUh took this on and uh we want everyone to know what a what a tremendous uh uh help this was and and how grateful we are too\nWill look we are thrilled that the result was as it was we got another case right now where do we haven't had that result right now and that is a representing us or helping to see a Bebe in our office in Pakistan but uh your case ended successfully but you were there in prison in Turkey in very difficult circumstances but I think is a I'll take a call in a minute here\nBut I I Andrew set for the folks what you were ... how long have you been there and what you were doing\nIn Turkey what was your call to go there\nWell uh we were there for twenty four years before I was arrested and our main goal was to uh go and priests to this Christ\nOne of the main things we were involved in with church planting we are well several church plants and then in the last couple of years when there was a surge of Syrian refugees because of the ISIS attack\nSyria a number of refugees came into turkey and we saw an opportunity not only to show the love of Jesus by helping them a humanitarian aid but also people who had never had access to the gospel most Kurtz have never met a Christian\nOr in their lives and in Syria you're kind of preach the gospel it was forbidden so we got involved with the Syrian refugees\nAnd we're a started a meeting among them and we're doing evangelist and with that\nSo you were there as basically a missionary I mean we can safely say that no we could not say that while you were there um obviously because of the situation you're wearing but you would they're sharing the gospel that was what your job loss\nWe did it and we did a very openly we we did everything they opened our churches were open to the public the ... um Misha worked to Syria's what it's all done out of the open\nBut before we take cause has to run to the question over those twenty three years any serious issues with the government or local or state a regional government or the national government in Turkey at all\nWell there are cycles sometimes are\nThere more accommodating to churches and took resent that sometimes there's a bit of a a tightening up uh we had a they're often rather than from the government it's from a\nUh other people who will sometimes there'll be threats bomb threats death threats or we were attacked once in our church with a man came with a shotgun\nSo that's always a possibility is that just does anybody who's involved in church planting a turkey can have those kinds of dangerous but\nIt's not from the government\nSo this was this was in a sense a new effort to arrest you and try you know one of the one of the charges was ... so ... nothing like this ever experienced these threats experience we understand that and that part of the world but but what happened to you is something that has not happened over twenty three years\nNo it was an unprecedented thing yes\nSo there is one follow up thing we're doing you know I said your case was closed and that's a great thing 'cause you're home and and and we're going to get into what's what's next for you but she she you got it we still one legal issue where you got to finish up with and that was the un commission on arbitrary detention ... we talked about that yeah they engaged in\nThe working group on arbitrary detention and engaged and stay out we present it the whole case to them\nThey're still making their decision and then I have to announce finalize ... than what the professional I went to court that he's back um I pay family with actually that decision ended a conviction and and what and release conditions where\nRight here's what we're going to do there's a lot of you called me I mean our phone lines are literally jammed Facebook comments coming in El ... says God is so good so happy the pastor Brunson history Christine says welcome home pastor Brunson you're truly here due to answered prayer so we give all the praise and Thanksgiving the gun I said that the beginning to broadcast\nA Andromeda caught and I said this and I met her I mean I'm I'm very happy with the legal work that was done by our team that was led by cc I'm thrilled with the work that they invented in Washington and government affairs shop and Greg ... who runs her office in ... and it just a great job in the end and the circus\nAnd as of now I was representing you and then ended up representing the president I mean you none of nobody could have put down altogether at the end of the day\nThese though I I Believe that with and not to take nothing away from any one\nThat uh the lord was in this and that's that's how these things happen and I'm Glad that uh everybody I'm Glad for the tenacious advocacy by our legal team by the president by the secretary of state but we do also have to give credit where credit's is also do you not just the way we feel is the inland it's usually\nBut let me do this we we've Andrew we've got a lot of people want to talk to you so you stay on that phone and we're going to start taking calls yes Karen is calling in from New York\nOn line to Karen welcome to Jay sexual alive\nHi Karen you're on the mastermind ...\nThank you for taking my call and I did find a cow pasture Branson I pray for him daily I'm so thankful for parents to answer and he's home and I wanted to let him know\nWhat an inspiration hear testimony as a Christian to other Christians throughout the world and on the light that he was in darkness and I just thank him for that um he really inspired me as a Christian to um the mold\nAnd preach the gospel time their sets what were called to do so I Want to thank him and tell them how happy I Am to hand him back in the United states\nWill do what you're talking right to um Andrew where where do you what do you say the care and\nWell we are very grateful for parents prayers and for a number of people who prayed for us and we believe a obviously a God used as a people are but I think that uh what was moving that's what brought our name up to this level or with the president uh\nWas was periods of God's people and but I also think that\nAs we look at it we think well we're we're not very significant or importance for our name to rise a for so many people to pray for us we think that there was much more that God was doing and I look at it as almost like we're looking at a puzzle but from the bottom side\nAnd someday we will look from the top and will actually see the picture right now we don't see the full picture\nBut God was doing much more than just using ... to release me from prison prison a I think there was he was just pouring prayer from God's people into turkey and then to the middle east and that there's going to\nA pass something spiritual onto a spiritual blessing on and so we we ask God to give us an opportunity when we asked the president\nFor a good pray for him he was very receptive and it was a great privilege for us to do this\nLet's say one more call before the break here Julie California on line six Julie you're on the air with pastor Bronx Julie\nI'm gay and people are going to come on the wall that's why I'm a member of the hail today\nBecause they care about one individual and they care about us for the whole world and passed on

care about the individual and so my wife told me out cc would stay up sometimes through the night monitoring something for us the hearings and then the next day go through a whole day at work\nAnd just the personal care there was a really phenomenal uh uh the question I just forgot what the question\nWas you know no no the question was did you feel the prayers of God's people\nYou know I I was very encouraged knowing that people are praying for me one of the fears that I had it sent irrational think perhaps\nBut when one one that's isolated the way I was is it would be forgotten and that people would not pray for me and I desperately wanted that per because I I felt very weak and so uh as I look back uh on my second year of one God was rebuilding me\nI did it feel God's presence very much but uh I I Know very well that it was a personal God's people that was a\nThere was a great coming to me that often was not felt it was like a hit and grace and I wasn't aware of it at the time but then I Would look back and say well I came\nThrough these difficulties and I know that I'm too weak to do it myself you know I Know that it was great\nYou know you're absolutely right if I were to take a break we'll come back with Sandra ... runs the moment but interesting statement when you said where you felt like you were alone and there were those times we we've had other cases where people

I noticed one thing one when we my wife and I were held together for Thirteen Days were arrested at the same time and I have a seminary that Greece I ever tasted New Testament and I've taught for ...\nAnd the years I've preached and ah yet I saw that my wife was stronger than I was during the Thirteen days and it came from\nA a deep devotion she has and I should say a consistent time with the lord every day for years she set time aside and she read the Bible and she just spent time in God's presence and prayed\nAnd I was more sporadic I'd run fast and then I'd slow down but she was very consistent and uh it's not that she had been credible revelations every day but it was the uh over time the consistency and just feeding herself so that when\nThe crisis came and wear\nNFL together there are\nPeople and from ISIS and the cells around us and we thought what's happening what's going to happen we had no idea so we're Thirteen Days\nCut off a together and and that are holding fatter and she was doing better than I was ...\nAnd so I thought this is a method says she carries and that I found uh that uh I Want to practice as well as emphasize just a consistent time spent with God it's strengthened says\nUh for the difficulties or will you be able to handle it when it comes\nA well you get the grace at that time [laughter] you know before and uh sometimes it doesn't feel like enough to be honest with you sometimes it doesn't feel like enough and I'm working through that but the fact is that it did it it was enough\nI just want to remind people pastor Bronx you kind of set of passing because of I think his experience in Turkey for so long but because of the refugee flow out of Syria\nAnd that he was even in that original a holding the data deportation facility out there with his wife with a prisoners from ISIS\nYeah this is these were a difficult situation right from the beginning uh it did and he's a man you got to remember that yeah the ... the ice is part of this again because turkey was dealing with this overflow of people out of Syria some who were ISIS fighters so again I should have more people to to miss that it it passed readers' comments were go right back\nTo the phones to David in Washington state on line five David you're talking to pass the Bronx I David\nHello pastor Brunson money does David ...

County which is the most pro Trump county in the country\nAnd every year they have the main event where people dress up in western garbage or somebody political event and all the Republicans comment to be clear I was asked me the keynote speaker and I was very flattered and honored and I went there and I spoke to somebody because they got me a very nice to have some half\nOf it and I posted it on Twitter and Facebook and somebody wrote and said very markedly [noise]\nThis is not your heritage\nAnd I wrote back and I attached a link to a comedy with Web site that's at twenty five percent of cowboys was the last [noise]\nAnd I said so in fact if my heritage [noise]\nIf you go on line you'll find that number twenty five percent are pretty calmly sided [noise]\nContact with a friend of mine historians Roger McGrath and teachers are taught for a long time American West in California history and UCLA\nAnd um\nI asked him about their twenty five percent number and he said there were a number of black cowboys many of whom were quite prominent\nI maybe about twenty percent of blacks were\nAll on cattle drives in certain places but the number twenty five percent is wildly inflated and he said and I used to teach a course in this and when I talked about the number of being inflated I was used to being racist\nSo we're to talk to our Roger McGrath about the percentage of black cowboys how the number get to be twenty five percent how they treat it and I also want to ask you about this movie Django that um [noise]\nUh when parents you know put out east and he wanted to cleaning she wrote for black people as if they weren't already black cowboys I Want to ask is this your story and whether or not Jane go help or hurt the cause of historical accuracy about the American west all it will be coming up and just a few minutes\nBut first\nThe um\nReuters is reporting that a Russian has been charged with conspiring to interfere in us congressional elections\nAnd a Elena or can't pronounce the last may become the first person charged with a crime for interfering with twenty Eighteen elections chief count for something called project laptop operations started and twenty fourteen funded by Russian oligarchs\nAnd um this Russian oligarch and to other companies were indicted or back in February and special counsel Robert Mueller separate investigation of Russian meddling\n\nComplained details new examples of Russians using fake persona on social media to stoke arguments about race and other contentious issue now I had written and talked about how USA Today look at all of the uh Facebook ads that the Russian box purchased a and a the overwhelming majority of them had to do with race\nOn some time they were pro black sometimes they were anti black only a handful had to deal with specific mansions of Hillary or I'm Donald Trump basically they were just trying to sow racial discourse\nNow\nHow can something like this actually have an impact on an election you can have an impact on the election given the fact that the last constantly talks about how racist America yes the Russians are watching the same news at\nUh everybody else watches like watching this and be on the watch CNN they see this constant constant constant drumbeat America institution of the races systematically racist black lives matter you ought to block cetera\nMy point is whom do you think has a bigger impact on how people think and how people vote washing box or the left wing media constantly talks about racism or sexism income inequality homophobia\nMy friend Sam Gross close with them I wrote a book called left turn\nOf the primary news sources between eighty Ninety percent of them are left wing in the news media were truly fair and balanced the average state with all the way Texas which is about eight to ten points in safer on the Republican so if you want to look at impact on election\nLook in the mirror mainstream media because you have a far bigger impact\nAnd even if you argue that the media point of view a legitimate point of view\nNinety percent\nHow's that balance\nAnd the answer is not far far more impact during the two thousand eight election you've got people like\nThose who are in that\nOrganization called journalists reporters literally going back and forth on line discussing ways we can minimize the impact of the revelation of Jeremiah Wright\nUh on the Obama campaign here's what we can do we can pick any conservative assigned somebody Karl Rove Fred Fred Barnes a this report is that it could be anybody let's find somebody and accuse him of racism to change the subject\nEvery week it's on the floor of the Senate and says that Romney has not pay taxes let improving because of the word he is he's not paid any where were the media why is it that Harry we can even show his face\nYou know they had an impact on the election\nWhere were you you refer to illegal aliens is undocumented and call people racist to call them what they are which is specifically illegally illegal aliens\nWhat kind of impact that has on how people perceive the issue of illegal immigration\nPeople like Ann Coulter racist for areas that Jesse eleven twenty three million that we hear all the time is probably way too low old fast forward Yale study shows that the number eleven twenty three it's way too low and they put the number eight twenty to some ... million\nPeople like us Andrea Ocasio Cortez if she's Joan of arc\nCan't explain how you're going to pay for all this free stuff\nBabble slicing the you know you when you ask her how to pay for all this stuff\nHow is it that we have a lot of people\nWho have a favorable view of socialism is because of the media because of Hollywood because of academia and you want to talk about the influence of Russian bought\nAnd we're always hearing about how to live the Republican voters are because of the influence of Fox\nI'm holding my baby brown libertarian fingers\nGallup poll\nShows Seventy eight percent of Democrats mistakenly believes Russia change election results not just interfering with changing voting taps\nRussia or Republicans are idiots because they are climate change deniers they don't face facts they don't care about reality Seventy eight percent\nOf Democrats believe Russian Russia change election results never mind Jay Johnson Obama's secretary of homeland security so there's no evidence whatsoever that's the case\nAnd you're prepared remarks to your knowledge there was no vote tallying or changes that no one's for was voted one way to record it some other way is that still your opinion that uh with respect to the sixteenth election that uh the the intrusions or ... or whatever there's Russians are others did\nNot affect the or the actual voting yourself\nBased on everything I Know a that is correct I I Know of no evidence that through cyber intrusions boats were altered or suppressed in some way okay the lessons learned moving forward or you designated the or a sister\nAnd that's a good enough\nGood enough serious serious\nSeventy eight percent of Democrats believe not only that Russia interfered in the twenty sixteen election\nBut they changed the result despite a lack\nEvidence for this for you in the ...\nMajority of Democrats also believe that George W. Bush lied listen to the Iraq War that's like zero evidence to the contrary evidence that confirms that point of view what is Republicans\nThat are diluted Republicans don't care about facts don't care about science majority of Democrats believe George W. Bush lied listen to the war even though we didn't Seventy eight Senate Democrats believe not only that Russia interfered metal\nBut that Russia change election results despite the evidence for this
