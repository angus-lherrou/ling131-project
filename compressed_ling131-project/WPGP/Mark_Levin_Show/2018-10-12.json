a couple of producers on about a month ago I had a writer on of the federalist to do to review on it and talked about it and how all the all the background and how hard it was from the get made this movie was actually finished\nIn two thousand and Fifteen or sixteen and it's now just getting on the air or like three years later I'm\nAnd so I I find this thing here on a Philadelphia magazine\nAnd the headline is the Kermit does know movie opens today not without controversy of course a a ... and his this person's point the Victor Fiorello is that the movie critics are pretty much ignoring it he says\nAh it's been over ... it's been more than four years is over two million dollars was raised through crowdfunding to make this movie he says today that film finally hits theaters but you might not know that we searched and this is what Christine said we\nSearch silo for reviews of God's know the trial of America's biggest serial killer among the usual suspects but reviews by mainstream critics really does know movie are scarce nearly nonexistent actually\nAh he has he said the only one he could find this is a review of a movie or you can find a removed just about any uh any movie that's out there\nA Michael arrest chef in a he's a reviewer for somebody LA Times\nOr according to this guy rush fashion remarks that the gods no movie could never be mistaken for having a liberal bias and later using terms like sanctimonious and sensationalistic to describe it so I didn't read that review maybe I can find that but this guy thinks that the movie is\nA sensationalistic\nA and\nHe doesn't he's so I guess it's not important to him I just it's amazing to me um that people have taken that not only taken this I'm having this reaction to it but having no reaction at all to it that they wouldn't um they wouldn't do review\nAnd this is I mean Fox News I'm sure we'll have something on it but this is this is a good topic\nBut it's a great topic for any talk show TV show any kind of a panel show\nIs it's a spectacular topic and it's a it's a movie that um it's a it's a true story\nAbout a guy who killed babies after they were born alive but is now serving a life sentence sorry but that's a I don't know that seems like a no brainer to me as as a as as a subject for a movie number one but it took them all the time to get a I'm\nA first to them a long time to raise the money and then it took them a long time to make the movie and even longer to find the time when they could get it distributed and so it's out there and very few uh theaters\nAnd I think the only way that this happens for the movie is if there's some kind of a grass roots groundswell\nUm movement to get people to go to this movie but uh it's playing look for a theater near you I I Know I live out in the south area I live in Washington County and the closest one to me is\nThe movie theater at the Galleria in Mount Lebanon has um has it and uh it's it's I think for other places so um it should be everywhere I don't know why wouldn't be but it isn't so I Hope I Hope that um\n[noise] becomes it gets to the point where it's Christine said the the theaters are being asked why they're not carrying it and maybe that you can do if a theater near you doesn't have a call up and ask why should it should be on a I Want to get to one other thing here I thought was kind of funny um this is\nThis is a Senator Bill Cassidy\nHe's walking through the ... yeah us do it right now he's walking through the hallways of the Senate building and they came across a couple of a woman who was

well\nYeah in the United states spoke with one voice on this and that's why it was so important for the president and vice president to set the tone but in the Congress Jay mean scores scores of senators and congressmen or spoke out on this a door and you're right I think senators link for ...\nProbably had the most vested interest me tripped over to turkey to visit with officials in the

received the call this morning from the president of the United states\nPresident Trump who told me to have good news\nUm looks like your pastor pastor Andrew Brunson will be coming home to the United states that he gave me some of the details about that that that government been obviously working on their release but that was the process would be going\nTo two military bases that's how these things are handled but I expressed so the president on behalf of all of our ACL Jay member or the ... family\n... for his unyielding unyielding a efforts to obtain the pastor's release and of course your prayers and support for the past and let me also say that\nUh I have a lot of idea what the media lot as you know a ... in several different capacities outside the ACL Jay but I Need to say this to my friends and the media these reporters a for these ah newspapers that when I'm dealing with other matters I've been very kind and covering pastor Brunson case and the story\nAnd that helped keep him alive as part of the process when you've got\nPeople held like this and I'm a I'm a huge thank you and I told us to a couple of reports that I appreciate them covering it and continuing to cover it and uh and that and that's across the board here a ... and it's been on many networks of Fox News CNN\nOr have covered extensively ab seniors are discovered it I mean I even talked about it with George Stephanopoulos on ABC this week a couple of weeks back so a good news on that front and we're thrilled with his release but again if you're just joining us ...\nAre now being processed out of turkey and what that means is he's they're removing the ankle bracelet which which is monitored it was at a house arrest\nA will be taken to a military transport aircraft uh probably flown directly into Germany\nI'll be evaluated may return to the United states I don't know exactly when that ... will be yet we're we're into that but I'm Will keep everybody posted is this a progressive progressive over the next several hours but a great day\nUh on any time you get these releases like this door to a great day we're still waiting\nFor the one on the BBC that case was earlier this week I Know this way way up to the others but yeah that they are there were reports morning that that could be coming at any moment job out of the pack and was a great take it\nOut of the Pakistani U.S Supreme court that that case here or what happened pastor Brunson\nUltimately was ordered is that is unique it's similar to the situation as time served all of the witnesses against faster or brunch who basically dropped their\nStories or this morning in court in Turkey um and said they were there was they were not accurately reported as as what they had accused pastor Brunson of\nAnd uh and then ultimately the prosecutor a recommended in Turkey that he be allowed to travel or the ... no longer under judicial order and so that's why the ankle brace it will be coming off where he's coming off as we speak right now\nHis house released a house arrest or will be released and ultimately will be given his passport and able to travel and and we plan on doing that um later on today\nA in Turkey I just to remind you this is someone who spent two years and containment a year and a half of that in prison\nBecause of his Christian faith I pastor been there for twenty three years in Turkey in American\nI raised his family has three children and he'll be reunited with the United states ah two sons and one daughter whose daughter spoken out a very publicly for her father even going to the United nations in Geneva a show again I I've heard of his ... as a sister on as well so there's a family\nWhich is very excited to uh to see pastor Brunson released it was a long and difficult process more difficult than they should have been with a NATO ally like turkey these are not it was not like a situation\nI'm In Iran or North Korea right much uh with how complicated it got\n'em and because it's an American citizen then I figure it's just as big of a deal or to see his freedom or saw everybody's a ... who was innocent and persecuted because their face it doesn't matter what countries doing it what relationship to us may have with that country or their release is something to celebrate\nWell look at it absolutely and we're thrilled with the outcome here and I hope this also goes a long way in restoring relations between the United states and turkey Turkey's been an important ally of NATO ally and they play up strategic role in the region and it would be good to see those relations are stored and this was a\nStep is a secretary Pompeo said it very positive step in that restoration process having said that also let me just say that this also gives you a glimpse and I'm going to go to bed on basic gives you a glimpse of that nature which we have these cases that was a unique situation here in that\nUm we had a situation where we had a NATO allies Jordan said that took custody of an American so a NATO ally taken custody of an American pastor\nIt happened to be also at the very same time but that fast or it was a ... in jail\nHis family contacted us we immediately began a representation of him that predated my representation of the president but then of course now represents and it happened for over a year and a half now about a year now representing the president the United states and so it gave us a unique perspective on it and\nUh I think it was helpful for the pastor or to to have an advocate that could obviously a speak with the president but having said that this president has been very very assertive on returning passages that are Americans back to the United states and just had a great track record there\nBut it was a unique perspective for me it we've had a lot of these over the years but it's a little bit unique in that sense but again I when I got that call\nThis morning I was just a really delighted with the with the news that we wanted it conveyed I we set up a a video on Facebook immediately\nOr we sent out a report or social media outlets as well but we're glad now that we're talking with our our radio audience than I think it's important for you to state the nature of the bipartisan ship that was involved in this and what we were able to accomplish on the legislative level that help move this all\nWell I think it was particularly important given the fact that you just pointed out that this was an ally of the United states that we had a vested interest in maintaining a good relationship with so today we're grateful to both countries but you're right Jay this was a little bit different in that regard first of all it was important for the administration\nTo speak with one voice the vice president and the president the secretary state ambassador brown back being in the courtroom Jay but then in Congress I mean\nI I Would first give a had given me a tip of the hat to senator Jeanne Shaheen Democrat from New Hampshire who went over to turkey herself and J I Will tell you was extremely engage behind the scenes\nBoth on putting pressure on turkey when when it was appropriate but then also engaging diplomatically with turkey and reassuring turkey did the United states wanted a strong relationship with him\nAnd and free and pastor Andrew Brunson was the best way to accomplish that and so\nYou know there was sort of a a team of four senator Lankford is centered or tell us who went down to the for the United States Senate every single week for the past several months to speak on behalf of the pastor\nAnd Senator Graham but Jay a multiple letters multiple congressional testimony a pastor Brunson daughter came\nTo Congress to testify visits to turkey engaging diplomatically and also through pressure means by camera all bipartisan and all of them J. speaking with one voice in half the United states government a behind the president\nAnd at the same time or you say to my team our team your teeth are that are listening and members of the AC okay your team at the ACL Jay bad bet it is team in DC a great corporate ... a team at the Europeans are below injustice engaged at the un on multiple occasions\nOr so we're very happy or they're very happy with the way this tape came out a Logan team that was in charge of the media and social media races a year stake here to our entire game we want where we said we utilize all the oil yours or government affairs professionals\nPastor Brunson a sister talking about that how important of a ally turkey is the United states and if the\nShouldn't have this kind of relationship so that's very important Senator Graham was talking about that as well I I just want to underscore to all of you\nAre thanks and how how important it is to stay with it these are tough cases they take us a long time that a ... you try diplomatic options um you could uh we had a White House in a president willing to take steps are\nAfter diplomacy or was not working just to get it done to even issues things like us or\nA targeted sanctions on Turkish officials to see the release of pastor Andrew Brunson and I cannot underscored enough um how important it is that all of you stood by for those two years I'm a pastor Brunson I Know he thinks you\nAdd to his family things shoe and as usual in these situations though he realized because in Turkey it was such a big story\nUm I think he will come to realize even more so over the next twenty four forty eight hours how many people were following his story almost on a daily basis here in the United states and certainly when they were updates on every news network\nA route or many different broadcast shows are some that will be doing later today who ... who stood

military base I stay in these members of Congress like Lindsey Graham said they they played a key role even go as far as uh not just using their contacts to me with\nThe president turkey but also to go right into the prison to be a pastor Brunson\nYeah far more than just issued a statement or giving a speech tournament several members of the house and Senate went over to turkey or to visit with a pastor Brunson also to visit with officials I mean you think about senator tell US Senator she he knew\nA used their seats in the Senate Armed Services Committee or to raise this issue Jordan's so you
