when he was in Sweden countries\nHave never gotten for them in this country but it's like this is what you know there are problems with human phones and then my problem with no\nBut when they guarantee health care for all of that I'm going to pay for talking with him\nHe's at the airport an airport in Sweden and he's talking to young people\n[noise] like nothing [noise] on childcare [noise] pretty good and you're right I'm trying to [noise]\nSo you know I think that those are programs that we all live at I think there's a lot with Martin in what the governments of for reading them done multiple [laughter] off enough\nWith are there are a lot of ways to express or the ideological divide we have in this country and one of them is that half the country beliefs as a free lunch and the other half of stopping them from eating Bernie Sanders tells this young person how much do you pay nothing punch me for child care nothing would you pay for college nothing\nMuch you pay for health care nothing nothing they don't have taxpayers in Sweden even in Sweden Bernie Sanders government has no money they can tax it they can borrow it\nThey can printed but they have no money\nIs

doing\nWell thanks how are you\nI'm doing great I'm Sally a Bernie Sanders once Medicare for all can you give us your analysis of what this would do\n[noise] yes it would be a complete disaster and if you know Larry I'm Canadian I grew up in Canada under a single payer I started a publication back in Nineteen eighty eight I'm I'm waiting your turn a guy to waiting lists the average Canadian family\nUm wait Twenty one point two weeks something a primary care doctor to getting treatment by specialist Bernie Sanders want the Canadian health care system is that Medicare for all the time has come he wants the Canadian system but even more he wants to add vision care free drugs\nAnd um and and and and free Bijan care and and um you know of course he he had the bill before the Senate which had sixteen co sponsors for whom want to become president and of course he never talks about what it would cost and how it would be paid for but it's Charles ... center said\nThirty two trillion dollars over ten years\nAll private coverage under his plan Larry would be outlawed and you know a hundred and sixty million Americans have employer sponsored insurance and the polls show they like it they would all lose their coverage immediately and we would all be\nLike people in the u._k. under the national health service Canada under Medicare system the waiting list or care would be rationed and our taxes would have to be increased significantly\nSo how would why why does a a Medicare for all seem to test all well among Democrats\n[noise] well I think you know Bernie started this back in twenty sixteen I'm Single payer around Medicare for all for a long time but only in twenty sixteen when he was running against Hillary\nFor the Democratic presidential nomination brought out his first single payer plan you know telling the American people that would be free and they would have the best healthcare and all and so you know the mainstream media picks up on this and plays it over and over again that you know who wouldn't want something that's free\nBut as I say he never talked about how it would be paid for and how much it would cost and so and then he has of course is I'm\nA new young sidekick Alexandria Ocasio Cortez a ... member of a democratic\nSocialist with America she is going around with Bernie telling candidate you know promoting candidates who support single payer and so it's really a being a very big move to the left for the Democratic party and I think we're going to see in this midterm election on November six\nAre these candidates who are running to the left a Ben Jealous or for governor of Maryland that's I'm Andrew Gillum who is running against um [noise] the Centers for the governorship in Florida how are these people do to the American people are they finally understanding by people like you and me tell educating them on\nHow terrible it would be what the cost to be their tax burden and you know in the latest poll a study out of the American association of medical colleges\nThey're predicting a shortage of a hundred and Twenty one thousand doctors\nBy twenty thirty because so many dots sixteen percent increase so many dogs you know quick medicine under Obamacare but the thought of being under a single payer system where Bernie says they would be paid for forty percent below\nWhat they're paid now um because they their salaries their payments would be tied to Medicare for this war and courage more doctors to quit and the best and brightest young people not to go into medicine\nCertainly talk to me about a pre existing conditions I thought it was an assault on the on the insurance model to force insurance carriers to take people with preexisting illnesses now hearing Republican say hey hey Democrats dope said we're going to take away preexisting conditions because we're not I'm confused\nWell I Know it's very confusing and of course it's all goes back to the fact that when Trump with running as president and the Republicans were running in the twenty sixteen presidential they promised that they would repeal and replace Obamacare unfortunately you know by the early fall at twenty Seventeen they hadn't been able to do it and it wasn't done\nUm we're seeing some very good things being done\nThrough the administration secretary Alex aides are you know expanding\nI'm short term a limited to ration plans association helping a lot of things are happening but this issue of preexisting conditions keeps coming up and the Republicans I think those that are in tight races are getting squishy on the issue the the the

I don't know rooms welcome to the program known as the Kremlin while because we've got to cut me to say though is guaranteed [laughter]\nSub go\nTriple late nights have been one that's a GED triple eight nine seven one seven to for three very able to release after dot com studio coming up we'll be talking with congressman Dana Rohrabacher California congressman one of seven Congress person who's in a very difficult race against state opponent who wants to Medicare for all Sally pipes and they were just talking about that [noise]\nThat's coming up and just a few minutes President Trump today [noise] defended his use of the term nationalist which he said at a rally last night he called himself a nationalist and therefore that meant that people that hate Donald Trump he was saying white nationalist nudge nudge wink wink I'm a racist\nIn Studio the\nCo producer and co writer of the book and screenplay God's mail the untold story of America's most prolific cereal poor please welcome to the studio\nAnd medical marijuana I got it you know I I haven't [laughter] macaroni there you go there you go that far but thank you [noise] um and they keep coming back on you and I talked about the movie a couple of days ago\nOne of the things I didn't mention is that God's know had separate better facilities for white patients they do for black patients what that all about ...\nRaces to me that's called racism you know yeah he's black\nAnd he's black yeah yeah and I think it was really you know with with God it was all about money\nSo it you know a lot of the black people I think that we're coming to him were from very poor neighborhoods so the white women were coming from nicer neighborhoods and had more money but yeah he was an ... and you know even understand some of his staff or black we're ... we're asked like what was that about what did he say without these that that's just the way the world is just how things are done\nNow is a little confused about some of the other the various activities that he was doing was he was he's selling drugs which he claimed\nThat yeah so in fact that's the only reason he ever got caught by the way so went undercover narcotics officer Jim what was the one who actually eventually caught up with 'em so when he was doing was\nYou know this whole ... opioid ... drama the ... the tragedy by the way that's happening across America you need you need to get prescriptions for that right so he was selling prescriptions to drug dealers and under fake names and he had such an ... setup but he was probably the third I think he's the third most\nAt the biggest opioid supply or in the whole of Pennsylvania so you would turn out but he would he would have people turn up at night and get like Fifteen twenty thirty prescriptions that then they could sell on that they could go to ... to to pharmacists skipped failed and sell those until those up that's how we got called it's the only reason they got close\nAnd in the film his home see nice but not particularly opulent will be making a great deal of money huge so they found they found that two hundred and four fifty thousand dollars in cash in the house and I don't know I don't know what you're doing there Larry but I I don't think you've got that kind of cash hanging around I don't need as many of your listeners who that kind of cash hanging around and he only Seventeen homes he was ...\nI Can't get I can get a diet Pepsi out of the [laughter] you know every five yeah\nI mean it was a lot of you know it doesn't does a real sense of at the very center of the story with greed you know that he was very and he liked the money you know and the house\nWas like a hoarders episode like the house was really disgusting but in the house to were boxes of things that had never been opened a lot of shopping you know a multiple things both the same type of thing that would never that ... packaging was never taken office um there were big shoppers\nNow regarding abortion he was convicted of a boarding babies that were born alive yes and convicted of a boarding babies pass the time that the Pennsylvania law allows you to do it\nYes yes but he really he's in prison for three life sentences based on three children that he that were delivered a lifestyle that lived to Christ moved to try to swim toilets um and he he and his staff were were cutting an expert says there's a routine basis\nI'm Talking to and macaroni a she is the co writer and co producer of the movie ... nail the untold story of America's most prolific serial killer not only is it a interesting story about gods now it's also got some mystery to it because it took dean Cain to kind of\nSay what's going on over here and the feds who only cared about the drug violation couldn't give a report about what he was doing a boarding these babies yeah I mean it's incredible ... at the very center of the ... I just kind of mentioned the ... ... detective demoted undercover narcotic suffer he's the one that made this all happened if it wasn't for him\nNone of this would have ever come to light and in fact as you said you know and it's true the FBI and the da ... only focused very much on the drug case\nBut Jim would said what about this woman who died this woman kind of my ... who died why don't we why are we talking about her\nAnd because eventually because of gyms perseverance and they actually ... opened up the ... the the the the homicide investigation into the death ... once you once they did that um are allowed to search for evidence that connection with her death they found everything else\nThe other of course big point of the movie is that initially the mainstream media didn't care about this case yeah it's amazing and the reason I didn't hear about it because it makes them half\nVery unpleasant thoughts about abortion yeah and they don't want to go there\nNo no they don't want anything that might in fact you know real you know have any effect on roe v Wade and this film certainly doesn't and portray a portion of very good like because you get to hear about abortion and you don't hear it for a pro life activist you hear it from two of the you know during the trial too good abortion is to legal abortion is rats on the stand to describe it good abortion\nAnd when they when the jury heard what a good abortion sounded like they didn't see much of a distinction between that and murder\nMhm [noise] um I ask you this before when we interviewed a Gardendale ... regarding the the drug stuff I'm sure he he he's aware that was illegal I'm sure yeah he's got conscious of consciousness of guilt about that but about the abortion I got the impression he didn't make\nYou done anything morally wrong no not at all in fact you know he feels relieved indicated that he was helping the poor women you know that he you know he really is a hero to the poor\nYou know at some level he ... certainly claims that that's the case you know when he I mean even worse by the way and I know we're at Salem Radio station I mean can you imagine he also had\nScripture passages he's giving me scripture passages to justify abortion to justify what he did he's written poetry pruning when one of the poems he wrote pruning and you can imagine that reference he was using that that we need to prove and for things to grow well I mean I really extraordinary but he's\nYou know mad to me he is a complete lunatic but it's all the people that are enabled him to make a make for very chilling reading and very chilling knowledge\nAnd macaroni is my guest she is the co producer of the movie ... the untold story of America's most prolific serial killer I've seen it it is a moving deep disturbing film I urge you all to see it did you ever speak with\nDr Carson yeah I've been in the prison so I spent about three hours with them and um\nYou know he it's it's amazing he actually lives up to all the cliche for the serial killer he's like Hannibal Lecter he has this very soft voice he's very highly educated cheap you know how the whole thing about its hands you'd have to look at how big my hands or his whole thing about a speech which of course becomes very chilling when you realized he cut the future of children and kept majority\nHe sang me twice he touched my leg inappropriate to continuously\nAndme and he has this really soft voice and he has the demeanor is hearing is in prison forever and never going to see the light of day again and freedom and he has a demeanor like he's just come off the golf course he has this very relaxed and he's smiling all the time and but every now and again when I asked him hard questions he would do this kind of\nBrain freeze and go oh you knew about this like in an extremely creepy weight you know so he's yeah he's every kind of creep actually I don't believe your movies showed his wife\nNo that's correct or she wasn't married yes which she aware of what was going on they're not ... not only was she aware of what what what's going on she was involved so in fact it's actually one of the most awful parts or what ... what are we leave her out of the movie\nBecause you couldn't include everything so we'll have to you know the plan yourself to an R. movie and she was one of them I mean and also actually bringing her and makes it really dark because she was involved in what's it called the Sunday babies when the clinic would completely empty of every of all the other workers and he and her\nWould see what they called the most difficult cases which with people up to nine months and we know about that\nAnd because people would see some of the remains the following day and stuff so she actually went to prison ... but only for a short period because she cooperated with the authorities children\nYeah seven children from three different by any of them involved\nNo none of the children involved um seven children three different wives yes\nYeah but none of the children you know in fairness none of the children were involved in the youngest child the youngest child with them with a high school student too and you know with their during the raid on the house\nUh we only have a few seconds left and what is his reputation now in Pennsylvania specifically Philadelphia ... black community was his reputation now\nWell I think you know he he he now has the correct reputation for being a for being an animal in a monster but I Would urge people to go into the movie and they can find a local listings gospel movie dot com and don't be scared don't be scared because I Know you're hearing me failed and stuff but actually that's a lot of that from the book on the worst up in the book the movie it's PG

appreciate it with great see effects Dana Rohrabacher up next I'm Larry Elder Larry over\nAll through all the other [noise]\nCongressmen what about this migrant caravan how big a factor is that\nWell I think that that ties right into what we're talking about was Trump\nPeople begin to understand that we have a guy a tough guy like Trump as our president it gives us some kind of confidence that we're not going to our people our country will not be invaded\nAnd are Democrats or earning or doing nothing but attacking the attacking open other Republicans these folks are their their act as if this invasion of our country does that in fact my own and\nUh the guy earlier Wilder uh as ended up saying that it off or get here or there are here illegally we're going to be giving them Medicare and all these are traveled the benefits will surprise surprise\nWhat we believe that we looked at Latin America we have families what we do anything to get them here\nIf we got the politicians all the time the finance health care and education and other benefits what were the trader on people can't do that we got to be loyal to people like her father my father worked so hard to make sure he had a good education\nAnd they said if I people they went overseas and save up for the Japanese ... but the fact is they loyal to the American family which is a United States every race every ethnic group we are Americans that's shaken a lot of ...\nThat our president is a tough guys watch out for us and some people on the other side of the lines are not watching out for America they have some kind of interest overrides\nMy guess congressman Dana Rohrabacher California forty eighth district he's running for re election in tough district\nYour opponent got the endorsement of progressive Democrats of America and he signed off on every one of the groups or a boost positions on their questionnaire including things like reparations for slavery Medicare for all I mean this guy should be pretty easy to
