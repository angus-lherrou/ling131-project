to show the first the first Fifteen minutes or so and then a story about a ... amber Akeley ac who um\nGot shut down trying to give a speech at American University and I couldn't decide whether to do just finished up here with a story about a John Carroll University up in Cleveland where a kid was called in to talk to the title nine somebody rather\nBecause he complained about a a drag queen show at the school and thought it was stupid or not suitable for a Catholic school\nAnd I guess they gave him a lot of pressure that and then I came across this so I think I'll go with this this is a\nThe Atlantic a guy named so he decide I Hope I'm pronouncing his name right or the\nThe headlines of the story was sports\nCollege sports are affirmative action programs for rich white kids this is where we are\nIs there anything that any is there anything that has not racist in America anymore it's just\nIt's and I and I've been saying this for a long time but there are there are plenty of legitimate cases of this but it's just everywhere every minute every day it's just and and it just doesn't go away and it's the whole the word has become meaningless\nThe even the cars in some cases has become meaningless when it shouldn't because as I said there are legitimate\nOr there are legitimate issues\nBut that is is what he wrote put another way college sports at elite schools or a quiet sort of affirmative action for a fluent white kids and play a big role in keeping those these institutions so stubbornly white an affluent\nA and he goes on to talk about um the fact that you know you have rowing teams in lacrosse teams and they're all made up of white kids\nAs if the there's there's some kind of that was obviously it's white privilege that's involved in it um but it's it's it's it can't just be because it just naturally happens that certain people are attracted to certain things there has to be some evil racism a foot that creates this\nThe drunk period when the uh attempts at

an American issue we don't allow acts of terror we prosecute those when fortunately here\nSo far our our law enforcement split able to prevent and I think that's a big step in and as a positive step so far there's been no injuries that by the way there are injuries because people are going to go down buildings ... flights of stairs and be evacuated so let me tell you something that strikes fear and that's why terrorism statues are written out\nAll the way they are we come back from the break we're going to get updates on what's happening\nIn the situation in Mexico or with we've been advocating for intervention in an appropriate way diplomatically both for for a border confrontation\nWe don't talk more about that we come back from the break we'll also take your phone calls at one

wherever you buy books\n\nBack everybody is a secular here with our team I've been watching it with India ... uh Harry ... director of policy is in our studios in our media center so uh this is what's happened is negotiations going on from what I I've been able to determine and what we're seeing also in the media reports between the United states and Mexico and ... how to handle\nWhat is called the migrant caravan as attorneys are now deeper into Mexico which so far away from the United states but our borders but might say far away a about a thousand miles in some cases some cases Seventeen hundred\nBut uh it's in Mexico and it's just tried determination right now uh as to what to do there is this approach called metering which which slow the flow of migrants the ports of entry\nUh that's one aspect that's being done also negotiations or whether the U.S could deport care than migrants back to Mexico or to their country of origin of process known as return to territory because generally when you seek asylum\nFrom a of a country the first country you get to is generally where you're seeking asylum even back that country would be a safety net for for the asylum seeker\nYeah join the idea is is the first country that you reach in which you feel safe is a country that should be the one that receives the application for your asylum so they started in Honduras Guatemala El Salvador they move north through Mexico\nWhen would seem it would seem very obvious and Mexico should be the first country which asylum and saw it or not the United states so that is a ... that is a correct statement\nOf what the applicable international law is a on this score\nSo I guess the question really becomes here and that's what you look at Harry and that is\nWhat we're calling for when we called for from the outset of this is intervention inside Mexico in cooperation with Mexican authorities and their fears to be that's where some of this is going\nAbsolutely so we have suggested previously at the L. A. C. O. J. that diplomatic negotiations are in essential in resolving this crisis\nWe have suggested that such efforts should be aimed at stemming the flow of migrants slowing them down and finally stopping them before they reach us ports of entry\nOr and so late yesterday CNN reported on negotiations between the United states and Mexico on how to handle the migrant\nA caravan and I'm sure there are additional negotiations in discussions that are ongoing or between light pump pale and his Mexican counterpart\nAnd between the president of the United states and the leader of the Mexican government\nOr so as you correctly suggested Jay or the focus has been discussion so now it's on a process called metering which would indeed slow down the flow of migrants\nThere's some evidence from news reports about the number of migrants has actually dissipated which would be a help for a a an outcome\nUm but uh it's still potentially a future crisis and we need to uh maintain a clear focus on negotiations with Mexico and these other countries\nWe also should continue to place pressure on\nThe Honduran ... or ... or the El Salvador AM's a and the leaders of the Guatemalan government um they receive huge amounts of aid from the United states and I think it's correct\nOr to tell them that there will indeed be consequences if indeed are members of their country ... attempt to migrate illegally to the United states and last by the way I was\nStabbed blush or we should ... uh maintain our focus on the rule of law that individuals who wish to come to the United states as refugees should go through normal channels\nYou know it's interesting you say that Harry because he was one of the things that I I'm I'm I Want to say I'd opportunity to be with a secretary Pompeo interception on Tuesday for um\nA Andrew Brunson and um it was ... and it was a it was beautiful then by the way and and the pastors expresses appreciation again to our audience into media outlets around the country that have have carried has a story and ultimately got resulted God allowed the freedom of ah\nAndrew Brunson and the the you always look at it that way that's always the way I said these are people released from captive\nUm because of what the lord does and um there are people that are still kept and we need to pray for their release too and of course we appreciate everything the administration has done in that regard but\nLet me say this when I was with them you could tell in the state department and this is a these kind of issues are very significant\nVery very significant a and then you take that I think to the next step here and understand that early intervention want to avoid a confrontation at the border Randy to me that is the key issue\nThe whole idea is to prevent a clash that\nCould be bloody that could be horrific that occurs between the United states forces whether it's the armed forces or the border patrol\nAnd these migrants at the border so the thing is that we want to anticipate and intervene before this uh curves thousands or hopefully hundreds of miles before it occurs so that it could be a averted as Harry has mentioned the news reports have\nIndicated the numbers of migrants have fallen to about half of the Seventy two hundred that were originally said to be moving toward the United states\nAnd therefore there has been in attrition which is to be\nReally a we're happy to see that this has happened where they've gone and I don't know we have no idea\nBut at least citizen indicated that there will be less of a confrontation because you've got fewer number of people who are attached to this caravan as it is moving toward the American southern border let me play what a President Trump had to say about this and working\nWith Mexico ... ... is working with us there is a movement toward our country is so and they get here [noise]\nAnd his crew that his around the Salem involved that others will have a whole we can come into the illegal\nSo I think look I we we were early advocates Harry of the intervention issue with Mexico or in country there to see what can be done to avoid a border confrontation\nApps absolutely and that is highly necessary so one of the things that you should do to show true leadership is that you should anticipate\nProblems before they reach a climax before the clash or ups and clearly we have had time we've been gauge in preparation and we've engaged in hope fully fruitful negotiations with the Mexican authorities to avert a crisis\nAnd it's important to know that this crisis was initiated at least in part\nBy individuals left just individuals or in Honduras or who's basically initiated this caravan movement\nA number last week the Trump Administration has engaged hope fully in fruitful negotiations to avert the crisis at us ports of entry and that is necessary because you want to ensure that the integrity of the U. S. borders\nIs a respected\nIn addition you wish to prevent crime ... ... there's evidence on the ground that some of these individuals in the care man are indeed gang members they've engaged in a human trafficking\nAnd so it's from if we look at it this from an American perspective it's absolutely essential that we are Bert\nOn many of the problems arise internally with the Honduran government\nWhat's the Guatemalan government with the el Salvadoran government\nAre they taking affirmative steps to improve the lives of their own people are they using the resources that they receive from the United states government and the American people appropriately\nAnd I think the answer to those questions because at the moment I'm no they are not a balancing the interest of their own people so we should work to ensure\nThat the governments in those countries actually improve the lives of their people or indeed there will be consequences in terms of our adoption in funding from the United states\nSo Pam on Facebook asked this question I heard there's a second caravan which started in Honduras is that true and the answer is yes there's a report right now that another caravan of about a thousand people has started making a point of exit out of Honduras oh that is happening\nOr as well pat on Facebook says if this wave isn't deterred would set a bad precedent of course it does I mean you can't have your borders overrun but again I Want to\nI I think intervention here was smart early in Mexico I think that is the appropriate way that this was going to be handled I Want to close this segment the broadcast turning back to the pipe bomb situation I Want to make a position very clear we believe these are acts of terror\nSome people are saying they really are they real bombs we know if they're if they're not real bombs it would still be acts of terror\nSo let's take the politics out of this and and that's what they said these are acts of terror there they're designed to provoke Tara and there are federal\nAnd state laws anti we've said it months we only got thirty seconds left but said again it is a violation of federal law of course during\nGauging acts such as this and it is also a violation of the law of every state in which these five bombs\nOr whatever they're diseases explosive devices are that can be aggravated assault that could be solved with intend to commit a serious disfigurement Bali disfigurement which isn't aggravated assault 'cause even rise to the level Jay of attempted murder\nAll right we're taking your calls one eight hundred and sixty four three one zero that's eight hundred six eight four thirty one ten we come back to the right where you're for another thirty minutes you're not getting the whole broadcast go to Facebook parents go for a C.

taking your calls at one eight hundred six eight four thirty one to let me they were talking about two things one nine or\n... up a\nBomb scares and I think they do they look like they're coming from the same source or very similar source simultaneously indicates that they are I Want to be very clear I said the beginning of the problem is that at the end of the problem with said again and let's take all the politics out of it these are acts of terror\nUnderstand that these are active during the ... they're designed to provoke Tara and cause harm and when you got it back you wait buildings and do the kinds of things that have to be done here you are guilty of that crime whether the bomb goes off or not and so far fortunately nothing has\nThat's right I mean this is a situation where as we said yesterday on the broadcast\nThis should be completely condemn there's no place for this in the United states of America or we should have ideological debate vigorous debates and disagreements and our country\nAnd but the same time uh to to use this act of violence or attempted to act of violence to send some kind of message which it appears that this is somehow politically motivated I think just to not put those\nPieces together at this point I Would be absurd but that is should be completely condemn that want to make sure it doesn't matter at again who is receiving\nA it is the wrong and in America the person who did this should be prosecuted for the people who did it\nShould be prosecuted to the full extent of the law that means a lot of jail time a lot of time behind bars because there's no place for this in America or American politics\nYou know we get ... used to politics being aggressive and it's a it's a full contact sport in one sense but this isn't ... when you start sending incendiary devices bombs or things like that to a of a group of ... any people in any circumstance but this look look this appears to be\nA mode of we don't know who sent it but there clearly targeting a group of people that have a political connections a political ties are no political people now we don't know who's behind it but we know it's an act of terror and this is again this is not how you engage in discourse in the end I frankly shouldn't do it anywhere but certainly United States of America\nI think you're absolutely right Jay terrorism in the broader sense amounts to the use of violence or threatened violence are largely for political or ideological purposes\nOr there are now over one hundred different definitions of terrorism I'm Out there but terrorism is\nEssentially the deliberate killing or attempted killing of innocent people in order to spread fear\nThrough either the entire population or a portion of the population are essentially what terror does it on leashes intimidation\nUm and this amounts to a clear and unmistakable violation of federal and state law\nAnd the perpetrators should be prosecuted to the full extent of the law and so all Americans should unite behind one conclusion\nThis type of behavior in the United states is unacceptable it's inconsistent with the notion of the rule of law it's inconsistent with the notion that we are a a republic that is governed by constitution that apply equally to everyone\nHere's what vice president Pence had to say\nThese cowardly facts are despicable and have no place in American society\nI Want to assure you we deployed the full resources or the FBI the United states Secret Service and they're working very closely with law enforcement officials who will continue to monitor these investigations and those responsible will leave brought to justice\n[noise] All right we come back from the break we're going to take your calls at one eight hundred six eight for three one one zero encourage you to do that we're gonna be talking about the situation that is right now prevalent in Mexico now reports of a second caravan leaving out of Honduras with about a thousand people\nOr again we've advocated for intervention diplomatically in Mexico or in these countries of origin so that we do we avoid a border confrontation\nI think we have to be we have to make sure we're country look I Am very sympathetic you know I've noticed that it wasn't as broke as I've called for comprehensive immigration reform\nOr immigration system does not work I mean we're we're we're kidding ourselves if we don't think that if we think it's working it's not so we need to do with my grandfather came through Ellis Island and there was a process we have to have a better way but now the technology have better processes but we have to have processes and we have to have laws and in the area where government of loss\nThat is absolutely correct It's also important to note\nBut consistent with reef fashioning our immigration laws because the system is indeed broken we should continue to note that people respond to incentives and to deterrent\nAnd so one of the issues that out there of course is the fact that we indeed do have a largely open border crossing in the southern part of the United states\nAnd so we need to take direct an unmistakable action or to close that particular border and to this incentivize additional caravans from starting in Central America or or elsewhere\nOr I'm going forward or bought at the same time the American people have a role in that and that is to push for a bipartisan consensus a re establishing a our borders All right\nWe're going we're taking your calls and comments we come back in the last segment the broadcasts at one eight hundred

are there's been a ... reports now that a second suspicious package was sent to a Delaware postal facility or a project designated for former vice president Joe Biden you have to take that situation take the situation that you have also and I think this is again\nIf these are we don't know who's responsible for it but they're trying to send some kind of message and that message just here but it's a violation of state and federal law make no mistake about it and then the United states of America we do not have political discourse by pipe bomb\nThis is not the way we do it you could have vigorous disagreements we should not be screaming at people it restaurants we should not be yelling but we should be doing is exercising our constitutional rights\nIn a in a in in civil discourse it can be listen First Amendment free speech says it can be robots uninhabited that's where the language of the Supreme Court but this is not free speech leader acts of terror pure and simple that's\nIt is yes it and and so this needs to be completely condemned as as having no place\nIn America or the American political discourse and I think that the uh this is a blame game that the media is trying to do oh let's be honest there's been a lot of rhetoric on both sides of the aisle here including amongst the media and I think with the president said\nUm everyone together he said everyone at the speech um included him included a path\nSo it's just the other party but also included some media outlets to say you don't call it down um and then at things should improve and we shouldn't have\nSituations like this now we live in a country where we do have freedom of speech and these are politicians could say they've got that same freedom of speech you know they've got a pope it died as some of the bigger than others\nAnd they may say things you don't like they may say things that make your blood boil\nThat's fine in American politics you get to respond and ultimately are we the people as voters or decide who represents us in each of these government positions whether it's\nThe White House whether it's the U.S Senate the Congress state government local government school board is all up to us we vote and there's an election coming up\nVery sued that will impact our Congress and will likely impact a lot of your state government uh as well we don't get into all that all the national broadcast like this but a lot of governors races in in a state houses state Senate races simply races all goes on you need to get out their exercise your right\nTo vote Tracy of Facebook's Jordan you mentioned solving at the border solving the issue at the border what does that look like\nI think that looks like the U.S than having to go through each of these people which is what happened in April so April twenty two year would have ended up started with about Fifteen hundred that was considered big\nThis what are the smallest estimate is thirty six hundred the largest estimate is over ten thousand you would estimate is seven thousand so this is much bigger than will be dealt with in April in April the Fifteen hundred windows down to about five hundred when they reached the border\nThose who were were apprehended at the border one hundred and twenty or so or were arrested immediately for illegal entry so they they had no a right to to enter and no good claimed to make a for asylum or another about about Ninety percent of that remaining group\nA is in the asylum process now so a few hundred\nAre the asylum process I think this organization likely if they do make it to the border with those are down that way too where the people who actually get to the border yeah he'd go through the process may actually have a claim that can be made and by the way that that process takes a long time so that means they got through an initial step\nSo out of five hundred over a hundred were arrested\nAnd are about three hundred so got that through the first asylum process step but imagine that tenfold for us to deal with that is something that I think we have time to prepare for like President Trump said but we should we should get this\nFixed before we're on the border Texas or the border California\nAll right we're taking your calls at one hundred sixty four thirty one ten other comments are coming in as well as Alison Facebook says this is such a tough thing to deal with balancing compassion with keeping our border secure it is and Harry I I don't want to look towards that there were legitimate asylum seekers in there\nBut you gotta you gotta get through that process and and we don't want to not be combat and that's why I Want to avoid a border confrontation\nAbsolutely and so I was a made a very very good point that balance is clearly necessary so we have to balance the interest of the United states in the rule of law the integrity of our borders and are keeping criminals and others I wrote\nA with compassion but the way to do that is to engage in negotiations to prepare\nA ah American officials and Mexican officials to deal with a problem on the ground before the caravan reaches us ports of entry\nAnd so it's essential that we focus on that there is clear evidence from news reporting that the U.S has engaged in some negotiations with Mexico and these negotiations indeed are bearing fruit\nJulian Facebook says thank you for saying to stand up for civil discourse them she says she loves ... as well we appreciate that Julie but we're trying to give you irrational leader and these are both these issues that we dealt with today be suspicious packages that we looked like the pipe bombs being sent to politicians and others in the media\nAs well as the situation ah with the Caribbean and they're very distinct but we we've got to be level headed and how we deal with it but I Want to be really crystal clear on this especially on this issue 'cause I'm hearing these kind of mixed messages from some\nThe the fact is that these are acts of terror legally speaking\nThere's no question under federal and state law these are actually feel to wait for a ... a device to go off before it's an active Tara\nSo these acts are acts of terrorism and that's what we have to remember and and that's what local and federal law enforcement or engage with\n\nFilling in for the\n[noise]\nWhat I'm Talking about our number two very able to show Mark Davis for six fifty a and the answer DFW long distance running around for you yes families from fragile\nFragile close to the edge\nCurrently s dyslexic but the reason for that is it's big John Anderson's birthday John Anderson is Seventy four leaf\nVocalist on obviously venison round about the stuff you've actually hurting and the magnificent four sides of tales from topic graphic oceans there is a mind trip or if you've ever the mood for it and it's funny because if John Anderson Lee vocalist of yeses Seventy four he's only two years younger than McCartney\nAnd he was a Beagle the Beatles very much a sixty is a phenomena yes very much seventies phenomena but you know what\nYou know when they were traveling together the the building blocks of yes Nineteen sixty eight [noise]\nSo I mean the Beatles only been around for like four or five years and and and yes as crushed starting to crank out a progressive rock and value most people's heads explode there in Britain the late the late sixties anyway yes quite quite the record library there already a telephone number is eight eight eight nine seven one said eight eight eight nine seven on said mark\nDavis in Fort Larry Elder\nLet me hit the reset ha tell you where exactly we are and what are my thoughts on some things and then the idea is that you share your thoughts\nAbout some things and we hope that uh that you will do so eight eight eight nine seven ... eight eight eight nine Seventy one real quick as we begin or would you be the first on the movie everybody's talking about before the elections that for the nation national chooses masterpiece is on DVD at about five days\nOctober thirtieth really states or your topic today at destination movie dot com death of a nation movie dot com directed it so you know it's compelling so go get that destination movie dot com\nOkay the mystery packages the story seconds the finger pointing continues and let's make a list\nWhat we don't know and what we know this is how you stay sane throughout this entire thing right now my lists of what we don't know and what we know\nMay differ from yours you may think you know some things that I don't you may think some things that I think I Know are in dispute and that's why we have telephone lines so um do joined us here's what we do not know we don't know who's on these packages okay can we started the most basic we have no idea\nWho set these packages or why\nI and that's where you stub your toe for the first time it's like wait a minute don't we know that this was some expression of hate for for liberal uh iconic figures clearly sent by some nut bag on on the right [laughter] so we don't know any such thing\nYou know is that probably the greatest possibility yeah because we have are not bags to\nKnow that all the left as guys who shoot up baseball fields and and the left has tons of people who uh will shock you ought to a restaurant and claw like zombies the doors of the Supreme Court and do all kinds of other who feels off nonsensical thing we've uh we've we've got our crazy used to\nBe the thing that that started to wrap itself around me when the story first began and and the and the tally of mysterious packages started to grow\nSaid you know doesn't tend to be something we do and\nI and why in the world would it exactly being that's earth logic why would you do it sometimes you send somebody a pipe bomb because you want to kill him but you know ... nothing exploded yet you know what I mean\nAnd I think that it was the one and sources mailbox where the where the the white powder was nothing it was in art now and then by the way that doesn't make it okay if you send somebody something just to scare the or the ... out of them that's that's a terrorist act as well\nSo you don't have to blow up for you to have done something very very illegal\nBut is it okay for you if you keep that uh that hoax antenna primed and dialed in you bet it's okay mine is does it mean I'm declaring it a hoax I'm telling you I Know it's a hoax I noticed the left doing this to the left so that we can you know spread out and have some myth of equivalency\nLike yeah we're changing image we got a lot of restaurants were chasing Ted Cruz at restaurants we got Maxine Waters advocating hooliganism\nBut you have your crazies do if you're trying to kill the Clintons and the Obamas and Joe Biden and Robert Deniro you people are just like us yeah\nNo we're not okay\nBecause even if even if we do find that this is one conservative lunatic you know what that is one conservative lunatic\nWe have more to be sure but um it it's not our rank and file really hopped up activists who are out and doing things that countless thousands of leftist are doing\nAll the time there is no comparison so the thing that we don't know is who did this and why we do not know\nHere's what we do know a media culture that hates Trump's God's will do anything to tag him with this bad story\nAnd that is why you actually get I mean I I heard Wolf Blitzer I was kind of funny I was getting out of the car dollar into serious actually I'm In the car will split you're talking to some congressman or so and so we know we have CNN just if you never have the president's ear tell them that we we really try to get things right and we're not involved\nIn fake news like will shut up dude it's pathetic it's sad I mean they've got a great idea of you and John Lennon you know want to go you know build a tree house in the backyard and have a a club meeting why don't you decided to start covering things barely covering things honestly lose the corruption fire Jonah costs to get your act together\nYou know lose the Trump Grange wouldn't syndrome and become a real news organization because the the cries of fake news are real and deserved and valid an\nAccurate and I'll just try a ball round mess and I'm going to your calls\nEight eight eight nine seven one said eight eight eight nine seven ...\nHas a question hangs from the rafters\nShould the president dial back his rhetoric in view of the there's this package story or blah blah blah blah blah\nShort answer is no\nThere is nothing nothing in President Trump's rhetoric that somehow necessarily lead to somebody doing something like this even if it is a nut job conservative there is zero connection to be made there none by thinking people\nBut by people who have had a bug up there but about Trump since the day he won there's plenty of material and they're going to use it and they're going to hammer it and they're going to bludgeon it and you know what it's going to backfire to\nJust like Kevin are just like the caravan desk is going to backfire too you don't think voters are paying attention today say wait a minute what now this\nFirst we have ... media apologist planted it embedded with the caravan trying to uh uh characterize it as as some noble pursuit\nAnd we have what the media and Senate Democrats did in the cabinet debacle and now they're taking this very\nAdmittedly unfortunate and scary story of devices showing up at a at some Democrat mailboxes and they tried to blame Trump forward are you kidding me this will make people crawl on broken glass to vote\nRepublican so please keep it up guys please keep it up [noise] we're in San Diego hey Sean Mark Davis into Larry how are you doing\n... good ... all good thank you\nI Want to call in and and respond to that they fought back and take just a moment to your child I'm\nSorry you had a caller calling talking about he had two former electorate can well are you getting what\nThey write a novel by America read that propaganda running and not only that probably\nThe ones who knows that propaganda it's it's an anecdote it's an anecdotal stories from a caller and I think at at at face value as a little bit of a grain of salt\nI mean any but that that type of thing didn't spread out your your list okay time very ... on the guy said the Mexican they're going to this guy\nSo he said he said I don't want to do make up something I didn't say he he he he told a story about a couple of guys that he had conversations with he's completely entitled to share that story as are you as a mind\nAnybody anybody taking from Atlanta traveling anybody extrapolating from outside the hall of Mexicans who joined the military overthrow as well that would be stupid for them to conclude that [noise]\nWell I I mean with this is what this is what happened with this is called the thing over and over again that happened you have Donald Trump who who would think oh hey Democrat which which which I Will break a losing\nBet that just are you telling me that he shouldn't shares opinion about that are you telling me he said he thinks it's a witch on various zero evidence of collusion that is his opinion and he can say it every day and some people can get some people can not like it\nBut don't try to Muslim people or you you say whatever you want all the whatever I Want other callers will president well freedom of speech membrane which all judge what like a basic cable [noise]\nAh [noise] when you get it wrong by it always comes back to bite [noise]
