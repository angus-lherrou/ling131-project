whatever message she was selling was working for sure\nTalking to a room and stuff in the Washington Post a couple more minutes you're Roman um\nHow much does a support this dark and have you would think I'm hearing what you're saying here today and when I read in that um in in your story that you know how can a guy ever come back to the job but there's also some support out there for them isn't there\nYeah he's got a ton of support he's he's he's got a lot of support from um you know the the the community of Iran a ranking boosters are\nOr who have come out and supported him over the past few weeks I don't think are nudging um I think there's a lot of people that believe that he has been made out to be a scapegoat in that\nUm that that that that this didn't fall on and then and I think at the end of the day when the wall to report came out last week and we heard about all of the things that contributed in Jordan McNair stats\nThe one thing that made it really clear with that commission was um where at least president low spoke a damning evidence spoke athletic director and Ron Walters spoke to a guy who architect at the um the report is is that\nYou know this did fall on a DJ darkness fell on the strength of conditioning staff in the medical staff I'm so there was a clear effort I I Believe um to to try to shift for at least try to not blame DJ a jerk and for the death of Jordan McNair now\nThat we will wait and see what this investigation reveals whether I'm the best gators to side or the commission decides that there was a toxic culture there wasn't a toxic

to chew on those things out but the bottom line is that I'm In the program remains in limbo you know the border regions are supposed to meet on a October nineteenth which is still\nA ways away um we believe that that might be\nThe timeframe or the tide area which decisions are made on DJ ... um and and possibly other uh ... uh people involved at the university their fate or whether that's\nPresident low or yeah like director David Evans um there's been speculation that are so\nUm we don't exactly know what that timeline looks like at this point we know that the ... and it's supposed to wrap up a pretty soon within the next week or so um and and obviously all the findings will determine or do you do there and said and the direction of the football program\nI got ten seconds just can you tell me or would you bet on him getting his job back\nYou know I think I think\nI don't see I don't envision a DJ there can be able to come back um but obviously that's that's not for me to weigh in on um I I think he has a lot of sports I also think that with the death of Jordan McNair\nUh it just it it just seems so unlikely to me that you'd be able to come back and and be

I Want to get into the specifics of what that allegation are but everybody saw much like the allegation at the Yale University\nA event party and those allegations proved to be true which is no evidence of and other than the one witness I mean that's one that's ... if that ends up being cooperated subject to review instill and is credible what do you think that does to the nomination\nWell I think the nomination is in deep trouble and I think at this point in time it's very possible to speculate\nThat that allegation a remains a the most serious hurdles to his confirmation\nUh it's important to realize that Rebecca Mitchell the prosecutor who ask questions at the hearing suggested that no reasonable prosecutor would bring a case against judge Kavanaugh based on the testimony of the two witnesses last week\nSo I think if there is some ... corporation with respect to the second allegation and uh that could pose a a real hurdle for judge Kavanaugh that's if in fact there's cooperation absolutely absolutely huge question\nYeah and I think one of the most interesting things about Mitchell's report to the Republican Senate and she sent all the Republican senators and she said that this is a matter of he said she said but\nThis case is even weaker than that in her report that isn't very telling statement about how she views of the witnesses that have come forward\nBut ... year when you've got to the Democrats are looking to stop this nomination let's be clear none of these ... none of the Democrats maybe but on the committee ... especially we can get talking about individual Democrats than a minute and on the Senate but nobody on this committee was going to be voting for capital before this happened\nAbsolutely not they'd already announced their opposition to him so ah it's they're going to vote no in the committee that we're going to vote no on the floor of the U.S Senate or there's a handful of Democrats left I think basically it's Joe mansion\nHeidi Heitkamp I mean I I'm not even sure who else pass that I mean because you had Joe Donnelly come out and say no no I don't know if the FBI change\nIt's possible that this FBI investigation has changed the mind to reopen a few of those uh a moderate Democrats or read the I ... I saw a red state Democrats in a moderate like Doug Jones in Alabama is does this change his mind if the FBI comes back\nAfter the potential to vote or we will see\nBut so far I think it comes down to Lisa Murkowski and Susan Collins maybe Joe Manchin the as I don't think you get Susan Collins without Lisa Murkowski and vice versa I I Can't imagine\nOne of the voting yes one voting no so yes Joe ... could be important to get a kind of over the line with a Democrat and I'd have to have my\nYou see any democratic support right now do you think the Joe mentioned doing it\nOnly if this report comes back crucial clean and that would be a ... and because of internal pressure and he would do it only if Murkowski and talents were there so it was already over the line\nSo he's not doing anything to get the nominee there I don't think he would be the vote to confirm Brett Kavanaugh let me say if if it came out to him now but he's not going to make the calculation that way\nAnd he had he said I agree with your announcing mentioned is going to be the one that pulls the trigger for Kavanaugh I think if he sees that the Republican senators Murkowski and Collins or going form then you'll throw his hat in that direction\nLet's go ahead and take a phone call one eight hundred and sixty four thirty one ten if you want to talk to us on air\nYeah let's go to Phil in New York are talking about a little bit but we can talk to us off in New York on line one feel welcome to Jay ... if I feel\nLike it very much appreciate it very much anticipated my question my question was going to be I think there's any chance whatsoever that even one democratic senator will vote for confirmation\nI think what they did what we just said is right I mean if ... if he was the deciding vote probably not if it's already fifty one votes their email because it helps them in the Senate seat how close is that Senate seat in Virginia West Virginia right now I Know it was\nI think he's looking to rock the boat there I think he's got an okay lead and okay lead a similar as you say you pull it gets you vote against a reward nominees for President Trump and um those Trump voters come back ... same thing you think are saying but I think not maybe not a\nIt's a I think now they can all rely on this report but they will not be the votes to get him across the line so it's not like Heidi Heitkamp\nIn Joe mastering uh come saving this if Susan Collins and Lisa Murkowski vote no yeah and I'm like you're not going to be the the ... the the fifth\nUm or even the the forty to fifty votes so that a vice president Pence could be the fifty first vote I'm Jamaican she's got a nine percent lead right now he says so he's not going to do with the the rock that you don't want to get into five percent\nSo because it becomes a whole different issue for the national parties when you started dropping lower than that to he's right on the line of it should be a pretty easy race unless you awake in some Trump\nBase there they get so upset with you I don't know but if something comes back about him\nWhich is why is he is looking at I don't think that that awake his face I think that the nomination gets both\nRight now matches up by nine percent but I'll tell you something\nThat could swing down to five percent pretty quickly I got a real race or let's take another phone call one eight hundred sixty four thirty one time yeah Mary Ellen in Illinois on line for Mary Ellen welcome to Jason ...\nEveryone I question that this thing on we've evolved and saying this many teeth that the FBI carrot sticks so why are we wasting time going through this again let that get like\nWell I ... the first of all ... states something they don't have the authority to investigate it as a crime but any they do have an authority to investigate it as a background check that emphasis\nThat's exactly what it is this is not a federal crime this is a state crime in other words it as a state\nBased if in fact he is a has committed an offense than it's under the laws of the state in which he committed these offenses allegedly\nBut this is being done not as an investigation of a federal crime which it is not and cannot be but as a background investigation of a nominee to the Supreme Court and that's how he the FBI gets there a presence into this case\nNow that that what's that means that this is not a criminal investigation no so this is not a situation where a file is an open at a U.S attorney's office and the case moved to determine whether he qualifies for background to be on the court\nAnd I think what's happening right now you've got allegations you've got to that they're considering they're not reviewing the one raised by my carbon out each client\nThe reviewing the two now you've got Dianne Feinstein saying the White House and the FBI should release details on the scope of the cabinet background investigation keep Congress in foreign run any changes this needs to be a real investigation must get all the facts\nAfter they order the FBI investigation same Senator Chris Murphy of tweets yeah of course there should be an FBI investigation but whenever they fight doesn't change the fact\nThe cabinet especially after his performance yesterday is the most dangerous Supreme Court pick of our lifetime that I'm just saying so for the mainstream Democrat in the party not the moderates not even the most live which is a mainstream Democrat there is no moving them they don't care about the FBI report that was just the delay tactic\nLike and he said to hopefully have more pile on something else\nOr ... and uh and and this idea I mean uh Debbie said are they trying to get the judge to go through another hearing a publicly I think they said sure\nIf it delays it I mean that's what I'm saying they will take anything to delay this because they lay it to make it a political issue of the midterms\nUm they think that that's a benefit to them they're making that calculation that this is a political benefit for Democrats to continue this process on I think that it's the FBI's heads to an extent that does that but do not expect whatever they find even if it's positive for Brett Kavanaugh to influence a single Democrat\nBut we also know process wise if that's what it is his ... nomination goes is that the floor of the Senate now yeah it's the for the ... FBI report you come out you've got but you've got to release the vote could be\n\nYeah so there's yeah I mean this is where it's ... percent territory said during the break but for everybody was on the air right now I mean it it would finish our first half hour this is this is not like there's some rule book for this exactly is the president just said in a press conference literally while we're on the air um you know they're they're handling this is how this is what the city is requesting\nUh and then the White House has ordered its so it's it's not what Dianne Feinstein is requesting that was what the Republican leaders they leave the Senate it's with their request yeah\nWe've got a lot more we're going to be here for thirty minutes if\nYou don't get the full hour the broadcasters go over to Facebook periscope\nA or a C.

B. I. investigations three oh two sets the name of the form number do not reach conclusions they don't say and therefore we believe that or we recommend that that's not what it does it simply sets out facts\nAs they ... as the agent and they're usually two agents by the way who interview these witnesses not just one but two agents who go in interviews these witnesses and come up with the three oh two that they then give to their supervisor it is reviewed and then it is set up the channels and eventually will reach the White House\nBut that's what they're supposed to do and I hope these field agents who are doing this do the right job and and our faithful to their task of finding facts as they are and don't do the things that FBI agents in the past on this program we've talked about doing\nAll right let's go right to the phones Jennifer calling from California on line one Jennifer welcome to Jason ... Jennifer go ahead you're on the air\nJake thank you for keeping your arm to process by which I think it's going on but I have any of that it\nBrings out for their allegations there's no other are there in the cabinet\nThat's right so he's already cleared committee so that was part of the deal they will continue the investigation but declared committee so he's out of committee it's the floor of the Senate\nThe question will be if there is no cooperating evidence of the allegations I think he goes to the floor and I think he's confirmed if there is cooperating evidence of the others I think then and that that's a credible credible cooperative evidence\nThen I think it raises a different issue wouldn't go back to the committee though it's still on the floor of the Senate yeah that's right I mean there's so much the committee really work is done although reporter probably\nGo to the committee which are kind of could I mean this is a heated Vancouver and back but I I think if you're at that point\nThe nomination has pulled 'em that's not up to the Senate now they can inform the White House White House would make that decision ultimately\nUm uh we we've got to a well we'll take this we come back causes it about you know how the vote to work will explain all that we come back\nFrom the break if you want to talk to us on the air to one hundred sixty eight four thirty one twenty a hundred and sixty four three one zero but this this will drag out at least through the week yeah I think we're going to be covering this most of the week I'm going to be on the other news will cover it I'll report may get Reno nevada report finish ... there's a chance is released to the committees\nAre and to the Senate and it's a relief to the public\nAnd if there's no cooperating evidence I think he goes forward on a boat now whether they'll do the vote Thursday or friday or Wednesday at the Senate will decide what to look that ... that investigation is winding down Clarence Thomas into getting two or three days what kind of in the same point here\nOh or or or college that decided to do something different I just don't think that it you cannot allow any Democrats to come to the rescue\nOf Brett Kavanaugh it's it's a it's so this is solely going to be a Republican decision let's be honest about it can Mitch McConnell um do what Chuck Grassley cannot which just keeps Republican majority together Chuck Grassley\nYou could not ... on friday that majority was not there\nI mean because Jeff Flake said unless you do what I say I'm going to vote no on this and wonder if it would\nHave been voted down in committee which technically doesn't stop it but I Would have been so a Jeff Flake was able to be in control this is the senator who's not even not even running for reelection retiring and he's a he's going out and making this\nAfter he made a statement saying it was ... he gets persuaded by the Democrats that's why I don't trust anyone in the situation right now I'm the longer it goes on I think the tougher gifts and less this FBI report just goes back and makes them look foolish but now we're we're going to see for them is that wasn't enough\nYou know ... they were looking to enough so it don't matter will be another project like it should it should be but it less he's he has to sit there for ten more hours and have people yelling at his face I'm someone who has no political\nA bone to enter this he's done he's retiring so um he decided to put himself out there in this role which was kind of weird for someone retiring or but he also I think a a has faced this onslaught for Democrats here is what if it comes to a drawing the nomination or to be defeated what\nHappens in well the president would it ... the way it would work is exactly what everybody said Mitch McConnell\nWould make a call the president saying I don't have the votes and that does not appear to be the case right now we don't have the votes in that point normally would withdraw the nomination\nOr they could make a go forward on political grounds but if it's enough that they couldn't get the Republicans are I don't think they would [noise] and then he president makes it not listen to another constitutionally makes another nomination that they will have another role of advice and consent you'll have a a justice Supreme Court term for a while\nWhich never great but that's just that's just the nature of what it is All right we're going to last the broadcast we've got a couple of lines coming over here and there are give us a call at one eight hundred sixty four thirty one to an even if you get a ... keep throwing back\nWe'll try to get to calls on we've opened up a couple of lines for you at one eight hundred sixty four three one one zero went through some questions on Facebook will get some new ones in the\nUh in the hopper here some of them were were back on we're also going to get some information on the time when we come back from writing\nBack on

met his year coal aid for for forty three Bible that's eight four four forty three Bible ooh\n[noise]\nAll right we are the last thing with the broadcast for taking your calls the one eight hundred and sixty four thirty one ten we will take the calls in the order that they've come in let's go ahead and take one next yeah Matt calling from California on line one that well could adjacent you'll live I met\nAt a high so I had a comment and that is not something I've seen the Republicans really organized while around but I actually think that a genius move by the Republicans I'm you know flake aside not running for reelection and everything like that but\nThe thing the denser screaming for at that all that friday here and what they wanted it FBI investigation and they did it really kind of quick at the end flake kind of came up Grassley said OK and flake said I'll take a week or maybe less and that's what\nAnd you heard Democrats or Democrat it we thought that spoke say this is exactly what we ... we want this FBI thing and then they close the hearing and they moved it out and and now it's going to go to a boat and we all know that no one's going to change their mind records not come back because you it's so hard to prove a negative so this is the one thing you are going to do is you're going to get all\nThe that cloud that would have been over\nOn Capitol if he got in for me like the Republicans just pushed through they didn't care it's like\nNo they did it they let the FBI and they\nGave it to say that all metal mouth that the problem here is they're going to say that's not enough Merriam periscope rights was Blake more free to make these moves since he isn't running for Senate again\nAnswer yes he has to answer to the Republican primary or base and and he was going to lose the primary that's why he's retiring let's be honest it's kind of was gone he was going to be primary out of the U.S Senate\nAh so he decided to retire instead of a face that loss um so I I Do believe listen I I agree with Michael to an extent I think that the American people which can certainly influence\nAnd how the skills I mean these are elected officials either politicians that's that's the point the American people may agree if this report comes back super clean\nThat the Democrats look foolish for vote if they're going to keep complaining so it may be enough for the American people that's what we've said if this report goes back clean Democrats lose likely Rand probably look foolish if\nThey continue to pound their their fish it's not enough of an FBI investigation ... this this evidence now that Brett Kavanaugh has gone through a they've got specific names to go for they've got specific individuals so look to time period to look at\n'em especially the the this allegation out of jail or they know when it was where it was supposed to have occurred who is alleging it and uh and then who would have been in the building I mean they could have gone they could go through so\nUh if there's nothing there may be that the American people say enough you know this and I think that's the best case for for Brett Kavanaugh and for Republicans to get their majority together\nAll right let's go ahead and take calls one eight hundred and sixty four thirty one ten who's next Jodie in Kansas online for Joni welcome to Jay sexual alive or Joni\nAll your\nLife when the I investigated and yeah and that there is not more evidence or the evidence whether there'll be a ... week course to Dr Ford\nNo here's what I think's going to happen I think they're going to say they're not going to call Dr Ford Andy a liar or that you said there was no evidence cooperating Dr Ford's allegations that's all they're going to say\nThat's right if you look at the report the this Rachel Mitchell who was\nHired by the Republicans did the case she says is incredibly difficult to prove\nIs even weaker because she identified a other witnesses to the event and they either refuted or allegations or didn't corroborate them a reasonable prosecutor would not bring she said this is Mitchell says is a reasonable prosecutor would not bring this case\nUh to trial based on the evidence before the committee and she said that you couldn't even get a preponderance of\nThe evidence standard which is the civil standard much less beyond a reasonable doubt so and I tend to agree with her she was not the most uh you know colorful prosecutor\nOr exuberant prosecutor I've ever seen\nWhat was it was a well yeah I made that up it was not goes cracked up and broken up doing statements made but but I understand what you're saying All right let's take another call\nYou have a large from Texas on line three law or what could have Jay sexual ...\nThank you thank you very much a guy from John and I really appreciate you know I just think real quick payment in fact I think what we saw some Kavanaugh's anger with a little bit more than what everybody saying I Believe that he felt the weight of the whole ... oh yeah they knew that what's going on now to\nNot just tell from not just you know good and bad and he said she said that the weight of the whole system\nWell look this is his career I mean this man that was a he sits on I thought those two things that he said that we're meaningful and pointed to me to listen to things that he loves doing coaching and teaching and based on these allegations you wouldn't be doing either and that area's a pretty strong statement for someone that sign of British thoroughly reputation for the last twenty five years absolutely\nSo judge Kavanaugh has been the subject of a sustained and relentless attack\nFor months it's important to realize that Senator Feinstein withheld this allegation this accusation four months before bringing it forward just for the nomination was going to be voted on\n... and yet there is no credible evidence at least to this point in support of the specific allegation made at the hearing last week\nA and as I understand it there's no support for the allegation made with respect to the nominees alleged conduct at Yale\nThese well that's what they're investigating absolutely but it's also important to remember a bad however the FBI investigation comes out\nA particularly if the nominee is cleared\nThis will not be enough for the Democrats now because they're afraid of ... a judge Kavanaugh's judicial philosophy which does not accord with their preferences\nThere particularly afraid that he might limit for instant access to abortion in the future he may not necessarily support the creation of rights which are not rounded in the constitution this is what the Democrats actually opposed\nHead of yours for following who's been ready to DC for politically correct attention dismayed learn so

what he did talk to women if if they answer\nThese questions in a thorough investigation concludes that have these allegations are not true then we should all move on but if these questions are not answered because the president limited the investigation what we're not help was\nIn the house or just have a Supreme Court with the justice who has all of these allegations still circling around and
