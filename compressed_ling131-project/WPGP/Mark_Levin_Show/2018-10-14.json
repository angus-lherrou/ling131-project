the probably the cabinet member who is the most respected although the United nations ambassador is not typically a cabinet level position but of the\nTop officials in the Trump Administration to people on the left she probably is the most popular\n... certainly think and that's quite on the curb of course\nYou know my family my ... at the same and um my pin little ones I adore them entertain us un yeah they sacrificed a lot they put a lot of time and energy\nInto it [noise] um but and they have a lot of heart and really wanted to make America a proud and so with that I'm not leaving\nUntil the end of the year my goal is that we make sure that everything is in this place and um for the next in Vassar to come in but it's a great day in the United states and I'm proud to then part of the team now I don't have anything we sat on where I'm going to go I think\nThat um the main thing was\nI was governor for six years and we've dealt with a hurricane a thousand year ... shooting a school shooting there was a lot and then to come in and just getting years out of\nRussia and Iran and North Korea it's been eight years of intense John and I'm a believer in her mind that I think you have to be resolved with enough to know when you step aside and allow someone else to do the jobs so\nThey can survive in a lifetime and I will tell you\nThis um if are all in here that are going to ask about twenty twenty no I'm not running for twenty twenty\nI can promise you what are we doing it's campaigning for this one so I'll look forward to supporting the president I mean I actually\nWanted to do this because Nikki Haley ambassador\nTo the United nations has been very special to me she's done an incredible job\nShe's a fantastic person\nVery important but you also is somebody that gets it and she has been at the United nations from the beginning with us from the beginning and work with us so they can say that it's been really a long time very intense and she told me probably six months ago she said you know\nMaybe at the end of the year the end of a two year period for the end of the year\nI Want to take a little time off a little but she's been a very successful\nYou know governor of South Carolina\nFor years and then she uh she did this and this is possibly the more in tune with what's going on in the world very dangerous\nIn lots of things [noise] but she's doing a fantastic job and we've done a fantastic job together we solve a lot of problems or one of the process of selling a lot of problems at the beginning of\nNorth Korea was a massive problem and now we're moving along move it along really nicely I can speak for\nSecretary of state Mike Pompeo is things in the world of nicotine and so we're all we're all happy for you and one way for we have to lose hopefully you'll be coming back as someone\nWho is this is going to be a different capacity to that effect but uh I just want to let you know so at the end of the year Nikky will be leaving and they will be in constant touch I Know that whenever you have an air there's you're going to vote for you know all the players\nThat that was doing the thing I think she did best in the United nations she got to know the players [noise] she got to know in China Russia India she knows everybody very first surveys are they like it\nExcept for maybe a couple of normal rustic at all likely but they do they really like editing maybe more importantly their respective [noise] so they just wanted to tell you that we will miss you oh at least we can all the time but we will miss you never do is have you done a fantastic job but I Want to thank you very much [noise]\nNow are competing friends in the media really really really wanted her to leave you know how to suggest that she was not happy with a boss like Donald Trump\nInstead she thanked him she was grateful\nShe said she intends to campaign for him and twenty twenty no intention to run against him and twenty twenty to primary\nSpoke respectfully\nIsn't interesting how people leave the Trump Administration this turbulent chaotic administration in space such nice things about it\nAnd as for why I Believe she's leaving her that she just burned out like a difficult job and he's difficult boss he's demanding he puts a lot of stuff in the box and I think a lot of people can't keep up the man sleeps four or five hours a night\nHe's frenetic he wants to accomplish a lot and I think for people to have to do the stuff he wants to do with a lot of work a lot of pressure\nProbably two years under this president it's like four years on any other president people come and people go there's a story about two new rock knew the legendary coach of no reading\nAnd he was ill once you get an assistant coach the game in the in the system won and won pretty handily in the new rock and he admitted to one of the seniors that the college that it bothered him that uh this assistant won the game in his dead\nAnd to me and said well we're all useful but none of us is necessary\nAnd that includes president United States\nThe sun is going to rise in the eastern said in the west irrespective of what happens we keep going [noise] people come in people go in the midst ration\nAnd those who don't like the administration always looking for the ulterior reason didn't appear to be an ulterior me and she said she doesn't have another job so parents he does not have an offer that's substantial she decided to quit I think she just wanted a break all that travel all that stress\nPresident to always complain about how the NATO countries and not a pony up the amount of money to exposed to this president complain\nAnd did something about it [noise] great job Nikki Haley triple late nights every one is a teachable late nights every once in a two or three I'm\nLarry Larry Elder all through all the other [noise]\nSenate if somehow broken over those is simply that awkward prime\nMinister later those things have happened but this is a different order and Democrats are pointing not only as a way this was handled by in the history of partisanship on the Supreme Court your decision to block Merrick Garland a is something they see as a as having kicked off a new stage in the partisanship associated with the Supreme Court nominees\n'cause I don't know much history you have to go back to Eighteen eighty to find the last time a Senate controlled by a different party from the president\nConfirmed a Supreme Court justice to a vacancy created in the middle of a presidential election\nThey also conveniently forgotten the Joe Biden said Nineteen Ninety two when he was chairman of the ... the Democrats control\nThe Senate Republican in the White House if a vacancy occurred they wouldn't fill it also conveniently forgot that Chuck Schumer and Harry Reid Eighteen months before the end of Bush forty three set up a Supreme Court vacancy occurred they wouldn't\nFill it with either ...\nRight but Mr later I don't think that's right in Nineteen fifty six Eisenhower nominated Brennan and made for Congress was a Democrat controlled and also on the Biden Rule Joe Biden was talking in the abstract there was no nominee no nominee was locked and he said to\nNot have the nomination come up before the election but that it couldn't come up after the election and so a Democrat\nSay when they hear you doing this as they say he's creating new rules designed to do what he wants to do and as you've written in your book the long game when you do that it actually hurts democracy\nYeah well that's not exactly the thought at all what happened John you're you're completely miss controlling what a lot I gave you is the history of this I Know the history of this I've spent a lot of time on this throughout my career what I did was entirely consistent with what the history of the Senate it's been in that situation going back to Eighteen eighty\nSo John Dickerson the CBS says no you're wrong because the Democrats approved an election year Supreme Court nominee in Nineteen fifty six John King of CNN\nThey also conveniently forgotten the Joe Biden said and Nike nodded to when he was chair of the Judiciary Committee Democrats control the Senate Republican in the White House it was back in the uk or they wouldn't fill it\nI don't think that's right in Nineteen fifty six an hour nominated Brennan the data for Congress was a Democrat controlled and also on the biting rule Joe Biden was talking in the abstract there was no nominee no nominee was blocked\nAnd I thought at all what happens ... you're completely misconstrue and whatever\nI'm a college right on the history of Eisenhower gave a recess appointment in Nineteen fifty six the formal nomination\nFor that it didn't happen until after the presidential election year than McConnell is right or the diesel [laughter]\nBy this or what have you always had a Republican president\nDwight Eisenhower to deliver it will be
