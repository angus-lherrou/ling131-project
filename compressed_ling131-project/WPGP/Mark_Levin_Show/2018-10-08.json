I think it was um bill and Hillary are going to go on tour in twenty Eighteen and twenty Nineteen first of all\nI'm guessing you got to buy a ticket so and and and I looked at the schedule and the schedule the store the tour and we'll start in Las Vegas\nAt the park theatre and then they will travel to Toronto Montreal and Texas before the end of twenty Eighteen the tour will start back up in April of twenty ninth team with events in New York Michigan Pennsylvania\nConnecticut the district of Columbia British Columbia Washington and California ticket run ticket prices you've already talked ticket\nThis is just you gotta be kidding me the [laughter] six\nHundred and Ninety nine dollars now the least expensive tickets to some of the events were around Seventy dollars and says you're a ... this was surprising though isn't it a Clinton's spokesman did not respond to a request for comment on how much the Clintons will be paid for the tour\nWhat is wrong with these people and they just stay home\n... ... ...\n... I mean look it's I I Know they'll be traveling on well no they couldn't possibly travel on a charter a jet because that would be bad for the environment so they'll probably like a regular airline and you know regular plain and uh\nThey wouldn't dare to a private jet to these things would they\nAre but anyway there that's what that's the that's where they're going to be going but you know how grueling it is to be on a tour of like a musician that go in in one plane and out and back to the airport at all why what is it for them there she's Seventy one and he's Seventy two\nBut not that that should prevent them from doing anything 'cause I'm the same age but but and I I I'm sure I could handle a tour like that if I decided I wanted to go on\nBut what's wrong with these people can't and and can't they just go away she she must be running for president because there's there's there's no\nOther explanation for doing anything this ridiculous and\nI I Hope it comes to Pittsburgh so just so I can try to find somebody who's willing to pay six hundred and Ninety nine dollars\nTo listen to that BS that's going to come from them for a couple of hours from up on a stage anyway just keep that in mind plenty of good seats available check go on line at a somewhere for a Clinton's I'm\nAn evening with the Clintons\nYou know what they probably haven't spent an evening together in the last twenty five years until now then they're going to tour and act like\nThey're they're um Ozzie and Harriet who who you have no idea that that is do you do you do okay Arun does\nAnyway Steelers finally a looked like they're supposed to look beat the Atlanta Falcons yesterday uh Ben Roethlisberger only to the ball twenty nine times when he does that\nOr their chances of winning or seemed to go up but not because he's not playing well or is not a good quarterback but that just shows with something else was happening which means they're not behind and they're running the ball which are Connor did yesterday so they look good they played a bad team at home and beat him up which is what you're supposed to do\nJay apparently it's like they're going to yeah it is and I don't think that's I mean we saw the the most recent polls for instance when they're very tight race in the Senate in\nAh Tennessee where Marsha Blackburn until British in a very popular democratic governor of the state of Tennessee were basically neck and neck and over the ... most recent polls from CBS News which is a not skewing conservative but all she's up plus eight\nI understand there's other polls coming out that could mean plus eleven or twelve tomorrow you starting to see double digit leads yeah that's right I mean such big changes are occurring\nIn light I think that you've got yes it may have encouraged that the liberal base but I think the broader presidents right the broader Republican base a base that doesn't always unite around uh just President Trump comes together over Supreme Court nominations certainly it's one of the main issue seen Republicans that may have just heard that spells trouble for Democrats\nSo this is what we want to know from you what does the cabin on confirmation mean for you literally will take your calls eight hundred and sixty four thirty one day and that's one eight hundred and sixty four three two one zero back in the morning moment [noise]\nEmail fishing in the cockpit burying aren't really in real terms beta law and brain damage Asian emails are hard to get the message appear to be a legitimate I'm backing employee\nIntroducing barracuda fish lined a groundbreaking ... ... ... email ... interactive training reinforce that continue ... transform your employees from a liability into in line at the bottom good apparently they got ... ... pm to learn or [noise]\n\nWrong gas everyone I was out in ah Arizona over the weekend and spoke at a big crisis pregnancy center a banquet and uh it was the day of the confirmation there was a Saturday when Brett Kavanaugh is confirmed and that was very interesting to see the reaction of the\nFolks there he's now hearing cases so every case it's forward he will be a part of so they will hear cases oral arguments closed doors closed today they'll hear oral arguments tomorrow so uh that's moving forward having said that\nThere's already been a pivot and I want to kind of set this up and we'll go take some phone calls and we want your comments about this there's been this pivot since his confirmation we told you went through the pages they couldn't get it into pays for\nBaseball would have been run out the clock for three more weeks a politically that was what they were trying to do but it just was not work but couldn't they got the phase one base to and that was stopped at face three is that a fair way to say it man\n[noise] [noise] yeah absolutely I think they tried everything as they could Jay but ultimately they the Republicans held in the Senate they only last Lisa Murkowski on the final vote and how many times and we said on this broadcast if the Republicans could deliver fifty votes the Democrats could try anything they wanted and it wasn't going to stop them\nOnly losing Lisa Murkowski a ensured that did the judge Kavanaugh was going to be justice Kevin ... and then J I think it took about thirty seconds after the Republicans delivered that fiftieth vote and Susan Collins speech that Joe mansion said he was also a yes or it was essentially J uh fifty one forty nine margin and going through and\nI think it's important actually I think this is a good call the tickets were while we're talking about this margin gym in New Hampshire as a direct\nQuestion on line three Jim welcome to chase ... gym\nLike\nWe still don't like to ski\nAll right so let's talk about that go ahead oh what happened was one of her ... Republican colleagues Steve Danes who voted yes on culture and Murkowski voted no on culture and and that's what she would be a no vote on Brett Kavanaugh or her Republican colleagues Steve days\nWas a yes vote and would have a bit of a yes vote on Kavanaugh his daughter was getting married and he's from Montana a senator from Montana on that Saturday if he had to he uh he was going to fly back to vote a but out of a out of just a nice cities there she knew that\nTheir votes would cancel each other out anyway so when affected nomination so she could vote present so she was still registry her opposition uh didn't but that is why she did not vote no she would have voted no Steve dangerous they're so was it like she was doing a favor for Brett Kavanaugh she was doing a favor for her Republican colleague who was attending his daughter's wedding\nSo what happens so then what let's take that that's a great was a great call from Jim we're taking your calls hundred sixty four thirty one tent but now let's take what does that play she's in there for four more years before she's up for reelection they're already talking about Sarah Palin running for that a rope during a Republican opponent\nYeah politically speaking ... says the same effect as voting no on Brett Kavanaugh Jordan's exactly right on this I think it was a nice senatorial courtesy but look if she'd have stayed a no and they had would've needed Steve Danes vote they would have just held the vote open while he flew back\nOr to cast that in fact if people were watching uh either on cable news or on CSPAN you saw the first time they went through the roll call Lisa Murkowski voted no it was only when all the senators had voted in the outcome was clear that she stood and said\nOut of deference to see Dane someone withdrawing my boat I'm going to be a president\nBecause it's not going to change the outcome into allow my friend to stay home in Montana but politically speaking Jay\nAnd we've got to be very clear about this uh she was opposed to Brett Kavanaugh she did not deliver one of the votes that was needed to get him over the line and so when she's up for reelection in Alaska that's the message she is going to have to take back to voters in Alaska and convince them one way or another that it was the right or the wrong thing to do\nYeah I think this is as you should have a real fight on her hands and I think it yeah what do you think happened was well we're going to go state by state the minute but I think this is the interesting thing to me is I think the Republicans are going to pick up the house or Senate seats I thought that was I thought that was before that I think it's definitely in that but now the question is\nDo there was this blue wave expected to be coming and normally during the ... after the ... midterms of the new president they lose control it they have the control of the the house they usually lose it I mean that's historically\nHow do you see it here why see that in the house specifically everybody's up for reelection so unlike the Senate such staggered or this is everybody every two years so everybody has to defend their seat\nThat being said they say there's about thirty to toss up such kind of the average or that changes though I'm regularly most of those tossup still right now are Republican just to be clear only a two or a Democrat or held seats are that being said the lean ... the leaves you appear\nAll Republican and the liens damn are a big about mixed\nSo I'd say it's it's about this can Republicans are just kind of maintain if they lose a couple seats\nI think that is a victory as he they lose ... as long as they have witnessed keeping the house to control not even ... the head of enjoy these if they are still the majority party in the house even by one or two votes\nThey want I mean that was a big victory for Republicans coming out of a coming into a tough election cycle and then the Senate what you'll see I think certainly is an expansion of the Republican majority unless something very bizarre happen the next uh less than a month and what do you think [noise]\nI think that's right I mean ... the Republicans have two hundred and forty seats in the house right now is a Democrat who need to flip twenty three of them and you know history is on the side of the minority party so I think they need the goalposts for Republicans there is absolutely just that to Eighteen majority and I actually think Jay right now they have a pretty decent shot to do it or in the Senate I read\nIt wouldn't be gave and we know what it is in her second they'll let you finish but people need to understand if they ... they will lose ... house seats Republicans as al sweets I think there's no doubt but if they can still contain uh maintain control of the house that would\nBe a huge victory for both the Republican Party the members\nCongress had those committees and the president I mean you know I ...\nNo question about it both parties are only aiming for that to Eighteen number and the fact that Republicans currently have two hundred and forty Jay they hold a couple of dozen seats there really a Democrat a heavy seats so they're going to lose some of those but they're not even they're not named for two forty they're aiming for two Eighteen\nAnd in the Senate Democrats essentially need a clean sweep jamming I think they've already conceded that they're going to lose that North Dakota seat so they need to take the seats the Republicans hold and in Nevada and Arizona and in really sweet all of the tossup states that Jordan is talking about\nI don't see that happening J I think the Republicans are going to have somewhere between fifty and fifty four seats in the United States Senate yeah\nWell it would be quite an uptick All right let's go and do you think well we'll get into how much of that plays off of the cabinet of a process let's go ahead yeah Ruth calling from Colorado on line to Ruth welcome to Jay Sekulow alive Hi Ruth\nOh hi thank you for having me on and I\nJust want to say to women out there that I'm a Democrat and living in Colorado we're being invaded by thinking it is not traditional to Colorado and send other woman I did not\nEnd with the people that are ... including me in all their statement and I'm a survivor of at the end\nBut the thing is I had an object if I'm looking at all areas where think all media and listening not found by the full\nMessage and I just want to commend you on your job because you help me track what was happening in these last week and it was clearly an injustice to women and it's clearly an injustice towards Supreme Court into our nation\nWell thanks for listening was number one number two interesting I was with um a couple at dinner on a Saturday when it does have been I spoke out and I was where I was a speaker and\nUm he was a pendant and is now be switching the Republican Party I think I'm sure there are independent there's now switching to the Democratic party but I'm sure there is at play too but it's interesting that this galvanizing moment on the Supreme Court nomination that goes got so ugly and so overheated\nSo that again uh you watch that closely because a resource battle this or twenty nine days out um ... you'll see some ads are run directly by the candidate some ads are run by a the DNC and its affiliates in packs and things like that\nPolitical action committees they will start moving out if there is no\nChance of of if they're wasting their resources that doesn't mean that the Democrat won't continue to run ads because they've got their own resources this in Tennessee they happened to have a personal resources in pretty well funded campaign but they won't have the onslaught\nOf of not just adds but people on the ground on election day yeah coming from the national party\nIf the polling is continues to show pinpoint leads by a by their their ... Republican opponent when you have that kind of lead um again you've got to move on how you think this place and we got a minute forty four seconds your how big than you think this place in the house\nUm I think it's ultimately be the deciding factor I mean it it will depend on in some of these swing states how many of these democratic members really really make it an issue but the M I n J just the overall tone nationally I think that I think Mitch McConnell put it right when he says the his opposition really played into or the Republican Party's hands so you're\nDown to thirty or forty competitive seats in the house I think it could be the decision maker\nI worry and talk more about this we come back from the break we'll have our full panel with us as well we're taking your calls at one eight hundred six eight four thirty one ten that's eight hundred sixty four three one two one zero so we'll take some more calls when we come back from the break I think look a Britain you saw the do solve the full working up the constitution last week\nOr you saw the nomination process president's authority there you saw the article\nOr I mean article one two and three all impacted by this the president the executive legislative with the judicial branch and um there was a multi phased attack on bread cabinet it didn't it didn't work\nThis out they couldn't get it they were trying to get it to face for which would have been there was enough to Malta coming out of those investigations to have people saying we need more time and then there was a round the clock out when the FBI did the investigation they cannot cooperate\nAny of the allegations made against judge Kavanaugh and in fact the ones that were raised by one of the other lawyers late in the game a gunman sweat mix I think the inconsistencies in her own statements that came out so just the evidence wasn't there to to move it forward and that's what happened\nAnd then you saw the voting the confirmation will be back with more including your calls or just after the break\n[noise] would that's\nOur News I'm Keith theaters in Washington New York governor Andrew Cuomo says the limousine that crashed and kill twenty people

twelve fifty ... live\nWashington DC\nJay Sekulow live [noise]\nShe fell so for the American Center for law and justice ...\nAll right so I call it a pivot for second place right now judge Kavanaugh is now justice Kavanaugh you will hear as first cases tomorrow as they support\nSocio adjustable springboard to the United states and me we are now less than a month out of the midterms\nAll of a sudden the cabinet combination becomes it costs a lab in the sense that you have some Democrats saying\nThat they are going to if they get the house they're gonna open up an investigation with a possible impeachment of Brett Kavanaugh on the other hand does it unite the Republican Party as well Supreme Court nominations tend to do that so we want to get your reaction to this we're taking your calls an eight hundred and sixty four thirty one time we've got our full panel joining us now\nA senior counsel for the ACL jaded director of policy I'm professor Harry ... and Cornel West Smith\nOur director of military uh fares are are joining us as well as a fan and myself and Jordan All right so let me uh we've heard from the three of us let me go to are you a professor Hutchison\nYour reaction leagues confirmed what do you think it's the after effect of the confirmation\nWell first it's important to note that despite the fact that a justice Kavanaugh has indeed been confirmed that the political fight\nOr is not completely over so they're twenty nine days oh to the mid term election\nA conservative voters are mobilized they're energized and they're energized for good reason the cabinet nomination in my opinion has you nominate conservatives from all political spectrum\nBut be sure of one thing opposition is also energized to some extent and people on both sides of this issue are on racing like Matt\n... no question about that so when you were a group this weekend I was in a group this weekend\nA different parts of the same I Would put everybody within the same political philosophy correct with very diverse group\nWhat was kind of the reaction ... here's what I saw I ... there were at a table actually at the table we were at one of the couples that we're seeing with me and Pam I'm\nHe was an independent registered independent or had been a Republican had been a Democrat had been a Republican kind of back and forth this will push them into the Republican campaign and you know what did that that would they did to Brett Kavanaugh was so outrageous that kind of\nVisceral attack that age that you know this is just eat it just wasn't going to accept it and you know he was making ... what was your reaction where you are\nYou know very very similar you know the the ugliness of what happened the last two weeks is on everyone's mind and and the I think the consensus was that the Democrats just made it much more difficult\nTo ... to take the house or they probably were never going to take the Senate anyway and in spite of the polls are indicating that white suburban women are moving to the Democratic party and they were mainly against judge Kevin Oh\nI Believe that Americans in general\nAnd Republicans in independent voters in particular they were disgusted by the behavior of the Democrats on the Judiciary Committee and the blatant means steer spirited attacks from Kevin now I think it's going to be very very difficult for them to have this blue wave that they've been championed\nToday overplay it oh well they overplayed so round and round was heavily over played by Democrats the Spartacus find what I think to a point where it was almost kind of so law that they were the only ones making news and that wasn't really going to impact the election\nThen you get around to wear a so that the Democrats really embarrass themselves in the judicial philosophy section of the hearing and then we get to this personal attack\nSection and and again what ... what are Democrats left with\nA judge Kavanaugh who had to go through a horrendous experience for his family is now a U.S Supreme Court justice they're all just sitting there are still in the Judiciary Committee um they did everything they could and they have failed a yet again I'm so these tactics\nIf they use a secret serious question when the and the people that they're aligning themselves with like you mentioned one of the issues that well you mentioned the lawyer by name but it's like if you're going to start taking info from people like that um your means you're not doing your your due diligence before you bring these attacks and if people see that and you must be like that against someone\nSo their tactics may play very very well with voters who are on the east or the west coast\nBut the key question is how will their tactics play out in so called fly over a country in my view is that the approach taken by democratic leaders will indeed backfire\nAnd likely back fire big time or at least if we look at current polling results\nI think there is a free Kavanaugh house race calculus they post Kavanaugh house race calculus\nYes it was so politically charged\nRegardless of what side of the issue you are it was galvanizing\nAnd so it shook everything up nothing politically was the same\nWhen they had the second hearing these accusations if he would've just gone through a which will look likely that you know on judicial philosophy kind of normal Harry's yes most Democrats would have voted no but probably a few more would have voted yes um I don't think it would have changed the political calculus so much in fact I think\nPeople like Claire McCaskill would vote yes it may be tougher\nOr to to to to for the Republican or how they took to win\nBut instead I'm instead you had the second round of of of series of all this uncorroborated junk we can now say after the FBI second report\nUncorroborated junk alec serious criminal allegations against spread Kavanaugh and everything has changed now so every political calculation must change\nOnce you look at once you have a moment like this in history twenty nine days that we're ... we're talking to you now twenty nine days before the election that was all happening within about a month of the election then what do you think\nThe other reason midterms are historically good for the party that is out of power is because of an enthusiasm gap it's hard to motivate voters who their parties in power to get out to the polls are J I think\nWhat we just saw was about the best infusion of enthusiasm to a party that already has power that you could possibly get so how will play out I don't know but I'll tell you this a Republican majority in the house is far more likely today than it was a month ago I think I think you're right\nWe're taking your calls coming into the last segment one eight hundred and sixty four thirty one ten eight hundred and sixty four three one one zero remember tomorrow special programming on the case of a sea of the big developments there we'll talk about that a little bit after the break but we'll get into it tomorrow [noise]\nThan forty three years since the fall aside [noise]\nOver fifty thousand never made it [noise]\nThe ones that did return

under events Murray's they'll dot com\n[noise]\nHad a great 'cause when she came in my face but from Johnson saying do in the Democratic party it across the ... the consensus that we've had here in our studio was yes\nBecause you've got this um when I called mainstream democratic thought the set and more centrist and then you had this progressive to the right to the left the Bernie Sanders almost a approach going out there and how do you you're up there what do you what are you saying well\nThe only thing I Would add to the conversation James I think there's a struggle even inside the elected members of the party enemy Jordan talked about how Nancy Pelosi would be the new speaker likely if the Democrats retain power I mean\nThat's actually an open question because if they're going to get a majority Jay it's going to have to involve Democrats who actually campaigning opposed to Nancy Pelosi both from the left in the right so I think there's kind of two questions for House Democrats one can we get the majority back into\nWho can unite around they can get two hundred and Eighteen votes on the floor of the house or to be the speaker of the house so I think there is a a really there are a lot of fractions inside the party right now are left I Would say less center and then far far left and they're having their own fight on it\nAbsolutely All right let's go right back to the phones yeah Linda calling from Georgia on line for Linda welcome to chase you alive they Linda go ahead\nThank you for taking my call her I was listening and I guess you know I Am a independent conservative I grew up African American badly Democrat\nYou know we do with our parents Dale and half of the two thousand election I came out of the party I think uh they they said um Senate calling ... I think it'll galvanize ... and I gave that extra pet for people to get out to vote 'em\nYou know I mean talking to different people I just feel that um you know people are tired of what they're saying we you know I'm a mom\nWhat do we adopted kids out of this as\nWell and I want to see good things happen sure and I'm not a spring chicken my six white and gray kids\nWant to see good things happen for our children and what I see or hear happening is that what time did we wake up we had bigger fish to fry and I voted for President Trump\nBecause I think the energy that he brings this is what we need to move America forward I'm just\nWondering what you think about the parties with this that we've seen going on\nWell I think what you said is ... what part of Georgia you live at\nI'm In Hiram ... last yeah you know no harm\nSo look I mean I I think your your what you said eloquently is the kind of where things are\nI think that the American people you could take a much broader than Georgia the American people are looking at how does this impact my children and grandchildren\nAnd you've got a situation now you look at the stability global stability which you have global civility right now in the way we haven't seen in ... in a decade or you have a sense of momentum I think on in the economy a lower the employment\nThan even though the historically that it's still tells you that there's a switch in the in the house leadership uh in midterms there's this this mission presidents she has not gone by the norms yeah I mean that that\nTheir historical data is political data I mean it's a data that says the heads of difficult for a political party that is in power to get the enthusiasm gap up but J\nUh the the economic data and the other sort of fact based data really all is flowing in the direction of the GOP right now so you know it's going to be a fascinating political study to see which of those two carries\nA because if you took just the one who would say the Democrats are going to win if you take just the other would say the Republicans are you in jail I think both are going to be very close but I'll be honest with you if I was going to be one party or the other heading into these midterms there's no question I'd rather be the Republican Party you think\nThe momentum shift as when that significant\nAbsolutely and I don't think that I don't think the Democrats ever really had a real path in the Senate would only in the house and they saw that path in the house narrowed significantly over the last month\nWas it was in college now usually conservative hero\nAnd who she spoke to yesterday conservatives were very excited about what she did appreciate what she did for judge Kavanaugh in that speech remarks\nBut I think it was broader than that so conservatives appreciate what she did even though they don't always agree with her a politically it does show the big tent Republican Party but independence and more moderate Republicans who may not have been as enthusiastic about getting out to vote this election cycle and never are in mid term election cycles\nI think that's where she was speaking to Susan Collins if you could start as we said ... uniting the party that way with\nTwenty nine days out well who cares about what happened fifty sixty days out\nWe now hear about what's happening now you know what what is it in the president that's what affects the term elections not how they were doing Democrats two months ago at war even three weeks ago when we were on the show talking about how now the Senate might be in play\nAnd it was a big change again yeah through it all goes down there is not going to be probably political as it as big as the Supreme Court confirmation though in the next day or not I mean the next twenty days\nDarn let's let's take another call yeah this is an easy one to answer from Larry in Indiana on line one Larry welcome to Jason ...\nWell I'm going getting past so I asked all is you're stuck with what is the confirmation but ah what do you see as far as as old as they did it that he was\nThere'll be there'll be a nomination put forward by the president and then we'll go through the process within the same thing in a house ... technically there may be other vacancies and now he has a sure I don't feel pretty quickly in DC yeah uh but yeah it opens up on these don't get as much attention usually sometimes there's some fighting in the Senate but it's not\nLike the U.S Supreme Court where it's like there's a ... like they're having to operate a down one it's not like that at the Supreme Court where it's a really affects things as much yeah I think that's I think that's right let's take another call to grab from culture yeah acumen Kansas online six Kim welcome to Jay ... if I can go ahead\nWell first of all you mentioned earlier somebody mentioned about how that quite a string the Democratic party that they stick together and my thought on that is that I'm Lindsey Graham said if they ever get got help as it ever get the power that they're looking for him because\n\nA very able to hear the said from South central the unit bizarre and I'm In
