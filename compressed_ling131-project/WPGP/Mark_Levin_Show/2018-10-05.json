think both of those two a need to be yes is now maybe Joe mansion would cast the deciding vote but I think that would be a pretty perilous place\nFor the nomination to be but look bottom line today Jordan there were all to Milly for votes throughout this whole process the judge Kavanaugh had to get through\nHe's now three of them he is one vote away from sitting on the Supreme Court\nJust so Steve on Facebook writes Jordan chances Kavanaugh's confirmed I think there's a good chance he's confirmed but this is far from over because the the margins are so\nI mean I think anybody who could tell you right now one hundred percent especially with Susan Collins who votes yes on culture but this is going to have a press conference tell you more about how a vote on the actual nomination

delivered instead of free of charge\nTake your to a whole new level users backyard dot com\n\nTo a without tomorrow's\nA scheduled fight or vote on the cabinet nomination this will be the vote the up or down vote\nOn whether or not judge Kavanaugh a becomes justice Kavanaugh you need fifty one votes the vice president came cast the fifty first vote if necessary there was concern that one Republican senator had a daughter and a wedding to attend a tomorrow he made clear\nA sitter days that he will fly back to Washington DC tomorrow evening if necessary to be the vote 'em to be that fifty or\nFifty first vote so that is no longer a a really a concern I let me say this before we get into kind of all of the what ifs as well\nI told you yesterday that at ... again they're not ... the Democrats they only had one ... defection Joe ... all the rest including some who are facing very tough political battles in states Donald Trump won and Republicans traditionally win state wide and\nUm they just all of them but Joe mansion decided to vote against cloture\nAnd let me read some of these comments that came out member of the word temperament I said listen for that from Democrats here senator Heidi Heitkamp from North Dakota she's a no vote now she was one that used to be in that group of five to than talks about always that were potential a vote for judge Kavanaugh no longer now\nShe says last Thursday's hearing called into question judge Kavanaugh's Kurt temperament she's voting no\nThe Washington Post editorial board which is no surprise opposing judge cabinet and calling for a no vote a says that his judgment and temperament would be in doubt the New York times just comes out and calls him a jerk seriously\nThat's the term they use they call it such a jerk Senator Feinstein says that he's angry at a grass and and the aggression some talking about to permit she didn't use the word but Senator Schumer did\nQuestion the confidence to judge Kavanaugh has the temperament sitter Durban\nUm uh it's asked to be put on the ... how could you trust his temperament center Doug Jones the Democrat from Alabama also a show your temperament that's becoming a judge and Senator Patrick Leahy a he has neither the judgment nor the temperament that is just a sample again\nThey're not going to let up on this folks I think that they seem to be made very clear to you that we have a time period here it's more than twenty four hours for like thirty hours where people like\nJeff Flake and Susan Collins um are are going to be under immense pressure as well as Joe mansion ah from both sides but especially the left right now who is flooding the offices in Washington DC and obviously did have the impact of Lisa Murkowski so they they ...\nUm I think with the white Lisa Murkowski is claimed she was the only Republican vote no on culture she decided she was walking into the Senate chamber a right before we went on the air and they had that vote\nThat are those protesters did have an impact so I don't think they can impact every senator I think that they probably don't have as much of an impact on someone like Joe Manchin of West Virginia especially with the Hollywood liberals protesting but they did on in Alaska Senator\nSenator from Alaska Lisa Murkowski now the big question of today is what will Joe Manchin say\nWhat will um what will Susan Collins say she's already scheduled a press conference that will just like say anything or do we go into tomorrow it it really still not have a clear indication that the votes are there for\nBrett Kavanaugh saying right before I get to the phones I just want to make it kind of clear to people you need fifty one votes\nUm he got that today to get to cloture if those votes held he would be confirmed without the need for the vice president he could lose one more and the vice president could be the fifty first so\nYeah that's why I joined in fact if everybody votes as they did today the way this would probably go down as the vote tally would probably actually be fifty to forty nine\nBecause Steve Danes will not have you back in Washington DC now now you're absolutely correct he said if his vote is needed he will fly back in time to cast it so if you play that hypothetical out so you did you know Jeff Flake or Susan Collins or Joe Manchin\nA flip to know the final tally when it is initially taken will probably be forty nine to fifty but they won't close that vote Jordan and then in that scenario you would see Steve Gaines get on a plane to come back from Montana\nAnd at the same time the vice president would have to make its way out to the Senate chamber so if everybody votes as they did today I expect it would be a fifty to forty nine confirmation and if you see the tally a sort of come to a closed at forty nine to fifty then it's going to be held held open for several hours to get the Danes backdoor and\nAll right I don't want to put words in the Centre College math but she's having this press conference which to me is unique because she she indicated one way by voting yes on culture I think she could have let that stand but she decided to have a after do press conference\nSaid hypothetically you lose Susan Collins and if you assume that these Murkowski that's which you could vote 'em you did have to rely on a job at should to save this nomination\nI I think that's perilous or Jordan I mean I Know there's a lot of reporting out right now the Joe Manchin has a pretty solid yes because of his race because of how popular judge Kavanaugh is in the state and maybe even some speculation of a party changing after the elections but Jordan\nThat's a very tenuous place for this nomination to be now I won't tell you that it's absolutely impossible for that to happen\nBut look if you go down to the floor of the Senate and the final vote is forty nine to fifty and you're starting to fly Steve the Danes back from Montana like we just talked about and you're starting to bring the vice president over to cast a tie breaking vote can you can you imagine the pressure that would be an Joe Manchin during those hours while that bill was held open and the delay was\nHanging on his vote look it might happen but that that is not the best path to nomination for judge Kavanaugh the best path to nominate a confirmation productive Kavanaugh is to hold Jeff lakes vote and hold Susan Collins vote and by the way during there there is some reporting coming out right now the Jeff Flake is Tovia quarters that he's a yes on Kavanaugh unless something changes yeah\nAnd the ... I mean bright things can change the thirty hours of a debate right now it's just started last hour or so or Jeff Flake is a waiver yes uh but still is leaving it out there to be persuaded to vote against\nAh the nomination I did want to answer this one called the companies I think this may be a incorrect information may be some confusion with names as well or it's something that would be totally breaking news that has not their report let's go to Roberta in Colorado on line for Roberta welcome to Jay Sekulow live\nHigh it's I heard correctly Cory Gardner is thirty no and I'm encouraging Colorado lens ... Gardner's office and encourage him to vote yes for cap now\nYeah I think that that's incorrect information he's a Republican from Colorado I think you might be confusing\nOr you're in Colorado but don't confuse the course there's also Cory Booker in New Jersey fan who is definitely a no vote but I've not got any Cory Gardner whether yes he was a yes vote on cloture he has not indicated all that he'd be in a no vote on Brett Kavanaugh\nYeah I think he's a yes on final Jordan I mean there there there was some reporting last night that he was still undecided as of last night but he has since announced his vote so you're either there's some confusion with Cory Booker\nOr more maybe it's thinking back to that story of last night you know there were there were several senators yesterday that came out and sort of made their first public statements like ... you know you had some problems with the process\nBut his boat was never in debt in Dallas and I think that's the category put Cory Gardner and I don't think he's somebody you have to worry about at this point\nYeah at that point if those votes started dropping a you've you've you've got the nomination is doomed um so you know you've got to really be able to focus in\nOn these final hours or what you got some questions about these final hours to than we have to be the focus in these final hours of because if you got everybody out there's potentially listen they voted for cloture and that was their first kind of comment on it and they haven't been one of the people that are having themselves out as I'm undecided throughout the whole process\nUm you know may have they said to the twenty four hours but then they voted\nOr you can't focus there because if you do focus they're literally that means you've got serious trouble with observation I don't think that's the issue right now I think the issue is these handful of senators but let me play this up both Rhonda on Facebook who wrote and please explain the thirty our weight dawn on Facebook writes why can't they hold the final vote today than\nWas not about the allegations but temperament and as I read to you I was told yesterday listen for the works to prevent it appears in uh all these no votes\nStatements city that senator Heidi Heitkamp which I think she's good by North Dakota or the Washington Post editorial board that says to vote no uses to prevent a New York times editorial board just called them mature\nA very very uh very uh\n... it's just a bit of ... these are the kind of terminology sitter Feinstein a angered aggression is how she explains it Schumer uses temperament Durban uses ... Doug Jones in Alabama uses temperament so does Patrick Leahy plenty of others have as well as just kind of\nA simple for you as well this is a good ... what company from Facebook you talked with Saudi and one eight hundred six a four thirty one to that's why the hundred six eight for three one was zero\nUh which stood on Facebook I'm surprised that center jokes from Alabama voted no on culture\nThan Doug Jones just showed everybody that uh you could ... an Alabama senator\nAnd a Democrat or that he is he's going to be voting with the Democratic party are so long as he's a U.S Senate\nYeah he's been showing up for a while and I mean honestly he was never really in play on this one and he has not been on play on a lot of key up pieces of legislation as well as nominations um\nYou know I I guess I Would read the political tea leaves on that a little bit maybe Doug Jones doesn't think the as much of a chance for reelection so he doesn't have to play or to the race in Alabama I'm not quite sure but I Would just I Would just say this I don't think this is the first indication from Doug Jones I think this is a pretty much more of the same of what you've been getting from him since he's been in town\nNot listen to him today on CNN by Nineteen\nClearly not really show and it should\nThemselves and that he wanted to\nInappropriate [noise]\nThere you go for Doug Jones is the temperament issues faced three the question is is face three\nSuccessful [noise] it's a question because the cloture vote was so close to that is just the vote to allow a final vote and just because you vote to allow it up or down vote does not mean do you also we're going to vote affirmatively for nominee [noise]\nWe finish out of the first half hour that you should always allowing

the full Senate took their first of two votes on judge Kavanaugh a today just happened just before he went on the air or the vote was fifty one forty nine in favor of culture on the Capitol domination that means the nomination moves forward\nA that was a vote to basically allow the final vote on whether judge Kavanaugh becomes justice Kavanaugh\nUm we don't have to really go through and read through the entire list because it was pretty easy only one Republican voted against\nCloture that was Lisa Murkowski only ... Democrats voted for cloture that was Joe Manchin Lisa Murkowski is from a Republican from Alabama a from a Alaska and Joe Manchin is the Democrat from West Virginia\nWe're taking your phone calls at one hundred sixty four thirty one to the final vote\nIs likely tomorrow evening I mean this was scheduled for a Jeff Flake voted yes if you're wondering that ... he said he's likely a yes vote\n'em on the nomination unless something changes so he's left ... out there Susan Collins was a yes vote as well um she has a press conference scheduled for later today where it's reported\nThat she's going to announce how she will vote\nOn the confirmation or we could play out the Sears for you and we will throughout the second half hour the broadcast if they had been a joy to be a from Washington DC but I Do want to get right to the phones people have already been hold on for half hour a Andy calling from Missouri on line three and we welcome to Jay sexual alive\nYes how are you doing today hey Andy\nI'm enjoying it I'm enjoying your program where they got the whole hour here [laughter] but real quick my father and my question regards if Kavanaugh is voted down tomorrow or looking ahead to Monday morning I'm my thought is known Trump do you think he would just come right to the microphones Monday and say okay\nYou didn't like the ... I'm ... I'm ... living a woman to to run for\nI think it was I think you know I don't want to think pass this vote because I think judge Kavanaugh deserves to become justice capital I Hope he does become justice scout offers family\nFor him a for our country or is this a philosophy a and a and I so I I for it is you know for those reasons that's my personal opinion so I don't really want to look past that\nUh but I Am also a political realist that this is a a nomination that hastened the balance could go either way these next thirty hours certainly um and we have to do before that exactly um or how it may come down I don't see the White House will take a long time in announcing if they had to\nBut uh again I don't think we want to ... go there yet I'm sure that they are prepared because there could be more vacant they're already preparing for potential for more vacancies on the Supreme Court during the Trump presidency during the first term even potentially so they're ready are\nAlways with a nominations they have to be\nA things happen um and so because of that they're they are always ready their lifetime appointments but no one knows again I'm sometimes justice retire\nSometimes they pass away while they're still serving and sometimes that's unexpectedly like in the case of of Justice Scalia one eight hundred and sixty four thirty one Ted we do have a couple of lives that we just got open by taking some phone calls early in the second half hour if you want to talk to us on the air one eight hundred six eight for\nThree one zero that's what a hundred six eight four thirty one tenth said um\n[noise] we have a press conference coming out from Susan Collins\nWe're waiting to see if Joe mansion issues are the kinds of statements um people can follow me on Twitter for that I Will be you know I I didn't was not tweeting on the ... the allegations of making statements about that I Am on the cover that the political voted things like that if it doesn't happen while we're on the air and certainly the final vote will\nAs well yeah I think that was I think that their phone lines are being flooded are not really the position right now I don't think I Need to give up the number because I think that what we've been checking in basically these phone lines for these key senators are are pretty flooded\nThat'd be said as a constituent like you'd never absolutely if you're a constituent of Jeff like if you're a constituent of a Susan Collins or if you're a constituent of Joe Manchin you absolutely uh\nHave the right and and if you have the time to pick up the phone call the ... you know the other side is doing it right now um and again I think that we can be limited and this I think that most senators have made up their mind\nUh but uh but again there are those handful remaining a Jeff Flake certainly is one of those who is still not been clear a he's kind of said I I plan to vote yes tomorrow so that's what he said unless something else uh is to occur\nTwenty eight twenty nine hours or for something else to occur uh uh and that ... for Jeff Flake that can be just being convinced by someone like Chris ...\nUm so you get a pretty open ended statement would not be nasty the so we want these people to vote in a positive way so I get I'm not going to cast dispersion on them uh I Do think that they you could say that they have been these are a sitters who put themselves out in this position\nBy publicly take euros that they are undecided or feel like they're going to vote yes but they're not a hundred percent I'm at a stand up or down or chat that if you can't get to the D.C office called their stayed off especially if you're a constituent if you live in Arizona kick it to the D.C office for Jeff Flake calls Arizona office\nAs well we've got a minute left or they're saying we come back we will focus all on your phone calls which I think it's been great for everybody listening to um I Know that everybody can call into the show but it kind of focusing in on\nUh the key issues in these final and how things could break down any final hours before the devote to either\nI put a jets for judge Kavanaugh to become justice Kavanaugh for ah for for a judge nominees to the Supreme Court to be voted down [noise] I I I Believe judge Kavanaugh should become justice Kavanaugh that's my personal opinion\nI support his

and you can have the swearing in um the uh you could kind of have the formal or a swearing in done very quickly you it was it that you know immediate ... on Sunday and then there can be more and more formal kind of ceremony even after that\nYeah I think it would happen virtually immediately Jordan I mean I think he would be over at the court on Sunday whether or not the swearing in happening or Monday morning or if he's confirmed by the Senate Jordan he's going to work immediately\nSo yeah so just to answer your question very quickly sure it happens immediately what you would likely be a kind of a small quick of it\nAnd then there would be a kind of a larger of it we're friends and family go um uh that's the case for other nominees are up but they start to work immediately states it back to the phones we go Stewart in New York on line three store welcome to Jay suck you alive\nI thank you for a while you do end up your support of Israel or my question is in the audience Brett Kavanaugh has been a judge has his temperament that they've been in this you\nKnow I mean he got the highest rating you can get stored for baby a the American bar association which is very far to the left politically by the way but when they they they look at these judges they look at the kind of ... what ... how they conduct themselves it's not really supposed to be about it's not supposed to be about judicial philosophy um and he got the highest\nRanking you can from uh the American bar association well qualified so that they get the no issues about judicial\nTemperament you can disagree with his usual philosophy but do issues about judge Kavanaugh's temperament at all\nAre brought up personal on the bench at work or throughout his career before being a judge or the twelve years he has served on the bitch back to the phones or we go mark is in California on line to Marcus welcome to Jay secular life\nAll right thanks for taking my call before\nThe court may\nEric I'm right now there's they attacked Bain basically\nThat is that basically it was it was at least a attempted rape or a ... a\nSALT I mean ... these are serious crimes he was accused of mark is with no core operation even after another FBI airport no core operation no one will lead to even say you know say that that they have been heard about this ever occurred\nWell yeah\nYeah well is it I mean this is this is it's politics um the temperament issue again as it was just there next line of attack see he's too angry to be on the corner where they actually say that\nIt's too angry too much aggression to be on the court that that was not him as again the city it was ... judicial philosophy there who defending himself there's a big difference uh back to the phones we go stand in Nevada on live for

the people who\nAre under the Democrats red state Democrats to get through with talk\nThat never really became ... he was catching up to ... to this boat ah than I think that uh uh the race was getting it just is getting a bit too tight and the Democratic party moving a bit too far to the left\nSo that you couldn't talk with no action just didn't really work but it it were a been okay for them Heidi Heitkamp types of North Dakota of all places I think she's given up\nBy this I mean what I think that she's done I don't think that's right because she does represent constituents like a standard set but\nUh but but than that I think for the Joe Manchin types of likely the party's moved so far to the left that ah he's tried to talk like a moderate but not actually vote like a modern didn't work and now we're seeing potentially am starting to vote or like the moderate he says he is\n\nI'm here but said from South central unit\nIn the program [noise]\nFor nine seven one is a GED
