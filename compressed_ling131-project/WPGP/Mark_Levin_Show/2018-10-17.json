describe\nKanye West ... said this is what happens when they grow don't read and then you have more money you are referring to the blacks were visiting president elect Trump as mediocre negro\nSo listen let's move on to talk about or somebody else a about Steve Harvey and I want to give ... to mark a Steve Harvey winter Trump Tower and seeing a lot of backlash for meeting with the president in a life where do you make of this controversy oh\nYou know I Love the apartment I respect for Steve Harvey and I think his intentions\nWere act this is mark from audio ... or ... or appropriate rather but but my disagreement is the way in which he's being you lose by folks like Donald Trump to get his message that if they have a seat at the table when you're at the table used to have experts at the table you'd have people who can challenge the president at the table I don't care Steve there but if if I was Steve Harvey\nI'm bringing Michelle Alexander I'm bringing Cornell West I'm bringing a mighty Perry I'm bringing a big law I'm bringing Michael Eric Dyson\nOperating some folks with me ... and president\nAnd in Florida the conversation otherwise you'll\nBe sitting on my girl\nBecause all of a real quick because all it is 'cause they can't bring up comedians and actors and athletes to represent like interest is the is the meaning it's disrespectful and it's ... and defending bring some people that there was an expertise Donald Trump they'll just for people to entertain so you were so you're at the meeting you heard sorry I don't understand how anything I say what part of that question but I I\nAnd less and less Steve Harvey turned into a policy analyst in in in the same meaning it doesn't matter what I was I was like Margaret all the people you're putting up here and putting in front of the cameras market wasn't even there you know what happened okay okay oh you're just a very many are you didn't work\nYou work in the rooms are how they were there last night and again my point that he was seen Harvey and then put them in\nPerson saying you weren't in the room was one of the um a mediocre negroes or their Trump invited to Trump Tower disagreeing with more come audio\nPart of the camera crew team here here's the deal you don't know what happened first of all Vassar Darrell Scott Michael Cohen there in a process of bringing all types of people from all over
