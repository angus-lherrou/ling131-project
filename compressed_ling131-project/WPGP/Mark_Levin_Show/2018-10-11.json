change that's why we're going to keep\nDoing these shows an update you are not every day but we will update you as we get closer and closer 'cause things do change uh that have an impact a few weeks ago it was like the Senate could be a jeopardy for Republicans right now it looks like the Senate um a is a is not that it is a pretty firmly in control of Republican series of factors talk of\nAdding more Republican said to me they have it it's fifty one forty nine so any kind of positive ads would be good now it's still very tight margins ... six days out so take nothing for granted a because so much connected so quickly in politics that being said because\nIt looks like the ... is is we're relatively safe for now twenty six days out for Republicans up that it really the victory would be I think than kid they could uh may take control the house even if it's this limits to march is I don't think\nI think keeping control the Senate um or should not be so overly celebrated\nA ... it's it's it'd be great it's obviously important I think for conservatives are especially with nominations it takes like that but it's really the house here at least twenty six days out\nYeah the Democrats chance in the Senate Jordan or a really long shot him and you're gonna have to pull off an upset in you know either tendency her Texas and then sweep all of the contested races the Democrats are defending I mean if you just look at the raw numbers of the three five seats up in the Senate Jordan\nTwenty six of them are held by Democrats in ten of them are in states that Donald Trump wants to that's a very unfavorable math then I think the Republicans are going to control the Senate and I agree with you I think they're going to expand their majority there\nIn the house Jordan um I think all the pressure honestly is on the Democrats day they assumed they were going to flip control of the house\nA historical data says that you would their bases animated because they don't like the president and by and large although I Would tell you in specific districts that is very much not true in seats that they need to win so I think they might be over selling\nA their advantage in that regard but look the pressure is on them because if if House Republicans can maintain even a one seat majority\nThat's not just a victory that is a huge a monumental victory for them and honestly the Democrat Party or the demoralization they would take place in that scenario during the it's almost hard to describe\nThe here to me is what is most shocking is the vitriol going into this from our former\nCabinet members of the Obama administration and attorney general member that such as the OJ were told not supposed to be hardest and uh everybody should be treated fairly and it's not really under even though it's part of the executive branch were told that really supposed to be independent the president should order the attorney general around\nTake a listen to Eric Holder on the campaign trail in Georgia\nListened to the words he uses the former U.S attorney general who is supposed to be the ... was the top law enforcement official for the whole country not just for Democrats but he weaponize that do the OJ east and that kind of language uses once again take a listen\nThey have to use the powers that may have gotten\nCore all the wrong thing they want to keep themselves in power they want to cater to the special interests heat is time for us and Democrats [noise]\nMaybe an dedicated to lay army as they are\nBut shallow he says I Love her when\nShe and my wife like really tired of hearing the ...\nMichelle Williams says that you know when they go low we all\nKnow [noise]\nThey go low we [noise]\n\nThat again folks where we've seen violence out of the campaign rallies you've seen the anti ... we've seen a again a Trump supporters being attacked or you know they don't see this kind of violent language is good for either side but for the nation's top law enforcement official a couple of things in that statement want\nHe criticizes the other side\nYou know conservatives Republicans I'm for a warning power for all the wrong things and the first thing he says they want to keep themselves to power\nIf you really think about that if you believe in the policies that you want to implement of course you need to remain in power\nBecause you can't implement the policies you believe in if you don't remain in power\nSo this idea that they want to stay in power is somehow a bad thing\nNo that's a good thing if you are trying to implement your policies you have to stay in power if you lose you will not be able to implement your policy second kicking people uh again this idea that uh we're going to would they go low Republicans are that we are going to kick them\nI Know he's not probably saying actually kick them out if she's saying it verbally so don't you know but again people here that\nDifferently than Eric Holder pitted it especially coming from a top law enforcement official but saying to me it sets the tone and I'd love to hear from our callers is well this idea that the attorneys for return to the United states is telling a tally Democrat activists to kick\nThose are Republican activists or would they go low whatever that means and how they define that up and say that is tough tough rhetoric coming from our nation's a former top law enforcement official\n... it's tough and I would argue inappropriate door and given the political climate that we're in right now where threats of violence an actual violence have been taking place look\nI mean I'm Glad you made this distinction because our founders set up the way of government Jordan that was intended to have tension in it you wanted to have tension you needed to have power the idea was that the best and strongest ideas would prevail but what you see in that quote\nAnd I think one that you might be playing up in a minute here\nIs not I'm looking for ideas to prevail it's looking for the preservation of political power at any cost and using any form I Would say including forced to keep it Jordan that is not what our founders intended there should be tension\nBut it should be tension over ideas ways for a stronger government waste to advance the the American people and then at the end of the day coming together around those ideas Jordan or that sound from Eric Holder or it perpetuates um what I think is a dangerous atmosphere we hadn't society right now and and quite frankly he should be ashamed for it\nAnd then it gets even more unique from Hillary Clinton Hillary Clinton of course can't stop or getting a getting involved in politics\nTake a listen to what she has said she former secretary of state former first lady who lost the presidential election to Donald Trump take a listen\nAnd you cannot be criminal ... political party that wants to destroy what you stand for what you care about that's why I Believe if we are fortunate enough to win that\nThat is that what he can start a ...\nSo you could only be civil with people you disagree with if you get power back\nAh in either the house the Senate Hillary Clinton uh you can't be civil with on policy disagreements\nBecause the way you describe policy disagreements are destroying what you stand for and care about\nUm that's a very civil so the only way to get back to civility is to have the Democrats take the house or Senate 'cause they're really civil river Brett Kavanaugh's hearing really civil people on that other side of the aisle let me tell you I mean let's let's let's just stop there this is politics it is tough but the language coming out as\nWe can only be civil if we get some power back is what Hillary Clinton said kick them is what Eric Holder said let's go to your phones\nOne hundred sixty eight four thirty one tended I Want to contrast\nIs in fact let's contrast and now President Trump uses a lot of tough language on the campaign trail he does and he has no forty tweets tough tough language as well he's passionate and and he speaks in a way that is unique or for any American president but listen to him last night this is at a rally in Erie, Pennsylvania\nUm he tries to play very much to the middle now the latest poll that just came out a from CBS a ... in just a a this was October second to October fifth\nHas black burn up eight so I was a ... a big swing but the other polls show that much of a mutt\nCloser to some of the earlier post so it's really within the margin of error I'd still I treat that as a margin of error race than uh the end and and even in North Dakota treated very seriously because um if you could hold on to Tennessee and flip North Dakota that's a big went\nWell and I would say just one thing on each of those races Jordan first of all in North Dakota part of the reasons the races ... runs so rapidly towards Kevin Cramer is because of how few votes are cast there I mean you're talking about only three hundred thousand votes a state wide in that race or a league can open quickly it can also close quickly Jay ... are Jordan so you\nKnow the ... the adviser you it's been in that state can move a lot of votes in Tennessee I I really think Phil Bredesen got hurt very badly this week because while he did say that he would vote for cabinet if you were in the Senate he\nAlso got caught or some of his staff on under camera undercover video a door and saying that that was a ... that that was just a political statement and then if you were actually casting a vote he would oppose Brett Kavanaugh so look I think he did make a politically motivated statement on Brett Kavanaugh\nI think that video coming out really hurts him I think Marsha Blackburn was probably the\nPolitical favors certainly going in any way I think feel Britain is in a while he's run a good race a joined I don't think he had a lotta margin for error and this was a pretty big air coming down the stretch and of course we're not\nGetting into all the gubernatorial races out there Tennessee does have one of those where the Republican is far ahead in the polls for the Democrat so there's a there's that also\nGoing that affects things certainly I mean all this all these different if you've got a governor on top of you got it on top if you've got lots of\nA contested races in the house level driving different kinds of turnout\nDepending on where you live we're going to take your phone call second half hour basically if you take a second half hour on politics don't always do this on this broadcast but today is that they were focusing one hundred percent on politics so give us a call one eight hundred sixty four thirty one time we open a couple of lines up\nAs we go through these important racist can the Republicans maintain control not just as a U.S citizen\nBut even the house of representatives tough\nWe believe possible twenty six days out\nWill tell you why one eight hundred sixty four thirty one

joining us the big question today twenty six days out to the mid term election [noise]\nAnd the big question is can Republicans make maintain control of both the house and is it\nI mean you may be shocked by hearing that right now because you've heard so often that I Know the Democrats are definitely going to take control the house\nThe Republicans are right now twenty six days out that could change Eighteen days you may hear something different for me but that's why we do the show staggered as we lead up to the election day\nUh as we're twenty six days out it looks like Republicans are really just seeing\nHow many ... extra seats they could add to their majority in the ... some of that it's just based on how many Democrats are up for reelection out of the thirty five race is a it is a twenty six are Democrats so that's a lot of seats just to\nTo to focus on and then you got to work on that adding a so that makes it just tougher mathematically and also the states hit of those states are in states that are a Donald Trump\nWon so it makes it even that much tougher which is why uh you've got a a leading a GOP leads you appear to democratic combat like Heidi Heitkamp\nA and a you've got a toss up Democrat races in Florida\nIndiana Missouri Montana Nevada ah and ah the only true toss ups on that list or offer Republicans are Arizona\nAnd a ... to the sea and I think to the sea they're starting to see this move kind of a a with better polling we'll we'll try to see if Marsha Blackburn gets kind of in that point range or not\nA ... latest polls show that but again that's a big difference when you've got that many of these that many ours it'd be so we'll go through all of it for you right now uh let me play for you to get accepted get re sets the stage\nThough what we're going to be facing from the other side's kind of leaders former leaders here's\nEric Holder he's in Georgia campaign when he makes this comet take a listen he used to be the former top law enforcement official now we had a lot to say about Eric Holder I Believe he weaponized the department of justice that we're still seeing the effects of that is the OJ also oversees the FBI\nBut take a listen to his political rhetoric of the campaign trail yesterday they have\nTo use the powers that they have gotten\nFor all the wrong thing they want to keep themselves in power they want to cater to special interests is time for us as Democrats [noise] to be as tough as they are\nMaybe an occasional a army as a minute is\nMichele always ask me I Love her when\nShe and my wife like really high

representatives the way it is set up that it\nRepresents the number of persons that district instead of the number of citizens and\nUm most of the people who come to our country from different countries um vote Democrat um slit seems it's really becoming more and more difficult to get Republican majority in Congress\nAnd even a solid majority when you have so many people think representative who aren't even citizens of our country\nWas not citizens they shouldn't be voting that's one so there are some instances the census goes out that takes account of the people and that's kind of have congressional districts are drawn up somewhat there's a lot of gerrymandering and things that go around but remember you have to be a citizen to vote if not your frog gently\nVoting so um it's not people who who are here who are not citizens that are are are voting and causing the Democrats to win a now\nI think that what you're getting at though the bigger issue is that the immigration issue\nA front and center in California you see this is why like taking the calls from all across the country than is because you get called from Julie she's in Santa Monica California and clearly a feels a little bit deflated because a significant demographic changes coming even though people may not be citizens yet\nUm and ah and California is one of the bluer states in the country but the Republicans do win in congressional races there\nBut just that it is I I just wanted to tell people I'm don't worry about the fraud right now what the election lawyers for the political parties do that they are um especially the close races get out there and vote and get out there and get your friends to vote than that is what's important\nYeah that's really what I was going to say

D\nPrinting trumps of racist\nPrinting Trump question whether or not Obama was from Hawaii therefore he's a racist nevermind Hillary's first one who started this oh yeah it's always campaigned it
