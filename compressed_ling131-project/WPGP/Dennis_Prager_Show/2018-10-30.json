for their their\nConscience list they are conscience free because they are so filled with self righteousness in opposing Donald Trump that that's all they need to know in order to to calm their

good I Can't lie lie lie and use that Jews to lie to undo his presidency\nBecause I'm doing this presidency is the Jewish thing to do it the Christian thing to do it the American thing to do and and it's of course it's the progressive thing to do that's how they justify their light\nThey live in the beginning of the Trump presidency when they said that the calls the Jewish community centers were

I'm Dennis Prager and this has been one of the\nMost disturbing hours of my broadcast career to see the ... saturating this country saturating it using the deaths of Jews the first mass murder of Jews in American history is being used\nAnd\nUh they saw there's so much to tell you all battle but my will I Want to reflect on some of that because it's relevant to what we're doing but I spent the last hour\nPlenty about the the wrenching of America and one of the greatest lies it's not the greatest lie that has been widely believed in American history I mean maybe there's another one I I don't know for a fact that that is the greatest in the sense of most widely believed\nThat it permeates the medium permeates left wing groups president is responsible for the Pittsburgh murder of the Jews\nAnd the use of the dead Jews for the left and he's one of the most disgusting things in Jewish history certainly American Jewish history but they're proud of themselves because getting rid of Trump is more important to them and honoring the dead that's why it's a fact\nThat is why they were Jewish synagogues that ... when Trump was elected they were proud of it they actual ... it was a Jewish ritual of morning for an immediate family members who just died\nThe perversion of Judaism into left ... is is rampant just as the perversion of Catholicism intellectualism Christianity to left is\nMaybe one day you will understand when I say over and over that left his ... has been the most dynamic will listen to the last one hundred years far more dynamic the Judaism Christianity Islam Mormonism any any religion it has been the most dynamic\nIs conquered break numbers of Jews and Christians that's right it has affected the way it is university is is is a leftist temple\nIs more dissent in a synagogue up on any go on any time of the study than there is a at a university\n\nRight now Michael in San Francisco doesn't agree which is why I Want to stay on I'm Glad he did Michael back\nTo you high high do you report it to me that the the ACL said that there's been thirty three percent increase in anti Semitic communication and what else would there was another words you use so\nSo what I wanted to stay with it I don't want to play a word game with the Anti Defamation league ... it's very very mainstream organization that\nIt's not a main street organized we differ on that it's okay go ahead\n[noise] [noise] well [noise] okay [noise]\nI don't wash their Michael I don't trust it but go ahead go ahead I'm not arguing with you and my only saving ... the ... do you think that the New York times is mainstream reporting or left wing reporting\nI think that the New York times you're a liberal organization\nNow okay so do you think you have you always a liberal organization\nI think is an an uncle or you can read about it mainstream ... anyone could fire\nOK okay we differ on that go ahead please\nOkay for\nWhat they recorded in Trump hurt your ... your ... or ... percent increase and then the second you're seven in Greece and again I don't want to get caught up in a word going buddy an anti Semitic activity rat\nActual activity et cetera and more important rewriting Trump in Pittsburgh is the right\nWants to limit this to nothing more than an anti Semitic or however there was a very specific thing about you that enraged killer certainly anti Semitic or with the prime of the year ...\nBecause the favor of the work directly for the ... the president in gator coming up from the board\nOkay I'm a little I'm a little confused here who said who said that these Jews favored invaders\nWith the man with the gun killed eleven that was\nGoing OK okay All right fine I I Believe you I haven't heard it I Believe you you also know that he said he said he can't stand the president because the president has too many Jews around him are you aware of that you\nSaid that he said that's the one thing he doesn't like about him but he also agreed with no these are his exact words that the invaders or coming to the water and he wasn't talking about you were talking about micro which was one of the top\nYou write in Pittsburgh have a group called ... or a big participants and a group called higher fever immigrant side or the older and yeah mainstream group in the world\nThey started off helping Jewish refugees refugees than the other countries this gentleman\nRelax with better Fraser moment killer was enraged at being you for that reason using that word President Trump\nRight why didn't kill Christians who were ... well All right so lumped arts and let me ask why didn't he killed Jews accuse me Christians who oppose the uh the caravan and a vast numbers of immigrants coming in illegally\nWhile I have great that you're working you're at work we would certainly agree with that but yeah that and and this certainly that was the thing that got killed those okay you're picking writing Carter\nSo if I'm right so if the president also if the ... okay if the president were uh were said I think it's great of caravans of about tens of thousands of people come in ... he would not have killed Jews in Pittsburgh\nI Hope so obviously if you're trying to say that there is the correct wander one correlation [noise] you\nKnow I'm not I'm I'm just asking why do you think that by the way let me ask you know the\nWhat what am I trying to tell me what I'm trying to say because ... ... what are you may know better than I Wonder what am I trying to say\nWhy don't we why don't we agree with Trump did say and ... and his supporters\nWriter okay so yes so let me ask you a question what would be how would you characterize\nFourteen thousand that's two caravans worth of people a A R B use or would you call them gassed would you call them refugee on that would actually be have that right you are and what yeah okay go on are you are okay okay are you for accepting them into the country\nI'm for expecting them under the appropriate I'm now with the screening that go through every who think that the American kid right\nWhat what they are not what they are not what Trump and you could order repeatedly you've been on what you probably mainstream media with box with anger at that time that they they're carrying electric smallpox eradicated almost ... years ago it took me forty years ago that they\nAre like I I think okay I under your right by the way ... ... well let me let me\nSee okay so let me say there is there is overheated rhetoric but I Am completely opposed to letting their man\nAnd I believe that the greater threat to America frankly I think it's up to the best of my knowledge anyone who says that they're bringing in smallpox is making a stupid argument okay I agree with you I never heard it but I Believe you got it's being said I'm sure a lot of ... things are being said\nI ... okay\nAll right you're right fine Okay Michael\nI I agree with you said you don't have to debate me any more if if that is one of the stupidest arguments against this the only arguments against this is not smallpox the only argument against this is just the does America have a border or not that have to control the left essentially believes in open borders 'cause it finds nationalism to be testable\nThe scientists to testable when you're a ...\nThat's not nationalism in you know it and you know\nWhite it's wet where nationalism is not having that nationalism is having nationalism is having borders borders is part of the nation\nWide Mart or than that and you know there\nWas a much more that's where we make different I don't think it's more than that I don't know I think that\nYeah it is it is hyper protection other quarter thing that not only should we protective order for people who want to cross that border are ... other alien\nOkay we keep going back to that al ... thing go right word I'm okay I'm a native from the president's now okay\nThat's a lot of ... when he called the animals that was MS Thirteen image Thirteen\nOur animals if you don't believe the image Thirteen to characterize animals I don't know who would be\nOkay I think that right so the debate isn't about the debate is not over verbiage even though verbiage matters I agree that the baby's over whether the United states of America like any country can have can have a a a border\nTo protect its borders the way Michael protects his home in San Francisco and the way I took my home in Los Angeles\nIf Americans are home we have a right to say who can come in that's pretty elementary that's what this debate is about if the president's had\nOnly use the most congenial language and by the way I Do I have said a thousand times at least I Would do exactly what any of these people from Guatemala or Honduras or Mexico do I would leave the corrupt countries of Latin America and try to come to this wonderful garden of eating the United states\nIn any way I cook I'm Dennis ... the dentist Springer show the relief factor

ultimate issues there [noise]\nEvery Tuesday the third our dinner Springer show was devoted to the great issues of life a lot of great issues the reason for this hour is that many people\nHave a map they know exactly where they are but they don't know where to go that is by the way that's the given in life we don't know where to go we have to be guided to where\nIt is best to go morally and terms of happiness in terms of meaning in terms of many things so this is a big could be cold I guess the map\nShow or the where to go on the map show but it's the ultimate issues hour and I welcome you all again I'm Dennis Prager thank you for being with me so of course anything Semitism is in the news so let's deal with it on the ultimate issues hour\nAnd I will offer you some thoughts I have written a book it's in its third edition it is it never been out of print I began it\nWho who many many years ago and it's been updated and updated updated but the central thesis is identical to the original lift the roads and then you should subject unfortunately it is the greatest hatred in history\nOr a greater percentage of Jews have been murdered than any other ah X. than the group that we can is that we know of\nAnd uh if his uh uh the unique aspect is ... unique aspect of Jewish hatred whose name is anti Semitism ... to ... ... ... ... Eighteen seventies and Germany\nAnd the unique aspect is that it is\nAlways a ... ... people will hate Jews want them all wiped out they don't want them and slaves were persecuted\nThey want the White House\nThat's an amazing thing in every generation has been the case there's been a group that as well to ... to Jewish babies therefore or targeted as they were ... Jewish adults\nSo explain a little bit about that the book the book is why the Jews the reason for it by Semitism the greatest predictor of evil and I\nThink you'll find that riveting why the Jews wrote it with rabbi Joe ... many many many years ago and again it's been updated enough that he was from a third or fourth addition published but I wanted to buy three publishers Simon and Schuster signed with the troops to her and her\nColumns and Rick Murray regularly published my Bible come from a beautiful job I might add so I have a question for you\nAs I could use some fortunate to some so I'd like to the cold and we are told repeatedly today that there's this tremendous growth in anti Semitism in the United states uh so I have two questions one do you think that\nThat is true whether you're a Jew or not a Jew I Want you to to tell me what you think do you experience it if you're not Jewish I mean are you a hearing more a Jew hatred in in talk with Jews are not present or if you're a Jew or you're experiencing an anti Semitism at work\nOr on your dry from home or or anywhere else I I have not even my mail and ... I'm I'm\nPretty well known Jew in the United states and where to touch them in the mail I mean there are others who do I have like a saying that they don't I don't deny for a moment but I get very very little and I have I've not seen any increase the people who hate me hate me because I'm a conservative because I'm a Jew\nSo I uh I'm I'm just curious\nI really am curious maybe I Am not aware\nOf this increase that is allegedly and maybe factor we taking place I Know what you're taking place on college campuses that that's but that's all from the left and from Islamic students\nThat's not that's not from the right but that is true if one is one wants to identify\nOr anti Semitism and it's increasing you say well that's anti Israel yeah but there there was very little difference if the only state on earth you target is the only Jewish state on Earth Day and I'm Sorry but that is anti Semitic okay let's please save me said me the uh the nonsense\nThere to watch something countries but the only one that I work to it destroys the Jewish state but I don't dislike Jews oh okay so you don't dislike Jews does it matter [laughter] it's nice if it does it does it mean dislike Jews means work works to when I elite that has that\nSo yes there has been there is an increase on anti Semitism on the American campus but that's not what the people who say visiting present Semitism talking about they they think there's an they claim is anti Semitism got his massively increased from the writing\nWhereas on the campus it's from the left and from a ... many Muslim students 'cause it's it's target specific leisurely there were students who were afraid to wear Jewish though\nThere are there are students who were free to where you know all the college campus\nBut other than that do you believe that this is in on the increase and what is your take on this uh this whole issue what eight Prager seven seven six is the ultimate issues our eight seven seven you know watch on it's been too long I needed I crave it\nGive us the eight seven seven jingle [noise]\nAll right very knives are right oh okay that's good okay very good show I'm joined by the way of showing you should know sang that compose that and sleet it on every one of the instruments\n[noise] marketable achieving\nOkay he didn't\nMark spring Texas a little more than a prayer\nI I'm more hot I think there isn't it like you and\n\nThat's an increase in ten minutes President Obama almost a hundred percent right Randy I'll\nDo it all and those things and how they train and actually in the platform and does that make credit for that many I think that any I mean it's okay it's higher read them\nAnd I personally at um we had our mind around at our\nAnd I think it out by someone who is all over it and we had it with all\nThe playground [noise]\nUm when did that happen\nIn the middle of years [noise]\nAll right let me react I I\nI just want to say okay this is an important I thank you for calling I don't agree I don't believe President Obama for an increase in anti Semitism and I don't blame the President Trump\nAnd I don't think that conservatives should play records that the left does even though it's tempting I don't think Obama increased anti Semitism and I don't think that um that the President Trump as I Do think that President Obama increased racial tension in the country\nHe could he could have and of course it was eight years Reid reassured or black America that this is a really good country\nInstead he said that racism is in our DNA spoke about Ferguson even though the the white policeman was acquitted by largely black jury\nBecause he acted completely in self defense with Michael Brown was not an act of racism whatsoever for the president to say ...\nWas a disgrace to have a Al Sharpton visit him as often as he did El Al Sharpton was one of the instigators of the only for Rome in American history that word is ... minute is used by brain most university historian\nIn describing the events in Brooklyn New York and crown heights when blacks attack Jews are and they they were exonerated by Al Sharpton\nAnd that so yes but I don't believe that President Obama's responsible for um for an increase in anti Semitism racial tension yes did he leave the country worse than you found that in every way possible I Believe so\nBut not but not in terms of anti Semitism\nOkay ah let's go to um uh Dustin in Columbus ohio Hi Dustin groups Dustin hold on I'm not going to I don't want to interrupt you hear the music because it will take you\nSo I we hear about all this increase in anti Semitism so fewer ... tell me do you think that this is true outside of a college campus I don't I don't I don't believe it is true but hey I don't live everywhere but I Do get around\nMore than most back in the moment\nSpringer show\nFrom the relief factor pain free\nYou're right there you're you're explaining it yeah yeah All right I think you're you're explaining it uh and I think there is that that is part of it you should all I'll read the Israel test by George Gilbert who is of course not Jewish and or see his five minute video at ... university the Israel test\nAnd he uh he explains that point in his unique eloquence with his unique eloquence\nThat he is he's a major ... one of the major thinkers in my in my one of the major ten thinkers living\nSo he uh he he ... the resentment if you if you resent\nSuccess not just financial but also financial then that's part of what comprises anti Semitism but anti Semitism of course as I pointed out has been the elimination element we will I liked him the guy in Pittsburgh settled Jews must die\nThat is very rare among ethnic bigger trees there are ... million ethic bigger trees in the world this try this try this nation hate this nation this religion have this religion cetera et cetera but the notion that every one of them most die that is essentially you meet ...\nThat's why I was told that Jewish babies must die\nSo it's a it's been a\n... it's a very serious hatred but again my my question is do you think it's increasing in the United states where do you think that that's a exaggerated I it is increasing I'm a ... but it's increasing to my opinion on the left\nAware or anti Zionism has substitute for anti Semitism anti Zionism is a form of anti Semitism or folks if if you have any intellectual integrity you look knowledge that\nI'll just say that the only state in the world the only people on earth who have no right to a country of the Jews is anti Semitic okay if you if you think Italians don't ever white to Italy then you're anti Italian even if you love pizza and you love a Vivaldi\nAnd you love or the Taliban opera\nYou know Verde and through Jeannie it's
