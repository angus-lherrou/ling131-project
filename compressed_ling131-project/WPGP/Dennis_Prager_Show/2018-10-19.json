Obama\nSo back to the question why is there such preoccupation because one one is it you have a moral sense and it's a very important thing for a lot of people to think well of themselves\nAnd we we can feel good about ourselves we are bringing to the world's attention something terrible that they're an ally of the United states is the second reason\nIs that he's not only an ally of the Saudi regime is not only in LA of the United states an ally of the most hated man in the world most hated man in the world for the left has about Kim Jong un and it is now the Ayatollah Khamenei me\nAnd there's not a it is not Bashar al Assad is Donald Trump is by far the most hated man in the world's media 'cause the world's media run by the left and the left hates him more than any of them and if she has a friend the friend is hated\n\nThose are the two reasons so why are we supposed to do here is the question on the table what are we supposed to do we can't deny him is because it's it would be a lawyer and you can't tell lies kept it on what the Saudi regime that that does it go up all the way to the crown prince we don't know\nBut that it was these are these are pretty well connected man apparently who are engaged in this murder\nSo why don't we posted to cancel a hundred billion dollars whatever what is the ... that they ever ordered in in ... five hundred billion right\nThat's a lot of ... that's a lot of jobs so you'll say well isn't morale will be more important than jobs to which the answer is what is ... ... yes it is yes morality is more important than jobs however there are two big cavity up here one is jobs is a moral issue\nIt's not it's not unrelated to morality whether or not we can ... a a a naval tens of thousands of Americans to work\nBut if but murder is murder I I I fully agree I have a hierarchy of moral good and the hierarchy of Laurel bad that's a very big component of my moral thinking\nBut the a lot of save the Saudi regime or toppled because of sanctions by the United states first of all if they didn't have America to buy stuff from they would buy it elsewhere\nThey're not going to stop buying military equipment number two and most important if you really want to talk more old then the greatest moral good right now might be in the world the world scene might be opposing Iran\nIran is the most evil actor on earth\nThe north Korean regime is the most evil regime domestically\nThe Iranian regime is the most evil regime in terms of foreign evil evil outside of its borders if it's great enemy is Saudi Arabia\nNow you'll say so we are supposed to compromise our values because they're our ally and because the enemy of the ... the enemy is my friend no you don't compromise your moral values you speak out\nYou condemn you try to make that ally ... more decent place but you don't abandon that ally because there are greater goods the most obvious example of being a man who didn't kill one ... but about twenty five million\nGift that figure because it's not possible for the human mind to wrap itself around it and that is Joseph Stalin and we back Joseph Stalin knowing that he was slaughtering people in the millions because he was on our side against a greater enemy Adolf Hitler\nAnd that is the way the world works for people who are willing to look at the world the way it works not the way we imagine we allowed to Jimmy Carter allowed the America under Jimmy Carter allowed the shark to step down in Iraq\nBecause of the various\nThings that he did that were bad like his ... is the world a better place because the ayatollah

discuss a strong opinions are differing views what people how how to achieve clarity ah\nOh I well I went back to the other adults right well\nTo say first of all it's a very important question and I I Will work on a more elaborate answer a butt off the top of my head first of all you must be clear ironically I'm using the term you have to be clear that what you are seeking is clarity\nEven though you may want to win an argument you have to sincerely seek clarity you can desire to win after that but your primary aim must be where do we differ\nThat's that's the ... the ... the most important whether it is with a spouse a friend or or political foe\nWhere is it that we differ let's try to establish that then we can argue on on who was right but first the least let's figure this out when I have done that with ...\nHalf the time the conversation and did something like this so the truth is we don't really care for that much you don't do we\nMove that interesting and then other times it just becomes clear if somebody says for example that uh I I just wanted to get a good example my last column was at ease Donald Trump or a massage ...\nAll I saw was clarity I had no desire to defend him not defend him it was not the issue it was written after the election so nobody could charge me with trying to influence votes I just wanted clarity on the word ... Jimmy\nIf right and and I think that I provided it then you before you answer the question or answered the charge that\nMan or any man is a massage missed let's try to define the terms and it turns out that sexually object to find women doesn't make you ... it makes you a heterosexual\nJust as sexually object defying men if you are a man makes you a homosexual not a man hater\nThat is the way male sexual nature works it object defies the object of its attraction\nAnd here is the great punch line it is possible to respect women and object to fight them at the same time now if you got a PHD in women's studies you cannot possibly know that\nBut if if you allow for clarity than you can so that so is is that at all helpful\nOr very thank you so much and thanks for all you do\nOh God am I happy said yes I didn't have no idea what he would say well it's interesting but not briefly I Know that it's so important why does it mean what do you mean by that you say that you said that the people who voted for a Donald Trump or racist\nReally on what grounds what are your Rogers wonder wonder state I don't want even to bake I just want to understand on what grounds do you make that plane [noise]\nYou had a caller this week that was just adamant about you know understanding and our world and go to Helen you held them over and try to get him to calm down an answer about what liberals or Denver University He just had you know he wouldn't ants\nWell he didn't answer ... he had no idea what he's talking about and then I realized that like a big\nThough he had a guy like that in your life your brother your you know whatever and you have to deal with him and you know they can go to ... come on in in Nebraska I didn't hear what you owe your community you know an effort to get them out there and an Asperger's antisocial\nBehavior or do you just walk away\n... ...

Am wondering about the ...\nI don't have an answer to that ... that are the only thing you could do is it is really short of acknowledge what I always say if the elephant adage in the room say look\nObviously we really differ on these matters but it's very important to me that we we just continue to feel good about each other in every way possible and be loving\nAnd if you are on board with
