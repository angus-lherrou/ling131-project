dangerous part of Manhattan It's just in fact I think I read somewhere in the literally the most dangerous\nArea of New York city or Manhattan rather by its location in just those two blocks a lot of homeless people there a lot of really really scary people and one of those scary people walked into the Burger King I'm sitting there by the table at the table by the window minding my own business reading a book\nLike a dummy sip it on my Diet Coke 'cause the Diet Coke always offsets the whopper that's the way it works in my mind\nAnyway guy walks in the sky shuffles in and he starts bothering people who are standing by one of the kiosks and I can hear one of the the the people the customer say step away from me don't touch me do type don't put your hands on me\nAnd the guys mumbling something you're not black these like in a black a sweat like a black traction\nAnd paddling and you can put this video up on the streams of people and see how this story because at this point the security guard for Burger King comes over and he's asking the guy politely I heard the whole thing is it's just a few feet away from me you gotta leave now buddy you got to go\nWell that guy pulls out the scariest looking nights it looked like a home made like a shame oh I've I've seen in the movies like is what prisoners make when they try to kill somebody\nAnd then the security guy gets enraged

guy picks up the search hole in the chair over his head screaming you're going to pull a knife on me you're going to end this well they get to the front door now the reason I put my phone down at that point was because they were like right\nTwo feet away from me three feet away from me and I thought this guy's got this knife in his hand if he sees me\nWith the camera he may stabbed me\nLike and I thought I don't want to die on the floor of the Burger King across from the Port Authority on a Saturday Night by myself if that isn't the saddest thing um you know my my wife is at enough as it is any way when they got to the front door which is right where I was at the front of the Burger King\nThis guy with a knife who had been shot clean and mumbling and just you know like he was out of it

war\nAnything and everything goes now lying is kind of place you know with a Senator Harry Reid and write Romney's taxes someone told them that even pay taxes and later on he said well you know it was effective right that's the issue is that effect if not if it's true or the total insanity of the charge\nThat Kavanaugh was part of the group allowing for women to be gang raped or not gang rape police about what they're doing standing in line\nThey are extreme that supposedly so much so that even the New York times wouldn't print that accusation but all of it is fair game any accurate ...\nTo be treated seriously if it is made by someone on the left against someone on the right but those are the rules so the salt that Keith Ellison I think is running for lieutenant governor of Minnesota He may very well have made against his girlfriend\nIs running for attorney general it doesn't matter it'll say like Shon was telling me attorney general it doesn't matter if you saw the debt against his girlfriend if it is but he's on the left and maybe even more telling he's a Muslim which if you didn't know isn't exempt group\nThese new rules only are for those on the right\nThe ends justify any means we're evil and they are right check that correct they never want to be called right but that's all that matters there is no issue of whether they can go to sleep at night but you know ... ... they care because they know they're doing God's work\nIf they even believe in God their God is more likely to be the God of left isn't or anti conservatives are anti Republican isn't that is their religion and it doesn't matter who they destroy there is no negotiating with these people it is their way or the highway\nI have trouble watching their lives in this past week even though you know it's the talk show host he have to watch that circus\nThey didn't really care about that woman not really she was yes center Booker I Would have said to you she was used as a pawn because because those on your side would have ignored a conservative woman with the same charges against a left this man you were using her\nAnd your accomplices of course in the media would barely cover it\nNeed I mentioned Kathleen Willie Paula Jones Anita Broderick the list actually goes on and on\nThose women women sorry weren't on the left so it doesn't matter they're just road kill on the way to power I Sean I learn roadkill in Texas that's that's a phrase that they're the Juanita broader right right right\nThe absolute hypocrisy of people like Cory Booker talking about sexual molestation\nAs president have another Spartacus moment wasn't letter the Spartacus feet like didn't he admits sexual misbehavior or the self righteousness of Kamala Harris or the other phone is on the panel they talked about taking the high moral ground\nThese hypocrites have actually reach new lows ... alone the moral high ground\nEvery time I can think they go you know the lower than this they break new ground\nTell me that's my first question to you\nHow you were able to contain herself I Won a prayer seven seven six these people's disgust me I Can't watch or listen to them in fact when I did was I was teaching part time and so every time a Democrat got on I knew I had to listen but I kind of this a little bit I I it's hard to take it's really hard to take\nKavanaugh was not even my first choice by the way to get the nomination but it wouldn't have mattered\nIf the pope was Trump's nominee and he has left us make no mistake about it they wouldn't have been against him it doesn't matter if Trump appointed by the way what the heck did they need hearings or future FBI investigations when they know how they're going to vote they already know\nAnswer to suffering people like Jeff Flake talk about being name correctly [laughter] you know as soon as I heard his name I have some doubts he said if you remember you would vote for Kavanaugh and hysterical woman confront him and he admits\nThat was part of the reasons he was for an additional FBI investigation can you believe that\nJeff Flake is a fool this delay will not unite the country as he suggested or placate the Democrats\nIt will further divide us this is all a show to delay the process so they can get in power Lindsey Graham hadn't just right\nThis is all about power and I and all of us probably can take in more easily if they just what they felt but they're a bunch of phony hypocrite left us who disgust me tell me what you think that when a prayer seven seven six but it's worse than that\nBecause we now have taken away one of our most basic rights the presumption of innocence you can charge anybody with any crime you want\nAnd you don't even need to have corroborating evidence it doesn't matter if they're innocent you can still ruin their lives and there are no consequences for the accusers because it's very difficult you have to prove that they did it with mouse\nDo you remember Ronald Reagan's secretary of labor I think his name was a secretary Donovan when asked\nAfter he was found innocent as some charges I don't remember the charges anymore after he was found innocent they said something about where do you go next to what are you gonna do now and he said something like where do I go to get my reputation back\nExactly where pray tell me does judge Kavanaugh would go to get his reputation back\nIt's gone now at least for a lot of people the Democrats and the left have ruined his reputation and some like Feinstein have the nerve to question his belligerence and demeanor at the hearings\nWhat was he supposed to do Senator Feinstein after you helped destroyed his life\nAct ever so serene as you ruined his life and his life of his family and his dentist has pointed out where is his bank account for all the good work is done for all these years how did Bill Clinton by the way stay as president after what he did\nWith the complicity of views Senator Feinstein and others in the Senate\nThis was not a good week for American I Want to know what you think you'd want to a prayer seven seven six and I can see the borders already filled but you know I I go to calls pretty fast now we're going to get close to break but as for Christine Ford do I think she was attacked yes\nShe appears credible not regarded by wrestling by Dr Thomas old saying don't confuse the motion with the facts so yeah she was emotional unbelievable but are you know heart may be getting in a way\nBut to judge Kavanaugh commit that attack I doubt it very much especially since no one can corroborate her story she doesn't know how she got there how she got home when it was exactly by the way why didn't you tell the others at the party or anyone else for decades for that matter\nYou know did she was she allowing a friend to be may be right by those boys also\nI mean there are a lot of inconsistencies in this stuff or if not inconsistent questions so now we've reached the stage where oh you need or allegations so I think about this what's the word of hundreds of people from now on making accusations installing every nomination they don't want\nAnd ruining everybody's reputation in the process now now there's going to be no way to get off this merry go round just accused accused and accuse it's a new democratic strategy that has now worked\nI Want to know what you think when I Prager seven seven six I can see you're just as unhappy as I Love you know to think mark Iceland sitting in for a dentist\nThe dentist print shop for the relief factor pain free to be [noise]\nNot the right word now but I I you know it's\nDifferent than the other thing that I I Want to mention is and I've not heard anyone say that\nUm when they ask her about her friend Leland and if she would cut from there um she she talked about the present well she got some health issues I respect their health care if I was thinking about this as a former fourteen year old girl even before cellphones\nNext we'll end what I call her and said well you know what happened you know she I remembering eight miles from home\nWell I should get home one of my friends and\nYou know I didn't like it and she tell her that she was leading or at least give her a car and you know what happened after I left or any of those kind of things a little holes in her testimony that I Wish someone had jumped on\nYeah were you disappointed in the a prosecutor also asking those questions I didn't you think like I did this is going to reach a climax and\nI yeah and I kept thinking yeah I mean you know when it came to the new great and then she got my heart thing because I thought boy oh boy this is harder for\nYou know you were done for\nAnd I was so proud of Brett Kavanaugh when he came in guns blazing and anybody that you know make fun of him for crying or for bringing up ticket daughter paid I guess ... ... what would you not do if you are accused of something so horrific\nWell yeah but you can't prove a negative well of course and you can't win because if you've been calm they would have said well he was accused of all these terms he didn't do but now finds thing and the other St Louis to deliver it to be a justice if she can't win with them that that's the point you did it well ... thanks very culture you you can't win with them\nHow could you when was it doesn't matter what you say it doesn't matter what the truth is\nCan't win with these people's\nPeople's people thank you mark six that\nLet's see some other great call let's go to um well we're going to get that break Amy uh this is just this could be briefed in Columbus ohio you're on with mark\nKind of art high anything you need high I just wanted to make the point really crack 'em I just saw the other day nuts or what ever happened or not but one thing I think if I was in ... I Would be focused on the person that was assaulted what was going on and\nOn the ... or whatever she said let's go were I was so terrified for a girl that I Would be focused on a person that was on top of the um one hundred percent so but\nThe other thing was quick I I I Can't I Can't remember where I thought\nWell I'll do it for just ... minutes that break you say they set up a go fund me account and I think they did let me know what you think when a prank or seven seven six mark I suffered in the spring and\n[noise]\n[noise] with insurance\nNews on ... avenue in Washington trouble your press conference at the White House defending his report nominee judge Brett Kavanaugh he says he is empowering the FBI to investigate according to the dictates of the Senate Judiciary committee\nLast week it was Senator Lindsey Graham and Senator Jeff flake of Arizona the Pentagon move holding off the full Senate vote on Kavanaugh's nomination for about a week\nAnd the president just minutes ago announcing what he called it truly historic trade deal replacing NAFTA deal that war since the nutrition guidelines we both Mexico and Canada both leaders ought to have this week to meet with President Trump\nOn Wall street right now it would appear investors like that new trade deal the Dow Jones industrial average is booming it's up by two hundred and three points or twenty six thousand six hundred and sixty one of the high tech NASDAQ also doing well and so by twenty five with the U.S and people I've heard of about fifty more\nDetails that are news dot com\nBubble tea enter whether [noise]\nSunshine mixing it was last night's Sioux City nine for some parts of the most money ... sixty five miles and limited send them or a woman\n... humid for a couple of showers and nice to have you on the spot any of them as he signed the clouds breaking for some sunshine on the Cuban I Seventy seven meteorologist Joe ... twelve fifty the answer\nRenowned medical correspondent and endurance race champion pop are not empty people\nAsk me how you keep to pd at the age of Seventeen healthy living is important which so he's famous if you have paint you can't train sons frills I discovered salon ... plus this unique topical pain relievers\nContains too safe and effective anesthetics nothing as work better for\nSalon ... plus cream or wrong side are\nLoaded arms Canada in a last minute trade deal helps President Trump deliver on a key campaign promise and GE replaces its German a half a trillion dollars later those stories next ...\nStuck in the health care roller coaster [noise]\nHe's\nNot knowing what to tell me\nHow you found it really is sharing solution people like you have been tracking it twenty five years members recording teeming around five hundred dollars a month and they have kept me never\nPay for things they don't believe in [noise]\nTaken by that because\nThey have to share\nPoll eight five forty one Bible to find out how much you can save on your health care measure called eight five forty one Bible that eight five forty one Bible\nA major trade victory for President Trump Canada late last night agreed to join the trade deal between the United states and Mexico delivering on a major twenty six seen presidential campaign pledge overall map to Canada held out right up to the deadline but to picture related to the president's demands last like\nThanks to write a lame duck Senator Jeff flake the Supreme Court opens its new session today without nominee Brett Kavanaugh who's ... has been delayed by totally pointless FBI investigations into charges dating back to his high school years\nG.

I Want to send us to one's twice through your out put him on hold for a second and\nLet God [noise]\nI like that that's kind of good let's go to John ... a driving in Missouri John you're on was mark [noise]\nHey mark high [noise]\nYeah I haven't heard anybody oh man on Dr hoard statement when she was talking about on a powerful or their husband and they were doing [noise]\nRemodel owner in three mile up like ... yeah\nAnd she had requested a second door and her husband and wife to hurry so why would we need a second I'm Out of the yeah\nAnd she clearly Michael meant that she was afraid that one day the more that attack might be a Supreme Court justice and this is what they take out oil when they were making that been\n[noise] yeah but what's what's your point I thought you had a\nI mean I just think it's funny that she would put that while I Would like to believe that that would be in the way she won in her statement something back in the oil white carpet when he was even as\nWell but he was a as a federal judge you know the circuit court or whatever they call that the the district court he was being considered for that previously so maybe that's why she brought up\nAnd ... you know even the whole thing with a ... you know so many years later they're going to come back and attack you so her answer would be let me defend her now that she was so traumatized by this whole incident that that that's the result that many years later\nSecond according to their testimony from the comfort that she and her husband rented rented that they were having marital problems that end the notes counsellors had this episode\nThat she describes are courting during the last eight to ... percent for men wearing pop\nDon't hurt tested on my own economic that very specific Nineteen eighty through and catch Kavanaugh so that's another lie\nLetter why was she was flying out frayed flying well that's a ridiculous she and her husband fly all over the world but that was another line another language hide the fact that her brother\nHas a relationship with Peter\nI'm\nPut a little bit right now but only three people were low so I think that that needs to be investigated\nAs well you know an awful lot about the woman that was very emotional I felt that women really relate an emotional testimony mhm and they find it hard to back away from it but it was not factual off did you hear an actual question for not taking\nCare of did you hear the code I ... a ton of paraphrase what Thomas duck Thomas all said that you can't confuse the motion with facts right she was really good on that emotional level right and and a lot of women especially with others related to that but you just said\nIt but that has nothing to do necessarily with it being factual Carol ... go go to your job now okay\nI Will\nGo but his shoulders are saying to me that people are so affected by this or even if President Trump doesn't seem to be as as emotional you guys are said oh no see what happens is a\nGood man is a fine man but this was really upsetting since the OJ Simpson trial maybe were struck I was on for Larry Elder one day when uh the struck testimony happened I mean this is really hitting people hired by the way the response all this is you got to come out and vote you got to come out and such big numbers\nThat it it makes a huge difference is not enough just it it's great that you know we give me a chance to express your feelings about what we we can't let these people get away with it and since I mentioned Sondra in Florida go ahead you're on a with mark\nJust scratch\nA radio on so that's a delay you there's something okay I've got to chew on hold because it's going to really make you crazy if you listen to the radio or jak in Annapolis, Maryland Jack you're on with mark jak yes\nMark thank you sure are there's appointed to be being I'm not talked about and that was at the beginning of the question\nOf Dr Ford she was asked how she found out about the party\nAnd she said that there was a pool boy aren't attendant or a friend that was at the pool told her about it and and she ended up uh you know going from that information she was asked who that person was then she said she wanted to keep that person anonymous well I think that's a key point from the fact that there is an individual out there who can tell\nWho held the party and we're the party was because that person told\nFord weren't was now I understand the anonymity but this is a very important point we have someone who she identified who she not willing to say who it is who can place or at the party\nBack on the ... who held the party\nYeah I I missed that part I was probably teaching moments but if that happened I it seems significant to me if you have someone who can ... your story at least place you their rights and in fact maybe he knows when it happened where a lot better than she does right that doesn't make sense everybody seems\nTo be focusing on how she got home but I think we need to focus on how she identified that part who were the party was and who wasn't there seemed to be an individual who told her exactly that information who we should be able to find out who was then cocaine corroborate the whole thing or cannot\nYou know it's really scary Sean these guys are doing a better job with the questioning Mitchell's there\nI mean you guys are asking and stuff I've missed some of it may be a little off there but\nUh I I I thought that was fair game also in the ... one of my friends of Tennessee said to me something about how to cheat she said she could people couldn't hear her but yet she heard them laughing there are so many things that one could have asked her about and maybe we'll call her in the inconsistencies but it seems like they\nTreated her with

I. S. L. E. R. at AOL dot com Dennis will be back tomorrow which may have you've done over the years and I appreciate that very much\nAnd you can also keep in touch with me on Facebook or Twitter at the ... show and you'll find out where else I appear besides Phil against a dentist or Larry or whatever in the last star talked about the Supreme Court the Kavanaugh nomination\nHearings and how despicable many of the Democrats and the left we're in our and many of you ... they they're all trying to get two and a little bit I just want to for some other ideas out to you\nI Want you first to consider the importance of a quote that my one of my brothers share with me from our second president John Adams here's the quote\nIs more important that innocence be protected than it is that guilt be punished for guilt and crimes are so frequent in this world that they cannot all be punished but if innocence itself is brought to the bar and condemn\nPerhaps to die than the critics will say whether I Do good or whether I Do evil is immaterial for innocence itself is no protection\nAnd such an ideas that were to take hold in the mind of the citizen that would be the end up security whatsoever that's partially what's taking place that's uncalled by the way\nDo the Democrats I threw out there know what their unleashing do they care\nThey're destroying one of the basic tenants of our republic\nThe presumption of innocence they are asking for trouble they're also asking for trouble if they want to go back to high school and check everybody's teenage years\nWho among us is so proud of those years and where's the bank account of thirty five years if he even committed what he's accused of as a teenager I thought we at least the left I thought they believed in redemption and they haven't left\nThat wants people to be forgiven even those who commit capital offense\nBut now the teenage years are in play and maybe soon part of that the junior high years\nAnd by the way I Believe you confess to some sexual assault ... senator Cory Booker during those years how come you were still in the sense\nAnd I thought Joe Biden plagiarize while he was in college how come he was vice president and senator cotton tweeted\nSenator watch this I knew about this but here's the tweet senator Blumenthal lied for years about serving in Vietnam which is all you need to know about his courage and honesty maybe he should reconsider before questioning judge Kavanaugh's credibility\nEven the New York times reported that this is me now Blumenthal has said he served in Vietnam when in fact just the times when the facts but at least five military deferments and eventually landed a spot in the marine reserve\nWhere he used was ... was eventual guaranteed not to serve in the conflict itself senator Blumenthal ask Kevin off he was familiar with I mispronounced the Latin false listening you know\nFalse us in on the bus which the legal principle that dictates jurors can rule a witness to be false and everything if he says one thing that is not true\nExcuse me senator Blumenthal but that does that also apply to you\nOr do you have a six different now for lying\nI watch these hearings and I felt like I was living in an alternate universe tell me if you felt the same way if you're on the other side I'll take your view and the other side I Want to get calls from people who disagree why it all makes sense do you want to prayer seven seven six\nNow another thing I Want you to consider this in my home state of California I suggested on Facebook\nThat Senator Feinstein deserves consequences for her do publicity and Republicans should vote for her opponent who may be further less than she is like knowledge that my brother another brother suggested this to me because what difference will make whether a leftist is replaced by far left\nI remember years ago comedian Mort Saul said that voters are often given a choice between Tweedle dum and Tweedle dum are\nNow it's much less innocent than that and what's the big difference between a choice between left and far left\nOne at least he's telling you where they stand and going for the kill all at once\nAnd the other is a phony torturing you slowly but surely that Senator Feinstein\nCalifornia's going down the tubes anyway so why don't we let them get their quicker I live here so we might be able to pick up the pieces sooner some day or maybe if they as they tried to do they can succeed and form their own Venezuela here are my ...\nGovernor Brown thinks global warming is the biggest issue we face and he is a sworn enemy of President Trump so let them go to the left is utopia\nAnd let's get the pain over with what do you think of that idea let's get Republicans to vote for senator finds things far left opponent and give her some consequences for her to plus city\nTell me what you think of that I did too and when he ... six\nIt's time we realize we're in a civil war with the left for the soul of this country\nSo then you can tell me what you think ... at the phone number that I just mentioned to you and just listening if you didn't hear the first hour the emotions the outrage that this was captured the American people like nothing else I don't think maybe since the OJ Simpson trial because maybe ... people out there starting to realize what we're in\nThat the lie and they'll do anything to destroy somebody alright I promised I go to your calls so let's go to Tom has been waiting forever Tom England or you're on with mark\nMarket is great to hear you substituting so sue perfectly for that is like and talk to you again I really miss your old Saturday Night show a few killers\nGuile well you you got to ... because I Do other stuff too so just to see where I Am okay what\nPhase me mark from the depression or my two precious three and five year old granddaughters to the ... I tell you I I totally nuts without without those we arts mark for your call Jeff Flake or pool is only one thing wrong you're insulting fool\nI read this note that Democrats have fallen into such and on the ... we carry infinitely deep\nMoral of this when you disagree with your age or no matter what they foster victim would constantly\nThey just said the constitution\nThey ate the free market as personal freedom we know that in the socialist state of California and they are lovers of socialism which is the government crushing people in the most vile way just look at that as a way lower and mark\nMy theory is if we don't vote them out as you suggested we must they will get a screen go whoa almost in perpetuity on Supreme Court they will do anything they can to push their freedom killing socialist agenda and\nThe future of this country as a once great bass you bring them that our founding fathers created will be forever gone\nThanks Tom and you said a very well I can I can feel free to say this Bill Clinton's line I can feel the pain out there it is it's obvious and let's go to a I like Josh in San Antonio is question or comment go ahead Josh\nI'm taking my call sure you\nKnow I just wanted to basically say that ah you know in my own reaction in any way to the testimony early or testimony which I think a Republican may have gone at it a little bit\nOf wrong angle I think maybe that they won't when you come up you can't really question anybody's memory without coming off a little bit ... especially in a I'm a one of the victim you're talking about starting to think that they should have basically just said hey we understand that you're that you're you've been going through a rough time and they might have happened to you\nAnd your incredible were not questioning that at all I think that what they should have done it that\nIf the if there was a terrible situation where somebody brought us evidence or brought you in a in a legit accusation but had no evidence what would you do and they're not giving our options you would have no no chance other than to say that what happened is that it requires corroborating evidence in order to destroy somebody's life\nIf they could have gone around to that then they're going to be like do we need your help to bring some evidence that there is any evidence and then from there she wouldn't have been accused of not remembering\nI'd like your style that's that's that would have been a good way to do it unless you may have different or lawyers who knows and they would have had some objections saying she's not here to answer that kind of a question I don't know you never know what but it but I like your approach thanks a lot of trash\nAnd I knew had a good comment there let's go uh let's continue the really ... in some ways even though you know how I feel Jan\nIn Marietta, Georgia you're on with mark\nHey mark thanks for taking my call sure\nThat's real quick ... one of the thing there are many things that I\nI think that I thought for a doctor Ford and her testimony but one really important thing was\nWhen she said after they decided that attack 'em that she saw a judge\nA friend that within the room and did not help her and laugh Eric lay out that what was going on\nAnd she said when she saw him he was very uncomfortable when she said hello what and when you're a girl\nOkay we'll give you a little question at the end mark I suffered in the spring\n\nThe courage is not there this flight cause someone\nA costume or wherever it was an elevator on the floors of the Senate whatever and starts yelling at him he admits that was part of his decision to\nSuggest that we have a another week of the stuff I mean we're we're as the courage Democrats would give them credit for one thing\nThey circle the wagons and they fight for their own and they know the battle or in that's been the problem with the Republicans do you really know what we're up against for them this war this is their

been ... with the Democrats were also liberals\nLike Alan Dershowitz simply would have said\nLook if I were Dianne Feinstein and she weren't interested in the blood sport of gutting this nominee a

there is a long time ago this doesn't come across\nThe threshold for me to pursue and I wouldn't be the end of it\nAnd the army speaking of Dianne Feinstein center Feinstein did you I don't know if you heard me suggests that Republicans and you're the national committee men for public after the Republican Party in California that maybe we should vote for her opponent so there's some consequences for what she's doing what she did the\nTop two primary system is another unique the listeners should know that some other disasters ... nature of California that you're allowed to vote for two people doesn't matter\nOnly two people who get the highest number of votes regardless of party affiliation we have no primaries anymore minor parties disappeared in California so not consequently we get one crazy Democrat too far left wing ... Democrat\nAs our only choices for US Senate we can't even write in it's a terrible idea Democrat activists say the Republican activists have that certain ... folks love it\nAnd it and so what we have is a Dianne Feinstein or as as a left wing opponent and Sean steals not going to vote for either one I Can't even right in what about what about\nMark suggests nice if people are so upset I tell you this I I felt like going to measure the fights are jumping Bill Carrick or you know for many years and say you know\nWhat you're going to have those is the average Republican voter the average Republican or not so we should just get it doesn't know that Kevin de Leon her opponent is more left wing than she is fresh so they're gonna viscerally react against blindsided by voting for the other Democrat but you do for your people national listening to the show they say ... what is your way or the future be where with this is is\nThat when they were so called primary to the top two vote getters go into the general election matter what so if the Democrats are strategizing and take over your state when November comes you have a choice between bad to worse\nNow that's what it is it's ... it's not only my idea of other people to suggest that I think we should vote for her opponent and maybe she will win\nRight if you want to be tactical do you say okay if she gets re elected she did or eighties she's getting less less energy I just watched the way she walked to the podium to talk to Senator Grassley their groups Elvis not super high energy there like you get Kennedy wrote he's a younger person he will be around for years\nSo he won't have seniority that she'll have but he'll be a threat to us in a while I posted this on Facebook people are upset with me and they did say what\nWas ... that for dying find since she was like more or less the kind of a semi acceptable Democrat because she wasn't as crazy as as as her colleagues but now she joined that that that group and now we're back to the Salem witch trials in Salem witch trials relationship disabled broad right I was gonna say yeah exactly\nBut this was an Salem, Massachusetts a sixty Ninety two they could you know there were ... there's a hysterical people that were making crazy accusations against a a number of women there were hung\nA and they were accused of being which is and it wasn't even against what they did but it was it was their ghost that did\n... full disclosure is I knew she wants to you when he was in high school\nFor ... you know let let that go I don't want to hear any more about that I Will do want to ask you though what she credible some listener picked on me saying all your talk shows are saying she had some measure of credibility\n... she was extremely well prepared she's a psychologist she's done this or all like she's been practicing this role for for many years to come she had a group of very smart media savvy lawyers and no she wasn't I thought she gave a good story\nAnd that was effective it was a great presentation but when you dig into and you see that nothing about her story her life story makes any sense at all but\nYou say that and I agree with you but are Republicans they didn't say she wasn't credible one of your callers I think the point we always start out by giving her credibility there\nWell you know because we want to be courteous ... not to be angry against women and and the ... and possibly somebody who was actually had this experience pitch you got the wrong guy and she probably knows in her mind in her heart of hearts that she got the wrong guy but she's she's she's a tool often but you know it's like our\nOur theory they leak the fact we're going to have a women or a woman a question her because we don't want these Republican mail is such a self defeat your your consult right so is that a smart move will certainly terrible for the first of all\nIt was a good move that to have these senators not grandstanding my I'm a you know ed Royce when each year the foreign affairs committee they hid it in ...\nAnd ... and I looked at it was awful but it wasn't at he's competing but every house member one have their day in the Sunday or their Fifteen minutes of fame so there was no choreography no strategy no coordination\nSo they were wary of that I get that but why should I have to read the New York times Washington Post is going to be a Republican tactics secondly they never should have done the traditional thing alternating Democrat Republican and giving a ... I Know that I saw the assumed that she was ... I mean I've been crosses damned if you have a minimum you want to keep going\nSo he can do we have lawyers on our site as their US Senators who\nAre so it after that they agreed to this form it rather say look OU Democrats could go through all used up there when you're done we're going to have our first question or\nThey should have had you there was a ... again the Republicans were in a bind there they're looking at all the stats and appalled and women are angry and I've been walking away as a sizable number of maybe ten twenty percent of women are walking away voting against Republicans because they think Republicans are but\nIn in ... in this sharing a I'm Glad to see something a little bit uniquely different I like what Chuck Grassley is generally done\nHe's kept to tell you I Know what I have kept the tough schedule and look he's got a real problem at you and I don't have\nTo face in daily life he has to get eleven boast about Twenty one person committee staff and like like like you know so the whole hearing loss for one person in the universe was for Jeff Flake ... got his hearing any voted out and I told you last year and what was your flakes name before he changed it a you know what I think it was more than that way it's sad to say\nA Jeff weasel yeah and then he changed ... thought it was ... a lucky we got us vote I got to tell you something I'm grateful for that now\nFlakes got another week going on with this I think it's actually good and I'm going to tell you my cold calculating political reasons yes making my team very angry fired up their team's been angry and fired up for two years now it's about time our team wakes up understand smell the roses we have a nasty enemy here they're ... they're trying to take over the house of representatives\nAnd if you think it's bad today wait till you see Maxine Waters in charge of a major committee that's really going to put us over the\nIt's very scary if you were to look if the Democrats take control would who would share the the major\nAnd he's in the house it's it's a rogues gallery of I mean you when you see people who are going to be an arm tourists\nThey couldn't get a security clearance there people are going to be having oversight or the CIA officer the message clearly it's as I said you gotta you know be enthused enough to go out there and vote and get everybody you know look at the at the at the national strategy 'cause we have a national leadership there\nThe Democrats are counting on for example getting a few seats here in California like let's say Dana Rohrabacher\nAnd you talk to conservatives in Washington they're not yet energized\nThey don't realize that this was a battle out here they just look at Republican registration so if you live in orange county right that you got to come out for dinner or what is the ... national implications how few how she can do and make the different anti ... and I think average voters don't understand what it means when one party controls that chamber the Senate or the house there it means\nThat they control the committees that uh it it is Maxine Waters who they're\nIt to be fulltime impeachment twenty flat\nOut not only that Orange County as the pathway for Nancy Pelosi we've got four seats at risk we got great candidates oddly enough of the four seats we got three women running the Democrats are three guys running\nSo so the ... so in other words we're we're we got the right demographics you've got the right approach or getting out spent two to one six to one and some of these races we need a muscle up and get curious and show up like the Tea Party yet in two thousand and ten\nSo that's the conclusion we we got to get out there to all our listeners out there where are our women candidates were born women it's OK was judge Kevin are credible\nThat was a blessing I I you know you ... you heard that you heard the speech is a little you know girlie boys at that that we heard in the morning but you know the terrible victim and she looked good she had the makeup was she didn't have any makeup on\nA she had a nice smile a by the way our entire statement was pre written and and circulated did you know that it wasn't a spontaneous statement she she was All right now by her lawyers the jihad jihad rehearsed for several weeks probably for for many years of her life because\nFor some reason she got this weird obsession against Kavanaugh cabinet came through not ... with without notes and gave gave us heart and was it was a triumph\nOf the ... and that's why he's a he's going to get nominated\nSean steal our Nissan burn your calls ... seven seven six markets are filling in for ...
