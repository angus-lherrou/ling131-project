a cloud of chaos and the political conversation so it's an honor to be with you truly\nWell that's very touch because of who you are so thank you but I I Want to focus on you and your book\nAnd the news items that I just read about you and campus Owens but first let me tell everybody he's written this book campus battlefield how conservatives can win the battle on campus\nAnd why it matters so campus battlefield the bookers up a dentist Prager dot com if anybody knows the campus battlefield is turning point you have people all over the country\nAt universities all over the country who are members of the pie USA I folks have spoken for his conventions all around the country will be Newport Beach in oh was it ... this week and\nYou and I was in Florida for you and you know I just want people to know I spoke ... was Washington DC cause I remember that the Donald Trump junior was with me a behind the scenes there and are you a twenty five hundred students didn't view\nThat that's correct yeah you spoke our high school audience and you spoke to us on the Palm Beach and in fact you also a book at our chapter at the University of Wyoming or ... or ... people selfish I was an excellent speech and I think a chapter\nAt Colorado State university is also hosting you know I in the near future as well so uh\nI just want people to know how much we work together it's it's it's a powerful thing and that's the reason I mentioned that but I just want people understand twenty five hundred students from around the country usually the cheap and such a very big deal and I I just want to salute you for that\nAnd if you when you go to something like that my dear listeners you you get some optimism\nShow you or your subtitle of your book is how conservatives can win\nThe battle on campus All right go ahead how we are a lot of we win\nWell first of all the premise that I come forth in this book is one that you talk about a lot which is what we believe we're in you know a civil war and it's a culture war for the soul of this country and politics of Andrew Breitbart used to say first downstream from culture and the most in\nCourt vertical and culture is our university um they are they are filled with ...\nProfessor a lead but as you always permanently said Dennis ... not very much wisdom that goes on there and what\nWhat I found by touring these campuses and speaking at you know over a hundred a year and now having an organization that spans Thirteen hundred of them across the country is that it's not that students are opposed the conservative ideas\nIt's that they're not exposed them at all the first place bravo so and and the ... that I put together in this book is actually ... and it it said it in some ways it quite soon creeping ocean but we have to show up it's remarkable\nTo me how many students are searching for this message they have a desire to hear a different viewpoint and for whatever reason the universities have silent film and it's quite simple\nMy conclusion I've come to is they hate the idea that there are other ideas are but why not liberal there's very few liberal out there and what the law that they are focused on silencing any opinion that might ... model rhetoric\nUm control over the intellectual an ideological um viewpoint of a generation and so just just yesterday I spoke in South Florida we packed a room with eight hundred students\nDay before that we have two thousand students at the University of Georgia\nWait a minute wait whoa that's a big deal it really\nIs your weight you have you with you on campus or just you got\nA candidate selling myself to shoot the real draw so I kind of just\nGo oh you're just humble guy okay I mean you're both ... but that that's very significant to south forgive me I Want to underscore what you said very briefly\nThe issue my dear dear listeners ... they have never heard our side it is not so much that they are from the left you just that they have no idea that there was a non molest way of approaching life\nThat's exactly right and\nAnd what what I find the work that pregnant university does and what we're doing on the ground is that when students are presented these arguments in a logical factor reckon\nI'm non feeling sense if you will because every ... doctors rooted in the ocean\nAnd it's rooted in Greenland and as you've caught so many millions of people Dennis very few people care about how you feel we care about how you act and even more importantly what you think and why you think about what you do and so what we have found is that\nStudents that have any sort of ambition\nStudents that have any sort of sense of human decency or wants to do something in their life on there's no way they can find a ... ... because the left is all about tribal identity politics\nIt is about you can never\nYou can never improve yourself you have to blame the external for any sort of suffering that you might being being experiencing source students that might have what some would say classical liberal years on gay marriage or abortion they're leaving the less\nIn record numbers because if they didn't believe him some step on the free enterprise\nOr they think that black only dormitories or a bad idea\nThen all of a sudden you're considered to be a right wing or art service at the at the university and so the second part that I highlight this book is how radical universities have become and it it is important for your listeners to understand the Democrat Party the sixties and seventies but JFK type Democrats\nThose are considered to be fringe right wing radicals Allen College campuses\nIf you believe that there are two genders if you believe in free enterprise\nSystem if you believe America is the greatest country average like that those are considered fringe ideology and because of that you know the left that somebody's doing us a favor it allows us to recruit decent minded students that\nQuite frankly say there's no way I Want to believe in this cultural Marxist group here that is being shut down my throat by my professors um and then the third point I make in the book which is really really important is how the conservative business community has subsidized that's who they are giving over the last couple of decades um\nIt is amazing to me you go walk you walk the halls of Harvard or Yale or Princeton a majority of the big\nGifts that are given at the university's worth a worst indoctrination occurs\nThanks to the giving of conservative successful business people that have allowed the Marxist to have unlimited amount of funds to indoctrinate generation after generation and so it's really a call to action to parents and to a one night to stop giving money to ... university not give it to ... university that the different\nTo stop giving money your actual school you went to first of all they don't need it\nSuck it up they're going to use your money\nTo go against your values are program a generation to hate America and that that really needs to be reinforced that goes through all this ... levels are given how universities corrupt the or the ... process and how they deceived donors into thinking it's going toward the targeted\nOn initiative or program when in reality it goes toward\nCultural studies or feminist studies and allow these professors to continue their um\n... yeah that's a good book the book folks again this campus battlefield Charlie Kirk founder and president of turning point usa the book is up but then it's probably good outcome would you please tell my audience what has happened with DePaul University\nYeah I mean DePaul University which is a private school in Chicago a Catholic school\nUm has a lot I guess that that candidate selling myself are not allowed on after next week despite the fact that we followed all their protocol odd that we feel about all the forms\nThat they asked us to you and and they're not that they really and that's a common tactic of the last ... the mayor and we can disagree with that and that and partly Kirk on they express violent language that could be demeaning to work\nBy the way I Want you to know that that is another example of why I say the left law he's with the ease with which you brief this isn't that you wouldn't engage in violent language give the example she said she's black and she said blacks shouldn't vote Democrat and that is considered violent language\nThat that's correct and ... so the Olympics actor for the law they learn that\nAll they have to have seven or eight students feel they're threatened by it hurt bicker and the breaks a picture like within a moment's notice and so the actor there have been trained by the professors Oprah and port professor gone that\nKeeps them they are claiming mhm if he could\nAllow the crack dialogue it allows disagreement that allows you point to her daughter is a professor of none of that that anger and they're really really good at it\nYou hold on there okay Charlie Kirk my guess the book campus battlefields\nI'm going to the dentist Springer show flying from the relief factor pain free usually the\nSchool a movie every child extent the weapon ideas do right without whatsoever like on on that and I didn't\nWrite and they only of Arizona right so there are only two ways and that is to have to consider not sending your kid to a school and home schooling them\nOr is a two and two and to provide a positive alternative and that is through the great books through the Bible through ... university videos me there is
