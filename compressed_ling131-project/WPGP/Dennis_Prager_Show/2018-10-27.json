{"month": "10", "state": "PA", "station": "WPGP", "content": "Here's what I Love about the show 'cause I don't have this written down and I don't do a lot of things other than just kind of have an ally but this thought of them sure you have people that come in with an old family heirloom maybe only part of the ring or a the band or whatever and or they want something done to to make it their own but they want the ... how do you deal with that I Would think you get a lot of that not\nNow you're tapping into a personal passion that are gay during the day I Love that you know I'm I'm I'm sentimental you know like ... you know we kinda live in a little bit more of a disposable world now where we just don't expect anything to really last and\nAnd you know we completely understand where you may have guarding jewelry from family members you know grandparents would ever that don't match your taste but there's elements of that whether it be the diamonds gems loans\nThat are essential in the court to that piece and that's why most common things we do is take those and actually create designed for customers to take you know take part of that history part of their family and recreated into something beautiful that they will wear enjoy as well rather than just disposing of it\nSo between that and then just general customers nation that's just a great reason for people to come see it give you a call find out what what all you can do for before they just go out and buy something\nYeah I mean it's worth you know if nothing else is worth talking to us to see what we can do for them 'cause I don't think a lot of people realize what the possibilities are endless said they're not walked into a box where they just have to pick this or that I mean they can make anything that to heart desires you\nWell let's fast forward a little bit ah then we're talking with mark held Herman from trinity jewelers located on mountain ... road he's here with us with a special leadership is burg let's let's hit the last few years and leadership in your life there's a lot of things going on in Pittsburgh I Know you're involved in some of those you get involved in the events were doing\nTell us a little bit about the people now in the city some of the pastors retail whoever it is it may have affected you or even if there's a ministry what what what really hits your your leadership\nBuzz here well I think for me I seek out\n'cause you can't you can't um\nExperience teacher so much so I Try to look for mentors and kind of my life you know and it starts with your pastor I mean they have life used that\nCannot be measure that we can't ever understand you know the old joke you know he says up on Sunday I mean pastor shift as a twenty four hour job and and the and the different you know direct things that they deal with you know there's so much wisdom there\nAnd I've also make sure to surround myself with mentors you know I'm ... and you know I have one gentleman in particular that's not even in the jewelry business but just as a as a life mentor for me 'cause really\nEven though you know it's important to me to trinity successful but what's more important to me as the integrity of trinity of who you are you know and how we Christ through everything that we do [laughter] so I you know it doesn't have to be just in business type mentors you know I Would encourage people to look for those people you say\nThis is you know when I look ahead and I look at ... you know\nRetirement are beyond in my legacy\nThis type this person this is who I Want to be reflected at us and then you try to emulate that and and you know you learn from them and and are heading that direction\nTo find someone good to follow yeah exactly [laughter] well that you've been involved I think it or a ten things like the man up that goes on around here with focus folks and those kind of conferences that are available to us here luckily\nFor me the biggest blessing and and I don't I never understood how much this could impact my life is what\nYou know how God has blessed trinity to with a growth that we've had him around a third edition and\nAnd but the ... the ability of as a successful businessman of being able to give back and and the ministries that you can be involved with I mean we're you know usually involved like you said with urban impact and I mean just all these different ministries it's\nIt's so fulfilling to be in a position to help ministry and moved that forward\nWell that's why a lead you into that [laughter] you jump jump there but I wanted to go there that's very important to you and I want people to hear that too if you're involved in business it's important to have that give back mentality philanthropy minister whatever it is that you feel God is calling you to do but uh don't get so caught up as you mentioned earlier so caught up in the business that you forget some of these other things\nAbsolutely I mean growth is great we all want to see growth and mostly from even even the people that are part of the trinity doors family but the more important thing is what what are you doing to give back and what are you you know benefiting from that business\nGood fun question I have a that I usually like to ask and all of these leadership is ... and I don't necessarily that people know that I'm going to ask you about\nHow some of the things either from church or for the business in the leadership things you've seen have actually helped in the home or even vice versa you some of the trends and things that you've seen come across there and and I think mentoring the big one\n'cause a lot of ways you mentioned your kids are Twenty one I always argue with people that no I'm not a parent for life I might be a mentor or even like in an elder situation but we need to raise kids up to be their own so that they go to raise kids and so on and so on is that mentor aspect how have you seen some of that cross over\nA without question I you know and even from a standpoint of what I've learned now you know I certainly feel a certain you know not responsibility but passion to give that back\nAlso to help others you know\nI'm In you know I have a lot of that again I have a lot of friends that um stores all across the country and and sharing ideas and just trying to again you know looking towards my mentor say okay how do I then reflect the same way that he does to me how to live and reflect down to the next generation and so on\nAnd um you know the biggest thing is is the children you know it's the children of Pittsburgh because that's where we have to change in their hearts and minds and their futures 'cause there's so much available for them\nBut I think we have to keep ... they've all got individual backgrounds and they've they've some of them from good families bad whatever that situation but there's still an individual that if we get involved in their lives that maybe the thing God's going to use to change them right then right exactly and in the past can be changed I mean from that standpoint you can you can get away from the\nWall and they have to see good role models they have to see what would it means to be a man to be you know in all aspects whether it be you know marriage most important who you are as a husband you know who you are as a business owner\nThey have to see that there's more to it than just chase in dollars and and you know going that route\nOne of the things we talk about around here a lot is occasionally you know we got to have fun sometimes for what what's your what's your what's your phone button I don't want I don't want to see that I ah I was getting put your leisure your activity what do you like to well\n[noise] the more the merrier as far as er and I love to have fun I mean you know I Love boating water skiing or riding motorcycles\nUm but honestly the most fun as friendships you know I mean that's that's another thing I encourage people to you know develop awesome friendships and you know that's the thing that indirectly through business you know and and you hear even here where I Am\nI you know they they say you know if you can have a couple of good friends in your life you know that you really are true friends that you really blessed and I'm truth I'm way beyond that I I I sometimes just say God you know this is unbelievable I feel so blessed I have so many people\nThat are proof friends that you know that it just it was my life and I encourage people to do the same\nAnd from what I Love you you're pretty uh pretty much a black and gold guy to\nOh yeah I think I was you know we got to get them through the play off the air and stuff\nAnd then come I don't know if we get the penguins around to a third a third Stanley Cup or not\nThey got some work to do that it is kind of neat though that the city color that's all the things you know that I Know they're all the thing I like the fact that the uh it doesn't matter to me where you're black and gold and your your goal no matter what the season it is but I think you bring up a good point in the friendship aspect because that's where leadership can really happened one on one you may find\nSomeone that boy they could really use something new near you might ... he's been through that or she's been they could really help here I think that's a great point the dynamic of a friendship is huge fellowship within the church\nA fellowship of the church's most important especially you know beyond even just attending church but getting into small groups getting to you know developed I mean some of the closest relationships we have in our lives and my wife and I or you know fruit small group and getting the people at a deeper level\nThrough in in a church being a big thing to you and the involvement there and and I know that's huge for most of the people we have on here this morning about race yeah as we can bring that out here in these in these programs and let people hear what's important to you about church and what what involvement you've had and what leadership you'd learn their\nYeah well it's all my life lessons come from the Bible in church you know that's number one and I I feel like if you as close as you can adhere to those everything else is going to fall in place you know so much of what's happened with trinity and its growth and the great things have happened there\nReally when I look back and do wild mark you didn't have a lot to do it you know they're always going to be near saying wow God is really cool and what he does you know I mean\nHe just puts things in place and sets courses that you don't even see coming as not until you're looking back you go oh I didn't I never saw that but you know if you get everything else in order a God really does take care of you and and send you in the right directions\nWhile we appreciate you being in her barge spent a great time chatting with you let's talk again real quick about where the story is given the phone number and the website because again\nWe don't always want to be doom and gloom and I know that surround the holiday season where people like to be afraid or scared of certain things but finances are definitely never one of them\nAnd when you're looking at people with thirty five percent of all Americans are about Seventy seven million of them\nHave at least one dead in collections with an average tab well over five thousand dollars that's full Cape Fear homeless or we can consolidate that get rid of that stop letting it make compound interest because it will come after you\nBack in the back back in the day people used to say well I'll just ignore him for seven years senator will disappear\nThis day and age there are so many collection agencies out there that they just sell it to another collection agency if they weren't able to get you to pay it off the not agency will sell it to another\nAgency so it keeps renewing itself that that just keeps compounding income pounding and that snowball keeps getting bigger that dead of yours is never going to go away so it's something to pay attention to because those that rule of thumb that people live by before that\nMagic seven years and then it disappears doesn't apply anymore it's about being responsible for the debt that you have and maybe you can make a settlement on it\nBut just show up and we can help you get on track with that another great thing that I'm you know we're talking about Sarah that you mentioned before was with the Bloomberg report ... student loan debt\nRight I mean ... look through the roof\nIt is through the roof he said it was a hundred and fifty\nSeven percent and hire fifty seven percent increase on student loan debt and um it's the rates are usually even the government loans are at seven to nine percent of the parent plus program seven percent just to go sign let's say to bring that money out for your children and the interest rates on mortgages are super low so a mortgages are good that\nWe could very easily refinance and take that money out but it's astronomical\nThan it is evident when you're looking at that number that's one point four trillion dollars in student loan debt and with a lot of parents coast signing for their children or just taking you know this parent plus student loans out those are loans that are directly relying on your credit as well\nSo that impacts your ability to borrow why not take it out through your mortgage why not just give us a quick\nThree to five minute phone call we can talk about how we can get it done for you so that way you write it off on your\nDebt at the end it there and also you get that low fixed interest rate payment we all want to help our children and we all want to see them succeed we all want them to be able to go to the best college and have no worries we all have that tree and let us help you make the help that much talked about it\nI mean when you're putting things into perspective\nWhich student loan debt forty four million borrowers\nThat's forty four million borrowers oh\nSix hundred and twenty\nBillion more than what just credit card debt is in the United states that is a horrible statistics\nDish is a horrible statistic because it's fixable I'm not saying college education is it worth it I'm not saying don't let your children go to the College of their dreams or\nLive the dream that they want to and get that great education it's about doing things the wisest way the smart way if you have Apple's it's about putting the right apples and write baskets it's that simple\nAnd you have to look also at credit card that the average American spends one dollar and thirty three cents for every dollar that they earn one dollar in thirty three cents for every dollar that you earned that is putting so many more Americans in debt\nYou're having more debt than you're having savings and with\nOver the years the average spending has increased thirty percent it's not your fault that the groceries have gone up it's not your fault that the gas prices have gone up\nBut it it can be fixed through your rights changes with how you're spending your money where are you getting your money from\nAnd who are you paying your money to let's start making ourselves richer instead of the big bang structure let's start putting that money back in our pocket\nAnd making sense out of where that money comes from what the average debt upwards of thirty eight thousand dollars and just credit card you're going to be internally indebted because even though that amount might not seem very large\nWhat that amount turns to in order to be paid off\nIs the scary part of it because that's money that could be saved invested for you your family your faith your children let's look at about where that money's going how it's going and how quickly\nWe can do that for you all it takes is I'm not kidding you a quick easy several minute phone call any time of day even on the weekends and we can help make that magic happen for you and make sure that your financial future is on the right path\nSo he can always reach us you can literally go onto the website and set up a time even to chat with us or the website is ... and the and teach cheat dot com and then you can schedule time weekends evenings are fine\nI'm ... and you can always call us a one eight hundred six six to nine five zero\nUh the question right now with ... where we are even with credit scores often we may want to refinance\nMay want to lower interest rates so we work with fifty wholesale banks were a family owned business and if you're looking at even buying a second property lower down payment options we go down to five eighty scores but even for folks of eight hundred scores it's well worth asking the question to see if we can do better on the interest rate\nUh because rates do change daily and it's important to have the lowest payment option as well\nA and one of the key parts of even Pennsylvania here in Pittsburgh\nWe've noticed you want to pay off the mortgage but the mortgages good debt so if you have credit card if you don't have enough money in retirement why not take money out of the home when values are going up and break are still low investing it in retirement fund investing in and\nPaying off that debt versus\nJust paying off the mortgage which is good debt and having all of this other bad debt so we're living longer folks are our projections are eighty seven years of age for for women men about eighty five but as the years go by their projecting a hundred two hundred and fifty years at Stanford statistics so\nI certainly think that's a positive but we have to plan if we are in a position where we don't have enough during our golden years so fixed income\nAgain that could be an issue if you don't have enough money put aside for health care issues that may come up\nA for even fun time or buying that second home and I said a ... it's always\nCall us and and just be curious because\nHere's one of the things with Pennsylvania and Florida we have a population very wise above sixty two years of age\nWho may not know the benefit of having a reverse mortgage and being able to choose to make a mortgage payment or not now this is not a question mark alone it is a government sponsored\nProgram you always keep the home and the deed and ownership\nOf the property and\nYou can ... or sell it whenever you wish its government sponsored so you do need to go through counseling and we pay for the appraisal\nAll about education and empowering our listeners and over the last fourteen years we've been able to share information about what is happening in the market because we work with\nFifty wholesale lender so it's just like as we're heading to the holidays going to the outlet store getting a better price on brand names but at a lower cost and with the war that we do our lenders pay off for the services\nSo you don't have to so please do asked the question and reach out to us that we have about two minutes left Christina so you have a little bit of time\nWell right around the corner is the holiday you know I ... I Do to\nOne of the scariest things so not Halloween but one of the scariest things is that people do end up spending a lot more in this heavy seas and a lot of people spend a lot more whether it's your\nGas or electric heat bills or and or whether it's decorations for the holiday season or it has a Christmas present shopping whatever the case is hall all the spending is a ritual in America to never going to change but one thing that's important is to stop the hangover\nAnd the hangover usually begins when you get that first credit card bill it's called the financial hangover great way to stop it is to talk to us now nip it in the bud let's get this going let's start saving because you're going to be the winners at the end of it quick five minute phone conversation can really\nChange your life take off those financial blenders and really open up a lot of opportunity for you let's increase the ability to borrow\nLet's increase the ability to spend more freely and to understand where your finances are quick little adjustments let us work our magic and put you on the path to financial freedom\nSoaked style with that call us at one eight hundred six six to nine five zero and again a final regulations to Alan levine engine Frasier well done for the many years of service that you provided on TV\nUh and receiving media war it's ah this past week as well as try and make it to the November third event with Bill Neal for the city a league hall of fame and um you can find out more by giving us a quick call as well one eight hundred six six to nine five zero\nToward financial issues working harder is not usually the way to eliminate a financial issues necessarily because if even if you work six or seven days a week if you are\nA holding on to a higher interest rate on the mortgage or if you have credit card issues uh ten Fifteen twenty thousand it's very hard to get off of that mission cycle because Eighteen percent rate is Fifteen thousand dollar credit card minimum four or five hundred dollars it's not even making a dent\nIn and sometimes you have an emergency you have to use that credit card again so it's bumping up to the limit which ends up bringing the score down so\nIf you're looking at buying a home for refinancing if you're looking at a credit score that's an issue if let's say you have a a higher debt to income ratio we can make sure\nThat we will give you that hope and give you the yes and we're happy to work with you we've had ... fourteen years ... away after a year they are they're ready to buy that home or refinance and then we have folks who are looking at\nAll I Want to buy this luxury home it's a million dollar property\nBut I'm getting a rate that's much higher my credit score is great why am I getting a five percent interest rate\nIt because when it comes to wholesale lending we're in a position to provide you a much lower interest rate and the four is even\nIf it's a million dollar property you're going to end up spending two thousand dollars more on a mortgage with the higher in the interest rate in the Sixers or the seven but with us You're going to keep that two thousand dollars a month which is going to equate to a million dollars in savings after Thirty years if not more imagine that so\nI really encourage folks ask questions where here for you dare night the number one eight hundred six six to nine five zero stay well folks\nIn the mortgage for family than those in those mortgages Kevin residential and commercial purchases refinancing out eight hundred sixty nine five\nThe breeding program

with Kevin Bach\nYeah good afternoon welcome to the show we appreciate you joining us here today my name is Jessica I'm alongside Mr Kevin Bach of integrity retirements delusion each and every Saturday afternoon right here on an ... the the answer we have to remember standing by right now for you to make an appointment with Kevin or just call and get those questions answered\nAgain Kevin has nearly three decades in the business seven\nDo for a three seven three five five three seven to for eight three seven three five five three\nAnd as always you can get more details and integrity retirement solutions\nDot com so much to talk about on the today show but it's always Kevin I Want to check in with you I Know you've been so busy each and every week you're on the show you get so many phone calls from listeners saying you know a Kevin I'm finally ready to sit down with you I've been listening to the show tell me what how those meetings are going\nOn right 'cause it's so fun to educate people all my life I I Do things to educate people in the wintertime on the weekends of course are the people on how to feel better on skis um I got out of a business for a while back I spent four years teaching the new owner\nOh how to make a successful I just love to teach people what they don't know\nFor with retirement planning an estate planning and everything that we do with our business it's an educational process\nWe sit down with people we educate them\nAnd almost every time ... yesterday friday we had a new car I come in\nAnd they're like why didn't we know all this for my um my mother eight years ago there was nobody or attorneys never told us that are bars are never told us that we could have been prepared today and we could have had all of our assets protected today if we would have known what you're teaching teaching us now eight years ago\nYeah you know I think it always comes down to you think you know everything until you find out that you don't buy into that time comes usually as the saying goes do everything with confidence if you're confident and no one would question you and that isn't anything that you do but when it comes to confidence in the financial world I think you really have to sit back and think\nDo I really know everything had my daughter to all the I's and cross the tea as well get this the annual retirement confidence survey finds that most Americans or overconfident about how they prepared for retirement so I guess it's good to be positive and upbeat about it but how do we know whether our confidence is justified or is it just smoke and mirrors\nWell the problem is people already knows all they know and they make their decisions and they build their coffers on what they know and we heard it before the other shows\nYou have to know enough to know enough that you just don't know everything and what your nose or you know and there are ... there is the potential to have more information\nI mean to you to maybe change your way of thinking\nAnd that's what we find as far as our clients come into us they have one thought in their mind they've heard over and over in in the past they come in here and we have to educate them on what the truth star\nWhat will probably happen not what might happen if you do something the old way mhm and like I said you have to know enough to know that you just don't know sixty four percent of workers responding to\nThe twenty eighth annual retirement confidence survey\nSo that they're very or somewhat confident about their financial prospects in retirement mhm I'm confidence was even higher among those that were our closest according are retiring Seventy one percent of workers age fifty five an older\nSo that they're confident that they'll have enough money to live comfortably and retirement\nBut many Americans as they get closer\nTo retirement their their their thoughts are a little bit less mhm writers an incredible amount of overconfidence author I personally think that there's there's a lot of assumptions that they have that just aren't true things have changed the old way of doing things aren't the new way of doing things sure and the rules and regulations have changed\nAnd a prominent we see people go into retirement I always say it's in a vacuum but is it is very little knowledge on retirement\nWith us there's six parts to a successful retirement plan not just your money\nSo there's there's more than what you think goes into retirement\nWe recommend people start to think about retirement at least five years before they're targeted retirement date mhm so you can plan everyone's situation is very different and there's no cookie cutter approach getting into it\nYour risk tolerance is different than the other person's risk tolerance unfortunately what we see is people go in thinking I don't want to have any risk\nBut we see that they have money and mutual funds and they have money in stocks and bonds right at anything this very well like that you have a risk and they think that they don't because they've been\nMaybe it's a lack of education on their part or maybe it's they're just trusting with somebody else says um but there is risk with anything that can go up and down in value\nNow makes sense completely you talking about of course having this confidence knowing where you stand understanding the ins and outs and really how they control over what your financial future looks like it's so important and you mentioned Rick tolerance I think a lot of us\nMaybe aren't so sure that our risk tolerance and of course when it comes to stocks and bonds and the stock market it can be risky which is of course scary to a lot of retirees are people on the brink of retiring but are there are other options besides the standard four oh one K. IRA and then of course messing around in the market\nWell there's a there's a lot of other options let's just go with a little bit of a maybe it's a hidden risks they don't understand we talked about the sixty forty equity born split that most people talk about when you go into retirement sixty percent of your money in equities forty percent and bonds\nAnd there's there's something we talk about that we're going to get into his called the sequence of returns\nWe had a client up into tanning we saved him we reduced is taxable income by forty thousand dollars a year just by taking his income a different way\nThat is incredible I mean oh my gosh that is crazy it just goes back to the fact that we're talking about knowing what your different options out there I mean that can make a huge impact in somebody's life\nCan ... you know we had one client that was going to lose out of his retirement his ... but it was about a million and a half dollars his son was only gonna get half of that almost half a little over half of\nThat ... the rest was going to go to taxes but by the time we were done now his son is going to receive that much and ... and more tax free\nThat is incredible and that that sounds like something that you want to talk about I don't know who wouldn't want to talk about that ride he buy more of your money not given it to Uncle Sam that's where it that for me\nThink about this if you look at the words the IRS put those two words together as spells there's\nAh yes you're right\nSo let's take those words and keep them apart and make it yours let's keep it in your pocket and your family's pocket and reduce or eliminate the taxes do when you pass away the taxes do as you take income and more tax favored way\nI'm telling you guys the proof is in the putting as you're listening to it right now and with nearly three decades in the business\nThis is what makes Kevin Bach stand out out of everybody else he knows what he's talking about he knows how to help save the money and how to help you keep more money in your pocket book for retirement to that phone number seven to for\nEight three seven three five five three again that's seven to for eight thirty seven three five five three\nGet this there was a survey by the Employee Benefit research Institute that found that\nThirty percent of American workers haven't decided yet what to do with their four one K. accounts when they retire so what's your process for helping clients and make this tough decision\nWell whenever you're you're gonna retire you have to decide do I want to leave my money in the four o one K plan so I Want to take it out generally taking it out is the best option um\nWe can even show you how to uh like we said before we want you to really start thinking about retirement planning at least five years before you retired\nUh we had one one client that finally became a client we knew him and working with him for about Nineteen years and they finally decided they're going to do what we wanted to do it twice in the past right before each of the last uh market crashes\nThey were going to make a move their right to come over with us market crashed before they did they said oh we're going to wait for our money to come back\nNow that he kept delaying their retirement\nSeveral times so in this case here\nSit down and figure out where you want to be when you want to get there then we figure out okay what are your options um you've got to know your options generally you have for options\nAre for choices you can leave your money and the plant we don't recommend that a lot of times they can charge you hire administration fees if you leave your money in a plan which takes away from your total retirement\nYou could take payments from the planet installments and what we do is if you have the ability to um pulled her money out of such a pension or your four one K. you pull the money I always see OK what can we do to give you the most income if you need the income\nOr is it better to leave it there and take what they offer or is it better take it out and\nCreate your own guaranteed retirement or your own pension type plan\nYou can roll with the money into an IRA which is usually what we end up doing or you can take a lump sum if you take a lump sum from your four one K. or retirement plan that's not an IRA\nThen they're going to hold twenty percent to pay for your taxes his taxable and you're probably gonna have to pay more taxes down the road if it's a larger lump sum we don't recommend that option\nAnd then once you turn seven and a half you have to take ... minimum distributions your MDs required minimum distribution so if you don't take them\nYou're going to pay a fifty percent penalty on what you didn't take wow that's that's that's big then the next thing you want to do is is map out your expenses trying to figure out a budget\nUm everybody no matter how much money you have you're on a limited budget I'd lose

doing buddy\nI'm doing well hey we've got lots to talk about but before we get into I'm winning a recent columns about the courts usurpations of the Democratic process\nSpeaking of which let's talk about um the Democratic process of agitation here a British in history I mean ... we had anything like this or is this in a you know just something that we can look back and say well it's certain points in time um this is what we've run into in our country\nOr we haven't had this before bell and the run up before the civil war and the country was as divided as it has never been before in my opinion never been since I mean Congress\nI mean the number of fights that Congress got into the number brawls the number of 'em too but they got into or the issue over the issue of slavery\nA divided Congress probably for I guess about ten years in the run up the civil war after the compromise of Eighteen fifty um which kind of\nThe way the civil war um by the way is not going to prevent it because the Congress was absolutely at each other I remember Congress has at each other's throats over that issue so I Would say it's been worst\nMhm well I'm right now I'm In you and you wonder you say okay well what is the a catalyst of all this uh\nYou know many want to blame certainly on the left you know they want to blame Donald Trump and his verbiage but watching here there's acts of violence on the left that are just are mounting that of course the the media is and not not about to\nPublish um and I got a report this morning here that just went through a litany\nOf attacks on Republicans and um you know they're out there trying to campaign or Republicans getting attacked I mean beat up any\nYou know a a ... you know they're ending up in hospitals there you know sitting there leaking oil as they're trying to campaign 'cause they've just been beat up and\nYou know I'm you know you got Maxine Waters things you know chase him getting their face a Spartacus himself [laughter] you know talks about or you know getting in a elected officials a face to face and ah you got to Eric Holder saying hey when they go low we kick him\nAnd you know which was a spin off of what Michelle Obama said about when they go low we go high or I guess now we just kick him is the shortened version and the updated version of a you know of that whole deal so\nThis is this is really gotten out of hand and you you think oh gosh you know when we're going to end up with something and then of course there was a reference or about uh you know the ... the the couple of what the music artists thing um you know when was the last time a president was killed by an actor you know\nYeah [laughter] uh yeah but I think that this is going to her I think this is going to have their publics in the mid term election that Republicans and maternal actually though I think that the ... the fair minded people in this country are looking at this craziness\nGoing on for people I Want representing me in the national government might be wrong about that but I Do notice that in that that that um\nPolls are now showing that in a contested states and now at least from the outside whereas there was like Thirteen fourteen percent advantage on the Democratic side a month ago is now one two three no I think that this whole um these attacks\nAre hurting the Democrats image and I think that hopefully this will reflect itself in the mid term elections\nOr the Democrats so an hands Bruce that they can see the damage that this does to their own party I mean 'cause the thing is this let's just say let's let's say of crafts do take over and and even if they don't regardless I mean we've got people here they got some serious mental problems I mean they got there exercising themselves\nAnd this is all you know the mainstream media is not reporting on it it's almost like it's acceptable so even after the election we've got their mentality and they're anxious to deal with I mean this isn't like suddenly going to go away I'm In you know after the election\nNo it's not no it's not it started when Trump was elected certainly not going away after it's not going away anytime soon now but but I but I Wonder though I mean I I'm\nI I think okay so the Kavanaugh hearings or another example okay for the media you know they they couldn't they couldn't hide that they were broadcasting they the the um earrings so they couldn't play down how the Democrats embarrass themselves in the country and the way they treated Kevin\nWell I mean surely cook the cook political parties are kind of D.C grew and this is a quote those who led this out of control demonstration on Capitol Hill against the Kavanaugh nomination have any understanding of how much damage they did the Democrats and the party's chances of winning majority in the Senate ...\nWalk down the road you know but they absolutely I Do think the capital here just like the creators you were talking with Maxine Waters Cory Booker Kamala Harris all those I think that this is going to be a problem for them and in terms of how it would be fair minded average American is going to look at\nLook at at the at the in the mid term elections\nAnd again I maintain a Bruce the sad thing about all this is that\nWe need Democrats in the fray here to be on deck to help us you know come up with solutions to solve the problems I mean they are so unhinged right now they've lost their mind because they hate Donald Trump so much just like oh you guys\nGo figure this out go call time out go out in the woods maybe you'll find Hillary out there I don't know but maybe you might find the other part of your mind that you lost\nSo that you can come back and be a positive part of getting this country back on track because it'd be so unhinged and to lose your mind and his direct ... you know to this degree\nIt's like I'm I'm thinking man what are we how much longer is this going to last year we've got a lot of positive things happening in our country could you imagine\nAnd and not that this is you know I I don't know if we've ever had a ... you know a ongoing kumbaya moment with Democrats in and bipartisanship that we could look back and say hey this is what this looks like a ... you know we can certainly talk about nine eleven but that was so short lived\nA you know because then it was like okay go to respective corners there and you can even talk after a Steve's beliefs and the Republicans got right um uh got attacked on the softball field but you know it just can't seem to\nSustain itself and um you just I don't know Bruce I just hope and pray that uh you know some a silver mines will um will take over here\nAnd stop the insanity because of the trajectory years very dangerous I mean it's one thing that you know physically attack somebody but a union you know if somebody is that a couple I think Rand Paul says he's going to I mean and he got hurt but I mean right now many could get killed here\nYeah yeah and and the problem as you mentioned is that if we don't have we need Democrats you're right we need Democrats to\nMe that's halfway All right you don't get any laws passed in Congress unless there's bipartisan support for the law Congress' job is to pass laws creating public policy in order to do that\nYou have to have to compromise both parties have to compromise both parties have to meet each other half way you're not going to get everything you want to legislation but if you get enough where you want to support the legislation than that legislation will pass\nAnd if you if if the Democrats are going to go as crazy as you were saying they are continue to be that way then we won't get any legislation passed we won't get any public policy created it'll just be the kind of stalemate we've been seeing for the last several years only works\nWhen we need the part of the country that they represent to be represented in the legislation and and we need their ideas this is all part of compromise as you say Bruce and this is ... you know we're missing out and everybody's paying a price for this we've got more and Bruce

the well the markets are running but some might say in the wrong direction\nWhat's going on but they know heat at the end of September early October and it's been pretty much down ever since I think there are several reasons for that clearly a rising interest rates of the Federal Reserve is clearly going to raise rates again\nIn December they've already done it three times this year and it looks like they want to raise them at least three maybe even four times next year [laughter] no matter what the market is telling them you know stock market has gotten weaker amount of housing has been hurt by it\nBut the fed says they want to get their rights back to what they call normal level no matter what the impact is on the market and I think that's definitely one of the things taking your impact here well they didn't have that kind of sense when a block Obama was president correct I didn't feel it's a time that the economy is strong enough to withstand rising interest rates now they feel a strong enough\nTo do that and they raise the eight times since I started this process in December of two thousand Fifteen ... and there's a lot more to come and so people are saying and including President Trump is saying you're raising rates too much too fast\nAnd it's going to cause economic problems in slow down the economy and and I mean in the housing market we've definitely had a slowdown in home sales some of the markets that really got overheated like Seattle and San Francisco definitely cooled off\nThe thirty year fixed rate mortgages over five percent now bill so that means that I'm I'm a margin some people saying I I don't I don't want to go ahead with that you know so what can we do\nWhat can we do and I mean because the fed is a defense the fed is on his own does would ever want and all that it's right or records do we have is not like we can uh\nYou know put a sanction on the fed can no\nIn fact it's the opposite when President Trump criticizing them may want to feel independent they're going to go the other way they're going to be even more aggressive to show that are not caving in to him to some extent I mean as investors what you've got to do is to put your money where it doesn't have volatility\nBut you're getting a decent meal you know the feathers raising rates and the banks are raising what they're paying what what they're charging on most but they're not raising what they're paying the father of the most part\nI mean I mentioned before you know what when when you were people are a good alternative are they secured real estate for ... ... because that's the way of getting an eight percent you know but the price of it doesn't go after them not violence in those days are\nTen dollars a share no matter what the market's doing basically and you get an eight percent ... with monthly checks if you are gr reinvest it doesn't websites that secured real estate outcome you know we all that so there's an alternative ah another ... keeping them in the bank pretty much earning zero\n... I I don't mean to get political but seems like everything's political these days\nUm you know what the fed is doing as I said you know compared to what they did with the President Obama and um you know for them now I mean it's like they're not even taking any kind of consideration I Know that\nA Trump was you know going hey out I mean you're you're working against this year we're going to get this economy going a missile remember whose team were on and let's or\nThey don't look I look like they're on his team and that's not the way they've\nBeen I guess that's my point that kind of makes this political because instead of seeing okay what works for the greater good I mean I'm you'll get your money I mean the fact the matter is you still got to figure out how to um you know reconcile what four or five trillion dollars are printed money you did under the old\nAnd they've been trying to reduce that their balance sheet went up to about four and a half trillion that's correct right as these the treasury notes come do instead of the ruling them over there a maturing them and so that's shrinking their balance sheets slowly I mean we're not pray fast Moscone man slowly right but yeah they see that as their priority\nAnd they see the priority is getting the interest rates up two levels so that when the recession have got a place to go down basically but they're creating the economic slowdown that's going to cause problems in the future and I think it could be\nMitt to that I was Nineteen I'm not saying recession but certainly slower economic growth not going to have four percent economic growth of interest rates go up as much and so President Trump is right it's just normally you don't say those things ... the Federal Reserve and you know as explicitly as has been doing well that's okay that's why we love [laughter]\nExposing all this to help us understand the cause and effect relationship to end in exposes people in terms of like what we're talking about here we have the same team here or not and that\nAnd to make their days ha ha ha can we talk Halloween for just a moment here we've got to any word it was a Danny of course a a good friend of the shows\nWith focus on the family he is the vice president of parenting or because of we need vice presidents of parenting I tell you [laughter]\nThat's hilarious bill hey thanks for having me on the show for said\nHey good that you're talking about Halloween but when we get into some of the stuff I mean when did you make it I I I was curious to get your read on this is that you got some cities are in the country you know banning Thirteen year olds for trick or treating on Halloween I mean\nA all this stuff is just a it's like well you know maybe we're better off just doing trick or treat him\nTruckers say that's sometimes just simplify Halloween would be would be really nice back in the\nBack ... ... maybe a decade or two decades ago we didn't have some of the the deviant issues that go along with Halloween and a lot of rules around that it was just a time for for fun for many families and it\nCertainly ways with media social media a movie some of the darkness around Halloween horror movies or has taken it to a different level but we don't have to go there's Christians we can we can do our own direction with the opportunity to pretend and imagine\nYeah exactly and there's nothing wrong with that but it's when it's gone overboard as you say a and were reflecting a you know the music that's put out into the culture of movies\nUh the sexual this nation of our young people I mean you know some of these things down and I'm sure when when you see some of these kids walking around and even going to school and the way they're dressed up and you think oh my God you know what what what is going on here\nYes you know I've I've a Thirteen year old daughter and a Fifteen year old son as many of you know and a nice done or has had a lot of his friends binge watching horror movies than not close friends but just run school paper and knows that\nAre around this time they're saying hey we're going to go watch this hormone as a group do you want to calm or or we're going to wear and watch hours and hours\nOr movies and and ah then some of the music that that comes out with that group it does it does create some great conversations with your hands about and you know what it means to have your mind and renew it\nYour mind what what it means round the Halloween when it interacts with their mind what what does that mean in\nA it's a great conversation my son about guarding your heart and your mind and the horror movies are made to to scare and I think there's a lot of demonic stuff with it really\nWell and that's the thing in and why you know Christians have been\nEspecially a protective over this and not wanting to her kids to participate you know churches have responded as I mentioned with the events you know fall festivals trunk or treat you know where there's candy give out and you know that kind of deal and so the kids can\nA habit and ah you know the the uh the costumes that we see at churches or not we're seeing on this up artist cities or because of some of those are really you know\nJust bizarre and ah I'm I'm like you Danny I'm all for you know imagination I'm all for the creativity\nUm in fact we used to have a dear friend of ours I mean she was she was gifted it was like God designed for Halloween\nYou she would she would come up and she would constrict coming her kids always one you know the best costumes in school and stuff like that she was just so creative and how she put these costumes together and\nI remember with beauty and the beast when ah you know that was a hit movie I mean she dressed up these kids and you think oh my gosh that they came up a Hollywood back [laughter] you know it was a terrific you know\nThere's some there's some gray costumes out there I think a lot of churches have\nBecome very creative and and as far as trade some some wonderful opportunities for kids express their imagination about the Bible dressing up as a Bible character getting to talk about that character is and why they're dressed up as a character and some youth groups will do a like an escape rumor mystery thing where they go\nTogether and and they have a time of a fun and and enjoyment together and some snacks and you know we were were were created we don't have to go out and dressed up as ... and all kinds of things they have a good time on Halloween you can\nUh it it there's super heroes and talking about that we're you know I for me and my family we've\nGot to use this opportunity to talk about our new identity and Christ that we have the opportunity where and cautious classrooms three Paul says we're as Christians were giving given a new identity putting on the new south but in\nReality if we look at where kids are out today there's a lot of pretending that goes on throughout the year just to get love and imagine if in Halloween you talked about what does it mean to be an authentic real person\nAnd and talking about that identity that that we haven't Christ and living that out the rest of the time and Halloween is the only day that we pretend to be someone else instead of the entire year\nYou know exactly well and I think what would you bring up here Danny is the Christians have kind of incense got caught off balance here was Halloween\nBecause it it it kind of morphed into a um you know something that was so I'm a confronted and in contrast to ah to our Christian faith and it's just seems like it's gotten worse than so uh Christians have kind of falling back on their heels as opposed to saying okay\nHow can we take back this holiday and you know bring the family fun back into Halloween\n[noise] [noise] yeah I agree actually paying for it is a good place to go I'm thinking I was thinking about things that are true and what are what are my can do but ... and the creativity of our mind and and talking about that that scripture alone Philippines for it is it is a great way to look at\nHalloween what are some truth thinks about at one truth thing is we can be creative God has created a stabbing imagination we can have fun and we can play together as a family\nThat part is very healthy so let's do it that way we don't have to participate in those the the other things that are very dark about Halloween and I think it shows that contrast of good and evil Halloween ranks certainly brings that out\nIn a very clear way and I think this is great preparation for the Thanksgiving season in Christmas season when when we\nWhen we began our time as a family with fun and and imagination take his time to maybe maybe maybe it's the beginning of of some movie a weekend says throughout the time all the way up till Christmas as a family and picking those out maybe it's a time of\nCelebrating a superhero times and what what superpowers got if given us through prayer and through the Holy Spirit maybe it's just a light rain some games out every year around this time you your brand came out and and you play that same game around Halloween this\nYou can still create some great to traditions around this when it doesn't have to be dark\nWell didn't you know what you said you're and I and I hope people ... is is that you this time to engage the kids\nYou know and have and get them involved in the conversation you don't ... you know you don't have to have the answers you talk to them and just say hey you know ... what does it mean to you you know what I'm you know what do you think about Halloween men and uh you know get their\nYou know and you'd be surprised the answers they come up with and in fact one of my buddies he asked his kids because look at but just for a moment pretend you're ... you're you're dead and you have children how would you know how would you want to celebrate you know a Halloween ... ... ... what would you what would you tell\nAnd I mean it was amazing the answer I mean the kids get it there really\nAre they're really sharp and use it there you go gosh here I Am I I was so worried about how to approach and what to say to him and stuff like that and they actually brought more of the table than I had you know\n[laughter] the other day the family were were sitting around and we\nDo this with with some of the families had council and that's pretending to be someone else in the family so everyone takes on someone else asked for all right then you take on an issue like pretend that you're late somewhere or something like that and then you pretend to be that ... percent gives gives each other early and it gave each ... each of us\nA lot of insight into how we handle stress how we handle conversations and we had a

explore the pros and cons of taking your four one K. or a retirement plan and with you where you either change jobs or you finally decide to retire\nWe're also going to tell you how you may find missing money and your four one K. so don't touch that dial stay with us for the entire show\nI think that there is a huge distinction a very important one between four one K. and what they offer and what IRAs can offer and that'll be a lot of ... uh what we talk about here on the program today\nFor one case for oh three bees thrift savings plans if you're a government employee are strictly retirement savings plans\nThey are not and I repeat not retirement income plants\nIf your age fifty year old or you should be preparing for how you're going to turn your retirement savings so this plan that you build up for savings into retirement income and for one k.'s and other employer savings plans were not designed to do that that's not the goal that they were out there to accomplish they were set up for you to be able to accumulate\nTo be able to save money that's that's why they're called a savings plan and not a retirement income plant again in ... and if you phrase it another way they are designed to help you get to retirement not through retirement\nYou know what that's a really good point and I think that's a point that a lot of people miss because there used to that\nThey're used to savings that used to looking at return on investment and not how much that investment can yield when it comes to income so you may be wondering what your options are now when you do change jobs and there's actually three choices that you have\nWhich option is best for you well that depends I mean these are all individual choices and they're custom tailored that's why we offer are on track retirement review service and that points in the right direction you know give you confidence to know that you made the right decision and that you're on the right track so\nLet's get into those three options of what to do with your four one K. when you change jobs and and the first thing that you can do is obviously nothing just leave the money in your own four one K. plan\nAnd you can uh just let it continue to grow and there may be a minimum balance required if you leave your money with your old company\nBut most companies will allow you to do that you know that said there are a few downsides to keeping that four one K. where his\nOne you can no longer contribute to it so it's kind of a dormant account and it's not really going to continue to do what you want us to do and to you're going to have multiple four one K. plans floating around if you're a new position offers one and you take advantage of that\nPlus if you're old company gets bought or switches four one K. providers now you don't know you're lugging information a year and count number can change it could be a bit of a pain to figure all of that out\nLeading your funds with your previous employers definitely an option but typically the downsides mean that it's not the best option\nYeah absolutely and I mean and there are other options so you look at doing nothing with some kind of eloquently laying out now\nThe second option is if you're working for a new company which I'm assuming if you're not there anymore unless you're retired that the company that you worked for now has a new employer plan a new four one K.\nIf they accept rollovers this could be an option especially if you've looked at the marketplace and obviously I think you can understand or advice they were looking at the differences between IRAs and leaving the money in the four oh one K.\nBut if you have to have consolidation if it drives you crazy to have things in multiple places with your retirement savings plan then yes rolling it into your existing plan could be an option now you have to look at the fees you have to look at the limitations in terms of what can I invest and\nBut that is certainly an option that's on the table now moving forward from those two I think the third option\nAnd this is one that will spend a little bit more time talking back and forth but that's the option to rule that four one K. or that for oh three be to an individual retirement account or an IRA normally it would be a traditional i._r._a. so that you're not paying current taxes\nBut this is a great option because I raise can typically have a lot more investment choices and I think that's what I Want to spend time talking about they're both retirement accounts\nYou just get to pick when you pay the fact that that's what that means you don't pay the taxes and to you after withdraw the money\nWhich is either going to be when you want to or at least you have to start at that Seventy and a half\nAnd there's a difference there are and the biggest difference or the choices you have to invest your money and Terri let's talk a little bit about why that's important the closer we get to retirement to have more and more choice on how we allocate these dollars and what an IRA might offer over four one K. why is it important to investors\nLines it's important but let me say this first these are the kinds of things that we talk about when we teach those classes out at CDC ac boys and see see see south and pick Greensburg\nWe spent a lot of time on for one case and we talk about the hidden fees that are in for one case we talk about the limited choices that are available as far as investments go\nAnd we talk about what's really important with that four one K. money I'm going to go back to what you said at the beginning of the shows you a is it's a savings plan not an income plan so when you start getting closer to retirement age or you start looking at preparing a plan for retirement\nThat four O. one K. if it becomes available to you certainly should be rolled into an IRA because the investment choices that you have at that point or almost unlimited right and you start building an income planned for retirement and not just the savings plans for retirement so you look at what's out there in the investment world\nAnd you start considering choices that are going to give you the best predictable income stream that you can get remember this is retirement money folks this isn't savings money decision I'm going to go out and buy a boat or a you know a a retirement home vacation home kind of money because the tax implications there's just not attractive\nBut if you're going to take this money and build an income stream or a penchant to yourself and you certainly need to step out of the restrictions and the four o one K plan and look at what's available in the marketplace\nAnd let me lay out a a practical reason what Terry's talking about here and and understanding that when you have a four O. one K. let's talk about the typical options so we look at the investment options\nEr four one K. and a lot of times we see a bunch of stock funds uh we'll see a large gap in mid cap a small cap probably a balanced fund probably a few international funds maybe one being emerging markets\nAnd we see these target date funds with our great Dane was twenty twenty twenty Fifteen you know three thousand\nAnd let me say this if you're not familiar with those\nAnd let me just say this and I mean this in in no disparaging way but there's target date funds are almost like investing for down these you know you want to set it and forget it right and if you're going to use a target date fund inside your current four one K.\nMy suggestion or and this is just general information use only that target date fund don't go into other funds and that because you can have significant over\nYeah there's a ton of overlap there and um I had the honor of working with US News and World Report if you Google my named Jason locked in US News and World Report target date funds put an article out there that was exactly what they're talking about uh so you if you look that information up and\nYou say okay these are my options and my four one K.\nWell what you come down because you have a couple of other options at the bottom usually there's one or two bond funds in a money market or a stable value people moved towards retirement and they say well I'll just put more money into the bond funds will focus interest rates rise that's not going to be a good option\nAnd if you say well then I'll put it in the money market\nYes it will protect the principal to a degree but it's not it keep it in a more conservative environment but it won't make you money and keep pace with inflation so that's why you need to explore the option it's built in the income plan but it's creating the choice in the freedom to have those options at your disposal to be able to build a complete comprehensive retirement program\nYou know as we're talking about these four one K. plans and and how to best utilized that dormant or that old four one K. have you thought about how much income you're going to need in retirement\nHow much income that that old four one K. can generate or even your current four one K. if you hit fifty nine and a half and it becomes available to you but on a scale of zero to ten let me ask you how confident are you that you have more than enough income to last through retirement\nWell if you thought anything less than eight let me say this what difference would it make to you if you did feel more confident in that retirement income plant where\nWe can show your strategies to retire with more confidence if you come to one of our class come to one of our retirement classes and find out how to structure and income plan so that you have that confidence to move forward knowing that you'll never have to go back to work unless you choose to\nHow folks there's an article out there we mentioned about finding missing money that has been left behind\nMind in forgotten four one K. is you know lots of folks who have changed jobs have left more than just a coffee mug behind you know there's billions of dollars in his retirement assets that are held by former employers or the pension benefit guarantee corporation\nYou know the companies have shut down their plans are over time workers forget about their ... their pensions maybe that you maybe you're trying to get to a plan that you know you had at one point that is very difficult to figure out who to contact and how to contact that so\nThere's lots and lots of funds out there there's been legislation also introduced in the Senate that creates an online registry so keep an eye out for that as well you know this bill would require plans to report account balances of less than five thousand dollars if they've been left behind and they can be rolled into an IRA so\nMost cases terminated plans generally must attempt to find missing participants but don't count on it meant life said that they recently admitted it didn't search hard enough for over Thirteen thousand people who are owed annuity payments going back as far as twenty five years so\nTo avoid losing a benefit that you think is out there tell your former employer whenever your address changes keep plan documents tax

financial and retirement related questions that you want answered today shows no exception especially if you change jobs or if you're looking to retire and you're probably wondering if you should take you four one K. with you or if you should leave it behind with your previous company\nOr getting this decision right has the potential to translate into a much larger balance in your retirement savings it's important folks that's why we've been discussing today on the show when leaving your job should you take you four one K. with you\nYou know when somebody retires or somebody changes job or is let go from a job you ever see anybody walking out with a box yes they always have a box yeah and you know what's in that box\nPosted notes favorite pans\nPersonal belongings very little belongings you know it's a very important personal belongings when you leave a job there money yeah your retirement savings [laughter] so put your four one K. in that box and you know you look at it and and and there are sometimes\nThere's a few reasons and we'll talk through those in the second half of the show that you need to consider strongly taking her four oh one K. with you you lose a lot of the provisions with loans and the advantages and you really have the opportunity sometimes changing jobs with your old retirement presents an opportunity\nAnd I share a quick story of a client who have been working with recently who\nReally we had tried to put a retirement plan together that made sense she's pretty conservative or her husband's pretty conservative\nAnd unfortunately she's a fifty seven years old\nAnd there was no provisions within her four oh one K. to be able to build the plan that we talked about so we kind of said local reallocate your four one K. and we will plan together to make changes at fifty nine and a half which is what her plan allows well\nThere was some shakeup in management and she is changing jobs and she's going to land on her face is going to be OK already has a new employment lined up but this changing jobs gave her the freedom to move for four one K.\nAnd she was a sad about that because she couldn't build a plan that she wanted within the confines of very existing four one K.\nSo folks you that you were out there that are changing jobs or have an old four one K. not sure what to do there sometimes you need to think of that as an opportunity\nIs not an obligation it's an opportunity a lot of times to build their retirement plan that you should or that if if we could counsel our clients and Terry you would echo the sentiments\nIf we could counsel our clients to be able to do things different or have opportunity to do different things at fifty five or fifty two or fifty seven rather than eating the wait until sixty they can be way ahead of the game\nOr with their retirement and that's what people that have all four one K. is are are they change jobs\nThat opportunity to live on the table and we can help you with that make that decision so you find yourself in that play the hundred three to one Seventy nine sixty three\nYeah it's really interesting folks in and we like to boil things down to very
