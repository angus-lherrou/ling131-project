marriage or a great honeymoon and a lousy marriage\nHow accurate is the honeymoon in predicting what happens in a marriage I\nAlways ask well not always the thing is all but I I usually ask couples or individual actually used that usually a couple of years they're divorced I I often ask individuals who were\nDivorced when did you know it was bad it was a bad marriage and\nIt is amazing how often I yeah I hear that you are\nWell then is the truth or the honeymoon I I Am quite close that is not my my wife but I'm quite close to a woman who that is exactly\nWhat happened in her case he was a very

it's just as to speak the possibilities the other way around\nI have a larger question that is worth so I think exploring\nHow important is a honeymoon\nI can see a very good argument for right after the marriage\nInto a normal life I can also see a great argument for getting away from every body of just having time for the two I I I'm not an advocate here not having\nA honeymoon I'm not an advocate for having one I think if there are good arguments for for both\nOr or delaying you know for six months or something some people do 'cause they just can't get a wave that time but I I don't know the answer I don't know if the honeymoon has been a\nA generally positive force in bomb being people or irrelevant or even counterproductive I don't I don't have any answer to that\nIt would be interesting study to engage in however but that's not really the question it's it may be the upshot of the hour but it's not the question of the hour the question of the hour is\nHow much related is was your honeymoon as if to the rest of your marriage was it a good predictor all righty\nLet's go to our best in Philadelphia Hi Beth thank you for calling\nTo talk to you good um\nSo my husband and

predicted I wrote a column on this about a month or two ago that the left will be violent and it\nIt's so obvious that only fools can deny that violence in this country will come from the left it almost always does there are right wing outliers of course who commit violence\nBut\nThe right wing the conservatives do not count ... but left wing does\nThey think it's OK and again it's it's because normal rules do not apply if you're on the left you know I see these things and I know when I say it is that there are a lot of people listening who think that it's an exaggeration I Know that it is if it's something I I I live with until I'm vindicated later by events\nWhen I said there was a civil war in this country are you know people my respect greatly like Jonah Goldberg said at the dentist is overall on this issue you know we should use that rhetoric it's not as so yes it as a civil war say always said it's my violet or but it will be by what the left is violent\nThe left everywhere in the world is violent melt liberal left to survive because normal moral rules do not apply to them that's another column I wrote recently there Hooper mention\nLeft this do not believe normal rules apply to them so I read to you know vis a from national view today\nTo Republican candidates for state office in Minnesota had been physically assaulted in recent days leading prominent

beacon\nTo have so much physically coming after you would attacking you is justice heartening course she's afraid to use real reason\nThe left produces evil people and this is an example of that that's what she should upset but they don't say because Republicans don't understand that they are the thin line between a decency and in decency\nThat is it just like the police are the thin blue line between chaos anarchy violence\nAnd peace so to the Republicans are the are the the imperfect wall between disaster violence\nAnd and the like and chaos versus order\nRepublicans do not understand the role there playing very very very few do\n... ironically the one of the clearest on this or is Donald Trump and he wasn't even clear on this when he ran he's now clear on it shame

fill a prominent Republicans of caution there were democratic colleagues in recent weeks against using inflammatory and divisive rhetoric and increasingly cash there was the only Hinch party of mob rule and addressing voters they are they going to hinge a party of mob rule exactly right\nOnly one side was happy to play hosted this toxic fringe behavior McConnell said Thursday McConnell's turned out to be quite a man\nReferencing the rock is protesters that descended on the capital during justice Brett Kavanaugh's confirmation hearing only one side's leaders are now openly calling for more of

the more they don't control the presidency and the house in the Senate the more violent they will get they have to when\nThey are for power\nThe essence of left this is power the essence of conservatism is less power they pretty simple isn't it it really is simple conservatives want less power by definition\nBy definition conservatives want less power\nMake government smaller give us less power left make government bigger give us more power the bigger the government the smaller the set is\nOnly one side leaders are male openly calling for more of it because they asked about

New Jersey or New Jersey a seems to just love love low lifes\nGuy isn't nothing the guy's a colossal zero\n\nHe's a demagogue he stands for nothing but power it's so obvious to anybody who isn't on the left that it it's almost like wearing a shrine to stand for nothing except Cory Booker that's it\nLife's treated him terrifically and he's in in great urges constituents to get up in the face of politicians they disagree with and that's all that Rand Paul could say it could be misinterpreted by the mentally ill no\nSenator Paul it could be rightly interpreted by that not mentally ill it could be rightly interpreted by every left the country that sucker punch a Democrat or at least scream of Saturday's in their face\nEvery day I bring the evidence not opinion evidence on how low life the left is\nAnd yet you all know people who vote left who think that the ... problem is Donald Trump the big problem Republicans it because the evidence is irrelevant to these people irrelevant\n\nSays what a ... more Rand Paul I think what people need to realize that when people like Cory Booker say get up in their face he may think that's okay\nLet's see who's the\nFollowing when people like Cory Booker said get up and they're facing may think that's okay I guess he's thinking\nOf Booker\nSaid said Paul who was president when Representative Steve ... Republican Louisiana was shot at a practice for the annual congressional baseball game last year\n\nBut what he doesn't realize I guess this is a this is Booker excuse me this is Rand Paul Springer about Cory Booker bought he doesn't realize is that for about every one thousand person that might want to get up in your face one of them is going to be stable enough to commit violence will bravo to you Rand Paul that is correct\n[noise]\nWhen you believe that the other side is sexist and tolerance Gina phobic homophobic Islamic phobic racist and bigoted why can't you sucker punch them if you
