{"month": "10", "state": "PA", "station": "WPGP", "content": "Get a lot of that now now you're tapping into a personal passion or ... I Love that you know I'm I'm sentimental you know like ...\nYou know we kind of live in a little bit more of a disposable world now where we just don't expect anything to really last and and you know we completely understand where you may have guarding jewelry from family members you know grandparents would ever that don't match your taste but there's elements of that whether it be the diamonds gems loans\nThat are essential in court to that piece and that's one most common things we do is take those and actually create designs for customers to take you know take part of that history part of their family and recreated into something beautiful that they will enjoy as well rather than just disposing of it\nSo between that and then just general customers ... it's just a great reason for people to come see you give you a call find out what what all you can do for before they just go out and buy something\nYeah I mean it's worth ... you know if nothing else is worth talking to us to see what we can do for them 'cause I don't think a lot of people realize what the possibilities are endless said they're not walked into a box where they just have to pick this or that I mean they can make anything with her heart desires yeah well\nLet's fast forward a little bit uh then we're talking with mark held Herman from trinity jewelers located on mountain ... road he's here with us little special leadership is burg let's let's hit the last few years and leadership in your life there's a lot of things going on in Pittsburgh I Know you're involved in some of those you get involved in the vents we're doing\nTell us a little bit about the people now in the city some of the pastors were to whoever it is the main affected you or even if there's a ministry what what what really hits your your leadership\nBugs here well I think for me I seek out 'cause you can't you can't\nUm experience teacher so much so I travel for mentors okay my life you know and it starts with your pastor I mean they have life used that\nCannot be measured that we can't ever understand you know the old joke you know he says up on Sunday I mean pastor shift as a twenty four hours a day job and and the and the different you know direct things that they deal with you know there's so much wisdom there\nAnd I've also make sure to surround myself with mentors you know I'm ... and you know I have one gentleman in particular that's not even in the jury business but just as a as a life mentor for because really\nEven though you know it's important to me the trinity successful but what's more important to me is the integrity of trinity of who we are you know and how we were up Christ's through everything that we do so I you know it doesn't have to be just in business type mentors you know I Would encourage people to look for those people you say\nThis is you know when I look ahead and I look at ... you know\nRetirement are beyond in my legacy this type this person this is who I Want to be reflected access and then you try to emulate that and and you know you learn from them and and are heading that direction\nTo find someone good the follower yeah exactly [laughter] well you've been involved I think ... or ... and things like the man up that goes on around here with focus folks and just those kind of conferences that are available to us here locally\nFor me the biggest blessing and and I don't I never understood how much this could impact my life is what\nYou know how God has blessed trinity to with the growth that we've had you know we're on a third edition and and but the ... the ability of as a successful businessman of being able to give back and and the ministries that you could be involved with I mean were you usually involved like you said with urban impact and I mean just all these different ministries it's\nIt's so fulfilling to be in a position to help ministry and moved that forward well\nThat's why a lead you into that [laughter] you jump jump there but I Wonder together that's very important to you and I want people to hear that too if you're involved in business it's important to have that give back mentality philanthropy minister whatever it is that you feel God is calling you to do but uh don't get so caught up as you mentioned earlier so caught up in the business that you forget some of these other things\nAbsolutely I mean growth is great we all want to see growth and want to see from even um even the people that are part of the trinity doors family but the more important thing is what what are you doing to give back and what are you you benefiting from that is\nGood fun question I have a that I usually like to ask and all of these leadership is version I don't necessarily let people know that I'm going to ask about how some of the things either from church or from the business in the leadership things you've seen have actually helped in the home or even vice versa\nYou some of the trends and things that you've seen come across there and and I think mentoring the big one 'cause a lot of ways you mentioned your kids are Twenty one I always argue with people that no I'm not a parent for life I might be a mentor or even like in an elder situation but we need to raise kids up to be their own so that they go to raise kids and so on and so on is that mentor aspect cub you've seen some of that cross over\nA without question I you know and even from a standpoint of what I've learned now you know I certainly feel a certain you know not responsibility but passion to give that back\nAlso to help others you know I'm In you know have a lot of that again I have a lot of friends that own stores all across the country and and sharing ideas and just trying to\nAgain you know looking towards my mentor say okay how do I live and reflect the same way that he does to me how to live and reflect down to the next generation and so on\nAnd um you know the biggest thing is is the children you know it's the children of Pittsburgh because\nThat's where we have to change in their hearts and minds and their futures because\nThere's so much available for them\nBut I think we have to keep in mind they've all got individual backgrounds and they've they've some of them from good families bad whatever that situation but there's still an individual that if we get involved in their lives that maybe the think God's going to use to change them right then right exactly and in the past can be changed I mean from that standpoint you can you can get away from the\nWall and they have to see good role models they have to see what would it means to be a man to be you know\nIn all aspects whether it be marriage most important who you are as a husband you know who you are as a business owner and they have to see that there's more to it than just chase in dollars and and you know going that route\nOne of the things we talk about around here a lot is occasionally you were going to have fun sometimes for what what's your what's your what's your phone button I don't want I don't want to [laughter] I thought I I I I was getting put your leisure your activity what do you like to well\n[noise] ... the more the merrier as far as I'm concerned I Love to have fun I mean you know I Love boating water skiing you know a riding motorcycles\nUm but honestly the most fun is friendships you know I mean that's that's another thing I encourage people to develop awesome friendships and you know that's the thing that indirectly through business you know and and you know you're even here where I Am I you know they they say you know if you can\nHave a couple of good friends in your life you know that you really are true friends that you really blessed and I'm truth I'm way beyond that I I I sometimes just say God you know this is this is unbelievable I feel so blessed I have so many people\nThat are true friends that you know that it just it buses my life and I encourage people to do the same\nAnd from what I Know of you you're pretty uh pretty much a black and gold guy to\nOh yeah oh yeah there's you know we've got to get them through the play off the air and stuff\nAnd then come I don't know if we get the penguins around to a third a third Stanley Cup or not\nBut they got some work to do that is kind of neat though that the city color and it's all of a thing you know that I ... I like the fact\nThat the uh it doesn't matter whether you're black and gold and your your goal no matter what the season that it is\nI think you bring up a good point in the friendship aspect 'cause that's where leadership can really happened one on one you may find someone that boy they could really use something you near you might find something else he's been through that or she's been they could really help here I think that's a great point the dynamic of a friendship is huge fellowship within the church out fellowship with it\nTurkey is most important especially you know beyond even just attending church but getting into small groups getting to you know developed I mean some of the closest relationships we have in our lives and my wife and I you know fruit small group and getting you know people at a deeper level\nThrough in in a church being a big thing to you and the involvement there and and I know that's huge for most of the people we have on there\nThat are lying on the radio yeah so we can bring that out\nHere in these in these programs and let people hear what's important to you about church and what what involvement you've had and what leadership you've learned there\nYeah well it's all my life lessons come from the Bible in church you know that's number one and I I feel like if you are as close as you can adhere to those everything else is going to fall on boys you know so much of what's happened with trinity that's gross and the great things have happened there\nReally when I look back and go wow mark you didn't have a whole lot to do is you know they're always a river near saying wow God is really cool and what he does you know I mean\nYou just put things in place and sets courses that you don't even see coming and it's not until you're looking back you go oh I didn't I never saw that but you know if you get everything else in the water or God really does take care of you and and so I was doing the right direction well\nWe appreciate you being in here more it's been a great time chatting with you let's talk again real quick about where the story is given the phone number and the website because again I'm always have this mindset there's always somebody out there looking for something good whether it's an anniversary cause they come around all the time or weddings or what not to give us the skinny back down again on where you are and what how they can get a hold of you\nAbsolutely well it's really it's actually simple to get to our place from anywhere in the city will do have people travel in our pasta come see us ... for a musician yeah you're absolutely so we're we're a mountain road we're just north of the city of Pittsburgh but again we're very accessible just from interstate Seventy nine were interstate to Seventy nine\nAnd that that can mortgages good that I Know in Pennsylvania people tend to think well pay off their mortgage first but if you have bad that if you don't have money and emergency funds if you don't have savings or for a rainy days before even saving for retirement as we're aging and living longer\nAs statistics have proven we're living up to Ninety five now projections are up to age a hundred and fifty in a by us\nBecause we're leading health care alive which is great but if we don't have savings if we have that that if we just have a mortgage that's paid off and we don't have any income that's coming in we haven't invested in long term savings plans\nThen you're not putting yourself in a in a good position so I encourage folks to call in and reach out to us at one eight hundred six six to nine five five zero because the bottom line is we\nUse how we wish to lead our lives when it comes to financial freedom for many who may be struggling with even\nGetting approved on a mortgage you maybe your credit score under five dating we approve of folks at five eighty give you the same low interest rate as someone who may have an eight hundred score depending on where the rates are because we work with over fifty wholesale lenders and that is quite remarkable in itself writes off\nWhat's amazing I mean and that's what's great we have people who are I I have a lot of friends we have a lot of friends who are back managers for banks that you know if they can get it done they don't want to upset their clients I've had managers where the clients are really really upset that they can get something done and\nThey're they bring everything over and we'd get their loans on within you know thirty days so\nWe have a lot of good relationships in Rio urge everybody just to you know how to mortgage statement give us a call see what we can do a lot and then a lotta in Pennsylvania a lot of us okay so we might have a great great but maybe we can get you paid off on your home in Fifteen Years instead of a Twenty years that you have left\nAnd the payment might be exactly the same why wouldn't you pay your home or five years ten years earlier I I don't know of any reason and the rates are starting to pick up so this is the perfect time before the holidays\nSave some money three four hundred dollars a month give yourself a little bit of a raise take some cash out for Christmas then you started the whole new here with a fresh slate\nAnd it is peace of mind so it is all about how you wish to spend time\nWith your family and time is the most valuable commodity that we have and it is free but it can't be bought so we have to choose wisely on how we wish to\nInvest in time and faith and family and often\nPeople have said can't do it I have to have that job more apt to have the part time job I just had a child and I want to be home but we need two incomes or we need me to go back to work to do part time work we've had to folks that we've been able to eliminate the need for two income so that one parent can stay at home\nUm or even have the potential to live in your home\nBased on a reverse mortgage and not have to downsize Iran's as we age so for many of us here in Pennsylvania we we don't want to move to Fort twelve times we are looking at\nLiving in the home maybe the second home that we've purchased but not have to downsize because of extensive and fixed income so the reverse mortgage has changed dramatically um because it is a government sponsored program and you have only access to fifty percent of the equity in the home\nYou can well it and you will always have ownership and the deed is always in your name so this is an excellent program one that's well worth asking about as well and getting the knowledge and information\nAnd not be making decisions based on here said\nHere says here say it doesn't deal with\nFactual of financial things that we can offer you as well as the fact that with a reverse mortgage you have to get the counting in education with a government sponsored agency so it is a decision solely based on that and not on what we have to share on air necessarily writes\nAbsolutely and then you know I had a friend he sent me a family member in in law actually and there was um we all mapped and um I was talking to her and she's like I I I really don't want to move out of my home and there's family there's all kinds of ... family dynamics going on which is always like that every family's difference\nUh one of the daughters was wanting her to move in with her but\nDidn't want her pet to come with her so\nI just felt really really bad for this lady and then when we got this thing done for her it freed up so much money for herself\nShe stayed in her ... her own home she loves doing things and and she's a senior whose whole life has changed because she doesn't have to be pushed into a situation that she didn't want to do and we're all about asking the seniors what their goal is what do they want done or did they want paid off\nAnd um we take it from there it's a process there's counseling involved but um you know this is the money that you've put into your own home and you deserve to be able to have a good time in your senior years this is what you've worked for I just don't believe that any senior should be struggling now so\nI Do encourage them to give us a call one eight hundred six six to nine five five zero and we'll have the conversation with them\nYes it is truly asked the question call us um and one eight hundred six six to nine five zero it is very fulfilling the work that we do that brings a great deal of joy as well because of the fact that um\nYou know stories like this with ... and my brother it's being able to have ownership of your life and not be pushed into decisions as we age we want to be able to still do the things that we want to do and live in the home that has memories\nAnd my personal favorite was Warren Buffett he bought that home for thirty thousand he's a multi billionaire he's living in the same home because it has memories and so no one should have to be forced into renting or moving out of that home a rather a reverse mortgage will allow that opportunity to\nBe able to take some equity out and not all of it just fifty percent of it and choose to make a mortgage payment or not but the mortgage payments eliminated and\nAnd that's just one of the key part and we pay for the appraisal so before you make decisions find out all a little bit more ask the question in college at one eight hundred six six to nine five five zero a couple of things that are coming up as well because we're a family owned business so\nUm we are supporting some really great causes that are coming up as well there is um\nThe Mario Lemieux foundation the six one six raise that coming up and which is a great event because it's for Austin's play room so it's a great twenty fifth year anniversary so we've worked with a anti Angus and we have decided I have decided to run\n[laughter] you [laughter]\nSo I I Want folks to join there's a run or walk it's\nA coming up on uh the Sunday it's October fourteen so I Hope some of you will join us support us or in general are not us but the ... foundation the Mario Lemieux foundation in raising funds for a great cause it's a nonprofit many of you know Mario Lemieux\nMost of you do and I'm also the other thing that's coming up which is a very very important event as well and November fourth it's with the\nPatch kids I'm a teen uh donate a kidney to kidney

that team donate dot kidney dot org as well so are these are important things as we know are we here in Pittsburgh are all about supporting each other and bringing each other to gather life's a team sport\nAnd um sometimes when we look at uh the ability to have that financial freedom we can support great causes for family members and faith based um scenarios as well I'm\nOne of the other things that's really ah important with our website\nUh W. W. W. dot and M. C. and T. G. dot com or the list of products that we offer so we offer VA loans and I'm with the VA loan programs off how does that work\nWell if you're a veteran and you have the certificate of eligibility you can actually\nPut no money down at all have to leave zero percent down um and it's because you know the government uh obviously we we all want to thank you for your service and then\nUm there's no fees basically the rates are really really low you can go as low as a five eighty score so we have the VA loans we have the F ha loans with three and a half percent down\nAnd um does that those funds can be gifted so it's almost kind of like a zero percent down as well we can do that as low as a five eighty score um\nWe have the conventional loans we had the reverse mortgages\nWe'd have advice more more than anything else any situation that you have we've seen it so we can help you with that and we can also if you're not at that five eighty score level we can evaluate and talk with the heroes of the credit bureaus and find out what we need to do to get you to that level\nUh the uh the fact that we have access to the credit bureaus directly it's amazing when people say wow I didn't know that a good got fixed in like twenty thirty days because he told me exactly what needs to happen and it's truly a there's a science behind it it's not something that you have to pay someone more money to fix that that doesn't do the trick\n'em but as I've said we are here to be of service answer questions make sure that we can get you approved whether it's a refinance whether it's a reverse mortgage whether it's a ... home purchase a or even an investment property or commercial properties\nUh we do it all and we are here to make sure that we give you the right answers and give you the education and the two that are necessary\nYeah and we're very very fortunate because we build these relationships with the credit bureaus you can't just call any of the credit bureaus and ask them in fact let me take that back\nYou can even get anybody to talk to you as a credit bureau so we've had these relationships for fourteen years I've been in the lending industries longer than that so we have these relationships where I'm Talking to somebody one on one and he can do an analysis so she can do an analysis and tell us\nWhat has to happen on that file or specifically so\nIt's a great resource it's been\nAmazing for us to be able to help our uh our clients who call us so uh we're happy to share that give us a call one eight hundred six six to nine five zero\nFolks also the website which I've said again is an easy tool for many if you wish to schedule time to chat on the phone or email us with questions as well is uh the website is an M. C. M. T. G.\nDot com I'm One of the things I've also or you know encourage folks to find out before you\nGet let's say shares say people try and be helpful to give you information it's not as if they mean anything um negatively about it it's just that it's not based on fact\nAnd sometimes when you're dealing with finances especially you want the facts and one of the key ones with reverse mortgages which I've seen over and I'm falling because it's true people get that information because the reverse mortgage is something that works\nAnd is solid program it's government sponsored to anyone who sixty two years of age\nSeventy years of age maybe you wish to have a little bit more financial freedom you want to stay in the home that you live and you may have a low balance on the mortgage or no mortgage but you want access to some of the money without having to make mortgage payments every month be curious to\nFind out don't base it on anything but fact\nBecause it's not only what I say or what soft says with the reverse mortgage have to go through the counseling process you have to get the education which is provided by the government so there is no here say there's just a fact\nAnd there's one fact that you have to take away very important the home always remains in your own name that's always been the biggest\nProblem a misconception and that can be verified not only that we're saying it but you go through the counseling agencies the loan product has changed from Fifteen Years ago so when relatives and other people say something they're talking about things that were Fifteen Twenty years ago\nThe home always remains in your name\nAnd would that folks give us a call one eight hundred six six to nine five five zero stay well folks\nIn the mortgage for family\nThose same American mortgages can have a residential and commercial purchases refinancing out eight hundred sixty nine five\nThe free shipping program furnished by most of the mortgage corporation\nFor fifty theater whether [noise]\nOr the ... gun shy in the south I knew the shower thunderstorm it'll be warmer high eighty three vibrant LaGuardia warm muggy looks to be seven very warm and humid tomorrow with problems sunshine shown bought the afternoon a hired a need for the record eat eat degree\nOn Monday clogging sunshine and shower comes from Fox warm and humid for the hype eighty four getting near the record of eighty seven\nI mean they're all just showing Fremont on AM twelve fifty the answer\nAs a twenty Eighteen midterm elections approach America ...

talk with Kevin Bach of integrity retirements illusion we're here talking about all things retirement your money what does it look like in the future have you thought about putting that income plan together for when\nThe paycheck stop when remind our listeners that Kevin you have nearly three decades in the business that right there tells you that you know what you do and you helped a lot of people cross that retirement finish line we have to remember standing by right now for your phone call at seven or eight three seven\nThree five five three seven to for eight three seven three five five three and on the website and integrity retirement solutions dot com\nKevin how are you doing welcome to the show I'm doing great how you've been I've been doing a wonderful I Can't believe that we are already in fall weather here just a little bit we've had some crazy weather this past week with tornado warnings and what not with the holidays just around the corner\nYeah it's a it's always a challenge in this area where I live\nNeighborhood we've had two tornadoes go through in the last about ten years and so when you hear the word tornado I can just wondering what we're going to go\nExactly something that's unpredictable\nRight just like ah your retirement can be if you don't go into a plant\nThat is exactly right because if you don't have a plan to centrally planned to fail right you don't know what's going to happen you don't know where your money is what it's doing\nAnd how it's going to sustain you for the rest of your life but if you take the time to sit down with Kevin Bach of integrity retirement solutions you could sit down and get those questions answered and start looking at number one you know your nest egg all this money that you've worked so hard to save over the years and you're going to talk about your Social Security and taxes are a big\nConversation health care planning is a big conversation you're going to literally cover everything from a to Z when you sit down with Kevin and I'm going to give you an opportunity to do that in just a few moments standby for that speaking of weather here Kevin\nWe saw without the hurricane Florence that recently came through that Mother Nature has the power to just destroy everything we own and literally as a matter of hours so this week we have a consumer tip or you\nCome home inventory that can be an invaluable tool if you suffer a loss AP correspondent war in Lebanon and tells us more\nImagine your house and everything in it were destroyed replacing everything will be easier if you have a home inventory a list of everything you will Barbara ... who writes about the subject for nerd wallet says doesn't have to be a written as\nOne of the easiest way to do it is to just take your phone and take pictures or video of everything in your house when\nShe got it on paper or video or what ever find someplace away from home to store it and if you do lose everything the insurance claim will go easier\nYou know it's interesting to talk about of course taking a video of your home and your belongings now your valuables and using that as almost a testimony if something happens and makes you wonder if we should be doing the same thing with our finances\nYou want to have a document of your finances something where you have everything that maybe you're executor or your power of attorney is going to need down the road in one location they need to know where it's that I had a a a new client in their office this week\nThat her husband passed away and she didn't know the password she didn't know a lot of this and that's a big thing is you've got to have your digital inventory your digital passwords end user names\nIn a location that somebody can find them and maybe put it on a sealed envelope so that you know maybe the kids you can tell if they get into it or not and updated as you change your passwords I don't know about you just go but every time I go into account\nThey're asking me to change my password for I just forgot about the exclamation point at the end or something so I have to redo my password and you have to keep it updated on your list your Journal of all of your your digital assets\nYeah very important that you keep all those documents together make sure you your spouse your kids know where it is maybe you have a safe in your home\nAnd then what do they want to have for lifestyle we try to find out what their lifestyle numbers aren't always have to say realistically because I always say some you know one hundred thousand a month coming in and they've you know champagne desires on a beer budget and so we'll find out what their goals are the ones who are\nAnd then we sit down and see what we can actually do with the amount of money that they've accumulated sometimes they don't need any money from it so we just have to make it accumulate the best we can\nAnd then sometimes they need to have money income coming from it for the rest of their lives and it's going to be the majority of their income they're going to have Social Security maybe attention but maybe not\nSo we have to figure out the money just going to come in from their income how much can we get this going to be guaranteed for the rest of their lives no matter how long they live\nIf they lived age hundred and twenty are they going to still have money coming in well if they're living that long they'd better you know there there's a lot of options out there people don't get enough information they go to one option let's say one brokerage house and they say well let's do this let's do the sixty forty split between stocks and bonds and and and\nYou know let's just do this this everything is at risk\nBut a lot of times there's there's times where you don't need to take the risk anymore you got Thirty years and if you run out of money or if you're if you're a sequence of returns of go against you which in a long period of time they can which means that if you're taking money out as the markets go down you're going to be showing off maybe twice as much as\nYou need to to make that income come in\nThen if if you have a a good solid guaranteed income stream\nIt doesn't matter what happens to the markets whenever you get that income stream coming in if you're within five to ten years of of retiring you pick that retirement date or maybe you're even thinking about when I retire you need to sit down and get a good solid plan\nYou want to find out when you can retire or if you already have that tape what you have to do to guarantee that retirement dates not going to disappear if the market crashes\nUh I don't know how about you but if I have a date set to retire or to do anything I don't want to have to extend that day I'm I'm looking forward to that day\nSo if the market crashes holy cow I have to wait maybe another three four five\nMaybe Thirteen Years to to retire how do you feel about that\nMost people don't but that's the thing with whenever people sit down with us we're going to have things revealed to them to maybe they've never thought about in the past and it's going to wake you up in a light new to wow there's hope for me\nAnd Kevin your kind of secret sauce here your secret weapon is your six pillars of a successful or retirement this is a great opportunity to look at what you have\nWhat you could have and trying to figure out okay how do we fill in the blanks to get there and build that road map towards retirement and just a few moments I'm going to tell you how you can sit down with Kevin one on one thought complimentary consultation and go through these six pillars stay tuned for that but first\nSays one of the benefits of having an estate plan is that it will help minimize taxes for your heirs is that\nIt can be unfortunately a lot of people they rely on one person to create in the state plan it might be their attorney where they think they've seen their advisor their financial advisor and they think that everything is taken care of\nAnd either case is not the state plan consists of a lot more than just legal documents or talking to your financial advisor in most cases\nWith us we have what's called a pillar planning process uh we touch on six key areas for success for retirement and you know regardless of the family dynamics are financial status um everyone can benefit from an estate planning and each person needs help in most if not all of those six areas\nYou've got to collect all of your documents your legal documents and that tells you where you want things to go after you pass but while you're alive one of the more important documents was a power of attorney for finances and a power of attorney for medical and generally we personally don't like to see 'em in the same documents\nWe'd like to see separate ones uh according to a recent survey from carrying dot com which we are contributing author for for carrying we answer questions on her once in awhile\nOnly forty two percent of American adults currently have estate planning documents forty two that means there's a lot of people that don't yes and that's just a will apart of attorney and and the living trust\n'em if you've accumulated a step substantial amount of wealth and you plan to transfer to your other family members did you know that you could lose forty to fifty percent of it\nTo taxes you've got to be really careful with with taxes that's part of our plan is tax planning her tax reduction planning there's four types of taxes that you have to be concerned about\nThe first one is a state taxes inheritance taxes in Pennsylvania's four and a half twelve or Fifteen Percent depending on where you are on the totem pole their gift tax is there's generation skipping taxes and the big one if you have any IRA money is income taxes your ears are going to\nGet there get your IRA and if they do what most people do they cashed in they're going to pay thirty to forty percent and Harris taxes as much as maybe forty three percent now unless you're states over eleven point two million then there's another forty percent added on\nBut there's all kinds of taxes that can come in and deplete your legacy and that's where we sit down and and plan a strategy to reduce or eliminate the taxes on what you've worked hard for and you don't need them to be taxed two or three times\nAbsolutely I think we're all fans of minimizing taxes again just another important conversation that you're going to have with Kevin when you sit down with him one on one and sneaking of that cat and\nLet's say we have people

online\nThat they've done that for quite some time but uh no I'm\nI'm kidding I'm really happy you know part of it for and yeah\nAnd enjoy it yeah without a doubt I bet will live um grey tabby here with us to talk about this one of the roller coaster ride\nThe brains are still exploding on the left over the Kavanaugh issue a couple of weeks ago you cited a this controversy is serious and the GOP a has no option they've got to get this right\nOh I think that got to get it done uh what's interesting is that I think that Democrats have overplay their hand high interest is staying up posing a confirmation of Brett Kavanaugh or they have resorted to all kinds of print the thought of that sort of low tactics including\nAs he said character assassination\nAnd what's interesting is the American people don't like it a way of saying all kinds of all shifting over the last ten days I think\nI Would at first and say hey look at the generic ballot you know all of a sudden that's gone down a one or two points it had been moving in favor Democrats now it's moving I guess some a Trump polling has gone up a little bit\nOf what most striking is that so called enthusiasm gap mhm where a higher percentage of Democrats than Republicans are valid that they would go and vote that their work by about voting et cetera that's been cut in half over the last week so\nYou know I I think really I always come back to this I think Americans are fair minded and they don't like to see a mad the thirty seconds that go way all\nA man of enormous integrity decency you\nKnow a lot of biased because of his family has friends admired by his peers all of a sudden bang characterize with no proof whatsoever as a man is guilty of sexual assault gang rape at ... and all of these charges that as I say so far\nAre simply that they're not proven there's no evidence\nAnd I think people are really pretty horrified by that\nI was I was concerned when they first started talking including the president of the United states when he said that Dr forge testimony was credible\nAnd I said that's not the correct uses the word is one thing to believe somebody like an actress playing the role of someone who is very believable in that role in that part that they play a but it's something altogether different to be credible\nTo be credible you've got to have evidence you there's gotta be some substantiate ...\nTo your claims and after everything was said and done all the hours that we went through and uh the show boating by the Democratic senators\nUm there was no you know there was there was no solid evidence that you can hold to to even you know you kept saying you know I like I could go and kill give her the benefit of the doubt let's give her a lot of space and I knew a lot of people were real sensitive\nAbout saying anything whatsoever hours the other night the president really caused to the left brings to explode when he was a basically utilizing her testimony\nYou know presenting the facts there at the campaign rally and you know the people in the you know some on the left really didn't like it\nUh but I can tell you some on the right to you know the well it's it's not dishonest what he's saying you know it gets back to Trump's ah you you know his style and and his tone I guess\nWell and I think really what happened is he was saying out loud what an awful lot of people that are in a country what think exotic was\nYou know all the well what's interesting to me is the way this thing has shifted it you know your your listeners might be interested to know there's a website that in real time a site betting odds and when she began to testify the odds of\nHaving a banker from climate it they went from pretty reasonable high odds offering high odds at all because everyone thought oh my gosh and by the way Chris Wallace on Fox ... is that yeah you know his toes because she's doing such a good job\nAnd I wish I could say I was shocked to Chris Wallace rolled I thought he ruled pretty quick on this I mean he went to any level I don't know just saying\nEverybody was afraid to say anything other than that I think honestly but that was interesting is when cabinets started speaking the odd but right back up again so it truly by the end of the day was she said he's\nA audience it generally found both of them only a couple and so there we are again proof but as a judge allegations which\nIn a second and third generation is set up a point where the third one\nI have an audience quiet charging worry\nNot they can't ludicrous and I think\nActually I think if any one individual I Would cite two individuals who really hurt the Democrats\nA quest here one is Dianne Feinstein because I think a lot of people that are saying wait a minute she sat with us Matt in her office as good person again so highly respected et cetera and she never even asked him about these allegations how inhuman is that I mean to me that's just plain\nThat sets it honestly and conceivable that Sacco person is Michael ... and for anyone that interested I wrote a piece about him\nOh I don't know ... weeks ago at the request of ... that I didn't know anything about the guy so I did a fair amount of research on him he is a horrible individual who has to buy every partner every white X Y every one is ever had business with basically as they would have a four\nShooting for ... for ... so people should look into this guy before giving in that time of day\nExactly will lose um were you surprised a\n... you know it's just like I mean he got hot box to his good friend in fact I wrote a column on this as well as I was concerned that\n... you know the last a week or so we ever since he got hut box by Chris Coons\nI think the Democratic leadership so whatever you do do not let him get out of your shadow used a hook to his hip you keep ... him with [laughter] you know with the dialogue and ... you know he's kind of or he might be our insurance policy after everything is all said and done but really it it seems that um\nYou know just like did the country of favor because look at the numbers you know to your point now that the uh Best Buy this evidence background check has come out\nAbout this that doesn't you know it's still the same I mean there's no there's no big bomb coming out of this thing so far what we're hearing is a look at the numbers I mean they have a they they are a dominant now to make sure that Kavanaugh gets confirmed\nYeah that would be interesting thing too is a a polling and a lot of their wings state senatorial races where I think the Democrats are pretty charged up and walk as are charged up so you know look at some of them is Ottaway look than trouble scariest play a high Catholic gone\nOh shoes ... says serious trouble ah they kinda go down the list and there's really a shift in some cases\nYou know almost double digits in the last week or two as people look at that and say hey you know what having a Republican Senate is incredibly important to what I Want to have a complex that country\nUm and by the way it Brett Kavanaugh is confirmed which terrified I think it will be a bad and there's also a chance that there's a lot of justice said that comes to available for typically is\nDown ... elected in\n... we have to go through with another justice and that ...\nI I think it won't even pay as hysterical at this time because this time what\nPeople need to remember is ... ... people said well why do Gorsuch had such a big problem well of course ...\nExactly and that did that change the complex that our cat or if the court\nLives we're going to say we're going to incorporate will pick it up from there we come back more realistic after this [noise] here's a\nQuestion about house being trashed while gang sees

wasn't on for example we really need them they said at the interview Christine Blasey Ford why I tell you what be careful what you wish for because\nI think that's at me I sit down to grill her about

this is the perfect convergence is it not a this is our democracy at work at a at full throttle you heard Amy Schumer a saying that uh you know Cavanaugh is a vote against women\nAnd ... in order to ... really believe that you have to suspend belief\nThat uh what Dianne Feinstein and the Democrats did was honoring woman\nBy the way they chose to handle this whole confirmation process and put our entire country\nOn its head\nAnd particularly women I mean as if\nYou know women don't have enough to deal with this we're not dealing an already with all that a ... with all this contention\nAnd ah so let's just add fuel to the fire here and uh let's get hyperbolic let's make statements that thank you very much a lot from the Democratic party and I take great exception for that because this is not unifying\nYou know they'll just like a made the announcement to and and I believe Jeff like in his heart or you know\nYou gotta we're probably appreciate I I Know some of the politics and things and the contention with Trump and some of these deals he doesn't quite see but but I I just want to see that there was some goodness in him and what he did by saying alright look at let's\nIt's not going to hurt let's have another week let's uh let's pause for a second and have an FBI have the FBI look into these matters you know we'll give it another week and that will be at that will be the scope we'll we'll look at these issues here\nAnd have the up yeah well the FBI his process this report and what we know and what we've heard so far is that um there's no\nThere's no mother of all bombs here or there is nothing is it's just a ... you know again it's he said she said a is we've been saying here I take great exception\nTo the idea of the use of the term credible and you know it's like wait a minute you're going to have some people you know most of you graduated from college and good burst good number of you are attorneys and we understand what you do with the English language already you already make up words and do all that if you think not talked to a court reporter\nUp to take dictation and uh you know it's quite comical dear friend of mine and many years ago it was a court reporter and she would tell me the stories of ah these attorneys and the words they would make up and it was their job to straighten it out and to interpret what it was a you know and we're\nLanguage but um you know the thing is is that and even the attorneys no what credible means\nCredible means there's evidence it means that it is a it it's more than believable but it's believable based on facts based on evidence not on emotion not on a somebody being able to\nPerform as we've talked about a very believable in that you know\nIn that starring role that she played and um but uh that's one thing but to save somebody is credible especially when you're talking about something like this and the and the idea that this is not a court of law yes that's true because let me tell you if it was a quarter law these none of these cases would have come before the court\nThey just throwing it out and that was my big question early on look at it this big violation is taking place why didn't Dr Ford take it to the city take it to the city officials take it to the police and say look at it hey I'm you know event this memory is comeback which is you know that's a whole nother a consideration in the legal parlance\nOf a a a recovered memory in terms of it's about the validity but nonetheless okay uh she goes in and present your case\nThat's where it should have been presented not in the court of public opinion and here it is she comes in and you know as we've all I I think we're in agreement that something probably happened to the doctor for it\nYou know I'll give her that benefit something may have happened to her but\nStories and ... you know just not connecting as well you know based on her own testimony forget about what\nThat affect us on a daily basis I mean think about it for just a moment\nHow 'bout kids in foster care\nAre you ready to stand in the gap for kids in foster care\nWell Dr Sharon for joins us now issues with focus in the family nationally recognized child welfare ... a welfare consultant and the retired manager for a permanent sea services for the Colorado Department of Human Services in the division of child welfare services used the former president\nOf the national association of state adoption programs and the association\nOf administrators for the interstate compact on adoption of medical assistance Dr Ford welcome to bill Martinez live our him\nI don't think it'll be on her glad to be with you today\nWell great to have you here as I said in the intro I'm it's easy for us to get distracted with so much hyperbole and emotions flying around our country right now but we we've got kids in foster care that need help doing not\nWe do actually there's over four hundred thousand children across the nation that are in foster care and many of those children are right there in the backyard of your listeners\nExactly what you think about what these kids are going through I'm fairly miserable young lives these kids in foster care and not all but most\nOf some with the biological parents who are you in jail on drugs or abusive um you know it's rare that they get a a a happy or a joyous memory is it not\nYou know there are so many challenges that kids have faced as ... entered the foster care system and you've said it\nTheir parents have gotten addicted to drugs or alcohol they have fallen on really hard time saying that struggle and children and I had been abandoned taping neglected and some of them yes even accused\nAnd so No Child should have to be living through that in this day and age\nExactly what kind of fair shot to they have it life if this is the way they were raised in and their parents are dealing with this and you\nKnow what are the chances of that they ended up like their parents\nYou know the fair shot is this that government and their narrow scope of war is supposed to protect the children so when they remove them from their challenge tall\nAnd its government's responsibility to recruit families to care for them because the government can't and shouldn't raise children and so who are those families courageous who are sitting in the few\nThat would say yes to God and become foster parents so that the children could be nurtured and love Don provided structure and guidance 'em and had an opportunity to heal while their parents are getting the help that they need\nSometimes Dr forward people are unrealistic about the reach of government\nAnd this is what gets government in trouble is that we all have a link to play in solving this problem in the lame to be in and this is what I Am seeing more and more and when government gets outside of its lame like any of us can do it anytime 'cause we see something as good observation wrong conclusion kind of thing\nAnd uh we meddle into things and sometimes we give the government too much credit and when that happens\nAnd we think that the government is going to be your daddy a boy that just opens up all kinds of problems does it not\nThat slide government's role is to actually set a narrow lane it's about safety and protection\nAnd recruiting families to care for children um until the government can stay in its lanes and the church and the community would step up and play the critical role that they can play it makes all the difference in the world and the life of a child\nOr doctor for the church has been discouraged to play a role as you know because uh all under the guise of separation of church and state\nUh you know the government can't be perceived as supporting a ... you know any kind of face or you know anything that has to do with religion\nBut this is the big live it's been perpetrated on our culture and meanwhile is ah our kids are our future for tomorrow's it's all being compromise all because of the bogeyman of religion\n[laughter] you you you you tell the truth there that um sometimes government struggles to realize that there are rich\nPockets of families and all all of their community who could make a difference in the lives of these children if the government would open the door and say you know what let's focus on the children these children need to be nurtured in Laos but for families come through the process\nTo become foster parents so that they cannot only live on that child but help love on that first family who is struggling and going through their treatment needs so maybe it's because we know God that is a retainer\nExactly maybe those children could go back home to their birth families um but at the church would step up\nAnd as they as you said they've tried and if government would say yes yes we watch the access these rich pockets are families who can love on kids love on those birth families and so that they were being many more children maybe having the opportunity to go home\nAre you going to tell me doctor I Know you're not going to tell me this maybe it's more rhetorical this question but as a people or people of a secular rise mindset are more equipped to teach morality than people who have face\nI think that that's an interesting question and I I Can't tell you that I've ever studied it what I can tell you is that um people who share values about children all along\nFamilies and that they respect that um\nThat children deserve structure that children need to know who they are\nUm and who they are that children need an opportunity to have an education that um is rich with all kinds of opportunities for healthy experiences that I'm\nChallenge their minds and and helped to shape and grow them in the image of who they you know should be that as long as we have a level playing field than children will do better um then\nThen by folks might want to skew with that picture should look like\nWell I think people need to appreciate that with God you don't have a level playing field is to your advantage I Will say that I have two points real clear in terms of empirical evidence let's take a look at the school system in the sixties we decided the ten commandments was irrelevant we needed to get it out of their\nUh we've got it on to their look what happened in our school system is an absolutely decimated is there any correlation with the uh you know since we took God out of schools is there any correlation to the effectiveness of the education system today\nI think our school system has diminished\nHas gotten off track their teaching things on school today that they would have never caught in the sixties seventies and eighties\nAnd nineties for that matter and um and because our kids are taken down bunny trails and I think that really aren't relevant about them being able to um reading writing and arithmetic\nAnd not knowing how to be social and I'm the kind to one another we need to back to being an values based\nUm educational system that we can grow and learn um men kicking the commandments out of the school will still run what's now show not kill no shall not steal your mother and father\nWell it's wrong what goes basic structures that helped shape at school we are as people\nWell because when you take that out of the uh out of the marketplace and and the area of debate then you have what's on display in our country today the dismembered meant a of individuals\nThe disrespect of individuals and of course we're not going to talk about sixty million aborted babies are in terms of a lack of respect for life and you have women today because of their claim that it's their body\nUm another big live as being thrust upon women but to many women understand that ah it's more than just\nTheir body especially if they're married or you know that's a whole nother conversation but Dr Ford I you know imagine for just a moment focus of the focus on the family with all the great work that they do and support and everything it focus on the family was secular rise to what would that organization look like\nWe wouldn't be the organization we are today\nYou know without all on so many levels on so many levels the ideas that are in Dr\nDaley at all and you know the team come up with a ... you know the support system everything is just so wonderful and I'm sure the gym daily would tell you uh the guy gets all the glory that it is God and buzz for God focus on the family would not be in existence\nWe wouldn't you know we stand for biblical principles and writes is right we can agree to disagree but\nWe agree on this principle that God is God and there is none other and when his principal said that really I'm walking love a darn ministry walks in love with God's\nA is a million enough maybe you need a billion I don't know but by the time we get done with the show we're going to give you some clarity and during the show anything comes out that you say I'd like to get a little bit more information adjacent likes the website ...

Y. the word group IMC dot com\nI prefer phone numbers being moral school eight hundred three two one is seven Ninety six three\nEight hundred three two one synergy so listening as much as you can or something comes up you need something to reach out to us either on the Web or by phone began to get your questions answered\nWell like I said folks on today's show we're discussing strategies to help you build more certainty into your retirement and your overall financial life than you know we all like certainly and predictability in our lives right Jay\nRight and and when it comes to retirement we like it a lot I mean the bottom line is you can retire when you want to\nYou can control your destiny as long as you make sure that you have enough income to last as long as you do and that's only going to happen if you take the steps that you need is not going to happen by accident and happens by action and as always remember the phone number eight hundred three to one Seventy nine sixty three will show you what that action\nIsn't you know one thing that's really interesting about retirement is that when you're working you're out there and you're collecting a steady paycheck you know without fail\nYou check that direct deposit every couple of weeks and there's money that's going into the bank and the paycheck provide you the certainty that you need to pay your bills and hopefully have some fun there\nBut when you hit retirement age that paycheck certainty largely got tosses out the window and the critical X factor for a successful retirement as I said just a few moments ago is replenishing the certainty that you had during your working years and\nThat process starts with figuring out how much income you'll need in retirement and that's what we call the real knowing your number you know not the commercials with people walking around and how much they have saved but this is how much income well you need\nOur time is different than anything you've ever done before and and that's why our team here at the synergy group who specialize in this specific area of financial planning knowing your number is our process is helping you discover exactly how much income you'll need and then we build a retirement income plan that meets your number\n... years ago there was a company called I. N. G. and now is this little orange bunny rabbit the runs around it's called Voyager and they did that no your number thing but no your number isn't about how much you have any account I mean you could have five million dollars in there and that might not be the right number for you to retire no your number is taking a look at your budget\nTaking a look at how much you want to spend and how much you would like to spend on top of that we we call those joy expenses and making sure that the fix sources that are there I mean you add that to Social Security pieces together you add the fixed ... if that's there\nAnd then you look to the for one or the for three to build the gap so if the budget and the seven thousand a month to do everything you want to do including taking those trips to fix numbers or five thousand dollars how much you've gotten the for three to take out of there to to build that guaranteed peace\nUh there's a great example that came out of USA Today\nTalked about Ralph lipstick but I built in God's relative actual name but\nI don't know how you look at a typo yeah maybe it is but but rather to put a million dollars together early according to the example of USA Today and he decided he wasn't going to pay fees it was just going to go into an as in the index fund and let it go because obviously a five hundred companies in there and wide degree of diversification so\nHe thought it'd be fun and decided he could based on a a retirement calculator decided he could take five percent off of that and started doing that take I'm forty one hundred sixty seven dollars a month\nAnd a ... as it as things went along a between two thought this is the apple goes from two thousand two thousand nine\nBy the end of two thousand four team the U.S and he was up sixty three percent wow he had a lot of extra money in his account is the ... the million dollars he started with Terry was down to three hundred and thirty six thousand seven or eight now he had taken money obviously hit taking money out of there but because of what have you with experience in the S. A. T.\nThat declined that they went along there that two thousand eight to ... he was not in a position to continue taking fibers that he was in a position to take two percent so\nIt's a lot about how big the numbers you start it's about what you can contractually bill that will give a guarantee that's an income planned Jay could you talk about what an income plan is\nYeah I mean it certainly doesn't sound like a having a certain plan their sounds more like racket Ralph ... are they going to\nCall Ralph's did get wrapped in fact I think I saw that Home Depot yeah he was demonstrating cut her cards or something like that wasn't and\nI think he was I didn't really\nHave nothing against Home Depot and got her car\nAbsolutely not when you when you look at what Ralph could have done you know what could have a goal what could have done different is built an income plan as you said that and that starts with an inventory and oh what do you need you know what do we need on a monthly basis what do we have coming in\nAnd then where's that gap what where's the gap that we need to fill to be able to ah be able to do what we want and that comes from your resources you have to listen to resources\nI Will throw out the website back out there synergy group Inc dot com under the resources have there is a great syllable a budget worksheet that you can walk through and it really just helps point out some of those categories when you're trying to figure out\nAn inventory of what you'll need in retirement some of those things that you might forget about ... like I say conveniently fills it in for you\nOn the website it's a budget worksheet at synergy group Inc dot com under the resource tap so once you figure out okay this is what we need we need an extra thousand dollars a month over and above our Social Security\nOver and above our rental income or pension or whatever might be their venue determine how why segment those resources that four O. one K. or IRA or the CDs I have to be able to create a thousand dollars was a little disruption as possible and and Ralph could have said look I'm going to take part of my million dollars\nAnd put that aside to create what I Need so that I don't end up in a situation of two thousand eight were to occur and folks that surround the foreigner I mean I don't know if it will be as bad as it will be worse\nBut the next markets like all the major down market cycle and when that occurs you don't want to be in that position that Ralph does which means you need an income plan that's what we are going to talk about a lot here today\nAre you listening to locks on your retirement here on your favorite radio station\nOur topic today is three strategies to build certainty into your retirement and you know we talked to a man and go about knowing your number and we referenced that one commercial where folks want it to know how much they needed to say and folks we use that term here to knowing your number but it's a different number\nAnd and just like in the commercial that number is different for every single person that comes in the door and let me just say this game or a um over the last two months I put together income plans and the number was so diverse for a young single girl who are not yet young she's getting close to retirement\nThat her number was thirty six thousand dollars a year that's what she needed to live on her income number was her income number that's right it wasn't about hitting that million dollars and ... that he lives in great shape because he had a million bucks\nThat's not the numbers that you're looking at so you know this this ... this girl and needed to thirty six thousand dollars a year I had a couple they're spending a hundred and fifty thousand dollars a year that's the number that you're looking to fix to not just finding that arbitrary number that I Need to save\nYou sat down with some folks just last week and they were looking for that one fifty a year number two and they can support that\nBut what they hadn't done in the original calculations something that we all need to do and has to put the determination as to how much does the government get a share with us before we get to keep what's left to have you ever thought about state taxes even those are federal taxes have gone down of the way we maybe take our exemptions maybe we're itemize before and now the standard deduction gives us a little bit more\nAbility to do that and they were not itemize thing anymore\nIt's why we have the CPA at the end of the hall I mean Tom Barrett here\nWell the answer those questions if you come in and we have a conversation and you bring a copy of your tax records we can show you mathematically what it would look like last year compared to what the new tax implications we'd be under the under the current law so if you haven't built tax flooding into your retirement plan you really have a build a good retirement\nWell and that's why the clients that take advantage of Tom services here I Know that their tax situation every year is being constantly monitored and that information is being shared with us the visor so that we can make sure that that plan is still viable you know we can update it we can tweak it and make sure\nThat it's it's still going to do what it was originally designed to do\nRight so you have to factor taxes in there and then you also have to factor in in a what a normal type of longevity um the average American should plan to spend at least twenty two years in retirement according to a recent study they're so twenty two years of the average amount of time\nPeople spend our retirement and if you're one of those people to say look I you know I understand what you guys are talking about but I really want to know how much do I need to have saved because I'm a goal oriented person and I can't just figure that out yet you know Tony Robbins put in his book money master the game you had a two step formula\nBasically said okay what do you need to live off of\nIf you need eighty thousand dollars a year to live you take that number and you multiply by twenty and that's a good target to shoot for those people that need to target out there um and Tony Robbins as really entered the financial industry and thrown some good tips out there are so those are some things to think about but there's a lot more than that it's not just we're just kind of scratching the surface here\nOn today's show is sharing three strategies to build certainty into your retirement thanks for tuning into locks on your retirement we just want to help you avoid nasty surprises and enjoy your retirement to the fullest and we're going to go to a break now\nBut when we come back we're going to explore why you and I

retirement we want to be certain that our money will last and that's why I Am today show or sharing three strategies to bill certainty into your retirement so that you can avoid surprises in the long run\nAnd you want to think about what does my ideal retirement looked like so go ahead for a second paint that picture in your mind\nAnd imagine yourself enjoying the absolute perfect retirement designed by you\nMaybe for one of us travelling spending time with the grandkids\nMaybe playing golf every day right now that's what my father in law is trying to work here though\nAre volunteering or simply having the freedom to choose what you want to do when you want to do it I Know ... years is going to look like what's that sleeping in yeah sleeping in would be a nice thing that's a you give that up for a lot of years with with all these ghettos running around the house but\nI I mean in the end the person you can count on the most of the person that you see in the mirror I mean it's certainly up to you to do the hard work to have enough saved for retirement yet saving for retirement only half the battle is crazy that sounds\nThat's the easy part the real battle is how do I adjust or turn my life savings into retirement income that will last as long as God has me on this earth and you know how are you going to guarantee that you don't outlive your assets and we're going to talk about that we're talking about a traditional role and why that's outdated\nOr traditional advice says that you should withdraw four percent from your portfolio again this is that four percent role and you shouldn't run out of money ever as long as you let it would last into your late night\nYou know are you using your stock or your mutual fund portfolio to provide that income to to pave the way for years of retirement income well you know that four percent rule don't be so sure there are some serious pitfalls to this advice\nMay biblical be speaking or you look when language was causing problems gone brought the time to be able down by\nGiving them different language to confuse them sometimes the language you hear out there about the four percent rule might be designed to confuse you also so uh again there was an article and marketplace or maybe two thousand eleven from Dr David babble then when he talks he's a professor risk management award in school business\nUh and he said that if you have a stock portfolio and withdraw four percent per year plus inflation you have a Ninety percent chance of running out of the money to retirement\nHow wait a second I thought that said Ninety percent chance of success\nNew Ninety percent chance of failure and again I remember he was living that pain the pain that we kinda forgotten that two thousand two thousand nine pain that if you look at that comment four percent distribution Ninety percent chance of running out of money before you run out of breath\nIt might just be view cause the concern is that the proper strategy for retirement income\nAnd here's where the fallacy lies many people say well I've lived through these market conditions I have the risk tolerance to stomach this look every time that I've left my money alone the market has rebounded and all these years that I've been building this retirement up it's always worked to just stay invested in the market will so she's never been retired\nYou've never actually gone from adding to your portfolio month by month paycheck to paycheck\nTo withdrawing from your portfolio month by month\nPaycheck from paycheck you've never done this before and that's why we're telling you things will be different this time it may have worked in the past but that same strategy of just trusting the markets ruined through here creates this scenario where you're no longer dollar cost
