and then I Want to give it to the president's speech last night I got a lot to\nTalk to you about one of the painful things to me about the\nThese attacks on America and specifically white Americans is how many wonderful white Americans there really are\n[laughter] to ... to ... fame\nWonderful people of every group obviously but you're only allowed to the same way\nThe Americans is if there's something particularly noxious about white America\nWhat America is a lot of beautiful people in it\nIt's really disgusting it's just disgusting I hate to so overwhelmingly from one direction it's just painful people live in denial of that\nBy the way I commend to you my column my Tuesday column I have a nationally syndicated color comes out two days I commend it to you\nNational Review town

yesterday to a an enormous crowd uh they they about Eighteen thousand filled the arena\nAnd you know who who gets those numbers on the left I'm ... and I I I'm not making an argument I'm asking the question who does get those does Brock Obama get those numbers I Am very curious\nWho get to those numbers on the left anyway\nI uh I Want you to hear some of the things first there's this one is very powerful or about who we worship want to want to play that one show\nNot government in Iraq for\nThe center of American Life so true\nWe don't worship government we worship God [noise]\nNow I ... it so I when I listen to these things this is just a habit of a lifetime when ever I listened to such things like whenever I speak I hear the voice of leftists in my brain\nIt's an automatic response to me it's almost ... how exactly is someone on the left responding and of course they lows everything that was just shit loads it\nSo that is to give away as to this very important distinction between left and non left you low was what was just said if you don't you're not a leftist\nAnd what is it exactly that is low some about it so let's go part by part let's begin again if you would show on with the kneeling and the flick\nKneeling and the flag\nAnd [noise]\nSo hold on there what why is that load some that we proudly stand for our national anthem and for our national flag why why would that be loathe\nTo a leftist\nIt's worth it's worth analyzing I'd like you to play this ah for a friend and say listen I just want to understand how you think I'm not going to argue\nI Wanna I I assume that you find is objectionable so let let let me in that what is bad about that we Pratt proudly stand\nFor our national anthem and our national flag\nAnd by the way I frankly\nDon't know the answer I almost always know what a leftist will say but I this one's a tough one what what are they going to say to proudly stand for the national anthem of the national flag gives an act of white supremacy ... it's a code word for bigotry\nIt's a a dog whistle to Xena phobia why don't I don't know exactly what they would find I Know they find it frightening and disgusting and the thought of Eighteen thousand people cheering for a further reinforces\nTheir disgust but I I really want you to understand\nThat it's a fairly recent vintage in American Life\nThat people would find a president saying we proudly stand for our national anthem and our flag to be disgusting\nLet alone fascist okay this is this is because we have gone so far left beyond where the left was even one generation to go next please\nNot government in Iraq or see\nOn the center of American Life so true\nAdult K O I hold on their show show yeah so ... ... okay so what would be left to say what's wrong with their faith and families the truth center of the American democracy or not ... was a government them bureaucracy\nSo you may recall a democratic convention a number of years ago we played it on the show a number of times I was ... I was actually at that convention I heard it live\nWhere they ... the ... the or not narrator the dmc the whatever term is used for the voice of a convention the resident voice\nGovernment does what Americans all Americans have in common or is the one thing all Americans share something to that effect\nThey really do believe that it has supplanted fate and family government and a bureaucracy he's right about that\nSee it's four percent of the wife as soon as the president says something to a crowd in particular it it is considered Neal for ... and all the usual adjectives throw it out\nBut I I really want to know from people what is wrong with that is faith and family not the center the lynchpin of American Life should not be\nArgued Mitt that it's that it's gradually no longer the case\nOf faith and family forty percent of Americans born to unwed mothers now and faith is dwindling\nBut\nIs that a good thing that's a question to ask a a person of the left in your life mixed number three claim number three of the president [noise]\nWe know that in America\nWe don't worship government we worship God [noise]\nIt it was as if he took a line and I'm not even implying that I'm not out of my mind that\nThat he is I'm just saying it was it was as if he would be from my current\nA video up at ... or you ... university on the American trinity that's exactly right because as government gets bigger God get smaller in the western world that's exactly what is happening government has some place the state has replaced golf\nBut that is entirely accurate\nSo there were three claims all of which would be found disgusting on the part of the left now when we get back I Will play you left wing reactions to another comment that he made in Houston last night and this will\nBe a ...

hanging at the visitor center of the European Parliament and on the plaque\nSays\nNational sovereignty is the root cause of the most crying evils of our time is the only final remedy for this evil\nIs the federal union of the people's\nIt's from a\nMan named Phillip curl later the markers of low seeing a British diplomat and peas or in the buildup to the second World War that's the description the telegraph of him\nThey wrote that in Nineteen thirty nine\nNational sovereignty is the root cause of the most crying evils of our time and the steady march of humanity back to tragic disaster and barbarism the only final remedy for this Supreme and catastrophic evil\nIs a federal union of the people that's what they believe that's exactly right\nBe turned out to be wrong by the way a Hitler\nSo it was worthy of extended analysis\nWhat it is they hate they hate the word nationalist as an example\nAnd I gave my supplies for you a quote\nFrom the European Union it's visitor center of the European Parliament has a plaque up national sovereignty used the root cause of the most\nPart time and the steady march of humanity back to tragic disaster and barbarism the only final remedy for the Supreme of catastrophic evil of our time is a federal union of the people see they believe the bigger the better\nThe American founders thought that since human nature stinks the less power concentrated in individuals hands the better\nSo but the left police people were basically good especially themselves they know that they are basically good because they're enlightened and therefore all the power that they could have will only be used benign only that is what they believe these people are fooled by\nDefinition left this may be sweet they may be a whole host of things but to the extent that they have left wing views their pools and foolishness begins with the belief\nThat power concentrated in a few people's hands if they are lightened enough is just wonderful they really do believe is actually in benign dictatorship that's what they believe the founders believed in diffusion of power separation of powers\nThat's why we have a Congress that's why we have an executive and that's why we have a court that is also why we have a U.S Senate to diffuse power among the states the left\nHates the Senate hates the Senate\nBecause it doesn't just reflect majority will because after all Wyoming with with fewer and fewer than a million people has as many senators is California was while I don't know thirty million forty million people but it's completely non democratic which is exactly what they wanted it to be\nThey did not believe in democracy that is from their perspective and its lack of faith in humanity mob rule\nSo folks this is just unknown today because you don't learn that at school who's going to teach it to you you're a left wing professor they don't even know what I just said it's not even a matter of suppressing it\nThey've never heard that they don't understand that the diffusion of power amongst many is a guard is guards against dictatorship but\nThey want the EU wants more and more power they're perfect example concentrated in Brussels that's why there was a ... they were shocked that a majority of rich did not by the idea that Britain should seated sovereignty to a larger\nInstitution called the European Union\n\nIf you believe people are basically good then it's great to concentrate power in a few people's hands if you don't believe people were basically good you have to be an idiot to concentrate all that power in the few people\nBut as I said they believe in themselves if there's if they don't believe in God much but they sure do believe in themselves we know what's best for you\nEnvironmentally and sexually and artistically you

not ... it's the most important thing and it's not used\nWhich is a a real reason for the problems and troubles of our time in America I mean the western world generally it's W. word that we were the\nPeople without thinking thinking work\nWorth\nAbout how many people even if like say the bill you were mill wisdom you know it's you know how bad it is how bad the situation is the word is boring to most people\nSay to a young person would you like to be wise I think you will get to the response what do you mean would you like wisdom what do you mean\nWould you prefer wisdom or a new

every\nYou could ever knew the newest model Android or the newest model I phoned\nEvery year for the rest of your life or wisdom I Wonder what people would vote for\nBut I think most people would say what you mean that's the point it's not valued\nLet me tell you ... where this is it my whole life it is been a ... a love I Want to understand why does wisdom understanding of life that is what wisdom is okay it's a it's it's the single word term for understanding of life\nYou can know a great deal and understand nothing\nThat is why the highly educated are usually the least wise members of our society\nHey because universities teach the opposite of wisdom they teach you to be a fool in my opinion some people escape on harmed but many dope and secondly because they teach you implicitly from explicitly\nThat knowledge is what matters rather than wisdom\n\nWhat the what aside from political correctness and the preoccupation and race and gender what does it show that Shakespeare's poster was taken down at the University of Pennsylvania English department\nIt shows a lack of wisdom because he wrote the wisest plays written in the English language but it's not value\nAll that matters is not wisdom but in this case race and gender so they they dismissed him because\nHe was a white male and they put up a female I don't know what color\n\nWisdom without wisdom you can't do good\nVis and good is what most concerns me good versus evil you can't be a good person if if you're a fool and the food is the opposite of the ... person and those of you who are biblical you oriented build the word food is used pretty often\nWhat does the fool fool does a person without wisdom doesn't mean a person without compassion so let me talk to you about compassion for a moment wisdom is infinitely more important than compassion in setting social policy\n\nYou will be if it's if if you just hear that today it will be very important if only that sinks in in making political social policy for a society wisdom is infinitely more important than compassion\nCompassion without wisdom is destructive\n\nAnd that's what we have that is what we have in the western world vast amount of compassion or pseudo compassion that doesn't matter even if it's genuine compassion compassion without wisdom is overly destructive\nSo I feel bad for people I'm not going to get into policies are going to continue the discussion about wisdom ... or give you an example here\nI feel bad for people who don't have as much as others and so we will give them more benefits\nBut the wise person asks what are you doing to that person and to the society by giving them more and more people benefits\nIs it good for society is a different question that's a question of wisdom is it compassionate is not a question that has anything to do with wisdom\n\nCompassion without wisdom is destructive\n\nAnd we don't produce people with wisdom because wisdom is in ... was the isn't soft it isn't taught because it isn't soft\n\nI Believe ultimately that the radical secularization of western society is at the core of the lack of wisdom\n\nWhen I get calls this I have I Know I mentioned
