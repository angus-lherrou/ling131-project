those who hate the president but I have a model with regard to that\nI adopted this when I ... in my first full time job and I was the\nDirector of a Jewish Institute in California that's why I moved from New York to California in my twenties to direct this Institute\nThey had weekend\nRetreats it's gorgeous facility thirty two hundred acres and they had this summer sessions for young people and I would advocate God's existence and I would advocate\nUh observance of the laws in the Bible and so on and some members of the board were very afraid of my advocacy of God's existence and observance of the laws of the Bible and so on\nAnd they uh they would say to me and then not not not was hatred or anything like that are just they would be worried and they would say you know you'll alienate some of the people who come and I developed a great phrase that has guided me you can't alienate the alienated\nThey already worry Leah needed [laughter]\nThat's why they showed up [laughter] somebody you know a friend begged them to cover his buddy treated the weekend or whatever\nSo you know I'll alienates people by saying that the president of the United states has been great that's far I don't think that those people have already not been alienated I guess that's all it takes is is a favorable word of a mere vote for Republican\nAnd you're pro rape you understand how sick to does become

are but do you have no idea where you're supposed to be going the ultimate issues our is about where we're going\nOn about the map of where we are although that but to make us\nToday is going to be a little more political than most are not in the sense of direct politics but the subject has political direct political ramifications I have a have a sad realization that I'd like to share with you\n\nOr better maybe I shouldn't put it is sad realization I have a question to\nPose\nAnd by my earlier statement that said realization you have an idea of what I think the answer is but here's my question\nDo people prefer liberty or to be taken care of\n\nSo you know my you know my answer even if you have never heard me before just by the fact that I said said realization you know what I Believe I've come to the conclusion that most people prefer to be taken care of and lose liberty\nThan\nHave liberty\nAnd not be taken care of and have to take care of themselves now obviously up to the extreme that you you can't find a doctor you can't find the hospital you can find a policeman obviously there's we're talking about within certain bounds\n\nBut that is how that is how people think\nI Want to be taken care of and if I lose liberty and the process that's OK America was founded on the belief of liberty\nAnd I think most Americans assume for well I don't know I take that back I think a lot of Americans assume that that was in a chord with the human universal human desire freedom\nBut it it it is it you know the\nNew York times are you ready I'm telling you this is going to shock you shock you in terms of its stupidity as much as in terms of its politics the New York times had an op ed piece in the last few days\nI did not mention it but I read it and\nI have to clean it up I mean there wasn't it wasn't that all profane but\nYou know kids listen to this am I Am aware of that that but also put it in a very ... general way and somewhat opaque adults will understand it was an article about women who have lived under communism\nAnd then lived under freedom so it was East German women\nAnd then the wall was torn down and they mail had freedom no longer living under communism\nThe article was a serious article you must understand this is a NATO lampooned is not from the onion it was a serious article claiming that women under communist Germany living in communist East Germany\nHad a more fulfilling sex life than women in a West Germany\n\nYou read that correct now the argument was they were show taken care of that the absence of the freedom to even speak did not trouble them as much as they felt rewarded\nBy all the benefits of a communist state it was by the way a series of articles in the New York times about how life in less free societies can be better\n\nSo then there was another article just the let's see what today Wall Street journal what's ... give up for free money\nI moved to Sweden for love not money\nBut I was happy to learn that merely living in this social democracy also when title neither paid parental leave benefits who could objective free money handed out by the government to all Swedish parents then I became a father\n\nAnd he talks about the you know everything free health care subsidized housing paid leave out employment benefits job training pensions\nAnd you know he said this system of inter laced welfare programs is the government's attempt to realize the political and social ideal that has seemingly universal acceptance among Swedes that has noticed\nTo get the R y doubled G. H. E. T. right\nSo it's it's the feel so comfortable and secure\nEverything is taken care of\nNow\nOne of the prices you pay is that you know you pretty much have to think like everybody else you know think of the box\nAnd you just in my life becomes this is me I'm not reading from the article life becomes I've often said about Western Europe life becomes really a debate about\nHow many hours I can get off how much vacation time I can have how much I can travel and it sounds awesome adjust I mean what could be better at work less\nTaken care of this is utopia\n\nLet me continue six months ago my two year old niece broke her leg the physician who treated the girl told my brother in law that his daughter would be given a full body seat the scan\nWhich you might say huh\nShe broke her leg and the doctor wants to give the the girl a full body seep the scan\nThe doctor insisted that the procedure was mandatory but not for any medical reason I Wonder if a single one of you listening knows the reason\nThe doctor ordered a full body seat the scan of a two year old girl that's a lot of radiation by the way\nA two year old girl gets a full body scan for a broken leg\nAnybody I Know the reason\nDon't think there's any one that I ... I couldn't guess I was thinking why is she getting a full body she peace can write the doctor insisted that the procedure was\nMandatory get it mandatory he had no choice\n\nBut not for any medical reason rather the Swedish social services administration\n\nRequires such scans to look for evidence of child abuse\nWhile the doctor did note that the broken leg was the result of an accident [noise]\n\nKeep told my brother in law the matter was out of my hands\nThat is the doctor saying that it is out of my hands I I have no say whether your daughter get to see peace ... when the girl's parents refused to subject to this unnecessary procedure\nThe hidden machinery of the Swedish welfare state spring into action my\nBrother in law and his wife were required to attend multiple interviews with social workers\nAnd to submit to friends and neighbors in in their small\nTown for questioning\nSocial workers even inspected their phone suddenly decisions is benign is why milk to buy seem potential evidence of parental deficiency my inlaws feared their two children might be taken from them\nIn Sweden the state reserves for itself ultimate responsibility for children's wellbeing\nAs appear at my job is to give my kids the to get that that Swedish term for this great all the developing security necessary to become productive tax paying members of sweet of society\nThat is why I receive financial support at medical benefits\nThe state is paying me to be a parent\nThis is the key here I Am in effect an employee\nWhy people are home schooled their children are looked at very often negatively but a lot of other parents the states should teach your children who the hell are you to educate your own children\n\nSo this has been a revelation in my life this deal\nBut issues our because this is an ultimate issue do we do we want to preserve liberty number one or take care of people\nBy take care take being taken care of now obviously there's there's gotta be an element of being taken care of we we all understand that but an element is the dominant which is dominant liberty or the other\n\nEven being taken care of to the point where I don't want you to have the liberty to speak because what you say\nMay offend me is another example of liberty being downgraded on behalf of being taken care of I I don't want to hear anything that may hurt me\n\nOkay ah let's go to a are too\nDoesn't agree so he gets on first hello or doesn't agree Allentown, Pennsylvania Hi\nHi Dennis I Do want to be on good terms\nLet me see if I can explain\nIt
