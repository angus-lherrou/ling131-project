{"month": "10", "state": "PA", "station": "WPGP", "content": "I look at myself and say I want to hire people smarter than me\n[laughter] you know I Want those people around me working and I want to be the encourage your in order to do that and you know you think about second uh flipping flipping to I'm Sorry you know talking about that meant mindset of Christ that servant mindset of Christ in God humbling himself communist world humming himself\nAnd I think not only that talked about the humility you've got I think I talked about the leadership of God that we should really try to emulate when we're leaders and it's about serving leadership it's about providing resources and the courage to people make them better\nAbsolutely grace mercy and maybe a little loving kindness thrown in our guest is Doug leap president of wings bird university or listening to leadership CEO forum here on a busy ... brought you by word if in Salem Media were thrilled to have dug in with us uh another thing I wanted to talk to you about a little bit is\nHow does that leadership thing in the philosophy of it I guess and the culture you transfer that down to the students and you know they got to get the GPA or they you know all these they want they want that degree but how do you\nGet the leadership into them even from or whether it's in sports or academics or other extracurricular what what kind of been the thought there I'm so glad you asked me that question you know that's what they pay me for that but it was it just kind of came to my\nYeah no it's an excellent question so it weighs ...\nWe are focused on students making connections between their faith how they serve and how they learn the more connections that you make with your faith in terms of serving and learning in your career the connections the more integration\nYou have in your life more integrity your life has and the more transformational your life can become when you make all those connections so we focus on those three key components in their education\nPractically what do we do that I think I'm I'm so very very proud of\nIs the is the immersion trips\nThat we send our students on locally or nationally and around the world and when you take a freshman or sophomore that's never been to another country and it's never seen the suffering in another country that is a transformational moment for yeah and really puts a perspective\nOn where they should be and where they need to be heading in the world and it's an amazing thing and that servant leadership because you're going there to serve but you're also going there to really try to work with those individuals not just to make yourself feel good about that service but also more importantly to look at them and say how can I help them\nAnd how can they helped me really working together can we can we build a better community for that yeah so it's really about that higher purpose of services as opposed to just going in serving in feeling good about it\nIt is that the program every student has involved and then there's some things that you have that all students have to do but I can remember was community service\nI follow the ... have a service requirements are credit that every student must do we also have a program fee it locks really focuses for the freshman on these key component so they have a really great understanding\nOf that and then the other thing that these mission trips yeah and and it's amazing to to the athletic teams do them yeah as well yeah you know the basketball team go to your bank or you know the football team of the football team last year every single football player signed up to be a bone marrow donor\nWhich I was so highly proud of that is Romanian Arab you're putting yourself out the oh yeah for for helping others in the in some just love the students we hadn't I'm so proud of what they're doing\nWell that is great to hear because I knew there was some of that involved and so when people are listening to think about well where's where kids going to go to college and you think well it's it's a lot more than just open\nThe textbooks you can go anywhere and get a vocational education it'll probably prepare you for a job but really what you want is to be prepared for life and have that life philosophy that's going to transform neighborhoods and communities\nAnd he'd been our guest is

Doug we've got about one minute left that Perry out there that thinking about uh where are their son or daughter is a junior or senior is going to go to school in a while they might just if nothing else to talk down to come and\nVisit you know I really do think were worth a look I had to students that I sent away\nTo college my wife and I we remember that that's going from campus the campus of cancers that oh my goodness we're going to make the right decision or not you know and it's an important decision but the more important decision I think in that whole process house where is where are you in your face and your trust in Egypt\nBecause she will always you too where you need to be continued have that so you know where you go is very important but it's not the most important in your life but\nWe don't always want to be dealing with them and I know that surround that holiday season where people like to be afraid or scared at certain things but finance as I can certainly never one of them\nAnd when you're looking at people with thirty five percent of all Americans are about Seventy seven million of them\nHave at least one day in collections like an average cab well over five thousand dollars that's OK here at home whenever we can consolidate that get rid of that stop letting it make compound interest because it will come ask curio [noise]\nBack in the back back in the day people used to say well I'll just ignore it for seven years and then you will disappear [noise]\nThis day and age there are so many collection agencies out there that they just sell it to another collection agency if they weren't able to get you to pay it off and not agency will sell it to another\nIn ... so it keeps renewing itself that that just keeps compounding income pounding and that snowball keeps getting bigger that dead of yours is never going to go away so it's something to pay\nAttention to because those that rule of thumb that people live by before that magic seven years and then it disappears\nDoesn't apply anymore it's about being responsible for the debt that you have and maybe you can make a settlement on it but just show up and we can help you get on track with that\nAnother great thing that I'm you know we're talking about Sarah that you mentioned before was with Bloomberg report my student loan debt\nRight I mean ... through the roof\nIt is through the roof he said it was a hundred and fifty seven\nPercent and and I are fifty seven percent increase on student loan debt and um it's the rates are usually even the government loans are at seven to nine percent the parent plus program seven percent just to go sign let's say to bring that money out for your children and the interest rates on mortgages are super low so mortgages are good that\nWe could very easily refinance and take that money out but it's astronomical it\nThan it is adamant when you're looking at that number that's one point four trillion dollars in student loan debt\nAnd with a lot of parents coach signing for their children or just taking you know this parent plus student loans out those are loans that are directly relying on your credit as well so that impacts your ability to borrow why not take it out through your mortgage why not just give us a quick\nThree to five minute phone call we can talk about how we can get it done for you so that way you write it off on your\nDebt at the end of the air and also you get that low fixed interest rate payment we all went to help our children and we all want to see them succeed we all want them to be able to go to the best college and have no worries we all have that dream let us help you make the help that much talked about it\nI mean when you're putting things into perspective\nWith student loan debt forty four million borrowers\nThat's forty four million borrowers oh\nSix hundred and twenty billion more than what just credit card debt is in the United states\nThat is a horrible statistics this is a horrible statistic because it's fixable I'm not saying college education is it worth it I'm not saying don't let your children go to the College of their dreams or\nLive the dream that they want to get that great education it's about doing things the way the way the smart way if you have Apple's it's about putting the right apples in the right baskets it's that simple\nAnd you have to look also at credit card that\nThe average American spends one dollar and thirty three cents for every dollar that they earn one dollar in thirty three cents for every dollar that you earned that is putting so many more Americans in debt you're having more debt and you're having savings and with\nOver the years the average spending has increased thirty percent it's not your fault that the groceries have gone up it's not your fault that the gas prices have gone up but it it can be fixed through your rights changes with how you're spending your money where are you getting your money from\nAnd who are you paying your money to let's start making ourselves or at your instead of the big bang structure let's start putting that money back in our pocket\nAnd making sense out of where that money comes from with average debt upwards of thirty eight thousand dollars and just credit card you're going to be internally indebted because even though that amount might not seem very large\nWhat that amount turns to in order to be paid off\nIs the scary part of it because that's money that could be saved invested for you your family your faith your children let's look at about where that money's going how it's going and how quickly\nWe can do that for you all it takes is I'm not kidding you a quick easy several minute phone call any time of day even on the weekends and we can help make that magic happen for you and make sure that your financial future is on the right path\nSo he can always reach us you can literally go onto the website and set up a time even to chat with us or the website is ... and the and teach cheat dot com and then you can schedule time weekends evenings are fine\nI'm ... and you can always call it the one eight hundred six six to nine five zero\nUh the question right now with the where we are even with credit scores often we may want to refinance\nMay want to lower interest rates so we work with the wholesale banks were a family owned business and if you're looking at even buying a second property lower down payment options we go down to five eighty scores but even for folks of eight hundred scores it's well worth asking the question to see if we can do better on the interest rate\nBecause rates do change daily and it's important to have the lowest payment option as well\nA and one of the key parts of even Pennsylvania here in Pittsburgh we've noticed that you want to pay off the mortgage but the mortgages good debt so if you have credit card if you don't have enough money and retirement why not take money out of the home when values are going up and break are still low\nInvesting it in retirement funds investing in and\nPaying off that debt\nVersus just paying off the mortgage which is good debt and having all of this other bad debt so we're living longer folks are our projections are eighty seven years of age for for women men about eighty five\nBut as the years go by their projecting a hundred two hundred and fifty years at Stanford statistics so\nI certainly think that's a positive but we have to plan if we are in a position where we don't have enough during our golden years though fixed income\nAgain that could be an issue if you don't have enough money put aside for health care issues that may come up\nA for even fun time or buying that second home and I say to folks always\nCall us and and just be curious because\nHere's one of the things with Pennsylvania and Florida we have a population very wise above sixty two years of age\nWho may not know the benefit of having a reverse mortgage and being able to choose to make a mortgage payment or not now this is not a question mark alone it is a government sponsored\nProgram you always keep the home and the deed and ownership of the property\nYou can ... or sell it whenever you wish its government sponsored so you do need to go through counseling and we pay for the appraisal all about education and empowering our listeners and over the last fourteen years we've been able to share information about what is happening in the market because we work with\nFifty wholesale lenders are just like as we're heading to the holidays going to the outlet store getting a better price on brand names\nBut at a lower cost and with the work that we do our lenders pay off for the services so you don't have to so please do asked the question and reach out to us but we have about two minutes left Christina so you have a little\nBit of time while right around the corner and the holiday oh I Love ... I Do to\nOne of the scariest things so not Halloween but one of the scariest things is that people do end up spending a lot more in this heavy seas in a lot of people spend a lot more whether it's your\nGas or electric heat bills or ... or whether it's decorations for the holiday season or it has a Christmas present shopping whatever the cases hall all the spending\nIs a ritual in America to never going to change but one thing that's important is to stop the hangover\nAnd the hangover usually begins when you get that first credit card bill it's called the financial hangover great way to stop it is to talk to us now nip it in the bud let's get this going let's start saving because\nYou're going to be the winners at the end of it quick five minute phone conversation can really change your life to take off those financial blenders and really open up\nA lot of opportunity for you let's increase the ability to borrow let's increase the ability to spend more freely and to understand where your finances are quick little adjustments let us work our magic\nAnd put you on the path to financial freedom\n[noise] folks out with that call us at one eight hundred six six to nine five zero and again a final\nGraduations Allen levine and Jim Frasier well done for the many years of service that you provided on TV uh and receiving media war it's ah this past week as well as try and make it to the November third event with Bill Neal\nNow towards financial issues working harder is not usually the way to eliminate a financial issues necessarily because if even if you work six or seven days a week if you are\nA holding on to a higher interest rate on the mortgage or if you have credit card issues\nUh ten Fifteen twenty thousand it's very hard to get off of that mission cycle because Eighteen percent rate is Fifteen thousand dollar credit card minimum four or five hundred dollars it's not even making a dent then sometimes you have an emergency you have to use that credit card again so it's bumping up to the limit\nWhich ends up bringing the score down so if you're looking at buying a home for refinancing if you're looking at a credit score that's an issue if let's say\nYou have a a higher debt to income ratio we can make sure that we will give you that hope and give you the yeah and we're happy to work with you we've had a ... lot fourteen years some who've worked away after a year they are they're ready to buy that home or refinance and then we have folks who are looking at\nWell I Want to buy this luxury home it's a million dollar property but I'm getting a rate that's much higher my credit score is great why am I getting a five percent interest rate\nIt because when it comes to wholesale lending we're in a position to provide you a much lower interest rate and the four is even\nIf it's a million dollar property you're going to end up spending two thousand dollars more on a mortgage with a higher interest rate and the Sixers or the seven but with us You're going to keep that two thousand dollars a month which is going to equate to a million dollars in savings after Thirty years if not more imagine that so\nI really encourage folks ask questions where here for you Darren night the number one eight hundred six six to nine five zero stay well folks\nListen more hatred download the way it is I can have a residential and commercial purchases refinancing out eight hundred sixty nine five\nThe breeding program furnished by most of the mortgage corporation for fifty theater whether [noise]\nWhere are you being Robin Williams afternoon a couple of hours like fifty six but I mostly Guardia winning with a few hours on his around the beeping and a couple of rain or snow showers late wife humanly possible in the world of thirty five tomorrow lingering rain or snow in the morning\nAnd talked to a club and some of the afternoon will be reviewing behind only forty four Monday partly funny high fifty four I'm you're all just showing dream on on AM twelve fifty the answer\nThe two thousand Eighteen midterm elections may be the most consequential in memory and Pennsylvania will play a critical part maybe the critical part and the outcome please join me for the battleground talkers tour in ... heights country club October twenty seconds along with my friends you\nLet us pray gr in Pittsburgh phone John stagger Walters we clarify what's to say this November tickets started to twenty dollars get details on dinner the program in the IT tickets now at the answer P.

Kevin Bach of integrity retirements solutions Seventy four eight three seven three five five three seven to for eight three seven three five five three you can always get more details on the website and integrity retirement solution\nDot com now Kevin you have nearly three decades in the business and I like how you say our clients don't lose money when the market tanked which brings me to this first subject ... had a lot of people talking about here\nYou know if you're a member of thirty plus years ago this month the Dow locked up five hundred and eight point twenty two percent of its total value kind of a big day and on that day that came to be known as black Monday Allison Murray now an executive with Fortune Magazine shared his memories of the crash with the wall Street Journal\nPeople sort of forget it was five hundred and eight points we say five hundred and they point is pretty writer I forget what a big deal that was enacted a law no one had seen anything like that [noise] Nineteen twenty nine that was really the beginning of the volatile markets that we've been living was since then it was a really big deal\nThat is a huge deal that's twenty two percent of the total market value it wiped it out any single day that is huge but we don't have to worry about anything like that happening again Kevin or really I guess you eat because the Dow went up and down this past week\nWell the dog run up and down today in today's values that'd be a five or six thousand point drop in one day that would be significant and then there's probably a lot of people didn't concern and waking up\nAnd sometimes we need to have to wake up but look we're uh we're in now the longest bull market and history\nWas I mean it's been charging up and up and up and now if you've been following it has been going up and down has been kind of stagnant but it's been going up and down for a short time now and if you look back the last two crashes are kind of did that before the crash\nI mean I don't feel is going to crash tomorrow but I feel it's going to we're going to have some kind of a correction here and then in in the near future\nUm five to six thousand dollars a pop up once in a day\nYou know I don't know but if you look back also history the last crash something that never happened in history happened is called a black swan event\nThat blondes went down with the equities usually we used to take the equities and we would head to a down market with bonds and they would go up as the equities went down and vice versa but now you can't say that that for sure is going to happen because in two thousand seven the bombs also went down\nIs really important for for people to not be complacent and and be aware that any time now it's the market could crash it could go down a couple of points you could go down\nTwenty percent thirty percent if it went down forty and fifty percent like it did and the last two crashes mhm how's how's it going to affect your retirement how's it going affect your retirement date if you're not retired yet\nYou mentioned just a few moments ago you know I feel the market's going to go down or I feel this well a lot of people say okay well that's great I hear a lot of talking heads saying they feel this or they're predicting that's I think at some point some people become blind and they go well it's the boy who cried wolf no one knows what's gonna happen why should I listen to anybody but\nThat's exactly the key is that nobody knows what's gonna happen not me not you're not anybody listening no one has that first a ball but you have to be prepared for the when not if but when something happens and I think a lot of people had their blinders on when it comes to that\nYeah that's exactly it is it's not if it's going to happen is when it's going to happen or you prepared if you're coming close to retirement they fought for ten years of what we call close to retirement they ...\nIf you are in that period of time and you want to retire at a certain age or a certain date if the market crashes how's that going to affect your retirement date or you're going to have to lay your your your retirement date we had a client that\nThree times a took them before the crash of like a Nineteen Ninety nine ah they started saying we're going to do something and then whatever started crashing in two thousand they said well we got to postpone a 'cause we've got to wait for our money to come back they were young enough\nThen right before it crashed in two thousand seven two thousand eight there were you to make a move and then the market crashed and they said\nWell we can't do anything we gotta wait for our money to come back\nSo as you get older you have enough time to wait for your money to come back ... and where that comes into play is if you're taking income from your retirement money\nIf you're taking your minimum distributions or you're taking income to live off of and that market crashes you have to you know potentially so more shares to get that same income coming in or reduce your lifestyle so you don't have to have so much income coming in ... is that an option you want and retirement\nAre supposed to be a golden years we should be gotten out there and having a blast so when your time has done you're broke that doesn't usually happen that way but you know proper planning can help you make sure that you don't get broke before your time is done\nThis was the old tax rate before this year seven hundred and eighty thousand at one point four million after the devastation yeah you gotta you gotta take the IRS out of your inheritance\nThe worst the IRS spells there's and we try to separate it get them out as much as we can and then provide as much of your legacy to your family as possible\nAnd that's what it's about as well protecting yourself your legacy your family avoiding those disaster situations I Know it can be overwhelming and stressful thinking about the future but it's something that we all have to do to protect ourselves and again\nIt's a process you're going to have several meetings with Kevin one on one to get those questions answered needs available by phone if you ever get home you take what would you say about this\nThis and that and he wants to make sure you have the resources and you guys are on the same playing field it's not just going to be you sitting there and Kevin do it on the work and there's going to be no conversation Kevin wants to make sure you understand exactly why he is you know recommending these strategies and tools\nOnce again that phone number seven to for eight three seven\nThree five five three now\nOutside of legacy planning tax planning income planning all the planning process in general there is one thing that is really tough for a lot of people to really wrap your head around and that is that transition that you are making from your work job to retirement cat and talk to me about how you help ease the stress during this time\nGenerally whenever you become voluntarily unemployed or otherwise known as retirement\nUm there's going to be a big void in your life for a while you've got forty hours of your hundred sixty eight hour week there's going to be changed mhm then you have the other part of of your retirement is you're going from a certain income every week or two you you had your paycheck coming in\nAnd now that certain income could be gone unless you do proper planning if you need to have additional income coming in from your other than your pensions in your Social Security\nWhere's that going to come from how's it going to come so we can create your personal pension plan out of your retirement money and continue to have those guaranteed checks coming in for the rest of your life no matter how long you live\nAnd you may want to have a little bit extra coming in and then you don't have to worry as much about what the market is doing it for so long as you have guaranteed income coming in and whenever we do that income planning we look at two things\nWe look at what is the base some or you need to come in every month just to pay your bills near food your church and your taxes and then we have the lifestyle I'm On\nHow much do you want to create the lifestyle that you desire in retirement\nThose amounts can be guaranteed to come in no matter what\nHow would you feel or you're going to be worrying about if the markets are going to crash after you retire and you may have to do without so we can have you have help help you have a happy retirement by giving you that guaranteed income stream to mash or needs and your lifestyle desires\nAnd never have to worry again you have about a market crash\nYeah replacing that paycheck that's what it's all about right everyone is kind of in a long time when you're waiting the next two weeks to get that paycheck to paycheck you feel a little bit better you know you come up above the surface and paying some bills now when you retire it's not going to be like that can be a little different so you have to think how am I getting replaced is income that I've been used to getting every two weeks before you know fifty sixty years\nAnd of course how much money you've saved it can also determine when and if you're ready to retire because it depends on the number I think Kevin you mentioned this before\nAnd that if you had your pile of money so to speak here but your lifestyle is extravagant maybe you need five to ten thousand dollars a month maybe what your wants and needs in retirement you could end up spending your big pile of money at an early age so that means you're not ready to retire we get clients\nCome in here and we're asking the questions was our base need amount that they need every month and their lifestyle news I have to really make a lot of times they don't understand what what they've said was that can provide them um but then on the other side sometimes people don't think they have enough\nThat we had one client that um we sat down with him he didn't think he could retire yet and I said who call Mike Mike you could have retired two and a half years ago he could retire today if he wanted to and believe it or not he procrastinated and within a couple of years he passed away\nSo really it goes both ways either number one you saved more than enough that you need but you didn't know that you could retire so you've got those years that are I guess wasted that you could have been doing something fun and retirement you continued working because you didn't meet with a professional who said hey you know what Jim you're great go ahead and your retirement had the time of your life\nAnd also if you say I'm ready to retire I'm not working another day in my life here's my pile of money but by the way I Need ten thousand dollars a month my lifestyle I Want to take three cruises a year and I want to get my hair done here I mean whatever those things are they add up real quick and by the time Kevin doesn't that he can go well if that's your lifestyle and that's how you're going to live\nUnfortunately you're going to run out of money in Twenty years what's your thought then\nSo it played both sides of the coins there so that's why it's so important to have that conversation with Kevin one on one\nSee where you are right now in the rose who retirement see what else that you need to be doing to better your your odds in the future and and really get down and winning exactly you can throw in the town to the nine to five and enter retirement give them a call today asked about the six pillars of a successful retirement\nWe're going to open about five more spot here for the next two weeks to sit down for complimentary consultation with Kevin\nAnd you also receive a Patrick Kelley book it's called stress for retirement I enjoyed it I Hope you're going to enjoy it as well really easy read and really turns on a light bulb to different

executive in history who has worked for both the White House and crumbling and um you know hasn't been investigated or had an FBI Cory\n[laughter] he said that that too and we are Michael\nI'm On earth may in our ah yeah but how how often they call me there are a\nA a condo with a quarter of a Senate committee for the same thing the mall or investigation that was a real on one you know bogus so\nWell and that's what this all seems to be coming down after all this time and all the money that people have spent on this and uh you know this is one of the things too I wanted to talk to you about being a formal or you know former Trump campaign adviser um you know you were a communications advisors specifically\nAnd we think about how uh the campaign was presented by the mainstream media and of course everybody was so shocked after the results but you weren't shocked I mean you saw the momentum you saw what was going on the thousands of people that are out there to see Donald Trump or during the campaign of twenty sixteen\nSo no big surprise for you on a on election night but for the mainstream media their heads exploded because this was the last thing expected because their communications advisors said oh no it's a slam dunk Hillary by Ninety percent right\nRight and and I'll tell you it was all the way around every ... same thing every day at work\nI was on TV that like through and I know I was when when they were your Florida for Donald Trump afterwards the victory I knew where you want this great ... and I just look around me and and watch the gray matter you know on the walls of their heads the order then\nNo but there are some relax or else today I think the Democrats win but\nIf the if you know the Trump voters like ... ... ... but at home and they vote on November ... river more\nOn November say by the house\nWell you're exactly right one of the things I maintain Michael there's a this candidate is an anomaly and he's been unique and no tradition says that ruling or the party that controls the White House who loses seats routinely\nA Donald Trump has been anything but routine look what he's done and not bending and exposing the deep state taking on these issues that mainstream America has forgotten men and women have wanted to take on forever and it's a wonder scratching their heads on what's going on with this government you know\nThat uh we keep on incurring all kinds of that we're not taking care of our national security were compromised internationally jobs are in the tank we've got more people on welfare than ever before people's dreams are being awarded this isn't the America that um you know I thought for\nAnd defend it as far as freedom is concerned it's not the America that is that shining light in the hill\nThat Ronald Reagan spoke out and it took Donald Trump or it took a guy like Donald Trump to go to the top of the hill and put in a new light bulb right\nIt really did and I think that's a really important thing to talk about because you know we we had a great president Ronald Reagan and George W horse I work for him it was a guy you know George W. Bush I you know even Bill Clinton for the good thing that I'm now your wife\nOr even though our country's going downhill and at this point in time you know in a in a lot of ...\nYou know the regular guy or the power of the guys are just not getting that done we have a higher up it was somebody on clay and politically correct someone who's not afraid to offend a delicate sensibility inside the beltway mentality\nAnd we start with Donald Trump and\nWithout a doubt and the thing is um you know you mentioned Bill Clinton let's let's just be honest about it to the Democratic party has not Bill Clinton's party anymore is it\nOh it is not as though are gone and it it doesn't have a ... a a course in the nine ...\nAnd and you can keep on going back whether it's a you know JFK or other a

for myself I I just like it took me wait for my my jaw that kind of you know [laughter] go back to normal 'cause I was in the perpetual all you know position with my mouth I mean it's incredibly\nWell it's a good reminder that God the creativity is alive and well you know we get to experience it every year but just once a year when a ...\nYou know beautiful green trees all of a sudden become just a brilliant colors of orange and yellow and read and it's just absolutely astounding so now's the time of year ... apple festivals everywhere lots of farms open up their doors and you can come in and you know drink some apple ... hot apples later\nBut if you're from Southern California may want to bring your coat\n... well I'm well even worse yeah now a U.S or I\nI moved from a four years ago from

kids and I just have some hot chocolate and enjoy the holidays that'd be awesome yeah let's call them\nTo have you okay great let's talk about most is I mean gosh ... this was so fantastic won't when we saw Moses on the big screen and uh it was just such a blessing again sight and sound and only the wayside and sound can do it you guys just do it begin wonderful\nI'm well thank you so much bill

of or little children and ah you know some\nSome great council in there so a Arun welcome to bill merging the slide good to have you with us\nAnd I thank you for having though I didn't hear\nWell are entering a we know 'em I say we know and I'm saying this from my father's side because uh you know fathers learn real quick ... into a degree\nUh and it's quite shocking uh when we learn really what moms do for the family and for kids all it takes his mom kind of you know maybe taking a couple of extra hours it can be shopping\nIn God Forbid that it's a weekend because then if you're going to the entire weekend\nYou know dads are in therapy for at least three months you know try try and do we feel like going oh my God what am I doing here are so moms have their hands full\nAnd uh we honor moms more than just one day you're here I'm do Martinez every day that we on her mom's 'cause we love them and we're so grateful for um you know what they do for our families\n... thank you sound like I I I agree wholeheartedly adding and lots of grateful every time I had said they will pay for health and give me that powers are sanity\nAnd but I yeah I I agree and I think that adds a righty of God and that definitely being a mom and it's challenging African exporting\nOut it's awful last holiday for me at least that really caught me I'll kill place where I Am just now but I think they can avoid that I have to raise the trap that and hopefully had bring out the lord and\nI was just an awful lot possibility that something that you get hired in wind out of it and on and it's something that I Wonder whether at that they will kill and it's\nActually been so wonderful and strain because that's and that's not let the lord has really ... that is not really all that I had it on him but he always had\nAn event there that's not let my children he sort of ... they call it child again it to a child and ... and his team I Can't let the eyes of the things that went out there and show I end the comfort of\nComfort with it and they like\nKids that now I just ask for help and by that encouraged\nI knew that it had that sort of relationship with God through them\nYeah it really is when you stop and think about it um a friend of mine has written in one of her books are about um you know about the spirit of a child I mean Jesus said unless you've come as a child\nA yeah you know I mean when you think about the the ... of that perspective a did God wants you to come to him as as a child you know very ... you know it's\nI'm very honest very direct a unassuming and um you know all the bravado which set aside 'cause and especially with two boys I mean yeah [laughter]\nI I had three boys so it's my three sons for many years until I had another son and daughter and as soon as I had a daughter I was\nDone I mean I got reduced in my lowest common denominator or sell a but yes with the with boys especially but they're they're just so honest and uh and and can be so much fun but also in the process as you mentioned um because it's so much about doing\nThat you forget about being and in the process\nYou forget who you are even as a mom or as a child has got\nAlso I Love about it I Love what you said about coming to God for the child like that but I think yes I just to see that it it's like it's so wrapped up in what am I doing checking out like to do list out like I Do all the time like his\nWhere am I may just how much they want to be with me I can take them out of school and they just why is that they're safe for a babysitter and there's a mom you're home and\nI I just love that honesty about wanting to be with than I think that like God cause us to as well and one thing like ... that I think that I just want to be ah with things that don't we don't have to have it all together and don't worry whatever you know they look perfect or they think perfectly they just want to be with her parents\nExactly like that and I I think\nI got it at this just as we are and he wants us to come to ... and offer all of our oddest emotions even ... ... ... ...\nWell as you stated um you know after the boys were born you realize that your identity I mean because we all we don't travel or do you mean in in many cases it's a identified with what we do you know your work you were for an attorney or professor\nUm I mean you had a ... you know you have an educational pedigree\nAnd ah so ah I often admire women who were able to transition and uh and and sometimes it's first season and uh and understood and sometimes I'm\n... you know 'cause uh I I don't know him and may maybe because young girls were diluted by uh you know uh who who who was the one of the super heroines I'm a super woman\nAnd they think that they can convince me that way so they they try to do both which is amazing to me a bit you know so you go from your identity being with what you do and now you're a mom\nAnd you know when you talk about in your book about you know losing a sense of identity as God identifies you not as the world's identifies you\nAbsolutely and and I'll just tell you're looking at it that that condition or it's not pretty it was it was it was difficult not and I still think patented that I I Do a little bit of everything else so that sort of a college town\nI realize that at least for me it really easy to cut my identity or whatever and get a lot about whether it's my job as a lawyer or whether it's my job at home with the kids on Iraq for her to stay out of our I don't know what God wants this to I was\nAnd and the gospel choir Jesus Says that ties with God it's so please introduce a fantasy world and when he signed it now you know this has to stay there and that's what happened with the team or the sailor all of these things that are true about Jesus\nOr rather he gets really simply and he has this is like a lot of fun as hell my wild clean and I just I Love that because I think that our identity to speak and what we need to hear that weren't a lot of daughters and\nApart from our jobs are all even as long as we are seeing a lot of daughter first and it's out of that knowledge than identity that we can't truly love our own children\nMhm and when you talk about your background I mean it it is impressive I mean what you were doing as as an attorney or a professor of law or a ... especially ... when I\nWe when I hear of an attorney who loves the constitution as much as I Do um [noise] you you can have you can have whatever you want to hear and I'm I'm On your side or whatever I can do to help you out um I I mean you have a\n... in your career I mean I'm you worked as a department of justice has counseled attorney general Michael ...\nOr so you have you've paid your dues you also a former clerks that you've Justice John Roberts and I got to imagine in light of a you know the recent or a hearings for justice Kevin ... that that had to be quite painful for you\nIt was it was difficult to the end of the I Am no jackpot not well I'm a work in the same building and he and we actually I played basketball together [laughter] it is a great tradition that Supreme Court first circuit\nCourt of a tournament and and he would protect paid a lot and I have a number of friends who work in court for him and or a\nVery clean and all that day so and I think it just shows real divisiveness that our country and also understanding the role of a judge a\nRoll of the judges issue on now is\nTo interpret the law that Congress has written all natural by the constitution and it's not can make a new thing or if we lean guy just kind of strange at those roles on and they don't have a lot more comfort and and that's one thing is that why because we know they're not going to impose their own policy preferences are or their own way of how they think they should have laid out by the\nDemocratic process that people that we all at ... ... ...\nYeah exactly which like an umpire I mean it's not like I go to say well are you a Republican or Democrat no we don't even think about that we just know they're there to call balls and strikes right and at that that kind of social but unfortunately um it it has been an average of this you know with activist judges\nAnd also a a the political forces that want to circumvent the process of a legislation\nAnd going through the process or are we using our ... founding fathers are said hey slow down take your time let's let's debate this let's talk about it and uh and when it's appropriate if we need to amend something will amend as we need to create a law will create a law\nBut there's a way in which to do it but don't go to the bench and are expected judges singlehandedly unilaterally to create law and this is what's happened and this is why it's been a disturbance and so I thought oh go ahead\nOh just agree with that completely and it was judges including senior or at least not very confrontational can't change it at all run out of their word has the final word and it takes a lot of effort that was absolutely\nYeah if you think not I'm a I'm sure Erin we'll rent out her voice for you for a weekend and and now the rule of law real quick right [laughter]\nYes yes absolutely [laughter]\nThere there are some things are so um your um your encourage you mentioned moms are besides getting their in their hands on your book living above loved and

thousand dollars in it and they lose thirty percent let's just say it's you folks will say that you haven't built your retirement plan you haven't come into the synergy group yet it and put this plan

mentioned remember those losses because in my example you lose a hundred and fifty thousand dollars you're left with three hundred and fifty thousand left of your five hundred\nAnd what that means is understand the mathematics of recovery you don't just need a thirty percent recovery because you lost thirty percent you need a forty two percent increase just to get back\nThe loose thirty need forty
