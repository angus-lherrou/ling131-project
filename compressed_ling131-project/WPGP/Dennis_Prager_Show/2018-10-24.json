I totally prepared to be in second place on this\nBut I I don't know where that might be found at this time and the reason is I don't have a male gender agenda or female agenda another man than ... than I Am a good people fan\nAnd there are just as many good man is good women and just as many awful ... ... that's just the way it is it's almost perfectly apportion\nEvery foolish band there is a foolish woman and vice versa for every good man there was a good woman by and large large in some societies you will find more of one type than the other I think\nBut any in any event good people do grow on trees whether male or female my topic today is the column that I Britain this week and it is largely about young men and the question of ambition\nOne of the things that renders men mass killing in the eyes of women\nOr at least that was the case for all of history and I am perfectly prepared to acknowledge that perhaps for young women today it is not the case\nI Would love to get your input on that particular issue incidentally but\nBy and large one of the most appealing traits if I may say ... renders a man sexy is one of the things to a woman is ambition knocked\nCrazed and viciousness narcissism no what ambition I wanted to get ahead I Want to be successful and ambition\nFor all of western recorded history was largely\nI Wish to succeed at work and I wish to provide for a wife and children I Wish to provide for a family\nDishes white male ambition this is when I was certainly when I was a kid this was what was assumed it was so so much of a given it wasn't even articulate it because it was just assumed\nWill you grow up and be able to take care of a family that was male ambition\nAnd my sense is that that has been a killed for many young men because it has been killed\nIn this society the notion of raising men boys to be men in the first of all is it believe it or not is almost considered\nArchaic today a be a man that is so sexist be a man or that show patriarchal or some other unbelievably destructive adjective useful\nThing for a boy to aspire to be a man what is a man a man takes care of the family\nThat is the primaries up the only thing that constitutes a man obviously but it is for most males that has been the defining element can't well I take care in all senses of the word we'll like take care of a family\nSo my assumption today is that this ambition has been shot first of all a lot of men for my generation to today even more so today\nOr were taught that hey you don't have to take care of a family in fact you don't even have to have a family there's no real compelling reason for you to get married and if you do or the female will pull her weight as they say she will\nGrow her or just as much as you will roll your or you were all a boat\nTwo or has been and so the notion that that I as a male will need to take\nTerrible family is is considered again patriarchal an archaic do you agree that's my question do you think that the the man of ambition\nI I Wish to get ahead I Wish to succeed uh I Wish to take care of a family that this is endangered species I obviously acknowledge that they exist they exist even in significant numbers but I'm the question is proportion\nSo if you especially if you are a woman or if you have a daughter who is dating or do you have a sense that this is taking place\nThat what I have described is in fact what is taking place or a this is an alarm that is not worthy of being sounded because it's not a big deal one eighth Prager seven seven six eight seven seven to for three triple seven six\nThese are the numbers to talk to me if you are dating if you have a son you might have a son for example who is not particularly ambitious who was a more than happy to stay at home and uh you know make a living but not not not really aspire to more I had the sense as I told you\nHours I mentioned I didn't tell you I mean it emulates but it's my column this week is about\nMy wife and my experience is test driving vehicles last week at five different dealers in Los Angeles area\nAnd my sense and they were all wonderful people are there was this there's no knock on them but my sense was that\nThese were not guys who were particularly ambitious particularly passionate about their work and you could say well maybe they're not passionate about selling cars yeah but it doesn't matter you still have to be passionate about your work even if you don't care about the particulars\nBecause the the more that you're passionate about your work the more successful you'll be and the more you will rise in life\nMy father wanted to be a doctor\nHe couldn't afford medical school so it became an accountant he became extremely passionate about accounting which is about as far from being a doctor is you can get but he just decided to his great credit I'm going to become passionate about my work of wars all too well at it\nSo the question on the table is ... young males and ambition now\nOverly ambitious is not good overly anything if it's good to exercise it's not good to be addicted to marathons I mean there's there's no end in life to the to the\nFact that any good think can be over done\nSo I understand you can have too much ambition because then it's not ambition to take care of a family and and ambition to do good it's ambition to be to be super rich or to be super famous or to be super\nPowerful and that's not that it's not admirable that's not what I'm Talking about but the absence of ambition in men is in a mask you leading characteristic\nThey major part of masculinity is indeed ambition I Want to succeed and wants to take care of I Want to take care of and I want to take care of\nThat is a good thing and it and and in the past it has rendered men desirable to a woman\nBut I I Believe that society has played the terrible tripped on both young men and women and it's told them that they are at the same is told young women that they are sexually the same as men\nThey could enjoy or any number of hookups just as much as ... with no emotional price paid\nAnd now why do you think why do you think that this idiocy of rape culture charge if colleges exists why do you think it exists it exist because so many young women have had sex with the leader regretted so rather than saying you know why did I get into it they prefer to use the term rape culture\nThat's that's the genesis\nOf the a phony charges of rape culture and it's by the way this proves that it's phony the proof is that parents and their daughters to college now no parent in the world would send the door to door rape culture I mean what are we are we joking but we ... what ... what are we living in the New York times\n\nAnd they told me the same thing you know you know you know women women will carry half their weight and then any in any deal and not by the way guys you don't have to get married you know what's what's in it for you divorce is a fortune anyway there's nothing in it for you you know women are available\nAnd so that doesn't breed the type of man that a fair number of women would want for a mate [noise] that's my theory if I'm wrong I'm happy I'm wrong [noise] how's that [noise] I Would like to be wrong male female our I'm Dennis Prager\nThe dentist triggers show live from the relief factor pain free studio\nOut right that is that is

get as many colds as possible Stefan in Columbus ohio Dennis Prager Hi [noise]\nHello Dennis I'll keep it brief um I'm Twenty one year old I'm getting ready to start a family um I have a lot of anxiety considering I grew up in a household with my father or mother was very overbearing so I Would consider it\nA masculine household and a girl so I'm just trying to stay on the right path with you know like ... to be the man that I Know which is a strong of household kind of metal\nAnd where did you pick up that desire\nOr just to spite you know I had a little bit of a little bit of contact with my father and he wasn't a a living and I want it to be so I didn't know I Want to be the opposite about numbers will cut the grass or any old so it's just the desire to not be that way\nWell well thank God you were you turned it around I mean that's that's fantastic Israel a New Brunswick New Jersey high during his Prager\nHello Dennis ... um um what I wanted to say was ambition might not be disappeared but I think it's time for the worst I think I'm basing his being channeled towards the self desired things like I Want money I Want women not life women\nAnd I'm going to do is I Know how and wanting a video that children are going selfish and those children are being raised as adults already like you don't you know I told the Nineteen year old ...\nAnd now I have a ... ah what is that I really what does it Wednesday so Wednesday down tomorrow night yes tomorrow night Minneapolis\nOr it's right on hold for the weekend been back in San Antonio on Monday on Sunday\nOr in Colorado State university um Monday\nAnd then they actually go home I I Will have a ... recreate myself with my wife\n[laughter]\nIt's a you know people ask me a lot\nTotally understandably so you know you're on the road so much by the way eighty percent of the time my wife is with me which I'm very blessed to have that ability but not right now and not when I go city the city the city the city\nBut when I go for a few days to a city she was she was almost always with me which is a real bonus but I Am asked the you know you do you like it and it's such an interesting question totally understandable question\nOn the one hand nobody likes flying every single day for much of a ...\nA and packing a suitcase or again and re packing and then during the hotel room on the other hand\nI Walk around thinking how lucky I Am and I remember I I mean it's only sincerely just as I did when we started this in my twenties\nI never lose sight of the fact people want to hear what I have to say how could I dislike travel if the reason that I'm traveling is that people want to hear what I have to say\nThat's why there was no happiness possible if you don't look at the big picture other aspect is is there any job on earth aspects of which people don't enjoy do that there is no ... there's no such job but doesn't exist\nYou like playing baseball and you're paid well to play baseball there were no aspects of of being on a I'm a baseball team that you don't enjoy of course there are talking about travel these guys do it for half the year it constantly\nAnd the work out that they have it's not it's not all farm but any baseball player who whose mind is still intact knows how lucky he is to be paid to do what he loves\nThat's the only way to go through life is to have a perspective on on what you're you're doing so too do you enjoy every single aspect of it there's no such thing it doesn't it doesn't exist\nBy the way I just like to note for no other reason than I Would like to know what it is today is October twenty four twenty Eighteen and my late mother was born on October twenty fourth Nineteen Eighteen\nNo Nineteen Nineteen I ruined my dad was Nineteen Eighteen\nI made a ... my dad was a hundred would have been a hundred that July my mom would\nBe Ninety nine today yeah she was one year younger eerie stuff\nYou know when you think about like the roaring twenties you think of the Nineteen twenties but we're going to be entering very soon we're entering the twenties again\nSo what are they going to how are they going to distinguish between the twenties and the twenties I don't know maybe they won't be roaring ... the roaring twenties were the Nineteen twenties and the non roaring twenties or the twenty twenties who knows\n[noise] any way mum wherever you are and I believe you are somewhere\nHappy birthday\nFrom me from your baby\nAll right everybody how to make America America again elect Democrats and win back the house\nOr the Senate the emotional basis of left wing for is\nSomething I've been pointing out my whole life Thomas Friedman is a perfect example of it like to read the program and and he is considered one of these awful liberals he's not even\nHe doesn't call himself a leftist but he hates the president and Mrs did they hate the president President represents everything they load the people who vote for them or most of them were deplorable\nWe are the opposite of Tom Friedman we are I mean it's just the fact we lived differently or we uh many of us are religious many of us a A R like\nGuns remembered that cling to religion and guns or\nMany of us are to actually get the chills that the star Spangled Banner many of us think of this other only contemptible to ah purposely meal in front of a hundreds of thousands of people rather than stand for the national anthem\nMany of us think that the United states is the greatest force for good many of us think that it's the least racist country in the history of the world many of us think we are blessed to be American so we're we were different than the guys are in the Tom Friedman ths world\nBut I'd like to I'd like to read to you because he is one of their more eloquent spokesmen he knows how to use language the way I I don't I don't want to use\nA a bad example but the best example with the left has so Thomas Friedman in today's New York times okay it's titled how to make America America again elect Democrats\nNow the very notion that you're going to make America America and abide electing a left wing party is is in itself an absurdity\nThe the left wing all over the world which is to do with the American revolution and to preserve the French Revolution every ... for a moment so America will be made America Again by having by having Democrats are in power\nTo have a more of a a far more socialized economy\nAs an example really All right so let's take some of the things he says some of the things he doesn't talk about the begins one\nIs still left to say about the terrible murder of moderates Saudi journalist ... and its aftermath by the way I don't know if he was moderate or not and I don't know if it's relevant\nIf if the guy was moderate or not moderate\nOr what was done to him is disgusting we all agree on that one of the few things left and right can agree with only one thing and I said it before but I feel it even more strongly now in the mid term elections vote for a Democrat campus for a Democrat raise money for a Democrat drive someone else to voting station to vote for a Democrat\nWhy does this have to do a well we'll we'll find out what this has to do with your mom your show he then he writes I don't say that because I'm particularly\nLiberal oh really you're not particularly liberal that's fascinating said why would you you're not even particularly liberal you you're not let alone left is you're not\nAnd particularly liberal Tom Friedman but you want people to vote for a Democrat campus for a Democrat raise money for a Democrat drive someone else to voting station to vote for Democrats so you want the left wing party to win but you're not particularly liberal\nOkay I just want you all to follow the logic here and wants to shift the whole country the liberal agenda I say that because I'm particularly American and I want to put the best of American values back at the center of our diplomacy in politics\nReally the best of American values and and was was that was that for example on display or when the when the rock Obama pulled out of Iraq\nWas that the best of American values in international policy was the shipping of billions of dollars to the Iranian regime\nWhich is worse W. O. R. S. E. than the Saudi regime in terms of doing evil on the face of the earth evil means hurting people in case it meets a definition\nThis is not a religious terms specifically and it's not a complex term evil is the greater amount of hurt this is dumb to innocent people is greater amount of hurt them to win and people by Iran or Saudi Arabia the enemy of\nSaudi of the enemy of Iran is\nYou know Mr Friedman show if you really care about humanity why wouldn't you while we all recognize how primitive the Saudi regime is\nAnd and it's institutions nevertheless I don't have a choice between a wonderful place and Iran I have a choice between Saudi Arabia and Iran just as\nIn World War two we have a choice between Stalin and Hitler and weak correctly Joe Stalin who even killed more people okay that's that's why I don't know what you mean by put the best of American values back at the center of our diplomacy in politics\nBut we'll explain his way I Will continue with his worth analyzing because we need to understand how the best of our opponents think and then respond you're listening to the dentist\nPrager show the dentist Springer show live from the relief factor main freeze\n\nTo bully trumping Republicans the same way he has them oh you poor bully people but I'll take that chance because there was a basic wrists\nFor truth science in decency and the Democratic caucus you gotta be kidding\nThe people who deny that there was male and female in the human being they have a respect for science\nYou're You're Joking correct truth truth\nUniversities are committed to truth to left ones the university's Tom Friedman is there a commitment the truth their\nDecency who who who\nDecency after what the democratic caucus did to Brett capital decency you're the you're the temerity Tom Friedman to speak about the Democratic party and\nDecency the left and decency\nAfter after the the ...
