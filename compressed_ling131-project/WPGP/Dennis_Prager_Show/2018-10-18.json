series I've been reading it and it's a [noise]\nIt's it's very powerful you could cry or at times and a Bill O'Reilly welcome back to the dentist Prager show\nThanks for in the book that I appreciate it\nI think you've done a a memorial service in writing this and I was I think to be honest it was somewhat of a gamble on your part because so much has been written about the Holocaust and about the Nazis and so so I'll ask you that what prompted you to do this\nEvil I'm seeing a rise and evil in America I'm\nTalking about people walking into schools gunning down students\nThousands shot in Chicago by drug gangs clerics um abusing shouldering a this just fall pure evil across the board and um well thinking about those stories I came to the conclusion that Americans are numb\nTo the growing evil around us and the only way that evil is defeated is if people confronted\nNot turn away as they did in Germany I'm In the late Nineteen twenties and in Nineteen thirties\nUm so I decided to write killing the ss because we had written killing patent huge success and we had a lot of research material leftover we got the Israeli government to cooperate with us on ss opened files had it not been seen before which is why we're able to\nPut the reader on a step by step of the abduction of Eichmann in Argentina\nUh we had a lotta new stuff that's never been put in print before so I decided to write it but the over arching is I Want the world not just Americans\nAnd know that evil exists and we have to confront it\nWas it hard\nThe two letters S. S. because of a of handler and what they did was except this apparatus and you ask the question was what surprised you so they set up this apparatus and they have tons of gold and tons of looted cash\nA and they have assassins\nWorking for them and and the ... the organization had a rat line what Martin Luther garden I called a rat line from Germany to Italy Jenna way Italy\nWhere they got these ss guys down there and put them on boats and then they went where they went most of them to Argentina where the parole and government was bribed to allow them in\nAnd to keep them they're protected so the red cross out of Switzerland help BSS so did the F a beginning CIA\nAnd soda elements of the Catholic Church and I'm Catholic so all of that surprised me and we documented pretty thoroughly in the book and then the track down\nUm you would think that the Israeli government would really want to get these guys in the beginning they did not\nAnd they didn't want to reopen this and they wanted to concentrate on protecting the new state of Israel from the Arab threat\nAnd they had to be badgered into tracking down Eichmann in manga law and the others that surprised us and then there's no surprises all across the book individual stories that we tell\nSo let me ask you you I Love the fact that you have a preoccupation with evil which has been me my stories and so I was in high school so I I asked a Holocaust survivor men went through outfits the rabbi Leon ... passed away\nAnd I I was with him for many many years and I ... I finally interviewed him and I asked him how does how did he explain the ss guards in the camps and their seat as him\nAnd he used the phrase that I have kept in my mind ever since it's the ... the one thing I truly remember from my interview and he said they were monsters with human faces do you subscribe to that theory\nAbsolutely means as his people didn't go to hell university and they and they weren't people who were uh in prison for violent crimes\nThey were farmers shopkeepers lawyers who before World War two live normal lives you saw him in the cafes you wave that I'm there all of a sudden the war starts when they sign up to get a black uniform in a dead set in ... to put on her cap\nThey walk into our within other camps and they brutalized people to the extent that modern civilization has never seen they kill babies they gas when they do the most heinous evil things that anyone could imagine and then after the war they go back to the towns\nAnd they take up their farming again it's unbelievable and that's why I wanted to tell everyone reads the book and everyone that I Do these interviews with that evil exist and every person\nAnd you have to fight it you have to actively fight it or it can envelop you and if there's anything from killing the excess that's it\nA quiet because I'm thinking of because I Want my audience to think about the uh so let me tell

the Supreme Court but at least we ruined his life\nThat's right I'm going to commit to you that evil that's an evil sentiment it is and I'm All right\nIn the Washington Post where women were feminists or or one I think in particular the feminist columnist writes and I was reading some of them\nOn the plane last night and I I shared some of them with you know some of the quotes\nI think that these are so important to understand the damage\nThat feminism an image it each make believe world ... all is a step emanates from the left or make believe socialism is make believe\nAnd feminism is make believe you ... is make believe it's all make believe for whatever reason and it's all psychological what ... ... it's there's no other explanation there was a\nBeep beep beep uh [noise] unhappiness\nMaladaptive ... to reality on the part of the people who embrace these things and certainly those who develop them they have contempt for the world as is\nConservatives understand that the chance of making the world's worst or is are the chances of making the world worse or at least as good as far as making the world better when you have a revolutionary idea\nMaking the world incrementally better each pack your that's what we should be doing in every generation but overthrowing the foundational ideas of a society because you have a dream of something better which is one character risk that's characteristic of the left\nRemember from the will to fundamentally transform the United states of America that's revolution\nThat is where only bad things will happen in the bad things do happen she writes here that she's a middle aged single heterosexual feminist by the way one of the things that I did not mention in my first read of her\nOf her column in the Washington Post and I'm not seeing her main deliberately 'cause I have no desire to a model left this by the desire to humiliate people\nAnd it's not important to she is she they're interchangeable they have feminists are feminists are feminists are feminists are on the left\nOf but it is interesting that there's no mention in any of the columns by her or other women writing this column in the Washington Post that may be part of the solution to their lowly mission she says I have never been so lonely used to marry\nShe seems to be looking for a relationship but she has the the word marriage is not even enter she's a she is divorced from not mistaken a buck cheat the there's no mention of of marriage so she wants to wish racial loneliness\nWe've relationship or even an unappealing temporary are fleeing would appear from what I'm reading the divide between men and women is never felt so why am I have never been so lonely too what she described that I Know what I described it to\nAnd then she writes about her on her being uncomfortable with this really nice man she went on a date with for three hours\nAnd he kept saying whatever you're comfortable with when she asked where he wanted to eat lunch she said whatever you're comfortable with and now I read to read from her over the course of three hours that while I became is ... ... she didn't like that\nAnd then what I even not only put a bold for myself to underline what it was time to part ways\nI was comfortable giving him a platonic hug it was not sexy being the woman the driver's seat for three hours\nSo if the manager of the driver CDs a patriarchal guy and a probably a somewhat of a massage therapist and if she's in the driver's seat she doesn't find it sexy\nWell and then she wonders why she's never been so lonely in her life because what the feminist like Old West is living to make believe rural\nReality it is is awful and then they have an imaginary world were things will be better\nSo she says if the demand is a dominant decision maker that's a glaring red flag that's what she writes after she's disgusted with the guy who says whatever you're comfortable with I don't need a man she says to ask permission for every move he makes fun of course that is exactly the way young men or talk today you have\nTo ask permission for every move you make we shouldn't let the battle cry of consent translate into boring sex see this is they they just said that they want their cake and eat it is like it's so trite they want to change the world into some imaginary things that can't exist\nIntentions are important in every one's intentions during sex should be of care healing and relief not personal appetite and blind conquest\nYou're going to move personal appetite for sex all the good obese care healing and relief sounds like a visit to a social worker or a therapist\nOkay now I Want to read to you from another one\nBy different feminists are also in the Washington Post this one is from October fifth do you know where your date stands on Brett Kavanaugh you showed\nSo she said she doesn't like to talk politics on first dates but now it's inevitable that she wants to know where they stand on Brett Kavanaugh\nSo she writes a few years ago when I was getting back to dating after getting over a breakup I told the friend about how I felt stuck in a paradox okay listen to this this has nothing to do with Brett Kavanaugh Detroit the title but listen to this again\nI told the friend about how I felt stuck in a paradox I wanted to be open to love but I also wanted to protect myself from the emotional rooms that dating and relationships and never to bleed can bring\n\nDid you hear that this is a grown woman\nTheir children left his two children before they do want to grow up\nI Want to be open to love but I Want to protect myself from the emotional boots that dating relationships inevitably can bring why don't you say that about anything else I'm open to working but I Want to protect myself from the emotional wounds that\nWorking for a living can bring I Want to live fully but I Want to protect myself from the emotional wounds that life it never to bleed can bring\n\nTold you there children there was no exception left this or at heart children they do not want to grow up growing up means facing reality being prepared for her that's the reason for safe rooms at all that stuff they are snowflakes\nSome of them are even my snowflakes but they're snowflakes they're not grown ups does it amazing thing she admits this like the other woman admitted in the Washington Post held only she is and how crappy relations between men and women are\nI now I continue reading at that moment it felt difficult to do both now I imagine a lot of the leaders feel stuck in the same dilemma\nReally that's not true\nLeftist leaders are stuck in this dilemma conservatives have mature understanding of life it involves inevitable pain there is a pain in life this is if you can't do anything about it\nLife has pain you want to live fully that's the garden of Eden story people chose pain and full life over little pain or no pain and not a full life\nLike finishing my huge genesis commentary in fact this month it'll be a A N o may first\nOh by the way just a reminder the amount of money or the rational bibles but the white five volume commentary on the first five volumes it's been so successful the we're going on the fourth printing of ... the first volume was on the second book\nOr if the prices going up to five dollars 'cause of the price paper it's printed on very beautiful paper so you could still get the old\nPrice at um at Amazon if you want to get it I'm just letting them know that is the rational Bible\nAt any rate uh I I that book makes you

I agree with you know half a percent right but at no point to she challenged feminism\n\nBut it may be her own personal statement and again if people are familiar with that particular person maybe their evolution as well I mean I'm a Democrat I so I have ... he left progressive\nUm positions but I think when it comes to this and my relationship and kind of by sense of oh no you know I I Am the nervous they're scared to do that again that Nike them at all either\n... or whatever I don't know that all righty\nAttached to one side or another politically it's just\nOkay All right I appreciate your call very much a caffeine in Torrance, California Hi Cathy\nHi Dana Hi [noise]\nUm I just called to allow him a ... a story that I heard from a recounting from my song about five years now he is\nNow how old is your son thirty two so he married one he's okay how writes\nUs probably four or five years ago [noise] uh he was telling me about child attempting to date and he said he found young women show aggressive\nThat when you're trying to get to know them it's a little like a job interview they want to now on\nHow much money you have in my kind of car you drive and what your goals are immediately you know not just a friendly let's get to know each other by very aggressive grilling\n... show ironically if that's the case and I have to have the word if but if that's the case so the argument that men will see women as sex objects ... is matched by women who see men as financial object\nWhich by the way there is some truth to both not necessarily a terrible thing just the way
