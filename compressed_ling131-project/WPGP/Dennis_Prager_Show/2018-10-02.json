in seventh day of Passover and so on it it just says you can't do work so I don't do work\nFact you should see my column this week\nIt is a is explaining the left and its contempt for\nThe middle class bourgeois Judeo Christian values system and that explains\nTheir belief that they are that normal moral rules do not government\nThat is why they can shout down people at a restaurant conservatives do not because they believe there are rules that govern them that's why they can close bridges because they don't believe rules govern them this is an extremely important thing\nThe smearing of judge Kavanaugh on an unprecedented unprecedented smear of a good man\nI I we are in fact Alan\nCalls it worse than McCarthyism\nAnd he's been a is a lifelong Democrat because he's a liberal and he does subscribed to the to the moral norms of of the of middle class norms as we call them but the left is not\nThe normal rules of civility do not guide the left\nThey are ... mentioned and I write that word they are niches rubber mention over meant is the Superman literally over men\nThey are over the rest of us over the deplorable deplorable believe in middle class Judeo Christian values left ... left wing or is do not they are governed by what they feel is necessary to achieve their ends they break eggs to make a left wing omelets\nAnd that is what we are seeing a happening\nI mean we I I got on to that because I was explaining I Do feel governed by rules\nSee you can yell and that's why I've said also often you could yellow conservatives for being hypocrites because they have a standard\nBut you can who who was a yelled at left wing hypocrisy there's no such thing as left wing hypocrisy because there were no rules that govern them so you can't be a hypocrite if you don't promote rules\n\n... by the way another another matter in this regard my original column that this ... this discharge should have been ignored it was right on my mind was the only one to the best of my knowledge riding on this in the national media\nOr they may have been others I I I I certainly and I hope they're all ... actually my point is not to tell you that on great my point is to tell you that I was alone are largely alone\n\nI said from the beginning a man who has an impeccable life as an adult\nI Am not interested in what he did in high school I Would have held this for Merrick Garland had he been the nominee I Would hope because we are governed by rules and these rules apply to both Democrats and Republicans\n\nThis is this is the new standard the latest charge a New York times piece that he threw ice ... ice face in a bar through ice in the guy's face while in college\nSo what so what are\nThe reason that left this don't have any problem with doing this\nIs they are ... they are they believe that getting rid of his nomination before the elections is a good that overwhelms moral norms you can destroy a man and his family a good man\nAnd his family because overriding that is the good of not allowing for the first time in the lives of just about any American conservatives to have a majority on the Supreme Court\nI Can't speak for before Nineteen sixty two but I can tell you about a Nineteen sixty two it was already governed by the left because they ruled the prayer in school is unconstitutional\nAs idiotic as the whole series of ... as as an judicial forget idiotic\nAs not based on the constitution but based on what people left of center think is right that's all that matters the constitution doesn't matter the Bible doesn't matter to a leftist their feelings are their moral guides\nThat's what you must understand it is a this I have said most of my life it is the heart versus\nThe law the moral law the heart follow your

support it there is just dirt\nI wrote many years ago the rape of her name is also a rape I should republic shit I have to say I don't know if it's on the Internet I wrote it when I was writing a newsletter I have to check\n\nSee I'm guided eye as as many of you know I'm clouded by my religion Judaism in Judaism who he who humiliates another person in public is considered to have murdered him\nIt was such a powerful thing that is why I govern my show this way I never allowed Monica Lewinsky jokes for example I explained it is it's up it's up the rape of a name is also right from ... when was it originally published does it have an original data on it\n\nAnd it was earlier in two thousand seven that that's so that's I just I simply rewrote it I guess on to that name that's fine anyway it doesn't matter true it's true eleven years doesn't change\n\nTime governed by that belief that to to smear up people humiliate them publicly is equivalent to a ... shutting their blood a basic Jewish aphorism and teaching\nAnd I banned all Monica Lewinsky jokes at a set on the radio I Will hang up on you if you start telling the one I never told one\nI felt the woman was profoundly humiliated jokes were made of her\nHow do you make jokes of people at their expense ah it's it's just a I mean obviously there are jokes their political jokes that's fine I don't even mind ethnic jokes if they if they don't cross lines like I don't think any joke about\nAbout lynching could possibly be funny no joke about the Holocaust could possibly be funny but I I I mean you and I told the jokes about Jews\n... where you have to laugh at ourselves and be able to laugh at others ... songs is not maliciously intended\nBut but humiliating they they specialize in this tear the man down tear the man that\nCharges made thirty six years later about what a guy did in high school that is correct um unless there is evidence that he murdered somebody or or committed an actual rate\nUh I I I because because of the ... of the crime that that's it otherwise I'm Sorry I'm Sorry we're not going to open up the gates to having this done\nSee what happens is the Democrats don't care because they want to win at the moment but it's like Harry Reid Harry we change the rules on the Senate and with regard to the ability of the minority party in the Senate or to\nA delay of votes what does the word again by um when the yeah by filibuster so what happened is the the Republicans got into power and they oh great well we need is a majority now will ... will apply that the Supreme Court justices too\n\nSo I have to say uh it's painful but\nI\nDo I I I battled with is within me do I want women to come forward and do this to democratic nominees\nThat this was done to me in high school the man is now fifty something years old [noise] I don't know I don't know because I Am so against smearing a name but they have to know what they have done\nThe woman who seems to have asked you know put very on challenging questions\n\nThe wall Street Journal published her entire analysis what we should put it up put it up at Penn is pretty good dot com\n\nI can only provide bunny assessment of Dr forwards allegations in a legal context in the legal context here's my bottom line a he said she said case is incredibly difficult to prove but this case is even weaker\nThan that\nThis is from Rachel Mitchell a prosecutor of sex crimes duck the Fort identified other witnesses to the event and those witnesses either refuted her allegations or failed to corroborate though\nI Do not think that a reasonable prosecutor would bring this case based on the evidence before the committee nor nor do I believe that the evidence is sufficient to satisfy the preponderance of the evidence then to understand the difference folks there there is the standard beyond reasonable doubt that is for conviction\nBut outside of the legal world all you need is ... I think in the ... if I'm not mistaken in civil suits the preponderance of evidence standard\nThat's different from beyond reasonable doubt just preponderance there but it doesn't even meet the preponderance of evidence\n\nIt's a very dark day in America to very dark day because the ... there's an entire\nPortion of this country the left that does not believe in moral norms they acknowledge it that that oh if you put them if you do you believe in moral norms oh of course of course but tell them yeah where are they from their their from them their moral norms are left this moral norms\nWhy did they have such contempt for vice president Mike Pence\nMike ...
