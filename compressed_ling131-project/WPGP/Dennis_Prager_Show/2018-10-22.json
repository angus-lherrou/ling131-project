appreciated people are this is the America that I that I I really like\nAbout the wise guy America the hyper sophisticated fools that um habits so many of our urban areas than are have gone through graduate school too long and become stupid\nSo that's my that's my initial take\nI hey everybody not just stupid callous jaded mean but other than that I think a key producing terrific people yeah\nIndeed so what is it now seven thousand have you seen pictures of the caravan coming in from largely from Honduras\n\nLike to talk to somebody about ... or ... how did they get through the Mexican border the Mexicans just don't care I keep hearing conflicting reports that it's not clear to me they only let six hundred forty and then there are seven thousand so is it six hundred and forty years it's seven thousand\nAnd it's it looks like seven thousand to me it's a mile long and again the question is how how did they just have such a large group get through Mexico\nNot that I think Mexico cares a that was a substantial part of their population lives in the United states and funds Mexico they send back billions of dollars and\nWe take the unemployed off Mexico's hands I mean we're essentially were a ... government to Mexico and the United states and the left thinks that that is a terrific thing even though all it does is enable the Mexicans to avoid confronting their

pales that question pales in significance compared\nTo the possibility of more Democrats because if you can't make enough Democrats in your own population you need to import Democrats so that you can win more elections that's what they do the import Democrats that an amazing thing is that done anywhere else in the world and the democracy\nWe import millions of people in order to have you with elected that's what it's about\nAnd it's a it's a big question we should have some folks are because the big question here how are they going to be stopped see this is me my fear is that\nThey will obviously they will have to be physical stoppage of people they're not going to come to the border and they'll say please turn around okay we'll go back a thousand miles or was Seventeen hundred miles out of I don't know what the distances\nBack to Honduras by the way I just want to add I feel for every one of these people like totally feel for them\nTo live in Latin America is largely to live in a corrupt society\nSo it's a fascinating thing we're supposed to we're supposed to acknowledge that they should come into the United states because things are so terrible for them but if you say why things are so terrible for them then the left accuses you obscene a phobia or racism\nSee they're really fleeing wonderful places where where there is little corruption and great opportunity they just prefer California 'cause they they like our beaches but of course they have beaches was there was not landlocked to the best of my college\nSo I don't ah [laughter] I have to live in this make believe\nWorld that are on the left is created there's no difference between American culture Latin American culture no none whatsoever American culture was not superior and the moral weight to Latin American culture\nBut everybody wants to flee vast numbers wonderfully they're equally wonderful cultures to come to our less wonderful or equally wonderful or none wonderful cultures get it that's what you're supposed to believe if you are college educated\n\nThere's no difference there's no moral distinction between Latin American the American\nCulture that's amazing I guess why there's so many Americans fleeing to embarrass\nWhy should they be why should they be impoverished they have food\nThey've perfectly they're perfectly acceptable\nNatural resources the reason Latin America is largely an economic failure is because it's largely corrupt ask our friends in Brazil\nIs is is there a few as ... as intelligent dust risk people was the Brazilians\nBut they're mired in corruption

dealerships car dealerships in the LA area\nAnd the experience was essentially the same in each they've made such an impact on on my on me and my wife\nOr to speak correct English on my wife and me that I actually\nHave written my Tuesday column comes out tomorrow or along on the subject was among the things that most go up to me was the lack of knowledge about cars that they're selling\nAmong these all all of them young mostly male\nA sales sales people at the if the car dealerships\nIt was it was remarkable I asked some truly basic I mean really basic questions and the answer in each case was a I'll look it up\nAnd anyway shopping for an SUV and I are very rarely shop for cars because for much of my the last decades I have been driving cars of advertisers which\nEventually they they sold their businesses in any way be whatever it is it now as we're having a new experience for having had in the wild card you might want to give car dealers the business I Want to do with boy into another one of them want to do it with a car dealers\nLet me give them the business but it was it was really fascinating everybody was nice I mean all the sales people were nice it's not an issue there almost all young men with whom I took test drugs I think in every instance of five I think for four or five five young men\nBut the thing that got my wife and me was any question I mean any question that I asked was clear they didn't have an answer and they said with no embarrassment I'll look it up oh let me let me look that up\n\nSo uh as I said at the end I think that if this is all representative and it may not be like somebody come out with that but if it is it all representative\nThere were two things that immediately strike me and one is that the idea that you should know as much as possible even about a product you're selling has has not registered\nBecause hey I could look it up why why do I have to know if that is you can come in all wheel drive why would I have to know\nThe length of the of that SUV versus the other one it's like ... or I could always look it up on the other is in general knowledge may not be valued\nWhy do you need to know anything if you could just pull out a little smartphones from your pocket and find out all you need to know\n\nThis is now if you feel that my general generalization is not valid or you do a very curious\nTo hear from you because it made a real impact on us I Am trusting is that the lines are working one a ... seven seven six eight seven seven to for three triple seven six\n\nThat was a ... that was one\nAspect of the experience that hit me there was another one too which is even\nDeeper and that is that the there was there seemed to be an absence of passion I\nAgain I remember from years ago when I when I last really went looking for cars with dealers\nThe the the sales folks were passionate about cars that's why they were in that profession\nI didn't have that sense from any of these uh sales people get older young\nI didn't have any sense of that but they were passionate about cars that was it was they might as well have been working in a shoe store this is not a negative these were very nice people\n... ... it's not a character challenge it's just the statement of a change that\nYou know if you haven't seen him in ... in a war you ever seen a young person longtime\nWow boy did you grow up you really grown\nBecause you haven't seen them see you see if you haven't seen something in a long time you can see a change\nSo this was a change that we saw a\nGentleman do you ah just
