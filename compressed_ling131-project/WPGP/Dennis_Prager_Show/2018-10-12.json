[laughter]\n... [laughter] pretty limited to speak you got it for two to these I was your best or the other states but All right so tell us the thesis of your book\nSo that I wrote the book uh obviously you know from my background that spreads prime minister but in the context but who rolled by no have I run my own global consulting business in which I one of the things we do it by\nThe clients around the world about political risk and political uncertainty and and how to respond and prepare for that but also an chairman of the idea with the global federation of conservative party includes the Republican Party the United states\nAnd uh since twenty sixteen I had been observing a obviously a theory of\nNew and unorthodox than unexpected electoral outcome Donald Trump election boat primary victories in general election victory was the big us but the upset ... breakfast referendum there I was so called populist movements in Europe and elsewhere and so I'm really trying to address what I think is going on\nAnd um and what um how leaders business and political but particularly how conservatives should respond to some of this so that is really the essence of the topic and I get to put my thesis in a nutshell\nWhich some people would find surprising I think the populist I'm as they raised these concerns about market in trade and immigration uh globalization that many of their concerns are correct\nAnd that that we have to do a better a job in terms of policy we have the meaningfully respond to be concerned but the way to respond to them it through um you know good a good conservative response the conservative answers\nSo let me ask you the the mainstream maybe which of course is almost synonymous with being on the left\nAround the world and picked all of these as sort of a nation almost fascism in a hurry and in Poland now a Brazil and the United states what is your response to that\nBy any anybody that that really clearly has no understanding of what fascism was\nUm you know the fascist movement which does exist and some corners and some dark circles or the movement from the century Nineteen twenties and Nineteen thirties was a very different these than most of this right wing populism is not to say that in some\nCases there aren't a than some of the extremes there are some similarities but\nUm you know populism uh people you see that on the left I'm liberal media you called mainstream media I call it liberal media 'cause that's what it is um you know they frankly equate anything they disagree with with that that kind of a standard response\nBut populism has a long political tradition populist have been on the right left and veteran populace are people who\nAre wrongly are often trying to bring the concerns of large map of the people concerned they believe are being ignored into public debate in public arena\nAnd um I think it's undeniable whether I Want to read for instance with the concerns of are the issues Mr Trump has raised on trade and immigration that matters like that\nThere is no doubt that he is speaking for a large mass of people who are concerned about these policies\nAnd are you familiar I'm sure you are like just a quick take on hungry and Poland\nYeah look I Try I'm not too I'm a kind of getting to talk in day to day politics of the various member part of the I I'm a I you know I Would say obviously in the case of Hungary\nI'm what I've heard of them support for Mr Bond more than anything has been his ... that's been um to illegal um an irregular migration over his board or something that the population supports them on and that the right to support them one\nWho so you tell us a little I I was not familiar with this and I think the important for my listeners to know about the ... the international Democrat union so tell us what one is that\nYeah so it was set up a believe it or not it was actually set up in Nineteen eighty three\nAre under the Reagan Administration um the original vice president George W Bush with the signer of the London Declaration that established the idea of prime minister got your\nHands are cold Germany a structure Iraq who I Believe was mayor of Paris at the time but the leader of the better right in France a day and a number of other leaders think it was about thirty five at the time came together to form a global federation of conservative party that has\nThat fairly regularly in the decades that follows very active and had some prominent near the end of the Cold War is the leaders obviously coordinated\nTheir policies or you know researching conservatism coordinated their policies that were often successful in very short order and bringing down the Berlin Wall of the Soviet Empire but the organization has continued to exist and and my vision for it is really one way or\nSort of activists and operative really share best practices on campaigning in on governing so we just had a gathering of a hundred representatives of various eighty parties around the world and and the Los Angeles recently actually\n... so I here here's something I Would love to get your take on\nWhen I think of Canada I I think of a of to Canada as in many ways the same way I think of America to Americans a left in her right is that is that a a valid perception or not so valid\nUm I probably would quarrel with it and it's in that sense there's no doubt um there's no doubt that in Canada or of all I Know merit many Americans uh conceive of Canada they have very left wing country I'm In fact\nConservative movements very strong candidate you mentioned govern ten years we just had elections recently where and our two largest province of Ontario and Quebec a right of center government came to office so\nWe have a significant um conservatism and considerate movement in our country but our country is far less polarized\nAnd kind of what you would call left right camps than the United states really are remarkably less polarized than part of the reason I wrote the book the trends I talked about in the book the trend of\nYou know very core economic outcomes for a lot of middle and working class people and\nThe political disruption and populist movements we're now seeing they really have not hurting hand at the same degree so my book is not a book can't on my book really is about it from my perspective why some of the lessons and some of the practices we followed in Canada helped the boy some of these challenges and how\nThey can help here the conservative movement United States and elsewhere throughout\nThe book ladies and gentlemen is right here right now I'm speaking to the former prime minister of Canada for ten years conservative no less\nAnd the book is up at the dentist Prager dot com right here right now and this man is as you could tell was obviously very thoughtful\nAccounting is a very important country in the world and we need to know more about it we need to understand for example the worldwide conservative a resurgence I mean it's happening that's what he's explaining [noise]\nI Need every one of you to to do that I spoke to our spoke about the Quebec elections it was astonishing talked about it on this on the show [noise] All right everybody I'm Dennis Prager Steven ... book is going to ... we reserve\nThe dentist for your show by the release your brain freeze\n\nI Would not today consider the national posed the conservative paper\nIn terms of its day to day coverage in federal politics but its editorial rely line remains relatively concern the more conservative papers are actually what's called the sun chain their tabloids but they are quite um quite consistently conservative\nSo where what an American goal for thoughtful Canadian conservative news coverage nowhere\nTo hide it tough yeah yeah have you know a while you have you have\nTo you have to look um you have to really find individual journalists um\nUm and and I would also say that you know that there's a huge market and particularly the phenomenon you have in the United states with pod cast\nUm you know I think there's a big market candidate for that kind of thing to take off what as I said there is a you know thirty percent of Canadians will always vote right of center at least thirty percent bottom it's kind of the the the low number\nAnd so that that audience as in my judgment if I were an entrepreneur and the media business I'd be trying to figure out how to get to that audience which for the most part has very little and the way of of outlet servicing them\nWhat about young people or let me put it let me actually before we get to the young people you said something that's very important to me that the polarization in the United states left and right doesn't exist in Canada is that the caller lean to the same thing right\nSo it was but but on the issues they differ is justice clearly as the left white differ in the United states so is it because the Canadian temperament is just more subdued ... why isn't there that polarization\nI I think it's the fact that you know I I ... I hate the generalizations about our country but it's a fact that\nCanadians having more civil public discourse than always have\nUm it it's also the case that\nA larger percentage of Canadians are not idiot logically committed the you know the number of people who would be hard core conservative or heart or left liberal\nWould be much smaller and the percentage of the population that would float between party significantly bigger in Canada ... ... I think the other factor that often forgotten\nWhen people can they can uh when people compare Canadian American politics as we have more than two parties and that really changes the dynamic significantly like I always say when you have this strictly to party them you know if a candidate a hack candidate B.\nHe can bring candidate B. down in a in a system where he got more than two parties there's always a risk to the candidate a attacked Kennedy be effectively the winner becomes Kennedy the who's\nNot oh by the hour I listen this has been a great honor the book is right here right now it is with Dennis Prager dot com thank you prime minister [noise]\n\n[noise] yes or a new ... new with Washington President Trump is celebrating the release of an American pastor who was on trial in Turkey he says he will be back in the U.S soon\nA Turkish court today convicted Andrew Brunson on terrorism related charges but still released from house arrest and allow him to leave the country the decision is expected to ease trained us turkey\nRelations President Trump has been calling for brunch son's a release for quite some time now for the Senate debate between democratic Senator Bill Nelson then Republican governor Rick Scott has been postponed because of hurricane Michael\nCNN statements says a live debate that had been planning for Tuesday night\nWill be rescheduled for a later date the statements says both campaigns ... to the Phillies so candidates can focus on response and recovery to the storm has now been downgraded in heading out over the Atlantic but it's expected to drop heavy rains along the east coast\nAnd all street winning session so far that was up sixty six points this was as how I knew\n[noise] twelve fifty the answer whether [noise]\nWhether cloudy abreast and much earlier today grandma jak at the high only fifty three and a Kennedy how to use the way you were then by midnight tonight\nSlow thirty nine and renal end tomorrow morning then compromise for some sunshine it'll be another chilly day behind your fifty clouds Hi you're fifty eight on Sunday\nAnd meteorologist Maggie Johnson on an twelve fifty ...\nCoast to coast from seed to shining seen some beautiful country\nAs governmental in a new army some camping world\nAmerica's number one Harvey dealer actually removal camping well you'll find over three hundred and fifty ... song ever changing selection of America's\nFriends including favorites like combing him out of every classroom size home\nAt wholesale prices and say hello to a whole new world who's a camping world of Pittsburgh dot com today\nI'm ... and ...

I enjoyed it is a painful topic because I Know how many people have endured it where\nKids were act it's called parental alienation uh syndrome PAAS I Believe\nWhere the anger of the parents are so great that they will deprive their child of the other parent because they're so certain about how evil the other parent is going to the fact that the other parent\nDivorced them\nIt's a it's a form of selfishness and self centered this that boggles the mind\nThat's a very bad thing the children don't want to take sides\nI have been shown parents who had every legitimate reason to be ticked off at the other who were aware of tremendous defects in the character and parenting of the other parent I've kept their mouth shut\n\nThey've been say one bad word about that other parents these people of a special place in heaven I'm tempted to say that The Poisoner's have children of a special place in hell\n\nThat's a very big guideline here's another big guideline don't spoil your child because

your enough there buddy\nChildren can have a hundred buddies but they only get two parents okay when a Prager seven seven six\nEight seven seven to for three triple seven six those are my guidelines very big topic because of the millions and millions tens of billions of divorces and how many actual number\nSince you know running the Seventy\n\nYou were still the child's parent that that will go as close to ensuring the child's happiness and healthy development as anything\n\nThe child wants you to stay\nHis or her father his or her mother if Iraq with guilt over the divorce and spoil the child the new of spoil the child I'm spoiled people are not happy people\n\nEntitled people are not happy people people whose parent isn't the parents are not happy people\nEvery guard rail has to remain up you were you still make the bans on your child in terms of behavior is is how you act\nAnd you you don't have a competition between the two parents about who can buy them more goodies and

think about people who stay together for the sake of their children do will divorce after they graduate high school or will divorce after they graduate college\nOr it doesn't seem to work out quite as they think and in many instances precisely for what you point out that it really or has it emotionally affected them even in college or after college is that your point\nYeah and even into adulthood

quote me when they make up ... that's why I Want you to know why but you should know I Do a weekly fireside chat from my home\nIt's a it's a university dot com and I are this week's is devoted the

it in quotes because the recordings in New York Times which never quote it'd be so works in the left\nOkay every body it's a one a Prager seven seven six and let's go to your calls\n\nA we begin with Kevin in Cleveland Hi Kevin Cleveland\nIdentify that probably was the top yeah thank you\nFor Thirty years ago there would be so much for your ... ...\nWell You're welcome\n[laughter] um my one question\nOr I guess I got tons of 'em but I guess the one on top of my mind is a ... if\nIt would be your advice for honoring a parent who's withdrawn or not really interested in being involved with me and my family it kind of stems back to divorce issues and what your previous talking in the\nPast our um but or I guess residual effects from a divorced childhood um but I guess in starting a new family started over what's my mom has done the same and she has a totally different experience but I'm with him I don't know if it's more\nWhen I got me going out to understand something so he is that your parents divorced and then he withdrew from you\nOr I guess not not necessarily or not I I'm not intentional outside but\nThey're like oh you're\nHaving started new families both of them my father is more than of involved with the new you know his his wife\nAnd right so I did so why so why summarized you accurately you're saying that he withdrew from you because he became preoccupied with a new like alright seems that way so you're asking how old are you\nHonor him 'cause I'm a big one on honoring parents in almost every case so I don't know so\nMy my biggest one day I Believe about okay well that's my biggest example of honoring parents staying in communication if they don't if they are a ambivalent or if they are recalcitrant are hesitant\nYou have to do what you have to do\nSo uh you you make you make periodic calls or you send an email just checking in if they don't want to respond they didn't you we have to do the right thing and again this is this is my single biggest example of why I Believe people need religion\nPeople for me to be told on or your father and your mother because of God wasn't behind that a lot of people would not honor their parents\nSo since God told me the honor my parents are unless it is an extraordinary situation of pure evil on their part I have to do that how they respond is their business whether I honored them is my business\nWhere I've had to have a a one sided relations\nYou're right so what is so you know what they said you send email and that's it\nYou you will be able to uh have a peaceful life\nAfter your parent is gone you did your best\nYou will have no guilt feelings I don't know why don't cost you to periodically get in touch it's not a big deal or if there's no positive reinforcement then there's no positive reinforcement my father called his mother every night she yelled at him every night\nYou put the phone on the kitchen table I hear her yelling at him you pick up the phone and go yeah I'm a ... put it back down and he and he had absolutely no guilt feelings after she left this world\nOkay okay All right thank you You're welcome\n... it's it this is the beauty of of feeling that that the almighty has the creator of the earth has\nTold me what to do\nIt doesn't say on or your parents provided they respond provided they're nice you don't need it commands to honor nice parents [laughter] that's that's the whole point it's on or your father and mother even if they're twists\nIn fact if you end up the Hebrew word for father and the Hebrew word for twit there you go\nYou know because you had letters in Hebrew letters all have a numerical equivalent that they go I'm kidding about the ... it was a joke okay but a\nThat's that's the whole point is is the power of it so I'll make go they go a little ad for myself please get the rational Bible it'll change your life I promise if you read the book will\nPromise\nI'm explaining the greatest book and it needs to be explained care if you're an atheist it's called the rational Bible\n... okay I'll leave it at that ah let's\nSee here thank you Kevin as an important thing and let's go to Andy in Chandler, Arizona Hi Andy\nCode and it's a prayer good to talk here again like you I'm\nThat question so my son is in kindergarten and he's going to Catholic school I went to twelve years a Catholic school so I Know how the discipline is and I
