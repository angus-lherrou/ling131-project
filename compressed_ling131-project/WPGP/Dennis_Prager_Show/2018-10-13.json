{"month": "10", "state": "PA", "station": "WPGP", "content": "Here's what I Love about the show 'cause I don't have this written down and I don't do a lot of things other than just kind of have an ally but the thought of sure you have people that come in with an old family airline maybe only part of the ring or a the band or whatever and or they want something done to to make it their own but they went to ... how do you deal with that I Would think you get a lot of that not\nNow you're tapping into a personal passion or ... you know I'm I'm sentimental you know like ... you know we kind of live in a little bit more of a disposable world now where we just don't expect anything to really last and\nAnd you know we completely understand where you may have guarding jewelry from family members you know grandparents would ever that don't match your taste but there's elements of that whether it be the diamonds gems loans\nThat are essential in the court to that piece\nAnd that's why most common things we do is take those and actually create designed for customers to take you know take part of that history part of their family and recreated into something beautiful that they will enjoy as well rather than just disposing of it\nSo between that and then just general customers nation that's just a great reason for people to come see you give you a call find out what what all you can do for before they just go out and buy something\nYeah I mean it's worth ... you know if nothing else as we're talking to us to see what we can do for them 'cause I don't think a lot of people realize what the possibilities are endless said they're not walked into a box where they just have to pick this or that I mean they can make anything that to heart desires yeah well\nLet's fast forward a little bit uh then we're talking with mark ... from trinity jewelers located on mountain ... road he's here with us with a special leadership is burg let's let's hit the last few years and leadership in your life there's a lot of things going on in Pittsburgh I Know you're involved in some of those you get involved in the events were doing\nTell us a little bit about the people now in the city some of the pastors retail whoever it is the main affected you or even if there's a ministry what what what really hits\nYour your leadership bugs here well I think for me I seek out\n'cause you can't you can't um experience\nTeacher so much so I travel for mentors became my life you know and it starts with your pastor I mean they have life used that\nCannot be measure that we can't ever understand you know the old joke you know he says up on Sunday I mean pastor shift as a twenty four hours a day job and and the and the different you direct things that they deal with you know there's so much wisdom there\nAnd I've also make sure to surround myself with mentors you know I'm ... and you know I had one gentleman in particular that's not even in the jury business but just as a as a life mentor for cars really\nEven though you know it's important to me to trinity successful but what's more important to me as the integrity of trinity of who we are you know and how we were up Christ's through everything that we do [laughter] so I you know it doesn't have to be just in business type mentors you know I Would encourage people to look for those people you say\nThis is you know when I look ahead and I look at retired you know retirement or beyond in my legacy this type this person this is who I Want to be reflected at us and then you try to emulate fat and and you know you learn from them and and are heading that direction\nTo find someone good to follow yeah exactly [laughter]\nWell you've been involved I think ... and things like the man up that goes on around here with both as folks and just those kind of conferences that are available to us here locally\nFor me the biggest blessing and and I don't I never understood how much this could impact my life is what\nYou know how God has blessed trinity to with a growth that we've had you were on a third edition and and but the ... the ability of as a successful businessman of being able to give back and and the ministries that you could be involved with I mean we're you know usually involved like you said with urban impact and I mean just all these different ministries it's\nIt's so fulfilling to be in a position to help ministry and moved that forward well\nThat's why I lead you into that [laughter] you jump jump there but I Wonder together that's very important to you and I want people to hear that too if you're involved in business it's important to have that give back mentality philanthropy minister whatever it is that you feel God is calling you to do but uh don't get so caught up as you mentioned earlier so caught up in the business that you forget some of these other things\nAbsolutely I mean growth is great we all want to see growth and want to see from even even the people that are part of the doors family but the more important thing is what what are you doing to give back and what do you you benefiting from that is\nGood fun question I have a that I usually like asking all of these leadership is because I don't necessarily let people know that I'm going to ask us about how some of the things either from church or from the business in the leadership things you've seen have actually helped in the home or even vice versa\nYou some of the trends and things that you've seen come across there and and I think mentoring the big one 'cause a lot of ways you mentioned your kids are Twenty one I always argue with people that no I'm not a parent for life I might be a mentor or even like in an elder situation but we need to raise kids up to be their own so that they go to raise kids and so on and so on is that mentor aspect cub you've seen some of that cross over\nOh without question I you know and even from a standpoint of what I've learned now you know I certainly feel a certain you know not responsibility but passion to give that back also to help others you know\nI'm In me oh I have a lot of that again I have a lot of friends that own stores all across the country and and sharing ideas and just trying to again you know looking towards my mentor say okay how do I live and reflect the same way that he does to me how to live and reflect down to the next generation and so on\nAnd um you know the biggest thing is is the children you know it's the children of Pittsburgh because that's where we have to change in their hearts and minds and their futures because\nThere's so much available for them\nBut I think we have to keep in mind they've all got individual backgrounds and they've they've some of them from good families bad whatever that situation but there's still an individual that if we get involved in their lives that maybe the thing God's going to use to change them right then right exactly and in the past can be changed I mean from that standpoint you can you can get away from the\nWall and they have to see good role models they have to see\nWhat would it means to be a man to be you know in all aspects whether it be you know marriage most important who you are as a husband you know who you are as a business owner and they have to see that there's more to it than just chase in dollars and and you know going that route\nOne of the things we talk about around here a lot is occasionally you know we've got to have fun sometimes for what what's your what's your what's your phone button\nI don't want to I don't want to see that I ah I was getting put your leisure your activity what do you like to well [noise]\nThe more the merrier as far as er and I love to have fun I mean you know I Love boating water skiing you are riding motorcycles\nUm but honestly the most fun is friendships you know I mean that's that's another thing I encourage people to develop awesome friendships and you know that's the thing that indirectly through business you know and and if you're even here weren't FM I you know they they say you know if you can\nHave a couple of good friends and your life you know that you really are true friends that you really blessed and I'm truth I'm way beyond that I I I sometimes just say God you know this is this is unbelievable I feel so blessed I have so many people\nThat are true friends that you know that it just it busted my wife and I encourage people to do the same\nAnd from what I Know of you you're pretty uh pretty much a black and gold guy to\nOh yeah oh yeah there's you know we've got to get them through the play off the air and stuff\nAnd then come to I don't know if we get the penguins around to a third a third Stanley Cup or not but they got some work to do that is kind of neat though that the city color that all of a thing you know that I Know there are only thing\nI like the fact that the uh it doesn't matter you can see where you're black and gold and your your goal no matter what the season it is\nBut I think you bring up a good point in the friendship aspect 'cause that's where leadership can really happened one on one and you may find someone that boy they could really use something you near you might find some now he's been through that or she's been they could really help here I think that's a great point the dynamic of a friendship is huge scholarship within the church\nA fellowship with in charge is most important especially you know beyond even just attending church but getting into small groups getting to you know developed I mean some of the closest relationships we have in our lives and my wife and I are you know through small group and getting you know people at a deeper level\nThrough and then a church being an Arabic thing to you and I'm involvement there and and I know that's huge for most of the people we have on\nHere the ... yeah that is so we can bring\nThat out here in these in these programs and let people hear what's important to you about church and what what involvement you've had and what leadership you've learned there\nYeah well it's all my life lessons come from the Bible in charge now that's number one that I I feel like if you as close as you can adhere to those everything else is going to fall in place you know so much of what's happened with trinity and its growth and the great things have happened there\nReally when I look back and go wow mark you didn't have a whole lot to do is you know the ... while God is really cool and what he does\nYou know I mean he just put things in place and sets courses that you don't even see coming as not until you're looking back and go oh I didn't I never saw that but you know if you get everything else and order a God really does take care of you and and send in the right directions well\nWe appreciate you being in March but a great time chatting with you let's talk again real quick about where the story is given the phone number and the website because again I'm always of the mindset there's always somebody out there looking for something good whether it's an anniversary 'cause they come around all the time or weddings or whatnot so give us the skinny back down again on where you are and how they can get hold of you\nAnd that that could mortgages good debt I Know in Pennsylvania people tend to think will pay off a mortgage first but if you have bad that if you don't have money in emergency funds if you don't have savings or for a rainy days or even saving for retirement as we're aging and living longer\nAs statistics have proven we're living up to Ninety five now projections are up to age a hundred and fifty in a bar up\nBecause we're leading healthier lives which is great but if we don't have savings if we have bad debt if we just have a mortgage that's paid off and we don't have any income that's coming in we have an invested in\nLong term savings plans then you're not putting yourself in a in a good position so I encourage folks to call in and reach out to us at one eight hundred six six to nine five five zero\nBecause the bottom line is we choose how we wish to lead our lives when it comes to financial freedom\nFor many who may be struggling with even\nGetting approved on a mortgage you made your credit score under five dating we approve of folks at five eighty give you the same low interest rate as someone who may have an eight hundred score depending on where the rates are because we work with over fifty wholesale lenders and that is quite remarkable in itself right stopped\nWell it's amazing I mean and that's what's great we have people who are\nI have a lot of friends we have a lot of friends who are back managers for banks that you know if they can get it done they don't want to upset their clients that have managers where the clients are really really upset that they can get something done and they're they bring everything over and we get their loan done within you know thirty days so\nWe have a lot of good relationships and we urge everybody just to have a mortgage statement give us a call\nSee what we can do a lot and I live in Pennsylvania a lot of us okay so we might have a great great but maybe we can get you paid off on your home in Fifteen Years instead of the Twenty years that you have left and the payment might be\nA way because of debt and um\nUh the uh the fact that we have access to the credit bureaus directly\nIt's amazing when people say wow I didn't know that it just got fixed in like twenty thirty days because he told me exactly what needs to happen and it's truly a there's a science behind it it's not something that you have to pay someone more money to fix that that doesn't do the trick 'em but as I've said\nWe are here to be of service to answer questions make sure that we can get you approved whether it's a refinance whether it's a reverse mortgage whether it's a ... home purchase a or even an investment property or commercial properties\nUh we do it all and we are here to make sure that we give you the right answers and uh give you their education and the tools that are necessary\nYeah and we're very very fortunate because we build these relationships with the credit bureaus you can just call any of the credit bureaus and ask them in fact let me take that back\nYou can even get anybody to talk to you as a credit for your so we've had these relationships for fourteen years I've been in the lending industries longer than that so we have these relationships where I'm Talking to somebody\nOne on one and he can do an analysis and so she can do in an office and tell us what has to happen on that file or specifically so it's a great resource it's been\nAmazing for us to be able to help our uh our clients who call us so uh we're happy to share that give us a call one eight hundred six six to nine five zero\nFolks also the website which I've said again is an easy tool for many if you wish to schedule time to chat on the phone and email us with questions as well is uh the website is an M. C. M. T. G. dot com I'm\nOne of the things I've also or you know encourage folks to find out before you get let's say here say people try and be helpful to give you information it's not as if they mean anything um negatively about it it's just that it's not based on fact\nAnd sometimes when you're dealing with finances especially you want the facts and one of the key ones with reverse mortgages which I've seen over and I'm falling because it's true people get that information because the reverse mortgage is something that works\nAnd is solid program it's government sponsored to anyone who is sixty two years of age\nSeventy years of age maybe you wish to have a little bit more financial freedom you want to stay in the home that you live and you may have a low balance on the mortgage or no mortgage but you want access to some of the money without having to make mortgage payments every month\nBe curious to find out don't base it on anything but fact\nBecause it's not only what I say or what soft that with a reverse mortgage have to go through the counseling process you have to get the education which has provided by the government so there is no here say there's just a fact\nAnd there's one fact that you have to take away very important the home always remained in your own name that's always been the biggest\nProblem a misconception and that can be verified not only that we're saying it but you go through the counseling agencies the loan products has changed from Fifteen Years ago the one relatives and other people say something they're talking about things that were Fifteen Twenty years ago\nThe home always remains in your name\nAnd would that folks give us a call one eight hundred six six to nine five five zero stay well folks\nIn the mortgage for family\nThose

appreciate spending time with us here today we are here each and every Saturday afternoon at twelve thirty right here on AM at twelve fifty the answer the phone number we have to remember standing by seven to for eight three seven three five five three seven to for eight three seven three five five three\nThe website to talk to Bach dot com and I want to remind our listeners that\nKevin you been in the business for nearly three decades right three decades Thirty years for a long time but yeah you know what you have so much experience under your belt I Would venture to think there's probably not a situation you haven't heard of when it comes to helping somebody plan for their income future\nNow there's there's no way we touched on pretty much anything that come up um we had a lot of experiences with our class we brought them from\nNothing to accumulating some money for retirement to planning their retirement to planning what's gonna happen with her or him either legacy with whatever's leftover and then we've even had to distribute that legacy after they pass we've had people we've had all phases of people's retirement we don't really\nWork with accumulation anymore except maybe if their kids come to us our focus is if you're within five to ten years of retirement and you want to decide on what they put the best date to retire that's where we come back we we help you through the transitional phase into the distribution phase or if you don't need a distribution in\nTo the protection phase of your retirement\nAnd then into the distribution phased after your past so we've got everything covered for you what happens in the middle what kinds of Caribbean need what kind of resources you need to um pay for your care where do you go to if you need to go into a personal care home home care news I mean there's nothing that we can't cover\nAnd that's what you need somebody that can cover everything that you can run into down the road and your retirement future\nYou know it's something that is so important to keep on the forefront here take it from a to Z and you talked about these three phases here I just want to recap so accumulation the working years you're accumulating your savings are doing all the right things and then of course that transition phase going\nFrom the work world to retirement where every day as Saturday and then that's the distribution phase where you're going to replace that paycheck\nWith their retirement income that you've built over the years with those strategies and tools that of course Kevin Bach has instilled in you and showed you how your plan is going to continue to grow\nNow here's the thing you talked about if you're five or ten years away from retirement that's usually what we call their retirement red zone that's they're just on the brink of finally being able to say I'm outta here I'm done with the nine to five\nBut even if you're maybe five years into retirement and you're thinking okay I Need to get some things may be readjusted I Need a second set of eyes Kevin can help you with that as well\nCall today and find out how you can sit down with Kevin and put together your very own\nRetirement income master kit okay and this includes going through a six pillar process that Kevin does its from income planning to legal planning you're going to do some legacy planning that and much more it's complimentary call today seven to for a three seven three five five three\nSeven to for a three seven three five five three\nI was doing some research cab and I found that are only Eighteen percent of Americans are very confident\nThat they'll have enough save for retirement that makes sense that goes along with this in spite of the long bull market more than half about fifty six percent of the people surveyed by trans America Center for retirement studies say that they still haven't fully recovered from the great recession\nSo nearly half of people haven't recovered from the great recession you got only Eighteen percent of people that say they feel confident\nNot a good combination here so does this mean that they'll have to settle for a lower standard of living when they finally retire well it\nOn on how old they were how old they are or what their health is are they able to um uh just how much are they putting away what was seen as a lot of people whenever the markets go down they quit putting money into their retirement plans\nIf you think about it is going on sale so if you're going into mutual funds and the share price is going down in value doesn't that make sense to put more money into your retirement plan by that share that that the mutual fund or whatever on sale\nAnd then when it comes back up you've got all these shares coming up that you bought her lower priced large people start putting more in winter starts caught up with us all makes sense mhm ... war when it goes down that'll help you to offset so if you know when when the market crashes again if you're not in retirement\nWill really you can't afford to what's going to be there for you down the road he could be thinking well maybe next year I'll make more maybe next year next time I get a raise up with something him but from every dollar you make you need to take at least ten percent out and put it away for retirement Fifteen Percent as better\nTwenty percent better if you want to retire younger\nPut as much as you can and if you're not making enough maybe you can change your skill sets improve your skill sets to get a better paying job down the road but you've got to think about the future because so many people were coming into retirement with nothing we get a lot of people we help a lot of\nOlder people with different benefits that ah the way we give back we help veterans and we've got a lot of veterans coming in here without anything for retirement\nAnd they just you know maybe they had a decent job but they didn't save enough and they are they had a catastrophic illness took away all their money these are all the things that have to be planned for\nFor your retirement um another thing that comes to mind a Social Security how many times we hear how we got to take Social Security sixty two so I can make the most of of my retirement at the most money back well when when there's a good chest that um we're gonna live in or eighties and nineties\nIf you wait until you are for retirement age of maybe sixty six right now sixty six and a half\nTo take your money then if you live in the early eighties and nineties you're going to end up with more money than if you took a sixty two maybe you're you're unhealthy while maybe sixty two makes sense then where you needed just to survive because maybe you're disabled\nBut just everything plays into it we talk about families will talk about their history you know how long did your parents live there still alive how about their parents how long did they live what was our health who do you take after your mother or your father how long did they live\nUm how was their health habits you know how what did they do to smoke today drink what do you do you remember today we have more options to keep us alive longer and feeling better than they did so how long are you going to live they say the average couple a husband and wife is going to\nOne of them is going to live to Ninety One or Ninety two you retire or what sixty sixty five how many years is that that you have to plan for and as we get older chances of us needing medical care becomes grader and that is the largest expense\nA forest in retirement the every single person in retirement expect to pay maybe two hundred two hundred and forty thousand dollars in health care a couple of somewhere around four hundred four hundred and fifty in health care\nHow are you going to do that we have to say okay what are we gonna do to plan and you have to start planning younger the younger you can play on the more relaxed you can be in retirement\nYeah we are living longer which means you are going to need more income and you have to find that balance of when is the best time to take your Social Security what are your other income streams and\nHow can they benefit you moving forward and again nothing that you do in retirement is going to be cookie cutter everybody's situation is different in the planning process and that's why it's important to sit down with somebody again with Thirty years of experience three decades Kevin Bach integrity retirement solutions and he\nCan help you go through this organize all the paperwork and do other punching up the numbers and say you know what\nYou're actually in a great position you can wait till you're Seventy to to take your Social Security or better yet maybe you need to take it a little bit earlier all these things have to measure of exactly right it's like putting together a possible you have to have the right pieces\nTo have that successful retirement and again we talked about having patients in plain a waiting game with Tom Hanks and his vision in Nineteen Ninety four minutes over Twenty years ago to make his profit off of a percentage\nOf the movies profits and that equaled over forty million dollars for him that didn't happen overnight it happened over Twenty years and again so important to have this conversation sooner rather than later\nAnd insects topic I Want to bring up is something I've never seen before sometimes you read about it and you know ... magazines or something and you're like\nThe release you know millions of dollars to their animals well I'm not sure whether this was showing your animal ... I'm not sure if it's showing your animal that you love them or just the way of kind of getting back at your kids and they have rights financial says five percent of Americans plan on leaving money to their pets\nSo do your clients typically have you know specific ways they want to pass down their inheritance to their dog cat bird how does that work\nWell when they leave our first meeting if they're really thinking about some options and most of them don't have they never thought about pet planning estate planning for your pets I talked to somebody while back I told him oh they're so what are you guys talk about on your show and I said we're talking about estate planning\nAnd they started laughing until I explained to them uh some of the key points in estate planning and they said you know what that's that's a great and you do the whole show on opposite whoa yeah um it's so important to think about it because if you have a dog you have a new puppy and you're older um\nThat puppy could live Fifteen sixteen Seventeen Eighteen years sure we've we've got cats are living twenty to twenty five years\nParents if you have a bird you have a parrot or one of the ones that live longer they can live as long as Seventy five years so what kind of a pet do you have what is their life expectancy and if you pass away who's going to take care of it and then the big question is do they know it\nAnd I have found a way in a while you get the bird that lives sixty years I mean yeah that's\nYeah you've got to leave provisions in the world who's how's it going to take care of it and some test cost more to take care of and others a veterinary bills aren't cheap anymore and it's all expenses so if you leave\nMaybe a little life insurance policy that you set aside just for the pet she's going to have some provisions um and it is part of something we talk about in our our killer planning process\nWell let me stop you right there because this is something I Want to transition into maybe a little happier subjects yeah but I I you know you're talking about a six a pillar planning process I think this is something that a separate you from all the other advisors out there so let's start with this this is the process you go through with each one of your clients starting with income planning\nRight it was the income planning we talk about you want to take income do you need income to make ends meet and under income planning how much do you need to cover your basic necessities what's it costs you to exist and then we have the second phase where do you need to create your lifestyle money\nHow much do you need to create the reasonable realistic lifestyle you want so what do we have in place to guarantee whatever part of that income you need you got Social Security if I'd have a pension us enough to create lifetime income for you so that you don't have to worry about that\nAnd then maybe you don't need the income so now we talk about asset planting that's our second phase how we get a title your assets how we gonna owned those assets do we want to protect us assets from creditors to learn to protect them from a Medicaid nursing home costs down the road we want to leverage those to help pay for\nA our fourth pillar health care planning\nBut do we want to leverage them for future needs to pay for catastrophic illness that uh one out of two of us are going to have once we hit sixty five\nSo those are just the first two areas and they needed the plant differently this is where we talked about earlier do I want to have more income that I Need\nSo it doesn't matter what happens in the market or do I want to keep it all the money out here and growing it it might stay the same for a year or two if the markets crashed the winter starts going up again you start seeing your money to go up again if that's how you like to see her money go then maybe we need to talk the third area\nOf our our ... our planning process is tax planning [noise]\nAre you taking income is such a way that you're paying the maximum taxes on it we see that it almost every case the way people are taking their income from their dividends from they're not so much interest anymore 'cause there is and hardly any but it ... those rates are starting to grow up so we're going to be starting to see people taking their interest at three or four percent like we can get people now\nUm how are you taking your income\nWe had one client that we were able to reduce his taxable income by forty thousand dollars a year just by taking his income differently wow\nThat makes a huge difference oh it did and and by the time we were done with his client that their family loves us because we eliminated probate for them we made their state more private we actually got them some better return on the money\nAnd which helped them to preserve what they had for a longer period of time because of her that her\nA few a few million dollars instead of a couple of million\nAnd a it was it was just a really good case or where there are so many things that we had to deconstruct and reconstruct it made it so much better for them\nThen the fourth area we looked at I talked about was health care planning how are you going to pay for your health care as you get older the every single person you're looking at two hundred two hundred and forty thousand dollars in in care expenses in in medical expenses the average couple between four hundred and four hundred and fifty thousand dollars\nTo pay for care how are you going to do that\nCan you you there's there's different ways you can ... you say some people um we see they have long term care insurance mhm that's great if you can afford it if you can qualify for if it makes sense for your situation\nSome people are opting for a hybrid life insurance policy now\nBecause you can buy a life insurance policy\nThat you pay for your care from the higher death benefit than we have the fifth pillar which is legacy planning which we talked a little bit earlier in the show we want to minimize expenses taxes and legal fees maximize inherited it keep it as private as possible\nThe traditional way of planning his as public as possible then we get in a legal planning that touches based on all ... all the other five areas that's us we are the general contractor we we control hold out for you\nSo as you can see it's a very in depth process literally goes from a to Z through in complaining to legal planning not leaving any stone unturned if you want to sit down with Kevin and talk about your specific situation and what's your hopes and dreams and plans for retirement and go through it six pillow process for successful retirement\nYeah no so I you know the president is right I mean he he wants to continue this expansion of economic expansion that is really truly ... duty is pro growth policies tax cuts deregulation\nGiving more money to grow and expand making major to hire and you know repatriate dollars in your state but you know I'll tell you this is the exact thing that's going to do\nWhen we think things are getting a little too hot to kind of getting a little too overheated perhaps we got to raise interest rates a couple of you know a couple of percentage points because a a a basic point it we expect that something will happen like let's say\nDemocrats take over the house from a policy stuff and there's an economic slowdown so we have to make sure that we have a little bit of cushion to lower interest rate in case we get into a little bit of a\nOf a mess when we have some of the socialist that perhaps could elected\nWell of course seems unfair for what they did and the previous eight years I mean they do printed up a bunch of money held interest rates down to zero and uh you know they they basically gave or the Obama administration a lot of cover and now here we are a ... you know counter mandating\nA you know the the holes that are the Democrats dug for us and I don't mean well it's like some of the Dirt's coming back on us and look who's holding the shovel but the feds well\nYou know it's funny what they're what they're doing right now\nIs the opposite of what it's doing you know we're doing so well because of\nPresident Trump's policies like hey we got to maybe have a little bit of a\nGive us a little bit of a cushion because we're doing so well you know what the what China with the Chinese government's doing now is actually lowering their reserve army because they're not doing as hot as we are because we called them on their cheating and frankly during the last ... years under a bomb it very very you you didn't just print money\nVery very quiet anything very easy to lower interest rates make it cheap to borrow when it's hard to do is produce an economic environment that's conducive to entrepreneurial growth\nThat's conducive to this group in hiring and you know wage growth\nThat natural old fashioned way exactly President Trump's done it but what do you\nAnd the tough senior Chris is that we're talking unelected bureaucrat when they're not even ... I mean they're their own entity and their social engineering this and somehow thinking that whatever they do has causal effect\nBut the causal effect that they are they're doing is they're actually putting a stick and the economic spoke to this country\nThat's exactly what it is you know when you hear candidates are here you know greater than fifty percent of Democrats believe socialism is it's preferable to capitalism you know you have to think you know what's what's going on here and then they do take control of the house you know what kind of\nThings do they try to push through you know that are going to be a good for the economy you know the exact opposite of what we need you know they're exactly doing exactly that you know when you have a front front leading candidate you know\nA ran for president last election cycle and Bernie Sanders who wants to\nSpend a trillion and trillions of dollars for a single payer health care plan and now you have a an emerging millennial in Cortez\nWho's looking to spend three trillion dollars or more I think the numbers more than that right exact ought to get this plan in place you know you think these these this is the next wave Democrats I don't know that we're facing too great a bit threatened twenty twenty\nI go back to the you know the basics Chris and I've been asking this question forever is that you know um how much government do we want to buy how much government can we afford\nAnd here we are still trying to swallow down a three four trillion dollar size government and the socialist ideas that oh no that's enough I mean we're barely keeping up with that we got twenty two trillion dollars in debt staring us in our face\nAnd uh you know and they go oh we got a better idea let's expand Medicare even more so we're going to go back and\nRevisit Obamacare two point oh a ... you know in ... and this is what the Democrats thing ... it's just not quite never enough if you just gave us a little bit more\nUh we could figure this out and it's like look at we can't afford it we've already giving you a everything we can give you and it's not working you know when do you cut your losses and move on\nWell you know that that's all right I mean a racket for Democrats and when they run for office\nIt promised free stuff it's very simple you know as I said earlier\nA you know an economic terms just print money and you know kind of give it away and you know lower interest rates make it easier to borrow but you know you have to have a healthy economy you have to do with the old fashioned way will operate and domestic economy anymore we ... we operate in a global economy and so\nYou know that's the whole racket they they've been running uninformed uneducated voters think great gimme gimme gimme game or\nThe government will take care of me ever pay for my bills I don't have to worry about anything and I have to worry about\nKnow anything that you know that I should do to improve my own\nUh marketability as a as a worker or even as a business owner or the government will just take care of me Uncle Sam would just take care of me and that is the exact opposite of what we were founded as a nation of you know we're a capitalist free market economy were competition is good healthy it makes products better drives prices down\nHere and it makes everybody all it makes everybody better office by millions of people uh you know hundreds of millions of people have been lifted out of poverty has a free market system that Republicans a spouse\nAnd Chris this secures our liberty I mean this is this is what drives all this I mean the reason that people want to come to this country has to really be free\nYou know to allow their ideas and their dreams to be realized in this country of towards them that and uh you know every time the Democrats are in leadership I mean all you gotta do is just look at the city's look at the states where ... where Democrats\nAre involved in their leading the way I mean it is absolute misery for the citizens there for the most part\nAnd you know it's like a you know what the voters can't figure this out even in you know let's say California you know with the pain that they're under I mean here it is\nUm you know you've got a governor talking about supposedly this robust growth that they've been having well they're still at a net negative they chased away more businesses out of that state and more jobs out of that state but yet you know with a straight face the governor says oh we've you know we've added so many new businesses\nYou know to the state here is like wait a minute you know you're so you're so far behind that you know we need that and then some in order to get back to parody\nAnd that's exactly it it it's kind of the same terminology bill as when they say you know during the Obama administration how many jobs not know how many jobs they created how many jobs they have\nAnd I love the ... that is not an economic metric you should be proud of how many jobs you saved or created should be how many jobs you created it reminds me when I came into the Trump Administration the department of commerce I ran the minority business development see for the metrics that we had and helping minority doesn't says okay\nHow many businesses have we have we helped\nUh how much that we said to them and getting contracts with the dollar amount\nAnd then I came in and I looked at this this new metric and it said how many jobs were created\nOr safe [laughter] we're getting rid of that in part nobody that and can we create and I'll tell you\nDuring the the twenty or twenty uh Eighteen fiscal year we create a ten thousand new jobs with that small agency or just a just a small budget and that's because President Trump's a robust economic\nPlan and and the domestic policies that exactly the business owners crappy the opportunity to just give them the ball you know you have to have all the end zone\nWhen we got we got to go to break will pick it up there we get more from crisscrossed the after the stay with us\nNever wonder how big going into Syria more creative ... companies and individuals make their own group to me

encouraged her to get a second to thirty percent of no because we can't afford to run out\nBy Congress which is their job to do then we are able to go in and negotiate things and settle everything down with our European partners and then uh it really puts an ordinance pressure on China even though China's already said is you know\nHey look we want to negotiate willing and and the president goes uh and it's not the right time yet I mean there are feeling a lot of pain and so they're getting Nancy but he knows that he's got them on the hook and he's just dragging them along until it's just the right time\nFor them to negotiate and for America to\nLeverage a you know and take advantage of this little leverage that is at hand for them or don't you think\nYou know that's exactly what a smart move that President Trump is taking is really taking a step of\nA and the first really allowing the Chinese to have enough rope to hold them so hang themselves man when you think about how much of an impact these tariffs\nAre in this trade war is having on a Chinese with respect US Economy in the U.S consumer base we really haven't felt the tariffs that they tried to slap back on and so if we continue to drag this out draw this out until they actually are willing to make concessions like stopping the theft of intellectual property exactly\nLike like stopping a force technology transfer um you know China's an entire are indeed apartment basically it's just I eat that uh you know so as soon as we get them to make those concessions I think President Trump's going to strike a deal but you're right he wants to attract without slow walk slower get this deal done just signed it ratified by Congress to you as you\nApproach that you are striking new deal with them get you get your pan our site we already got the Korea deal with South Korea deal done and then we are and then we join our allies in any unified fashion against China and I think that really turned up pressure on them and bring them back to the table where they have no choice but to but to play fair\nWell perfectly laid out Chris Garcia thank you so much Chris and former senior Trump official at the U.S Commerce

until now not\nInto relief factor came along as a one hundred per cent drug free solution for people struggling with ordinary pain quite simply relief factor was designed by doctors to help relieve those occasional aches and pains due to aging exercise\nAnd everyday living let me ask you are aches and pains keeping you from sleeping through the night for keeping you from taking those nice long walks or playing golf or tennis you can't really call it living if you can't get around comfortably the three week quick start from relief factor may be all you need\nTo lower or even eliminate these

Martina slide dot com all the information you need to know is right there and other information or further taking 'cause we are givers you know that's the way we roll hey John Goodman joins us now America's money's answers man and nationally recognized expert on personal finance miss Jordan how we doing\nGreat to be with again bill hey always good so ah how come you the bearer of such bad news here with the stock market are moving in the wrong direction\nWell it's been a rising interest rates that are taking a toll there and uh I'm not the bearer of bad news on the barrel real nurses that were actually happening out there so of course long confused with yeah in the long term treasury and a ten year treasury\nHas gotten over a three point two percent ... after the first time in quite a while most of the year and about two percent to point one of the really big move up words are not means that mortgage rates have gone up over five percent on thirty year fixed rate mortgages right\nUm and the federal that's long term rates and short term rates the fed reserved control\nOr they went up again in June ... June ... September ... uh looks like they're going to do it a given December so that means ...\nJust you can't raise the rates going into Christmas can you\nTell them I Will I guess they can never they were they want rise that will be for interest rate increases the fear that means that what you pay on credit cards and student loans and car loans and business loans all that's gone up three times this year will go four times probably three times at least next year\nSo it's costing consumers more money tomorrow when they're trying to slow things down a little ... I'm Sorry to have an impact of seeing the housing market definitely getting weaker than it was before with mortgage rates going up to over five percent how does that help because well I mean other than the fence view they kept interest rates too low for too long\nAnd their so called normalizing of getting back to normal right now they're fed funds rate that they control the two and a quarter I think what they would consider the neutral rate\nIs maybe three and a half percent so another point or more from where we are now which means that you're going to be even more on a loan you know going forward I mean it helps the fed what I like it helps us particularly definitely slows the economy\nAnd particularly bondholders are really getting hurt here you know I mean\nIf you have money in the long term treasury bond yields keeps going up as it has been you lose more than principled and you were in an interest if you're getting three point two percent on my long term on today and ready to go to three and a half percent which I think it's likely\nI I think you could lose a lot of principle so you got to do something different bill because right keep me up that way you're going to keep losing money\nWell the reality is is the fed is the fed and I know that when these things kind of happened when the dynamic tension starts\nPulling a little bit more in their direction people started saying why we have the fed anyway uh they're really not helping the cause especially at a time when\nWe're we're trying to recover ourselves the everyday consumer uh for eight years of bad news real bad news and a bad experiences and of course the you know they feathered that whole situation by not raising rates are all those number of years so I guess we're\nWe're paying for the feds passed sentencing\nAct like a good way to put the feds sell something were to easy they pumped a the the fence balancing it was about six hundred billion dollars before the financial crisis and after about four and a half trillion so they pumped about four trillion dollars into the economy\nTo keep it from kind of going over the edge and now we're paying for that they're kind of reducing that a bit of we can't just supposed to talk about what people should do if they've got money and I'm gonna get hurt 'cause\nIt's it's not a pretty situation I mentioned before the most popular email I get from your listeners about these secured real estate from yes because they can get an eight percent yield but the price of a share of something going pronounce it doesn't stay as a pen dollars a share and doesn't have any movement that way\nA website so that is secured real estate funds dot com know lending money short term to commercial real estate projects all over the country\nAnd it's got a good track record so if you need income that to me as much more stable way to keep your money instead of these bombs which I think you're going to keep getting hurt as interest rates keep rising\nYeah and I like to the minimum investment because I misunderstood I thought it was much higher but you said a five on five thousand dollars that's a that's a pretty good a pretty nice and there'll be missions\nTo get into an either or most of them are before them out\nIt goes right to get to the present and then you could do it in an hour if you like as well and have a compound you can either have to reinvest it on a regular basis or take monthly checks which every like wow so in in this ... I mean I was just in a conference last week where they're saying this is the beginning of a new bond market\nIndependent good to have you with us bill Martinez here fourteen minutes before the top of the hour we're getting some great news that uh the pastor in Turkey I'm Andrew Brunson is are being released um you know the state department's been working on this very vigorously along with our president\nAnd um we just uh got news that ah he's ah being released after being held prisoner in Turkey\nFor two years with us right now and I'm sure he's celebrating with that news as well is Geoff just and he's in issues analysts for focus on the family Jeff how you doing\n[noise] hey bill I'm doing great and um that is great news that a pastor's being released\nYeah right now I mean wouldn't you know it just as you and I are talking I mean this is a this is breaking news\nAnd uh we're excited uh we've been praying for pastor Brunson for quite a while you know as a most may understand he was being detained he was accused of being a terrorist or a ... but you know hey look at\nThat's what happens in a ... you know countries outside of the United states that uh you know or operates I'm with the power of the government to do is they darn well please and they come up with stories and next thing you know you're in jail and forget about any kind of freedom right\n[noise] yeah that's true and I'm probably like we're going to talk about this morning it's not happening here in the U. S. but a Christians are being accused care as not being extremist or a haters are bigots and\nUm but certainly yeah we're not in a place where they are overseas and other places where Christians are really being seriously persecuted\nI I mean on on some degree Jeff I agree with you they almost seems like a you know we are dealing with the hang nailed compared to what other questions that you see these\nOthers that have been persecuted that I mean uh you you you read the voice of the martyr and you hear the stories that uh you know true martyrs they're the face they're going through and um you know when you go cash what do we complaining about\n'em and you know that's one thing but the other deal this most concerning right now is the lack of civility\nThe political environment is torching our culture\nAnd it's creating a war and division amongst its people uh that is very dangerous that that puts us on a road\nTo a ... some of these countries have been doing where it just becomes so autocratic and I know it's hard for people to proceed that there was they said well this is America but\nBut here we are politically talking about socialism values and I'm just about every socialist country that I'm aware of or you may say unintended but are they end up you know overpowering the people and try to get everybody to think the same way and forget about any kind of liberty\n[noise] that's right we see um yeah we see that around the world where they're trying to I'm\nCompelled speech to be a certain way and we've even seen that here in the U. S. I Know in California I'm ... ... right at the Supreme Court struck down just in June I was trying to compel I'm pro life centers to tell their\nClients about abortion and direct them to abortion centers and so here you have the government here trying to come out speech and thankfully that was struck down\nMhm well and of course uh you know right before that you got Dave delight and\nWho are videotapes a Planned Parenthood or officials selling baby parts which I'm In every understanding of the law that I have is illegal\nAnd nothing happened to them but they've delight and is the one who's being persecuted now he he was a detainee was put in jail his legal fees are mounting and meanwhile the are the people associated with the sale of baby parts\nPlanned Parenthood at all um are roaming around phrase if nothing happens so what does that tell ... what does that telling you know people here in this country and around the world is that you better you know tone up to the party line if not we're going to make it a living hell for you\nYeah I I I think you're right I mean we could name case after case like that um jak Philips bake yes in Denver and a ... or the forest in Washington I'm\nEven chick fillet every time they try to build a new a restaurant um they're attacked and people are reminded that their president a few years ago came out in support of marriage between a man and a woman so\nAlong with along with almost eight well over eight million voters in California which by the way all those votes were vacated by the very uh ... ... you know Democratic Party that says well we got to make sure every vote counts\nExcept for the you know again just like the sinking in the speaking as long as it lines up with their politics it's okay\nBut uh you know the heck with the first amendment and that we have any kind of contrary in you and want to exercise the liberties or they were given to us by our U.S Constitution\nYeah I I think what it tells as one of the things that tells us is that um\nAs businesses and government and the media um are more and more opposed to the Christian message on a life and sexuality and relationships and marriage there are Christians need to be more and more on guard and um we do need to take a stand for\nA free speech and freedom of religion and those those values that have been such a part of the the American um tradition and are you know what that caller American experiment here exactly what we do need to be on guard for those things are so Christians need to be active and and of course we want to do it\nUm kindly and graciously but we still want to stand up and speak the truth and and do it courageously as well right\nExactly and people of faith need to understand um foremost to all this is that you have to war you're up in by wiring up you've got a warrior up with those tools that are not Cornel but the ones that are mighty\nThrough God and that to is a course a resembled a for us uh you know in the full\nArmor of God if you are not a armored up with a full armor of God or you're going to be insensitive or you're going to be a little bit of a cloud hopper here because after everything is all said and done ... you know what his pre eminent in our face is that we love one another\nAnd you know it's easy to love the lovable it's the on lovable that are the biggest you know the biggest challenge a chef you know\nYeah now to steer just warn us about that in and called us too it didn't he yes he did all of\nThose who persecute us and and and and I think people should be encouraged to because we have such great examples and people like Jack Philips and Baron Hill stats men who have been gracious are under pressure and they\nUm you know you were talking about the and civility they have not resorted to that kind of in civil language but they've been gracious and kind and\nThoughtful and they've expressed their viewpoint and I think I'm there we can be encouraged because those are really really good models for us\nAnd Jeff uh especially encouraged not only by the owners but ah the employees\nYou know when the chick fillet was attacked or the response of the employees were so godly I mean it was um you know I was really proud of the employees and how they came together and trusted in their faith\nYou know to a lot of people I I mean the things that some of the customers were saying to the people in challenging them I mean it was like they went out of their way to just to go ahead and ruin somebody's day in torment them\nUh but the response of the employees was admirable and um and I and I drew great courage from watching a ... and I mean these aren't you know these were young girls\nBeing attacked Jeff I'm now so uh you know it's a sad commentary you know we talk about some of these businesses\nYou know here we simply um in fact I'm having to California tomorrow or and of course one of my favorite stops as soon as I get there is in and out burger and for those of you know ended up or you just comes with the west coast it comes from the west and uh you got to have it in and out burger and they were all upset because uh you\nKnow in and out was supporting Republican causes right and and I had to laugh because they said gosh these knuckleheads looked at the bottom of the cup of their drink and saw a a Christian scriptural reference this wouldn't blow their heads up on this but\nI Know I Know there are um you know\nPer climbing the gospel and and large and small ways there but yeah and they make good burgers\nTwo very good [laughter] good hitters fries yeah exactly yeah real brave see there's a problem I tell people that go well why does why does or French fries taste so different I said well because you've been used to McDonald's 'cause they bleach stir fries\nAnd a you know by the time you tasted it it's got it's got a unique taste I think on one hand marketing wise and you know quite innovative for McDonalds but on the other hand when you go and you actually have a real potatoes like to do it in and out you go well what does feel different about ... that's the way potatoes as opposed to taste it certainly don't potato yeah you watch them\nTake this potatoes and split them up in the fries and you know you're getting the real deal\nExactly exactly but you know to your point after all is said and done here Jeff is that yes Christians that need to understand um hey we're in a culture war we're call to be defenders of the faith to be ready and any season you know to tell your story you know what is that\nUm the ... makes you so joyful and so excited ... what is it that happened in your life or that or you know causes me to think that I Want what you have right\nYeah yeah I think we can be um you know like our time at ... and we can be gracious under that kind of pressure and display\nPeace and joy in the midst of all the what seems to be chaos and instability around us and and a lot of that you know it's foment it by the media and by different politicians and we don't necessarily experience it in our daily lives but right when it does hit\nWell finding the answer to this question may be the biggest way to retire financially independent and it's the best ways well you know the markets are up one day down next increasingly lower interest rates on some financial you got to quote their Roy that you want to share\nYeah we've been talking about the fact that bonds are not guaranteed and there was a quote from a jumbled image him grass\nAnd Mr grant said the government bonds once offered risk free return but now they offer return free risk and they were looking for the rising interest rate environment out there you're building your retirement portfolio and bonds you might want to have a conversation with someone about the risk is inheriting today's economy\nThe good news is that it's entirely possible to maintain your lifestyle in retirement by following three keys to everlasting income and that's the name of the show today\nI Know folks out there listening you probably get advice from a number of different sources Santa you might have a financial adviser you work with who you may or may not be happy with you may get all your financial advice from Google and you know Google's are provided some financial advice but you've got to be careful because\nYou'll get a million hits and some of them are going to really steer you wrong and there might be some tidbits there but\nKnow could you be getting better advice and more importantly how can you feel confident that your money will outlast you the key to retirement isn't that have a fascinating portfolio if these glitz and glamour stocks and bonds and ... permanent income and that's the theme of the show today these three key\nEverlasting income you know I was just reading recently about the congressional budget office and the forecast for the U.S Treasury Department\nSays that the U.S Treasury Department expects to run out of cash they have no money to operate\nTen weeks from the recording of this show and you believe that they're gonna be out of money everybody better get a debit card to get one quick and obviously they'll raise the debt ceiling again and you know recreating hit the printing press but you know the government doesn't have everlasting income they continue to run out and you know if you consider\nHow much income are you going to need personally and retirement to supplement your Social Security and any other sources like pensions are rental income or you certain how much income that your portfolio can provide with running out so there's probably going to be some gap between what you would like to have\nAnd what you have coming in on the fix side so your portfolio has to make up the difference where's your thirty level there that you can do that you also need to understand the tax impact of withdrawing money from different types of accounts\nRoss IRAs and four one K. than and traditional just investment account and I don't know where you stand on that folks I don't know if you're in the dark on these questions\nOr if you feel like you've got some of the figure it out and you just need some fine tuning but that's why we're talking about everlasting income on the show today so you want to stay tuned in in one way to do that again workshops coming up all the time classes coming up all the time remember our website synergy group Inc dot com synergy is spelled F. Y. N.\nE. R. G. Y. the word group\nI N C dot com check out the events that are always feel free to call us at eight hundred\nThree to one Seventy nine sixty three\nIt's time for our weekly health tip because you need

not the only wants to talk about this most of the shows that we err on Saturday and you'll probably find for other shows do on a similar type thing\nBut there's uniqueness here folks are the as I mentioned earlier we don't say no to any financial products we crashed the plant\nBased on what you're asking that particular port of part of your portfolio to do is that income is that growth is a

out there uh the average income for people in retirement in that sixty five Seventy five range is about sixty nine thousand dollars a year or some other numbers thrown out thirty two percent of
