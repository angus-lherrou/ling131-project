the Patriot one of my favorite and Larry Elder and Michael lip but it was really ah\nI I Wish there was an evening that I I I Wish every left wing or the country could have seen what what how we talk\nJust amongst ourselves and the civility\nYeah ... and the lack of hatred it would be fascinating to contrast that with a similar evening of people on the left to an audience on the left\nBut I don't know how I Would do it but I Would like to\nTalk to about a little more later 'cause I Want to talk a little bit about the last question that was asked but in the meantime they have found a suspect\n\nOr they have arrested a suspect me in these uh\nI don't even know what to call them with a real bombs whatever they were sent to all these people on the left and but so far it looks like\nIt looks like a man is a a a coup on the right and he has a a a they have his vantage van is\nPlastered with Donald Trump stickers and the like so we will ah let's see we have even more information just coming in now he's in his fifties\nAnd let's see what else we can say arrest made in connection with male explosive devices white van outside plantation auto zone appears to be the focus of investigators\nAnd if you get the pictures of it or\nYou can see the the the pro Donald Trump\nStickers and\nThe other people look if it's conceivable the guys on the left that he wants to make believe use all the right but I I suspect that this is the real deal he's simply a he was already it's interesting he'd already been arrested in the past he has a record for making terror threats\nWhy people who make terror threats are not in jail is one of by a vote rentals I don't understand why\nThey have to actually acted out you can't threaten death terror and the like and that would be sufficient to place you are in prison\nI I don't know I'm a there's a question that I posing\nSo one is going to happen and it's already happening so you see we told you it's a Trump rhetoric that caused at Trump's rhetoric that caused the truck prior to Donald Trump to the left and the right got along great\nThe left was not calling a ... or all of us all of us all of us racist and all I I'm not ... they were not calling up police a racist\nAnd even on occasion pigs this none of this was happening\nGuy pay portrays the police's pigs on his socks in a in a football game in a is a chosen by Nike to be spokesman ... this is all us as well because of Trump presumably\nA wedding that Charles Murray ah one of the most thoughtful up people in the country uh it goes to speak at Middlebury College and or is it physically attacked and a woman oh the professor with him is injured by left wing students now that's all Trump\nShe ... this is the amazing thing\nOnly only the rights views hate is is the lie the one of the grand lies I should make a list they have to do that for myself the grandest of the laws the greatest of the lives is that America is racist the or the other number one is that\nWe have a word Nazis right I mean come on\nAnd and you remember how fast the steam Scalia and the of the shooting at at the Republican congressman playing a baseball game or how fast that disappeared from the news I mean you get updates on Steve's as ... as a condition and that would be it\n\nBut now this thing a ripe right at the before the elections I mean this guy aside from just being ... evil\nIn his in sick is stupid stupid it would be if if\nIf the left could have invented the guy they would have invented the guy if he turns out to be the right wing or that ... that apparently he he is I say apparently\nBecause of the of the van but as soon as I heard ... and then in ... in the beginning I thought this could this could well be a guy on the left because it's so often these folks to take place but\nThat's more information came in and I thought about it more than I realized who the targets for it's hard for me to imagine these these were the ideal targets of somebody who does have people on the left other all the people on the left\nWould have picked the same targets if they were trying to blame the right to\nFind out more than I Will let you know any more information as it is revealed to the public of the United states of America\nSo I have a very interesting thing for you here very interesting today uh let's see David Brooks in the New York times who ... the the New York times has three columnist author of about twenty\nThat are not on the left\nAnd David Brooks is one of them there were none that are on the right there are not leftists which is fine but they're they're not really on the right eye number words I don't\nI don't believe I Know for a fact there was not a single pro Trump columnist twenty twenty five columnist of the New York times not one\nHalf the country is pro Trump and not a single column as they could not find a human being\nAs ... take that back reports they could find the human being they would not publish a human being who was pro Trump on the opinion page on the New York times of the New York times so but David Brooks is not a is not on the left\nHe was just ... I Would say just centrist than he's quite anti Trump\nBut he wrote a piece in which he spoke about how beautiful nationalism is that he is a nationalist he's not a global list\nWhich in the New York times that gutsy thing to do of course he spoke about how Donald Trump\nOr is the other uh good nationalist either 'cause otherwise you would be unacceptable to the New York Times' readership defeated also attack\nDonald Trump I'm not saying he's not sincere that I'm fairly telling you if that's what happened\nBut the article the column was a pro nationalism pieces I remember I spent some time on that it's very important the president said he's a nationalist any attack the global lists and he was laughed at CNN and I played the laughter I mean they actually laughed at it\nSo now I what I find even more interesting than the columns or the comments by readers\nSo I Want to read to your show the comments of New York times readers to New York times\nColumn\n... the virtues of nationalism in which he says I Love my nation you know on that and it's a good thing to love your nation and like you know I I feel more for my nation than I Do for another nation just as I feel more for my family than another family\n\nAnd I want other nations to love their nation right all of which I have said very often myself so listen to some of the\nAh some of the letters that are written and again I'll give you updates are with regard to or anything in Florida here with a suspect or the bombing so here's number one ... the times\nPicks may have times picks there were three are\nThere are three a list that's the word three lists\nOf comments that New York times pick list readers pick list and all so this is the times ...\nThat sounds like patriotism to me and there's a difference nationalism is historically been used to know the superiority of the nation\nTo the detriment of other nations in the world community nationalism as arrogance and false pride nationalism can blind citizen to the need for critical thinking at assessing ones country's policy\nSo you see this is this is a big issue this is really really be [noise]\nThe left loads of nationalism that is one of its as fundamental as the left belief in big government is to smash nationalism\nWe will return one eighth Prager seven seven six\nThe relief actors freeze\nTo see a the idea of at Santa Claus can only be wiped out

Santa Claus is white\nOr\nIt doesn't strike me that that is evidence that the person thinks\nThat blacks should be mistreated\nOr is it they are inherently inferior in some way I but tell me I'm very

this isn't one of these overriding important issues nationalism\nSo David Brooks New York times nonetheless this one of the three mile left is Ross Douthat that embraces the funds or the other two has written this column on a nationalism and says I Am a national is not a global is\nWater is necessary for life but you can drown if there's too much water right a few in ingest the water and can't

not intellectually base\nThis is the real shock because it's intellectuals who tend to be left us so you think that there's an intellectual foundation for left his him know\nIntellectuals love left ism but there is no intellectual foundation for the opposition to nationalism is emotional all of left as it is emotional\nIt's a lower thing of the word or created by the Judeo Christian West that's ultimately what it is about\nSo I'm reading to you these comments by New York times readers to David Brooks column where he says I hey I'm I'm a nationalist\nAnd I'm not a global as they got away with it because\nHe also attack Donald Trump otherwise the otherwise you might have felt like he was defending the president and that's not tolerable ... pay the New York times so more comments it's well

of\nTheories about life I have a theory that identities are important to happiness\n\nWith me and I'm thinking of three and there may be more and if you have more or if you defer certainly if you defer one aide Prager seven seven six but first hear what the identities are and they are in no uh in order to report just three identities\nThat I think are\nThey are necessary or they are major additives two worlds happiness but they are not sufficient if this is this a low doesn't make you happy but they are great\nAdditives supplements contribute towards that is the word they're great contribute towards towards happiness or sexual identity male or female a national identity and the religious identity\nI think in my lifetime I have seen that these things are real contributors\nNow the reason I warn you at the outset the trigger is that there are those and I won't even identify them cause it to happiness our want everybody to listen and everybody would be comfortable as possible but there are those who are working\nTo notify those identities and say that they they really are not real and they are not even good\nBook that and therefore I truly truly believe they are contributing to unhappiness in the population by knocking these identities one ape Prager seven seven six so that I Believe that the ...\nComfortable you are with being a woman or being a man being a boy or being a girl and that is that is a serious part of your identity sir I Will be totally autobiographical here I have always been very lucky I admit it always been comfortable with\nBeing mail I've never wants to be a female I've never thought of myself as female I Am truly comfortable and uh I celebrate to ... to ... to whatever extent that his celebrate a boy I Am I my male identity and I want females to do the exact same thing with being female\nI think I mean I I don't know how you can debate that that is a contributor to happiness nobody would argue even the most I Would think\nOf the most ardent defender of the transgendered and I'm not even attacking the transgender on the contrary was not an attack at all but I I Would say that nobody would argue that having gender this for you thinking that you are the other sex\nOr then your biological given sex is not an it's not a source of happiness it may be something that you you you have to deal with and of course it something you have to deal with\nAnd you should try still to maximize your opportunities for happiness in life but it's you've got a really good my reality to argue that that is\nA a not an obstacle at the very least to one's happiness\nWe're one is not comfortable being a male or being a female so that's one identity I identities in fact almost been given a bad name oh he has an identity you that's not that's not good next is a national identity\nI think it contributes to one's happiness to feel part of something larger\nAnd ... and I think uh I think it's terrific I feel very American it has been a major contribution contributor to my happiness\nAnd I uh I celebrate it doesn't mean I think America can do no wrong with some sort of serenity it's like saying I don't think men can do any wrong celebrating the fact that I Am a man\nOr or comfortable with the fact that I'm a man but having an identity more the more I identify as this is my thesis of this happiness our the more you identify with\nThe the greater your chance for happiness and third as your religious identity that is played a major role in my life in my case Judaism being Jewish\nAnd it is for Christians obviously the majority great majority that you're listening obviously you're not Jewish but it doesn't matter or whatever it might be if you're a Mormon if you're if you're Catholic if your Protestant if you're evangelical\nOr whatever it might be what every it it ... it can contribute to your happiness sometimes it contributes to misery all of them can all of them can also contribute to your misery\n... nothing is a guarantee of life\nYou can be a you can be at war with your with your religious identity some people are\n\nWhen I first started radio I was the moderator of a program on ABC at Los Angeles very very very popular show I inherited a very popular show my bragging\nI was the moderator and as a priest a rabbi minister each week different ones each week and then there were members of fourth religions and I\nWould get calls people would call it and I remember how many people called and it was amazing to me so much so that at one time\nThere were so many people who identified themselves as hey Hi Venice so I just want to say to the priest and I'm an ex Catholic or I'm a recovering Catholic and I I I I was amazed I was amazed at how many people still identify themselves that nobody called up to say you know I'm an ex Protestant I'm an ex Jew\nSo ... we had this this I these people were obviously at war with their identity one guy called that he was Ninety\nAnd he was still angry at the nuns who would do is apparently raptors locals with a ruler when he was when he was twelve I told them you know I Am and I'm a Catholic but it seems to me after Seventy eight years you might want to give that up\n\nAnyway I I Know that in my life those three identities religious national and sexual have\nBeen major contributors [noise] and I know that there is a sort of a war against those identities today and I think all that will do is decrease human happiness\nI take your calls eight seven seven to for three triple seven six to happiness our\nProblem is that is pretty good show Springer show\nWell look uh I I hear you I don't want to talk too much politics on the happiness our but I'm not going to deny reality or what what she says is true\nSusan wants to know how you handle it ... the only way to handle it I mean while there are many ways I shouldn't say the only one way to handle it is to find to intrude spirits otherwise you'd be very lonely human being\nBut if it's a challenge dislike injured spirits about New York city isn't that interesting I don't know of course I don't know Susan but as soon as she says she celebrates being a woman being an American and being a Jew I just assumed they knew her politics but interesting\nIt's a very interesting defining element in the ideological rift in America thank you Susan I appreciate that uh ed in Chicago

such a nice thing a father and civil is to make the show in the car I have a very sweet image of of\nThe two of you think you look this is again does transcend specifically the happiness issue\nBut my general approach is to clarify where we differ it comes across as extremely non aggressive totally non defensive\nBoth so you're not defending you and you're not in attacking them just say listen we're you know we're both here to study and we're both students and you know we're good guys and so on and so what I like to do just what I like to do is I like to figure out where it is I I might differ with somebody\nSo then you just you you could ask a if a few questions or a ... and one of them might be you know I celebrate\nBeing American I Wonder do you I celebrate being male this this

August of last year a self identified neo Nazi also a Trump supporter in Charlottesville, Virginia killed a resident of Charlottesville, Virginia Heather Heyer she was not a member of anti thought she was part of the majority of people opposing the neo Nazis\nWho were simply residents of that town or students are parts of religious groups that are coming to stand up to the organized racist\nOr I see the president celebrating and endorsing violence against a journalist in Montana I listen to his antagonistic rhetoric towards his enemies and now we have what appears to be a right wing supporter of the presidents president engaging in a massive assassination effort against\nThose anti antagonistic a critic for the president\nAnd I hear you say that ... is the biggest threat and the liberal

asked them to come on again I gave them plenty of time there were no bombings and then he said he confused me\nThat you play with language my friend the left is a far greater threats of violence in
