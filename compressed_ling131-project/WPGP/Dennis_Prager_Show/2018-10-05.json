you're ready to order this pillow my pillow dot com promo code might gee my pillow dot com promo code my G. two for one right now and also eight hundred nine to eight six oh three for ... my G. [noise]\nThank you so much for spending a this eventful day with us a breaking news addition to the Mike Gallagher show by Monday we're going to know whether judge Kavanaugh is just his cabinet or not joined us then I have a safe weekend [noise] keep fighting the good fight on Mike Gallagher God Bless America [noise]\nWe've been talking about all the things that are up for grabs in November Medicare is on the ballot the government programs dedicated to seniors the one that we've paid into our whole life under attack by the Democrats they call it Medicare for all it's not an idle plan\nWelcome indeed every body and\nThere was a cloture vote in the U.S Senate ... in other words a vote to put the vote 'em the justice\nUp for vote [noise]\nYou cannot closed debate and cloture it's cold\nAnd you cannot extrapolate necessarily from that vote to how they will vote in actuality\nSo you can vote for cloture and then vote against Brett Kavanaugh so there's not a given at all in my mind that\nHe will\nBe\nNominated by the spot or chosen ratified ... confirmed by the U.S so there's not a given I heard and I have to verify heard that a Republican senator from Montana it will be attending his daughters\nAnd he's walking down the aisle on Saturday So that would deprive the Republicans of another vote already Lisa Murkowski she even voted against cloture now it's theoretically possible she would vote for Kavanaugh having voted for cloture but it is unlikely\n\nI just my heart breaks for the man and I don't know what else I can\nTell you I have made my case\nFrom the beginning that it did not deserve the U.S Senate hearing you cannot make a high school accusation that has never been made against any one Republican or Democrat\nWith zero corroboration and have the United States Senate close its functions and an entertainment your\nCharge or it just it wouldn't be done with anything else\nYou know we uh we we saw him in gay I saw him engage in an armed robbery and high school\nI think they would have stopped the U.S Senate for that hearing a fully credible person I saw Brett Kavanaugh engaged in an armed robbery armed robbery when he was a junior in high school\nAnd guess what I can mainly the people who uh who saw him do it then every one of them says I don't know what the person's talking about including one of them who is a best friend of the person making the accusation\nSo why is why did the why does the U.S government shutdown\nWhy does the U.S population preoccupied with one charge from one woman from high school thirty five years ago why and we all know why because we live in the age as stated by\nA professor Alan Dershowitz at Harvard law school a lifelong liberal Democrat Hillary Clinton supporter we live in the age of sexual McCarthyism that is why\n\nI I don't and he said it's darker it's a darker period than that and this is a liberal Democrat but one of the only ... only the only liberals with courage liberals are not leftist but they are but they are very weak\n... except the case and the rare case of an Alan Dershowitz who has told me personally and on film to me you will see it in my movie without um Corolla no sex faces next year\nIt's said to me that he is far more afraid of the left than of the right\n... well listen to it and see he was on with Tucker Carlson Leslie this\nIs the this is sexual McCarthyism right\nI mean think of it ladies and gentleman I Wonder if somebody had said he committed murder in high school whether they would have been a hearing I doubt it you have any corroboration you have a dead body\nYou have witnesses no and no on all counts I'm Sorry\nMurder is the worst thing that a person can engage in nevertheless we can stop the engines of government of the United states of America because one person makes one on corroborated charges murder\nTell me where by analogy is by analogy an improper\nConey tell tell me you are listening tell me why this happened\nOn what grounds were the hearings held say this is what I this is what I said from the beginning I was attacked by conservatives in the Washington Post National Review and elsewhere and I maintain that my original position was correct\nAll these conservatives do uh is feed the beast yes look at what you can do to ruin a man's reputation man who hundreds of women of all backgrounds in of all political persuasion\nHave affirmed it's such a decent man\nI I'm not sure that I have witnessed something like this in my lifetime and we've had this before with Clarence Thomas Clarence Thomas the who is still used as a poster boy for sexual harassment\nAt worst she is accused of talking a mentioning sexual matters in a conversation\nA with a a with a with a ...\n\nUh I I happen to know for the record I happen to think that it's unwise to do I have not done that and I'm not a proponent of it I but I think it needs to be put in perspective\n\nI mean this is is it the statement of a woman cannot even hear talk about sexual matters\nIt is so it is so devastating\nIt is I don't think is a is a affirmative a female strength\nI don't defend it but I I'm Talking about how how awful is it in the perspective of the awfulness of the people are capable of problem is in the United states of America things are so good for so many people\nThat a ... exaggerated view of sin takes place I don't mean religious and secular said\n\nWhen we this is what we have witnessed though the closing down of the machine machinery of government they were willing to go to California\nThe entire Senate Judiciary committee are you aware of that that was their argument will come to you when she said she was afraid of flying they made an offer of going to her\nOr representatives of the committee or not the whole company has some very important to have absolute accuracy on this program but the one who how whatever the number they were willing to go to her and it is because we live in the age of sexual McCarthyism\nJust as Alan Dershowitz put it that's the issue\nBut I I don't think in real McCarthyism in the actual you're in the Nineteen fifties I don't I don't know I I simply don't know I I ... this if one person had said about a Supreme Court nominee I Know he's he's pro communist\nThat's after all what the ... is charged with unfairly characterizing decent people's communists just like we have on fair charging of of people as sexual predators\nYou know how many left wing sites called him a serial rapist you imagine I mean the the man the man must wake up and think how did how did this happen\n\nWhen they Prager seven seven six eight seven seven to for three or triple seven six\nWhat if this is my question to you and you should posed this too if if if ... Kevin or relatives or even willing to talk the remember they are ... mention\nPeople on the left think that they are morally superior and therefore normal rules don't apply like the rules of truth the rules of evidence I Believe women is a statement that truth doesn't\nMatter gender matters not evidence\nPeople go to college in graduate school will say I believe women\nReally I don't believe men just for the record I Believe [noise]\nEvidence [noise] but then again I'm not on the left [noise] and that is Prager however [noise]\nThey'd like you to share your story that like you to email your
