[laughter] it's so simple\nIt's really advice I was sitting down with my clients jak and Ruth and Jackson\nEngineer and so he's you know kind of skeptical and he was a do it yourself or\nAnd I said jak you know where are you getting your advice on how where are you getting your advice I wanted to take Social Security and where are you getting your advice on where's the best place to take your retirement income from so that you don't hurt yourself\nAnd he said well you know I Am kind of do it yourself or but I got a guy I got a guy that's managing a portion of my portfolio but he's not giving me any advice and roofs just kind of rolled arrive she said yeah we don't get anything from\nHe charges to manage this portfolio so I looked at the cost that they were paying\nAnd they were paying the same amount of money that they would pay me but they weren't getting that Social Security advice they weren't getting that advice on how to take their investments out and they were not getting advice\nOn whether they could run out of money or not they did not have that GPS the networks for retirement GPS tells them they went through the whole process with me at no cost\nIt tells them what they should do to make sure that they don't run out of money when Jackson Ruth First came to me they're probability of running out of money was actually pretty high they want to spend a good amount of money and they had just enough to cover that that if they made any mistakes they would run out\nMy GPS in my car tells me where I Am right now in measured their costs measured the risk and it tells me step by step\nHow to get where I Want to be the networks retirement GPS laid out the plan for Jack and Ruth and as an engineer jak really liked the he was laughing he told me the other day he said Beth I'm an engineer but your money and [laughter] I said thanks jak\nWhat about those robo advisers we're talking about advice bat but I'm hearing a lot about robo advisers why not just let one of the robots do all the work well let's look at\nThe good and bad of robo advisers the good is that they're really really cheap [laughter] so what I buy my wardrobe for work you know I'm probably not going to buy the cheap cheap clothes I'm probably going to buy the ones that make me look professional and give me confidence to do a good job\nSo those robo advisers they're not going to call you up when the market takes a a crash like it did just recently they're not going to hold your hand through that and they're not going to protect your spouse when you pass away\nThey're not going to be a trusted ally or a guide you know they're just going to it's a computer program that reacts automatically to things that go on and the market\nYou know sometimes with those robo advisers you can enter certain events in like I'm going to buy a car or the next two years\nBut they're not going to factor in the things that are really important\nTo you when I was talking with Shaq and Ruth I had originally met them in one of my seminars\nAnd I asked them what was important to them about retirement and they said our health they said are they\nAnd they said our family they said our lifestyle and they like to travel that's my favorite too I Love to travel then I looked at them and I said you know nobody in his room mentioned anything about oh the favorite thing that I had a retirement\nIs that mutual fund or that annuity contract you recommended\nThe favorite thing about retirement\nIs what it does for me the favorite thing is the trip I got to take with my grandchildren to Disney World the favorite thing is that I was able to volunteer for my church and the favorite thing is that I'm able to spend time with my grandchildren nobody ever says oh my favorite thing is that mutual fund\nIf you're not getting investment planning along with all the other areas that the American college says\nAre part of your retirement plan make sure you to come and talk with me\nThe other areas that are important is that you have a plan for income and you have an overall plan for taxes you have health planning and if you want to you have plans to leave a legacy you don't just have an idea that you want to leave money to your family you have a salad financial plan in place\nOr you like Jack and Bruce you've got retirement savings but you don't have all the steps laid out\nTo make sure that you use your assets in the most efficient way so you have a better chance are leaving for your family\nIf you're like Jack and Ruth and you don't have that step by step plan\nThat changes with

mean we can afford to have thousands of people pour across our border and enter our country\nIllegally this is the ultimate blame you for President Trump's desire to build a wall and secure our

thinks he's telling the truth\n[laughter] so I always have to correct you know you you're the one who actually wavered on President Trump in the beginning you're the one who had to come along you're the one we had to win over\nAnd for some they still have one we haven't won them over rather they still haven't seen the light they still haven't recognize the extraordinary accomplishments of the first twenty months that the two pieces I have in front of me one by Fred Barnes over Weekly Standard and the other one by John Dempsey\nAbout how Trump has read the Republican Party from the media I Want to start with a few I Want to start with the red Orange Beach over some facts because I like to argue with knowledge I Want to make sure that as you vote as you encourage your neighbors devote as you get ready to go to the polls\nDon't believe the lie\nUpper rocked Obama\nSets the groundwork for this tremendous economy that we're enjoying right now Fred Barnes says in his column ... is a must read we're going to posted it Mike online dot com if you want to read it read Barnes rights but rock Obama is a proud men\nAnd it was somewhat in Deering when he ... to to claim he had created the ground on which Trump's economy was growing the media sided with Obama no surprise\nTrump counter punch no surprise there either if the Democrats won the election twenty sixteen Trump said GDP which was about one percent and going down would have been minus four percent instead of up four point two percent Trump tweeted\nHe's referring before point two percent he's referring to the growth rate was the second quarter of twenty Eighteen\nI opened up our beautiful economic engine with regulation in tax cuts are system was choking and would have been made worse still plenty to do read Barnes writes the Weekly Standard Donald Trump is correct about the condition of the economy and late twenties sixteen it was weakening\nThe shift in economic policy to the right change the direction of growth from down to up\nThat's what tax cuts deliver and tax hikes\nDo not use the Fred Barnes writes about Obama and this lie that Obama is the reason for today's economy and again it spread puts it Obama's proud man\nIt's kind of in Deering that he had such a head makes such a silly plane here are some facts ... Obama's successor Trump and the Republican Congress reverse Obama's policies\nThe fact is Obama had to struggle so hard to spur the economy and allow it to grow more than two percent a year that was the high watermark the bronco bomb in the last quarter of Obama's presidency growth pitch swept to one point five percent\nIt's obvious what Obama's problem was he had the wrong policy will watch of wrong policies from the day Trump was elected we've had a more real best robust economy\nNearly four million jobs have been at it for a million jobs unemployment is up to the lowest point in nearly a half century Fred Barnes says let's compare what Obama did with Trump\nWhat he's doing Obama raised taxes Trump cuts that Obama was a regulatory sell it Trump is passionate about deregulation Obama's clean Power Plan killed the coal industry Trump is reviving it\nObama downgraded the role of entrepreneurs and free markets in boost the economy and lauded the wonderful things government does Obama's biggest biggest breakthrough as we know\nWas the Affordable CARE Act a big step toward a single payer government run health care system Trump got rid of the individual mandate that forced everyone defy expensive insurance or be fine a big step toward a return to free markets in health care\nBill the entire Obama economic agenda was systematically reverse says economics writer Stephen Moore\nHis new book Trump ... we've got to get even more and Arthur Laffer laughs on the show one of these days presidents loved it out there are cheap it trumps case\nA White House report issued recently said it was a bit of stretching had produced two hundred and eighty nine accomplishments in twenty months we all know Trump exaggerates brags read Barnes rights but many of the economic gains were impressive\nEspecially the fact that job openings out numbered job seekers for the first time on record being liberal himself Obama relied on liberal economists they let him astray\nAs they did president John Kennedy in the Nineteen sixties they favored higher taxes to they favored increased spending\nThose policies created an economic downturn but Kennedy was smarter than Obama\nSays Fred he finally turned to his Republican treasury secretary she Douglas Dylan who recommended tax cuts JFK grabbed on to them and the result was an economic boom the roaring sixties rankings advisors persuaded him the tax cuts champion by Jack Kemp\nWould do far more for the economy the spending cuts\nThey even use JFK's as an example the sweeping tax cuts of Nineteen eighty one brought about years have strong growth notice the\nReagan Revolution Trump didn't need to be convinced obviously he and Republicans led by Paul Ryan believed it was time for deep cuts in the corporate tax rate the Obamas school of economists\nAnd commentators embarrassed by anemic results argued that economic growth was stuck perhaps permanently at two percent annually\nThat met Obama was doing the best any president do certainly far better than Trump would have done right\nAll kinds of dire predictions Washington Post said Trump could destroy the world economy Jason firemen chairman of Obama's council of economic advisors said Trump's budget assumes three percent annual growth that is extremely unlikely\nI live in Dallas yeah we have all this thing yeah yeah I I don't I think we're in a different time they'll Laura I really feel okay this is a different time where people are fed up I I don't I ...
