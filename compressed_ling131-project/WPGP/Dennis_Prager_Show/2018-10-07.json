take it up for elective things like may be asked to surgery it has to be for qualified medical costs\nSo another way that you can protect yourself is by having enough surplus income\nTo cover health expenses and here's what I mean by that I've met with people in the past you know and kind of comes to mind a lady named Linda she said yeah I have exactly what I Need for retirement I Need forty five hundred dollars a month\nI have enough to cover forty five hundred dollars a month\nI says into what happens if something happens to you what if you you know have a car accident or you have a health issue and you need to pay for more so you set yourself up to live with\nIn your means so what we did was her was make sure that she was able to produce more income from her savings that she didn't need Jews able to set that money aside and some of it she was able to just let accumulate in your town\nIt can be really stressful to live month to month or paycheck to paycheck\nLet's get that stress out of your retirement life which I'm it should be as free from stress as possible so form a strategy that can cover your regular living expenses and have extra money to pay for health expenses\nIf you want to make sure that you have enough money in retirement that you're comfortable that you set yourself up to live well within your means and have extra money\nCalled me at eight hundred Seventy five to nine eight eight and we'll sit down and talk we have offices in Robinson and also our main office here in South point both of them easily accessible off of interstate Seventy nine\nHere's my number is eight hundred seven to five to nine eight eight if you have at least two hundred thousand dollars to invest make sure that you protect your retirement savings call me an eight hundred Seventy five to nine ... ...\n... don't forget to check that out go to bat the Andrews dot info that's bath Andrews that I and ... oh that's not life insurance is that something we should consider oh yeah especially\nIf you're retired and you want to make sure that you take care of a family member so that could be taking care of a spouse or can be taking care of your children when you're gone so life insurance can be very versatile it can be used for to produce\nIncome for you now you have to watch out you have to structure it properly\nOr it can be used to provide a tax free benefit to somebody when you die that's exactly right it's a tax free death benefit now you may have to pay estate taxes on it so in Pennsylvania\nFour and a half percent if you're direct child or direct descendent\nAnd it can be higher if it's a brother or a non related person\nAnd so you get to get the death benefit of a life insurance tax free but you gotta watch out for a little bit of a state taxes but it's a big deal when you think about one person passing away maybe your pension doesn't pay the full amount to your spouse when you pass away maybe they only get half of\nThat and you have to Social Security's in a household\nOne Social Security goes away when somebody passes away the lower of the to Social Security goes away so that means in order to pay for that the remaining spouse may have to draw from attack civil account so that makes their taxes go up\nI remember my husband comes home one day and he said he was that your grandmother's house and\nYeah grandma she's Ninety One years old and she was out there pulling me out of the mud I got my truck stuck in their money and she got her truck out drove me right out of the mud go grandma\nSo if your life expectancy is Ninety One and everybody lives until that happy old age that's a wonderful thing I remember my grandparents having fun when they're in their nineties but what if you don't\nYou know everybody says oh yeah I'm not going to live to lady fiber I Am going to live until Ninety five\nWhat if you don't you got to make sure that you plan and so if you want to make sure that the life ... sure its policy that you have is right for you or if you should buy more life insurance make sure you talk with a qualify financial planner that uses life insurance as part of overall planning\nThat we're just about a time for today and the five major risk that we discussed are pretty big but the solutions you gave to help us protect our retirement assets they do seem a little bit more manageable somehow so any final thoughts yeah\nGet the retirement GPS\nGet that plan make sure that it's personal to youth customize\nYou know you can have a lot of money and make big mistakes and then it doesn't seem like you have quite as much money\nThe big mistakes are running out of money in retirement not addressing year healthcare concern not addressing taxes make sure you put those all as part of your big picture so at the beginning of the show we asked if there was one magic pill or one shot or one vaccination\nThat could solve all your retirement knees in really that one big pill is the networks retirement GPS\nIf you're paying someone to manage your money for you and they're only doing that they're only talking about your investments and they're not talking about legacy planning or protection for your spouse or they're not talking about tax planning and putting that year by year strategy in place for you\nMake sure you get your money's worth it's a very frequent that people pay the same amount of money to me and sometimes even less that they're paying to their investment adviser and with the previous guy they weren't getting overall planning no tax plan no long term care plan to\nMake sure you get the most for your money make sure you get all of the planning that you deserve for you and your family so that you can protect yourself and protect the ones you love\nWe used the networks retirement GPS to measure where you are and that includes risk that includes the quality of your investment so if you've got stuff in place that's really good we want to make sure that we leave that alone we don't want to disrupt everything\nBut if you have money that's not working hard for you then move your money to us we'll manage it for you and will manage it in the context of an overall plant not just how are your investments doing but how is your overall life\nDoing people don't come back to me years and years later and thanked me for that one you to monitor that one new to you that
