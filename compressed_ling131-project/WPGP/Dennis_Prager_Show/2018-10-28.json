the category where people need to take income\nFrom their tax deferred accounts IRAs four oh one case for freebies\nThe government forces you to take money out of those accounts when you turn aged Seventy so you want to have a place set up ahead of time that makes sense for that you don't want to wait till the last minute you want to make sure that you set that up a head at times so two things having an emergency fund and having a court income account\nOkay that's so ... what about annuities you know these are insurance products I think they do get a bad rap some time but they certainly have evolved over the years I Wonder if some of that that negative publicity is just a simple lack of understanding the oh it\nDefinitely is a lack of understanding by the people that purchase it and oftentimes a lack of understanding by the people that sell it\nThere's different types of annuities and he got to make sure that you have the right type of annuity you want to have the ones that are backed by legal reserves not the ones that just float around with the market then you also want to make sure that your annuity is cost effective\nSome annuities out there take the rap for all of the bad press because they're the ones who was really really high expenses\nAnd people here that on the radio or they might see the full page ads that say I hate annuities and you should do and the reason that they're saying annuities are bad is because they have high fees\nBut in reality only some annuities have high fees and not all of them as a matter of fact the one that I recommend have very low fees especially when you compare them to an overall brokerage account\nSo the key is to make sure that you have the right account that fits your individual situation you benefit from working with a specialist and make sure that you work with a specialist in the area that you are\nQuite honestly if you are thirty five years old and you're putting your children through college and saving for that\nI'm not the right financial professional for you\nI work specifically with people that are developing sources of retirement income and that have recently retired\nI'm an income planning specialist for retirement income\nMake sure that your financial professional fits you and that you understand everything that you're buying keep in mind annuities offer many very good benefits but you also have to understand that they're not liquid accounts they satisfy the need for income\nAnd they don't satisfy the need for liquidity so don't use the wrong tool for the job make sure that you use the right tool for the job now Annan Tony wanted to make sure that they were set so that they could just focused first on their grandchild coming into the world pretty soon\nAnd not worry about money every single month\nIf you want that security of having a plan that is set up so that you have an income no matter what\nThey call me an eight hundred seven to five to nine eight eight there's also lots of information on my website ... dot info if you have at least two hundred thousand dollars to save for retirement\nCall me right now we're live will answer the phone where it eight hundred seven to five to nine eight eight\nOkay so ... we're talking about risk you know what about just as simple last way to help control risk and retirement is there a way to make sure that our retirement plan is strong and can whether any storm that comes our way\nYeah so risk are really kind of uncontrolled and sometimes they're really unpredictable we can't predict the markets or the interest rates we don't know if we're going to get sick early in life or if we're going to be healthy until age is Ninety nine\nBut what we can do is we can focus on what we can control so with that in mind and going to go back to the first thing that I said in this in this hour find the right financial professional\nFind someone that you trust and it's easy to work with instill that you can actually implement the strategies that you've got\nNow when Annan Tony came into my office they came in and they had sort of a partial financial plan and it was all focused on brokerage accounts and mutual funds and a few alternative investments and it was written out and it was about\nTwo hundred page document and they plotted on my desk and they said what do we do is this\nYour financial plan has to be easy to understand and easy to implement\nI help implement things for my clients I manage money for my client when you're choosing that financial professional you gotta make sure that you're working with somebody that's going to actually help you get things done having that two hundred page financial plan\nWell it really looked impressive it was pretty thick and heavy was a solid book but when they plop down onto my table I said did you actually read through it and they said well we started to and I said did you actually do any of the things in that plan and they said no\nWe just got so bogged down in the details that we were never able to do that I think it's important that everything is documented in that you have all the charts and graphs and strategies and things but at the end of the day you got to make sure that you can implement it here's what's in the Andrews retirement GPS\nI've got all those strategies and charts and graphs\nAnd all those those that verbiage that gives you the tools to put things into place and at the end of the plan it comes down to two pages the first page is a\nRetirement income plan and it shows you step by step where to take your retirement income from it how to take it at what time and then the last page and the whole plan is the one that people go to first it's a bucket strategy\nPerhaps I should move up to the front page and skip all that but I make sure that everything is documented my clients are all great\nI wanted to mention the fact that half of my business comes from referrals that really means is very much to me it means that my clients have the right financial professional in place they trust me enough to refer the people that they care about\nIf you want to get that Anders retirement GPS in place for you in a well thought
