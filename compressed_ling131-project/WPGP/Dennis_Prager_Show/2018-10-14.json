D I why mentality maybe to save money on fees are commissions good idea a bad idea\nWell if you only look at fees and you don't look at it in the context you for your whole entire situation yeah you get lower fees don't let those lower cost allow you to leave your self exposed to making huge mistakes\nYou guys think about what's at stake here you've worked so hard for that money now and my experience people who try to do it themselves they manage their own money\nThey often end up hurting themselves in that hurts me because sometimes they come to me and then they come back like the couple that had nine hundred thousand\nNow all of a sudden they only have four hundred thousand\nI have found with out a financial professional a person can easily pay much more in taxes you know they might be paying unnecessary fees and they're more likely to run out of money during retirement that is scary\nSo ultimately then that Laskey you shared helping maximize our retirement assets part of it could be not to cut corners when it comes to handling your assets\nYeah that's exactly right and that's really a good way to say don't cut corners you've got too much money at stake and the benefits of working with a financial professional\nHave been shown time and time again you know you remember that Tom Cruise movie where he was talking to the girl and you say here's your chances of living with me\nAnd here's your chances of living without me with me without me I kinda think that applies to me no I definitely think that applies to me with me you're going to have a lot more confidence and clarity about not running out of money making decisions\nRegarding spending in retirement people who don't know how much they can spend are fearful of bending that's not a good\nWay to retire people the overspend are under ... been create a lot of stress for themselves and I can see that when people come to me that have never met me before and they've been trying to do it all by themselves\nSo you know if you're doing it yourself or if you're using one of those robo advisers one of those on line computer advisors\nYou don't have a person who cares about you\nKnow I talk about my client experience I Love my clients and I'm very careful who I Choose to come and joined me as a client if my sperm\nAnd therefore I've got people that care about their families they care about not making mistakes they want to be good stewards of their money\nI make sure that I invite my clients to come in dying with me on a regular basis because that way they get to know my other clients it's also a really comfortable way for a new person to become a client if my first\nSo here's what that looks like often someone will meet with me for the first time and they'll say yeah but I liked it\nHow do I get started and I say well would it be nice for you to talk with some of my other clients so we do wine tastings we do luncheon learns where we just had pizza or we do fancy Christmas dinners\nAll of those events are part of my client culture part of my client experience\nAnd so when I come to trust you as my client and you come to trust me as your advisor\nI think it's very
