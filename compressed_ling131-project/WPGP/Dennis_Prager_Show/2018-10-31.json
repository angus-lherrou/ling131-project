anything's taboo it's only because\nWe're on free radio so it's pretty rare but it does happen the other is I'm neither a fan of men or women there are a wonderful\nMan and the wonderful women and awful men and awful women and they're pretty much\nI Would say ... ... be much the same proportions same fractions of their sex\nSo welcoming deed to the show today's topic\nIs one that just noise at me and I want to bounce off you\nThe messages that we give to young women and have by the way since I was in college so this is not new\nYou should pursue career and that should be the primary concern\nThat you have\nAs a young woman and\nYou've been not as a young woman as you as you get into your thirties which is still relatively young\nYoung young\nAnd you know or somebody a good band comes along that's fine that's great if you're\nRunning says throwaway but that's not where you're\nAttentions and effort should be directed they should be directed toward a fulfilling career a successful career which means making as much money as possible is what the word successful generally connotes unfortunately but it does\nSo I Am curious if you are a woman who followed that advice\nAnd you know more or less single minded leap pursued career success was that good for you in the long run\nSecondarily I'm asking what do you think we should say to young women because I'll tell you what I Would say to a woman\nThis is the prime time for you to find a good man you should be at least as concerned with that as you are with career success\nThat's why I asked her why the way the phone number is one eighth Prager seven seven six eight seven seven to for three triple seven six that's why I asked young women\nWhen I meet them so often a waitress or even somebody sitting next to them with the airplane\nAnywhere wherever the opportunity arises I have no difficulty effect they love speak to strangers so relevant to me so I'll say hey can I ask you how old are you this is a a twenty five of the perfect so here's my question\nAnd some of you heard of this all ready and the question is if you could ... be guaranteed one of two things which guarantee would you take I always tell them is no right answer I'm just I Want to know how you think\nAnd I also tell them that even though one is guaranteed that doesn't mean the other camp happened it just means only one is guaranteed so if you could be guaranteed a great career or great marriage which Garin tea or would you choose a that's the way I put\nSo\nThat's my question one eighth Prager seven seven six so they're really to\nWell one is what if you're a woman what message did you get and what did you follow in this regard\nTo what do you think the message should be too young women because I Know what the messages societal message is pursue\nPursue a vocation pursue a career\nAnd you know for a white man comes along well that's just great that's by the way that's often how they put it to me I'll say well the the ... you're you're looking forward to getting married or do you you're says look you know the right man comes along and that'll be fine\nIt's not either\nThey're not telling me the whole truth and they really would like to get married or they really think that it's not that important\nAnd I think that society I look I'll tell you where I'm coming from I think you know what else to say that the way I think that society has played with terrible trick on you know women and has since I was a young man this is not new with all\nThis this is part of the transformation of society that took place in the late sixties and then the seventies it it was the the dream of most American girls\nWas about their wedding\nThis was mocked out of existence for a young ... high school girls to save the day you know I I periodically just badge and my wedding\nAnd it's very exciting to me what I'll wear and who will be there and who the man will be and what it will be like that ... a girl who said that today she wouldn't say to her ...\n\nIt's been it's been so to speak it's been embarrassed out of existence\n\nNo ... I saw at an airport been so many airports in the last week and a half I don't remember which city was but different airport every day\nThere was a big a big billboard you know they have these ads up an airport some airports\nSo there was one and it was something I Wish I took a picture of it so I'm so bad at memorizing these things so showed a young woman interestingly the young woman was wearing a sort of I think I'm a Muslim type a scarf over her head\nAnd she was not white she was not black so I think I think it would have been at a Middle Eastern origin attractive woman young woman with a scarf overhead but that's not critical and just describing it to you and the message was something\nTo the effect you should both read history and make history something to that effect so I was thinking at the very well what if we put up\nWe being Prager you what if we put up a bill I didn't even tell this to anybody Prager you 'cause they would think I was out of my mind but I this is while I was thinking how about a one in ... in almost the same configuration of a young woman\nAnd something like something to the effect I don't have the words yet but something to the effect\nIf you find a good man\nMarry him\nThat will ultimately bring you more joy than career\n\nAnd I have do I have no problem with women careers I mean we we have a woman\nWho CEO of a trigger you who is indispensable so well aware of the contribution that a woman could make but for the most part I Would still make this by the way she would agree she's uh she's married and she has what three
