Gallagher and God Bless America [noise]\nCrucial message about life insurance a third of the people don't have life insurance card to buy it's complicated\nPulled the president this prior to the I don't know when ... was it made clear several months ago Romney so they're speculation as to why she leaving because of course nothing could actually happen\nFor overly innocuous reasons seems to me that two years in the United nations\nOr one should be up for a monument somewhere in the capital especially if you're confronted the bad guys of the world is Nikki Haley has and that was done by during the eight years abroad Obama\nAnd keeping true to\nMajor left wing attitude toward life you when you don't fight this is an ancient soul music phrase those who are cruel to the crime or a better those who were calling\nCrew will be cruel to the kind\n\nThat is a motto of our dear fellow citizens of the left that liberals but on the left and that is that\nThey are kind to the cruel like the Iranian regime and they are cruel to the kind like Israel\nThat's a perfect pitch truly a perfect example there was something truly sick\nThere's a there's a morality of the conscience for those who were kinder to Iran than to Israel or to Hezbollah or to some us or to all of them\nNikki Haley has been extraordinary at the United nations Donald Trump has been extraordinary at the United nations after all the United nations ambassador reflect the will of the president of the United states\nI repeat that the risk of\nWhat is the risk that I think of it what is the risk in my saying that the U.S far the president of the United states has been a great president\n...\nWell the risk is that you alienate those who hate the president but I have a model with regard to that I adopted this when I ... in my first full time job and I was\n... the director of a Jewish Institute in California that's why I moved from New York to California in my twenties to direct this Institute\nThey had weekend retreats it's gorgeous facility thirty two hundred acres and they had\nThis summer sessions for young people and I would advocate God's existence and I would advocate\nObservance of the laws in the Bible and so on and some members of the board were very afraid of my advocacy of God's existence and observance of the laws of the Bible and so on and\nThey uh they would say to me and then not not now with hatred or anything like that are just they would be worried and they would say you know you'll alienate some of the people who come and I developed a great phrase that has guided me you can't alienate the alienated they already were really needed [laughter]\nThat's why they showed up [laughter] so but I you know a friend beg that covers a buddy treated the weekend or whatever\nSo you know I'll alienates people by saying that the president of the United states has been great that's far I don't think that those people have already not been alienated\nI guess that's all it takes is is a favorable word of a mere vote for Republican and you're pro rape you understand how sick it has become there are no limits to what the left will say there are no moral limits to what they will do or say\nWho is this person who tweeted out that the thick of it you know do something for the good guys and that somebody should take out Brett Kavanaugh\nA teacher it was a teacher at\nA special ed teacher in Minnesota and and so this is one cracks me up a so was this on a Facebook account or a tweet so Twitter has decided to suspend this person's account suspend\nYou have ...

people in the country\nI\nI don't read many tweets but I read I read his my wife showed that shows them to me\nIt's an it's an extraordinary thing\nSo anyway ah he has been great it is an astonishing thing I Do worry I admit it or would like to let me come on if the ball Street Journal here yeah I I admit it\nI'm just saying I worry\nWhat do you think that because I support the president I have a bans in critical fault and I may be wrong by the way I was just telling you I'm worried I'm telling you I oppose what he's doing but I Am worried U.S China strains deep and and I will there is only one reason one\nThat I Am worried about us China relations you know what it might be\n\nI don't think the Chinese would invade Taiwan\nNotes but Taiwan so good guess North Korea\nI think that if China says to Kim Jong un\nDon't continue or the nuclear as a nation of ... than he won't he's too reliant on China I that's China's way of holding us hostage is is North Korea there is no no no other\nSo that's the reason I worry about that that China has abused the world Trade Organization that it is abused intellectual property\nIt's I I personally of worry more about China's at about Russia or for a whole host of reasons I and I think the Chinese nationalism is growing at ...

I mean most people who like him understand that but I think a lot of people on the fence trying to think of him out and I really thought first of all with all this hour notice in our time the bitter sour left you know\nA ... banging on the Supreme Court door and shrieking like devil's and and behaving like children this madness first of all\nWe need to have\nSome humor and to celebrate what is

read asterisk until [laughter] I Love our Saturday that that isn't that a lot of truth in those burn out that's exactly right so\nSo we created a fable it's called Donald drained the swamp it's about a caveman name Donald okay hall the cave people are angry because they say the king king lives in the middle of a swamp and he never he's totally out of touch with us he doesn't know about our concerns\nWe can't even talk to him because the swamp people up protect him he will only talked to people who live in the swamp what do we do so they go to Donald Donald is the kind of a famous caveman he's a builder of caves everybody wants to have built by Donald\nUh and so they go to Donald Donald can you help us are they telling us that the situation is as well tomorrow you know I've got some time I'll go down to the swamp and see what's going on so we take a walk down to the swamp encounters a first swamp creature\nA lobbyist ... and the lobbyists or a says you don't understand you can't talk to the king the king doesn't talk to people who live outside the swamp he only just be living inside and so I'm so if you want to live in this one maybe they can work something out dumped has not interested I'll see you later so he goes back and tells\nThe cave people he says listen it's worse than we thought were gonna have to get drastic and he said they said what do you mean drastic to use as we are going to have to drain the swamp and they kind of get scared like you can't say that don't that don't say that the\nAnd he says I don't know if the only way and if you will how are you going to do it you didn't get a swamp people angry and he goes well you're angry aren't you and they say yes\nAnd he says well maybe it's their turn so the next day he decides I'm going to dig a trench either builder he knows how to do this all this time and I want to try and Mexico is not going to pay for it\nBut he says we are going to build the biggest or the ... trench we've ever dug and so he goes by himself with a shovel down to the swamp now the swamp creatures come out one of them looks\nA little bit like Chuck Schumer one of them might look like Hillary Clinton\nI'm not being specific about that often so do you yeah the artist that when you when you look at it you can figure out who these people are but but they get angry they said we live here ... and and he says ... ... where we live you you can live or where we live and they say we don't wanna live outside the swamp the people that signed a swamp\nAre uneducated they're on cultured they're deplorable and he understands that you know what only needs to do is dig the trench and ignore these creatures so he starts to dig the trench and as he is taking the trench he sees that the swamp green color the swamp is actually the color of money why\nBecause the whole swamp is money that's why the swamp creatures will not leave\nThe swamp so he starts digging and then the biggest bad a swamp creature ball shows up and he's angry\nThe biggest bad a swamp creature of all is called\nThe George Soros\nAnd the Georgia sources really angry the has bags under his other than the he looks Hungarian and he looks like a billionaire\nBut but the Georgia ... is really angry but Donald turns around and all of the gay people have shown up with shovels and they say well not as angry as we are and they help him dig the trench dig the trench during the swamp drained it was one of the rest of the way okay I Want to have to buy it for the incredible credible but but at the end of the book\nThere is a true teaching moment about what is self government what does it mean for people to govern themselves with American style self government\nDonald rises to the occasion and he refuses to be the new king he says no no no a free people govern themselves and that is very exciting so they so he says if you're looking for a president not a King I'm your caveman\nWashington gentleman ladies listeners think about the

because he has written a book this is\nCraig has this ... this is ... you and it's the books you must read before\nBefore the elections including mine but here to talk about Jesus is a reason David

ultimate goal is to inspire people to read the word of God itself the Bible and you'll see all these stories in the Bible told and rich detail in the book a\nLot of exciting stuff ship raccoon for our
