it the honorable America say Murray and two thousand and ten and I served him faithfully for five years until I was terminated in January of two thousand and fifty\nOkay is this whole story your whole story is a great American story and it's a great story of public service and success how how is it you ended up whether you are say or terminate you\nWere fired was it wasn't because of something that happened in the line of duty what was it that led to your firing\nWell a a year prior to my termination I had published a book that I had written on my own time and self publish for Chris Jimmy and the book is called\nWho told you that you were neck and if the question that got ask Adam in the garden to eat and ... and I say that because a lot of people don't connect that question of where it genesis chapter three birth eleven so\nAh so the book is titled who tells you that your neck it overcome the stronghold of condemnation and uh so that happened a year before I was suspended ah but the reason why I was terminated was cause I spent a few paragraphs explaining God's purpose for sex\nAnd marriage and that God created a sex for procreation and and and for the pleasure between a husband and why and how they match 'em on it and that any sex outside of that a is a thin and ultimately that's what cost me my childhood dream come true fairy tale career\nOK Now let's get this straight you have these opinions with your opinions and literally hundreds of millions of Americans share and you weren't trying to impose these opinions on some of your men and the fire department where you\nKnow are not at all so it it was the fact is you self published a book you hadn't use public funds what business is it of the city\nOf Atlanta or the mayor of the city council or anybody or what the fire chief does on his personal time as long as it's not disgraceful what was the argument for using a passage in your book to ruin your career\nWhere their position was that those physicians those views conflict it with the city views are and that I can have those views as much as I Want but when I was an employee of the city\nOr I had an obligation to check those beliefs that the door is what one council members fit and the mayor clearly supported that dish\nOkay at this point uh this I think most people are listening to us or slapping therefore has I think this is just clearly unjust and when people suffer injustice or discrimination\nOr a really an assault against their religious liberties or freedom of conscience who you're going to call not Ghostbusters you call the alliance defending freedom and David Portman attorney for the IDF\nOh what did the ... du what did you do a a ballot achieve conference case\nIt was it was quite remarkable when she first contacted us because we thought like you were saying this can't be true\nOf this can happen in America someone writes a religious book for for Christian man a Bible study and on his own time and and don't forget for for for what to happen here people would have have taken received a voluntarily the hundred and sixty two page book take it home\n... hours a day to read it\nFind one small portion to be offended by in the in the one\nHundred and sixty two page book go back to work and say hey I was offended by this and then you end up with the chief being fired okay we're going to we're not honestly\nLike everyone else

they didn't agree with that too so I didn't I didn't quite understand that but we filed a lawsuit on behalf of the chief the good news is\nA is that we argue that the policy they actually required prior permission so they told the cheap afterward that oh no you can't write a book on your own time for a bottle study unless you get prior permission from the city and the city allows you to do so\nWe challenge that as being unconstitutional his only prior permission needed is the first amendment and the judge ruled with us [noise]\nUm so that the judge ruled in favor of the cheap and now

pulls\nIssue to sixteen times you're not going to have any other outcome than that one and the videotape the tape\nConfirmed it these body cameras on these dash cameras often vindicate officers but if an officer\nErrors if he makes a mistake there's going to be accountability for that police officers know that\nThat I think Fifteen times or ... whatever it was it was a ... or ...

I Wonder how many times an officer now is going to be a beaten or killed because it happened in South Carolina Greenville South Carolina there was a they had a policy about not being able to pull your weapon out of a holster and they were chasing the guy and the guy turned around and ambush the young officer shot him dead\nUh it's uh that's one of the perils of police work and and police know that ultimately though\nOn balance it's better to have a video recording of it\nSo that the officer can be vindicated which is Ninety nine percent of the time [noise]\nAgain Baskin victory but don't stop

celebration twenty four seven three sixty five\nThe self loathing of in western civilization that the left is brought about his past the logic like I I mean it's passed a logic Brett Kavanaugh was sworn in this weekend\nAnd my heart breaks for the man my heart just breaks for the man\nI just want to ask those who who are\nAngry that he was sworn in let us imagine for a moment that he didn't do what he did what he is alleged to have done in high school and high school what's a match and he didn't do you feel sorry for him\nSee this is like this is a question like the one that I posed the atheists when I Know I my dealing with someone with intellectual honesty I ask atheist do you hope you are right or role\n\nIn out if they Athie says of course I Hope I'm wrong\nIf you think I Hope there's an afterlife you think I Hope this ultimate justice you think I don't hope his ultimate meaning you think I Hope I'm just a glitch in in a universe that could you know as much\nConcern for me as it does for pebble on Jupiter of course I Hope there's a God but I just have concluded that there isn't I respect that atheist\nBoth the atheist says I Hope I'm right\nI Hope there is nothing is oblivion for eternity okay that I have to say I don't find that person has thought through honestly\nLikewise here if you can't feel sorry I'm the assumption I making the assumption that he didn't do what he's alleged to have done in high school do you feel sorry for the man\nI Would say the vast majority of people on the left not liberals but on the left do not feel would not feel sorry for the man because there's a meanness that pervades left isn't\nThat what is it one didn't somebody tweet from the Stephen ... show or what was that again Oh yes at least we ruined his life\nThat's that's true that's their aim aim is to ruin the lives of those they differ with that makes them feel good\n\nYou know I might disdain for Hillary Clinton is analogous to the to stay in the left is for Brett Kavanaugh let's say but I I don't want to ruin her life I I it doesn't even occur to me as a desire or a joy I have no desire to ruin her life\n\nOr I don't know I don't even know it doesn't it's not

conservative unquote government please unfriendly that's in caps\nI have always prided myself on my willingness to be fair to be bipartisan and to be open to new ideas I enjoy friendships that are diverse but this isn't about politics or political parties anymore this is about values and the divide between mine and yours\nYou cannot hide between the rhetoric of family values liberty pursuit of justice limited government personal responsibility the importance of less government intervention business the role of government to provide people the freedom necessary to pursue their own goals\nTo push agendas that are too my value system\nUnkind hostile on charitable on Christian self aggrandizing ruin this to our collective environment damaging to the community as a whole corrupt self enriching greedy mask the uncivil prejudicial sexist racist and or homophobic\nThere you go\nThat's the list\nSo none of this family values or the pursuit of justice limited government President Trump's building for the most government intervention the ... the ride the feet of misery to pursue their own goals none of that stuff\nWhen the truth is you are simply corrupt self enriching greedy nasty ... that's it that's the year ... year a deplorable\nThe Gulf between mind values and yours is not political at this human that's I agree with that the Gulf between the left in the novel left is human\nNot political I agree with this woman the values you stand for not the ones with which I was raised that's correct we stand for totally different values than you on the left the I told you folks it's unpredictable the Gulf\nEither America wins or the left wing\nFriend is described as a person with whom one has a bond of mutual affection without mutual values mutual affection is impossible it's time to stop the charade well that's see that's what I don't agree with\n\nI I I Would not an friend a friend who who was on the left\nIn fact I Would treasure the fact that they still remain different\nI don't understand so you see what the ... this is the problem by definition that conservative so despicable human you can't even be on my Facebook page you can even be a friend on
