Spartacus moment but Booker uh the the the shouting over the chairman but by the Democratic senator from California ... down the list Harris I mean\nPeople the under you know the degree to which they are willing to exploit Dr Ford manipulate her keep her letter hitting spraying it at the last minute maximized public relations um people got a sense that\nYou know these people are really bad and I think that the ... the mass cars continue to come off as we've seen more and more bad statements you more and more bad comments on the third thing that happened was all of a sudden particularly center racist\nPeople realized oh yeah this is a team sports and so somebody like ... who had been desperately trying to convince people in Tennessee than it was a moderate they looked up and they said wait a second you're going to vote for Schumer\nWell you're in a modern if you're going to look for sure what the latest polls that just came out this week show high camp for example down sixteen points no nobody and she's a very very\nCompetent a political figures she's very good campaigner than the very long track record in North Dakota nobody would have guessed she'd be down sixteen points\nAnd everywhere you turn now racist that the Democrats thought they were going to win a ... who very very tight um you know early voting we're seeing a Republicans are doing very well know again I don't I don't want to draw any any conclusion we still have almost two weeks\nAnd two weeks out I think Donald Trump would have lost\nBut he was gaining votes every single day\nRight and we keep gaining boats every single day and frankly a caravan is is a is a huge burden for the Democrats that they just can't I think answer to that and I think among suburban a woman who have been one of the real weaknesses for Trump\nBecause they think about him is Thirteen gangs and they think about cartels and they think about a lawlessness\nAnd seven thousand people determined to break the law I think they mean Democrats and come back to the Republicans are in a much greater numbers and people would have just a month ago\nIs just me or does it feel you you're talking about prominent Democrats and the missteps of the last month or so I mean you could go to Elizabeth Warren and her bizarre\nA decision to release this DNA test and create a whole wave of of ridicule and scorn or the mob violence we're seeing we're seeing a Heidi Heitkamp I mean for crying out loud she she tells the world she was ready to vote yes on Kavanaugh\nUntil she watched his testimony with the sound turned off\nAnd she didn't like his facial expressions doesn't it feel like the Democrats are a bit like the gang that couldn't shoot straight\nI I think that a huge problem I think their their base so far less now\nAnd the energy of their base and hatred that their base has for Trump is so intense yeah but they're surrounded all day by people who are giving them signals uh that don't work in the normal world\nAnd so you know comments like I'm sure that that when the former attorney general said when the Republicans are down a Republican go low we kick kick him I'm sure in that immediate crowd they liked it\nBut for the rest of the country it it was a little sobering to have somebody who's been chief law enforcement officer United States\nSuggesting that Republicans ought to get checked right and it comes to

say\nI'd like to establish where our perceptions of reality begin to defer when they have to start at some point with similarity so where do they fear\nSo for example do do you acknowledge that\nIn

number industry so my first question is\nWhat ... what\nThe left in\nA in Latin America half the game with this caravan maybe or I Want to be more precise me BJ miscalculated it seems to me and I think to a fair number of Democrats ... only helping the Republicans\nAbsolutely and I think there was a greatness calculation um you know especially if they were trying to affect\nUs election or U.S policy and for example with ally in Honduras and and you get a great explanation of that history with ally and it's basically an ongoing war with the current government and it's basically this continuous battle with the current government\nBut the destabilizing Central America stabilizes our ability it it drives risk in our relationship we saw that they you know the United states government and the Guatemalan government have a very strong relationship\nBut when you have this well a migration coming across their border and remember they're much more like the European Union a lot of people in the United states don't understand that the Central America allows people to flow freely from Honduras Nicaragua back and forth you know to various theories in Central America\nThat it's so they can't really just close the border down if people have their paperwork\nSo what the Guatemalan government was doing while I was there if they had buses ready to go they were explaining to the people that have United States is not going to let you in that the Mexican government that this is a very dangerous journey and there were some children there that they had been lied to police hit on the bus let us get you back home\nLet it get you back home safely now of course the organizers of the group we're talking against that now we're moving forward we're going forward\nBut Guatemala was able to actually return nearly according to their their calculation around thirty nine hundred to pour thousand people back to Honduras\nThe problem however Dennis with that once the Caribbean started moving moving through Guatemala moving to Mexico and moving into Mexico more and more people were joining end so now you have it swelled to estimates right now are like fourteen thousand\nCreating a

part of the current American situation you may recall the people who wants to to remove Andrew Jackson from a twenty dollar bill is probably the most controversial though everybody now for the left his controversial who lived\nBefore them are so that's not telling you much but we have a scholar on here professor of history and American studies would Hillsdale College Bradley ... just written a new book\nWhich I Will be reading 'cause I I'm just finishing my sheer coincidence in very very very very very very very long\nBook I'm Andrew Jackson and I'm real interested in the American president and general and so on Bradley ... professor of history the book is in defense of Andrew Jackson and professor welcome to the dentist Prager show\nDennis Hi thank you so much for having me on great author\nThat's very kind of you to say I am honored so the ... the the indictment of Andrew Jackson is I think largely over his treatment of American Indians is that fair to say\nYeah I think that's probably at least since the late Nineteen sixties that's been the great critique of the ...\nAnd of course that's kind of deep into all kinds of culture and especially the textbooks that our children are reading so yeah that that's where it came from and generally the other thing that people will argue about but definitely the Indians problem is the main problem that comes up with him\nRight so what is your defense\nTall [laughter] what a great question [laughter] especially since I have a book titled that it\nWas just I agree it's a little unfair yeah\nAny well it is and it's also kind of one of those titles that that we've touched me at the age\nRight [laughter] right exactly\nBut you know there are a lot of things I think we could say about Jack the terms of putting into the contacts when it comes to the actual Indian removal I think that the tensions were good but the way that it played out was\nHorrible certainly it would be very difficult to argue that the way that these were removed from the southern states all the way to Oklahoma and Kansas that this was just in any way it was pretty brutal and I think there's a fault jak then it's more that one piece at the process\nWas in of course I Am I understand ready to go to commercial but the point I wanted to make was dead at the time Jackson was actually considered as a moderate on the issue of American indian some people that really\nWent after him for being as they would have called it an American Indian water and the reason was because as president as he's\nReally cutting costs cutting the budget which he did very effectively he also was laying out tons of money for the removal of the ... they're resettled in West there were a lot of people who thought why is Jackson spending money of\nWhite people so that read people could settle in these great areas on the great plains\nI it was really sought after land so Jackson at the time so different from the day and as you say we have no moral knew what the certainly the left at the at the time it was a really complicated issue in Jackson was very worried\nWithout question he was worried that\nThe whites and blacks would have very very high procreate a birth rate that they were just going to destroy the Indian culture simply by surrounding them in al populating them so removal to the western territories was a way to actually protect the Indian cultures at least if he thought now the again the execution up it was horrible\nBut his intention I think was generally a good one\n[noise]\nThat that's fascinating and that's one of the book or is it important books now you don't only defend him on the Indian issue you have a general defense of Andrew Jackson\n[noise] you know it's one of the things I found so I think we all do that and it's true that Jackson was an incredibly violent man there's just no way around that I in every way he was but he also had really certain rules\nSo that violence never ever could be applied to women or children that was the same actually for blacks as well as for India at the white get a deep respect strangely enough or beautiful enough yet it's strange interesting respect that women are buried deep respect\nTo the point actually he's almost ... times anti traits again Indian women as well as black woman or white wearing very very well\nBut the other thing I found about him so he's got this violence but he's got this ethic that's really interesting but I also found Dennis and you know counter so many current politicians the guy was just\nUnbelievably honest in everything he did and I think it would it kill his soul to have done something that would have been misleading or dishonest that that's how much\nStickler was about living out this deep deep profound honesty and integrity really quite stunning\nHow did he get the I I ... how did he get his a bullet wound\nOh well so we get a couple of getting quite a few good things in a number of Jules\nBack he had been a preteen and the team and a Thirteen year old you thought in the American revolution along with his brother and they had actually been captured in Jackson during imprisonment mouth off to a British soldier\nSword Hilton it's stored and actually beat in Jackson's goal\nOr even at Phil Jackson died a dope male they'll lay a finger in that spoke grief\nAnd it wouldn't be actually even with the rest of the school that's how deep it was that's the kind of thing ... would never forget by any means but I'm sure you were thinking\nBy the way I I we have very little time but I bought an older from you such a scholar and folks you really should read this book I Can't wait to read this or is it is it fair to say and totally different with beef it isn't he hated the British more than he hated Indians\nI don't think there's any question about that this is yeah you just didn't cross Andrew Jackson an edge because that soldier did that go ahead\nJack ... ever apple yeah that's what I thought you are a delight and the folks the book is in defense of Andrew Jackson scrupulously honest guys you can see the joy to speak to him\nAnd will do it again and ah go to prayer for Hillsdale about ...\nAll right everybody I Am not
