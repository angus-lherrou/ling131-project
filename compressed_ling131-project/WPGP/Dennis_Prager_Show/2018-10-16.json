were deeply unhappy with the idea that mutation and selection as creative power the opening talk at the conference by ... leading Austrian evolutionary biologist\nEnumerated several key what he called explanatory deficit of the modern version of Darwin's theory neo Darwinism or a number of the the the deficits that he enumerated were things that I had written on at length in my own book Darwin's doubt\nThis bombing the the royal\nSociety what is the ... the royal society of London it was started by Robert Boyle Newton was one of its first president we yeah yeah\nJust reading about them yesterday okay so they that's incredible that you had a conference on the weaknesses of the traditional Darwinian explanation where where most\nIf not all of the talks where we're exploring some new mechanisms that could supplement compliment replace\nThe standard mutation selection mechanism the odd thing about the conference however was that uh there were a group of of ah what they called themselves third way people they don't want to associate with those of us who are um supportive of intelligent design and that is a growing number of scientists by the way\nA and but they reject standard near Darwinism so they're looking for another approach they have a there was a one group of scientists has known as the uh Alton Berg sixteen and one of the scientists who was involved in that who helped call the conference declared at the end of this Royal Society conference\nThat it was interesting but it was characterized by a lack of momentous in is\nIn other words they did a good job of critiquing the neo Darwinian mechanism but nothing really was offered to solve this problem because they rejected rejected out out of hand intelligent any sign and guidance any any any right mind or purpose in in in the process by our eye for rises\nSo where those flaws might be and then the issue of reconciling if possible God and this and evolution my guests Dr Steven Meyer director of the center for science and culture of the discovery Institute in Seattle now edited the is the\nEvolution thing for me\n... when I hear you say this I'm thinking of all the\n... pre eminent scientists of the last hundred years\nWho have believed what you now say is not tenable what does that say if you are right why does that say about scientists\nThat science like uh every other form of human endeavor can be subject to groupthink\nOr to ... uh or it can be influenced by prior ideological commitments in particular in the debate about biological origins there's a prior commitment to a materialistic approach to the question it's codified in a principle known as methodological naturalism\nAnd it says it if you're going to be a true scientist\nYou have to limit yourself to strictly materialistic explanations for everything not just how nature ordinarily operates\nWhich will be quite sensible but where in nature itself came from\nAnd that principle Ben precludes the possibility of a ... a precludes consideration of designing intelligence and yet what did we discovered at the foundation of life we discovered digital code\nA Bill Gates the our local hero in ah in in the Seattle area says the DNA is like a software program will be much more complex than anything we've ever device but where does software come from it comes to my mind we have all sorts of indications of intelligence um\nActivity at the foundation of life we've got digital code we have a a complex information processing system we have nano technology miniature machines that are a mind blowing in their integrated complexity we've got circuitry controlling the expression of genetic information\nAnd know persuasive Darwinian explanation has been offered for any of this type of complexity the integrated or organizational complexity at\nThe ... fleet all some aberration was born and it prosper it because it was better than the previous ... a ...\nA a ... a plausible theory in the nineteenth century was formulated by Darwin before we knew about the complexity of life at the microscopic and molecular level\nUh in the wake of that theory of a a principle of reasoning was codified among scientists namely that we must limit ourselves to materialistic ... explanations of the kind that Darwin a promulgated and then as the evidence from the Nineteen fifties sixties and write to the president has begun to stack up\nEvidence that would in any other realm of experience point to a designing intelligence that the principal of methodological naturalism has prevented many scientists
