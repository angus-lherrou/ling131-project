{"month": "10", "state": "PA", "station": "WPGP", "content": "I was chairman for half a decade of the GOP as state party and we know by data and also by looking at our legislature were split halfway down the middle and so when that happens that's not an indication of a\nOf a deep blue state where a purple state and and ...\nBy the way and this is one of the important things that if you actually when the Senate race\nOr that could turn out enough Republicans to flip both houses of the state legislature 'cause it's one vote in the Senate and what is it one one now yeah oh and so what would change one seat there and it makes a world of difference I'm Sorry go ahead says on there that he\nLiterally right if we have our voters vote all the way up and down the ballot\nA that is exactly what's going to happen and the other thing that people don't realize is there an awful lot of good Democrats\nWho have become very disenchanted with their party there not socialists [noise]\nThey don't want this new vision that has been so articulated by the Seattle's city council\nA lot of your listeners around the country heard about that head tax that they passed and that we were ridiculed across the country for it because they were going to fight homelessness by basically forcing employers to lay people off\nBecause they couldn't afford to pay to head tax to the city and that's the kind of crazy ridiculous taxation that people in this state are fed up with\nAnd and your opponent is on record of wanting higher tax rates\nAbsolutely and she voted against that tax cuts and jobs bill she said she would rescinded a there is like all these big government Democrats there is not attack they don't love it's another way to get people's money\nAnd the people in this country are seeing a new way and that thanks to Donald Trump kind of doing with his policies are what hasn't been done in a very long time and I particularly loved in our state and across the country that unemployment rates are so low for our ethnic and minority communities\nAnd um I again you're you're running a very vigorous campaign you're out there all the time you you can't match I'm Maria in terms of money I mean she's been there three full terms in the U.S Senate um what's ... what would be your first priority if you actually one thing\nWell we have a lot of priorities in this state and a lot of people may not realize that we were inundated with for its fire smoke based on very bad policies that keep us from clearing out the under brash and getting rid of that gender or it's ready to explode the moment there's a forest fire we have had\nCatastrophic forest fires in our federal forest and that's got to change and that's one of the first things I Would do\nAnother thing is we are really hurting when it comes to transportation because our state is so a poorly respected in the halls of power we have very little cloud to bring home any kind of money from the federal government and I said I can bring home that the federal dollars for infrastructure that my opponent has been unable to do was harshly\n'cause you can work with the Trump Administration actually and and but also partially because I think you share with the Trump Administration a desire to move as to fixing our roads rather than building new ... trains as our friend taught Herman refers to them yes uh that actually go nowhere\nExactly you know we're on the cusp of a very exciting time in transportation a cleaner cars and and the ability to use a a phone app to find a drivers and writers in order to a double and triple up in car pools like we've never seen before you know a kind of an ...\nVersion of transportation for the commute and there are so many new innovative things that are coming down the road it's just a shame to use the phrase it's just a shame that we spend so much time wasting billions of dollars on a\nOn not getting our folks to and from work and back home to visit with their families for the rest of the day so I'm I feel very strongly about if there there's another thing that really affects all of that and this is nationwide it's bringing down the cost of higher education\nAnd we know the federal government has had a major role in increasing those costs and uh we've got to step in the time has come and it's an issue that I think all of that around the country are going to be working on\nAnd what are what are some of the promising ways you could bring down the ridiculous cost of higher education\nWell the the biggest one is that a federal use of of loans or that has allowed the cost of the universities to go skyrocketing\nNo of course with the federal government under writing all all of these loans including for people who just go for a year or two and don't even have a college degree to show for it we're speaking with Susan Hutchison\nShe is a Republican for US Senate go to a Susan for Senate dot com to read about this important race [noise]\nSo

the number one issue in America and even though we're up here in the northwest corner of the country\nThey really care about it because it is a national security issue and that so the people that I

decade\nOf doing this it has been a real privilege you can keep in touch with me and see where I Am on the air next on my Web page at the mark I must show dot com where you can email me following me on Facebook or Twitter\nOr leave me a message with a question or comment that we can perhaps respond to on the air as always you can keep in touch with me I mentioned this specifically they hold email mark has thirty well dot com M. A. R. K.\nI. S. L. E. R. at AOL dot com which many of you've done over the years and I really appreciate the fact that if you check those sites you'll find out where else I appear besides filling in for Dennis prayer or Larry Elder as I did last friday but what a privilege to be able to fill in for both the gentleman\nAlthough I must admit I intentionally use Facebook and Twitter much let's now I don't think I ever barely touched Twitter anymore you know how far left and biased they are\nThe thing with you know you get in touch with people you have known for years or seen for years of her from but I don't know it's so clear what side of the spectrum there on and that makes a difference\n[noise] but in the news you at where I've heard about the ... murders at a Pittsburgh synagogue it's hard to imagine that you go pray and be with your God and your fellow worshipers and you were murdered purely because of your face\nIt it's just incredible not unlike when you go to your church and you were murdered purely because of your skin color or your threaten or attempted murder is committed because of your political persuasion\nThey all have one thing in common\nThey make no sense except when you understand there's evil in the world committed by evil and deranged people\nThat the people are not born good and listen to seems to be a battle with those who are I don't know religious from those of us who are secular\nAnd if people are left to their own devices can commit terrible crimes\nAs would genocide or slavery so from the very beginning you write we teach our children that you know not every toys they're taught I always love it when you go to a party and um it's your kids or someone else's birth to part of the kid goes and he your kid once every toy\nThat the birthday kid has because they haven't been taught right they grow up selfish everything is about them when\nThey're babies everybody's a doting on them and falling all over them so that's a key difference certainly between\nI think not only the religious and secular but the left in the right the people are not basically good cause you hear all the time with the left that oh you know you got to be understanding of the murder or you got to be understanding of that background and stuff oh yeah there there's a real issue about whether\nThe people would be good if left to their own devices and what is Dennis always called something about the Germans tribes I think an Eighteenth century\nOr they were so powerful and committed such evil and that the answer was because they could\n[noise] so it's important to have guardrail were good behaviors are defined and bad behaviors are outlawed outlawed or even more importantly prohibited by by a guy\nThat you'll have to answer to that that is so crucial because if you don't think\nThere is something or somebody that we have to answer to win this was all over it than anything goes right\nInto your own moral compass that counts and yeah there are a lot of good people that have good morality and you know they would never hurt anybody but I don't trust that I that otherwise you would never get slavery otherwise you would never get genocide\nYou can't leave people to their own devices so that's why we have laws but even more importantly if you think there's a good job that you're going to answer to win this is all over I think that produces ... much better rate I think it's obvious\nUh so that's why I say boy could behaviors are defined them bad behaviors or outlawed or prohibited by a God that you have to answer to it [noise]\nSo what do we have we had fathers and mothers and sisters and brothers and sons and daughters they did not come home Saturday\nYou know you you are you ... and you think you have some sanctuary to use that phrase and that and what was his two brothers I mean I I Can't even watch or\nListen to the details 'cause it's too depressing and a lot of them older right it is just that you know they go about their business they don't bother anybody else\nAnd purely because of their religion\nThey are murdered by an evil guy who made it very clear right is anti Semitic you all Jews should be a\nKilled I guess is what he's you know I'm paraphrasing what was going on purely because I I think he was upset because they were uh\nYou know part of a group that was helping immigrants come into this country even illegal immigrants and you'll hear my position I'm sure of during the day about illegal immigration\nOne could be outraged about politics and not do what antifa does not do what the pipe bomb or does whatever side he wants of being on it it looks like he was on the you know the other side but who knows it doesn't matter evil is evil matter what you want to say\nBut it's hard to imagine the pain of it all but I Will you know the difference Dennis ... leave religious discussion for him when he when he gets back\nNo one's better than Dennis on that in my opinion\nBut I sure hope that there is good God waiting for them\nAnd that's family members can find some solace that way I Want to know your thoughts at one a Prager seven seven six but the worst part is probably not the worst part worst part is what happened to these people but I mean uh and I don't mind issue here\nIs what the media and others have tried to do to blame Donald Trump\nThat he's a he's the atmosphere that he has not only accept it but uh you know in some way encourage\nHas led to evil as if it's first of all as if it's only on our side right they conveniently forget Steve ... and and that the guy there it was a Bernie Sanders supporter as I remember and he he committed total mayhem right if not for the Capitol police that happened to be there with some of the congressmen he would have wiped them all out\nLet alone Steve's police who you know almost succumb to his injuries but to do and I saw it all over the place that was a a yeah former Obama official interviewed on Fox News let alone to the guy didn't even challenge from the news host on the weekend didn't even challenged him\nWhen he said oh you know comes from the top down and the kinds of things he says and it kind of things he encourages his supporters to do that's why we have this kind of\nWhat's been going on for ever\nNot to mention that and and you certainly uh you can't just blame the president for any particular supporter of his that commits may whether it's the pipe bomber\nOr in fact been this guy I think winds up being anti Trump my right he's ... he's on the other side it doesn't matter\nThere have to get the president at every turn whatever he does is got to be bad and it's part of the you know he he's the worst president never should have been elected uh he's evil he's a bumbling fools all those characterizations they hate him with a passion\nSo everything that happened to this country that is bad\nIs President Trump's fault and everything that happens that is good that's president bones credit to his credit if you don't believe that just ask and he'll tell you that\nSo this is what we have going on and you you can't avoid politics even in something so awful here and even in some of the rabbis there was a march\nIn my neck of the woods and um the San Fernando valley and you could just hear it oh it's it's the spirit of the country and its encourage Mitt to this kind of thing from the even if they didn't say his name you know who they were talking about and I know what happened\nI bet you all of you out there knew that it would happen that one way or another they were going to blame him for anything that happened including people who are against him none of it matters\nAnd we'll get into this later I I think in this first I Want to talk about the media and the press oh what they've done to this press and butter relates here relates here to these family members um that will never come home again because of the anti Semitism\nLook this is the greatest country in the history of the world but there are going to be evil people in it they're all going to be crazy people there are going to be this is what I say a two blacks who save is a you know hatred and bigotry against them and\nUh the racism in this country yeah you you can't outlawed you can't get rid of it totally they're always going to be people like that\nAnd there's nothing you can do you just ... and here's the other thing in this horrible incident luck luck plays a a a lot in life that if the you know I think some there's always someone who doesn't go for some reason and then they have to think the rest of their lives why wasn't of my time so\nIt it it's very difficult as I said and you you can't imagine what these family members are going through um ... it and it's not just them into the remember the black church where the guy comes into whatever his name was any it just kills people because they're black which is meaningless being black tells you nothing about someone\nOr being Jewish tells you nothing about their values and who they are being Christian right Christians are under attack ... country that's the one group that it seems to be okay you can attack them you can get away with it right 'cause it's okay in this country\nIt's it's very depressing and that's the leaves me back to politics that's why they have President Trump so much because he's willing to stand up for a stand up for our values\nUm say things the way they are which is what we've been waiting for forever for Republicans to have some courage so of course the left the liberals the media it's all the same thing to me of course there outrage with one course he's responsible for everything bad there's nothing you can do that's good\nBecause he's just evil it\nDoes you always on the other side of the planet on these issues let me know what you think when a prayer seven seven six mark Iceland\nNot unlike her husband who didn't go to jail for lying under oath of course the press doesn't do that they made it into you know he had this affair was an intern so because of sex that's why people wanted him to go you know he lied under oath you don't have a system in in court if you can get away with lying under oath\nAnd the idea that this one set of rules for the Clintons and another set for the rest of us so lock her up is not by any means and incitement to violence\nThe other charge that President Trump calls the media the fake media and they get especially in order to what the charge that they are the enemy that people there'd be on the media is beyond outrage they really get on their high horse for that one and they were beyond offended\nBut it's also legitimate the press not infrequently comes out with stories that are not true the latest example did you hear this one NBC was hiding ... story evidence in reference to the charges by Julie sweat Nick and her sleazy porn lawyer\nThat's Tucker Carlson is named for him and it's it's just one it's a good one [noise]\nIt seems NBC knew that you did they even support her lawyers characterization of his claims that you saw Kavanaugh spike drinks or engage in gang rape you didn't hear that John\nI think I got something on Shawn he didn't hear that bit of news yeah this so called serious offense is not outraged if you examine it from President Trump's respective or many of his supporters\nThe media is huge power to influence the course of events and the public's perception of events so if they're no longer object the reporters and apart a sense of the left which they have become\nThey will influence the people in a way that profoundly affect public policy to the detriment of shows so for example out talking about and the next our legal immigration debate with the media showing heart wrenching stories of children being ripped away from their mother\nNever mentioned the fact that none of this would happen if the mothers didn't bring them here in the first place you never hear that or the more salient fact perhaps that whenever somebody is guilty of a crime catch list that children are also so called ripped away from them when their parents go to jail\nThe children as far as I Know never go to jail along with their mother a father\nHow come that's hardly ever Porter by the mainstream media so it can be put in perspective by the viewer or listener\nSo the media shape the debate even in their use of the term undocumented well she was on Fox News even though he more picked on them\nAnd saw at all it's all they lacked the proper documents to come to this country or your house or take your bank accounts they just don't have the right documents\nSo of course many people never hear the other side of issues if the press barely reports him so in that sense they're an enemy of the people because they're denying all the facts to the people and not allowing them to make their own decisions let me know what you think I think this is a big part of the ship he's right\nLet me know what you're saying one a predator seven

goes on April ... anti Trump life than I was the anti Obama 'cause I think what about like far enough on here\nBut it doesn't matter because you can't you know unless you're blaming him so yeah you you can't be responsible for re lunatic just like I don't want Bernie Sanders to be responsible for the guy who supported him who tried to murder those congressmen you can't make\nYeah go ahead\nWell Bernie Sanders never encouraged to do anything violent or what has\nHe has really really I missed it wasn't that he encouraged people to commit violence\nThat we've had you know when people aren't getting punched and our house right here at our core cheese\nGet him out of here doesn't me to commit violence\nThat's not encouraging people to commit violence you know you can get them out of here

President Trump is not going to pay his court fees and never what it reminds me and I appreciate your challenge it reminds me when Trump was saying to their own memories that the Russians I Wish you would hack Hillary's emails some or he was kidding\nBut you guys on the left can't even take a joke you know why because you guys don't have a sense of humor for the most part\nBy the way I've I've ... I've got to cite examples as dense which say\nTalk radio on the left is just about never made it in one of the reasons I Believe just because they don't have a sense of humor 'cause this thing is not just about information it's also about to either way that treats people ... entertain them some way not only not staying the facts I'm not trying to put them together\nBut everything would you oh he encouraged him you know I I I could cite examples of other presidents that have said things that certainly weren't the most peaceful things in the world what about even Hillary lately saying we can't be civil anymore into we get rid of the Republican administration oh that is not encouraging people to do something\nI think you see it on one side let's go to\n... low in Torrance, California Iran with mark\nMark any doing well I'm\nNot a it's not really a boat or anything but just a clarification I Believe that the president the term uh said when he was ... for you you need it equally said

that's correct I assume you're saying if the way\nIt is but it wouldn't matter either way because even if he said they're an enemy the people I I kind of agree with him if they're not going to be with him it's not going to be objective in a report the news in an objective way\nAnd then you're influencing people and you're not alone with the people in this republic to make a decision about who to

kind of evolved into a people blaming certainly the media\nAnd of course the Democrats left it's all the same thing these days blaming President Trump for the ... bomber blaming President Trump for the shootings at the temple it never ceases to amaze me that everything that goes on that's bad it's his fault\nAnd um even in the most serious charges against and the one I think that most if ended up being the press is that the people\nThat depression is the enemy the people which I think they are because they don't report the news objectively and that was basic to our founding that there'd be a free press a new reporting the facts and not giving into government figures that they agreed with and make\nIt easier like they did on President Obama and by the way speaking of President Obama he said some awful things to that could incite people like me normally come that her people like make sure that we have that clip let's play it shouldn't\nHow\n\nNo no no\n[noise] so why isn't that inciting people to violence you see how he says so passionately and in the anger and his voice as ... people on my side let alone President Trump that were against people based on how they look or how they pray daily\nWhen did that first happened I didn't I must have missed or where in where he is looking for the compassionate Republicans right he really needs to Republicans that don't stand up for themselves but I Love the last one because I was going to talk about illegal immigration in this hour\nRipping immigrant children not notice not illegal immigrants but we're the immigrant children\nAnd and talking about from the cold cells bringing them out of the arms the mothers or fathers and and you know however you put a I'm paraphrasing\nAnd they wind up in a in a coal sell how isn't that incitement on his side for something but yeah you do that to children away from their parents we better do something about how come when he does it it's okay\nHow come when he he actually is lying about our position\nWorst President Trump blind I Want you to point that out in terms of\nLeaving them in a cold sell\nCars that makes me pretty angry how come it's not on their side\nThat's ... that's okay when they do but it's only President Trump you he's seen the visceral hatred for this president\nAnd as I mentioned Larry show friday you know the reason for it is because we finally have a Republican who standing up to the other side who doesn't let them get away with anything\nLook like you I I'm not thrilled with everything he says is Denis says you get the total package with everybody but the fact is they hate him they hate him with a passion because finally someone standing up to them that's what I think someone is really not letting them get away with it\nI remember John McCain to do anything about personal balmy he didn't want people to even mention the fact\nThat he may have been you know the way he talked about America should I Apologize and I've you know the issue about where he was born I get that one but you can't say anything about President Obama that was sacrilegious so to speak but it's okay you if you want to say about President Trump is okay and the press is complicit with this\nSo yeah on my side you can't say anything but on the other side you could do what you want and it was very hard I got to tell you it was very hard for me as the ... last quarter last hour said even some Jewish leaders I shouldn't say\nAnd what a surprise most of them are on the left to say oh the climate from the top down that's what you're doing that's what's creating madman well let me tell you if I was a little over the edge what President Obama did good maybe if I was a crazy evil person may be pushed me over the edge\nHow can you compare that mark how could you say that a president bombers just as great guy right it's like he never lied he never set up straw ... like you said immigrant children it's not immigrant children and how come it's not mentioned that when people go to jail their kids are taken away from them because people don't want you to know that\nThat you don't want to have that kind of compares\nLet me know what you think when a Prager seven seven six I'm hearing is live in a pain free relief factor dot com studios and let me get to your calls and rabbi Diane I'm not sure if it's a different take her not rabbi Dan you're on with mark\nAnd mark how are you real\nGood I'm active trying to make a comment in response to the previous caller\nAnd I'm often looks like some people get up from the Jewish community and say that the ... their colors to the president has ended up there just represent the Jewish community and unfortunately people often think that the name of it was that you wanted to do\nWith the more traditional Jewish ... ... ... ... we are great appreciation cook has done for the country and for the state of Israel all moving the embassy\nUm everything with the UN um it's it's just an

have to cook for the community where I live we have in your system nothing is perfect\nBut you can't get in and they got on the box without going you got a good way to go to ... have a ... it in ... and by the office and it's an unfortunate reality of life in America we\nWell thank you rabbi down I appreciate very much and I forgot that right we should mention that he's got orthodox or grandchildren but certainly the idea that he's anti\nSemitic yeah they put that on them at the beginning also doesn't matter if you have some on the air everything goes none of it matters\nLet's go to Peggy in Chicago Peggy you're talking with mark you know\nI don't work I I heard this and I mean I just want oh my God how come the oppressor and over the I I heard that public health isn't department the department of public health\nIs actually very very concerned not panicked but right on the borderline they said that these people that are coming across and if you know the\nThing ... migrants are coming over or not checked for disease they are carrying inside the antibiotic resistant TB TV was a scourge in this country\nAnd therefore scourge until you're in an antibiotics to check it and it's tough it's resistant to it we're opening our borders to people who are very sick they are some of 'em are like typhoid Mary show no symptoms but they'll carry the disease here and public health can

A. R. K. I. S. L. E. R. at AOL dot com\nAnd if you check those sites you'll find out where else I appear besides filling in for Dennis Prager force I differ Larry Elder last friday\nIn this hour you can continue to talk about some of the things we've been talking about\nThe last few hours but I said I wanted to talk about illegal immigration especially with the caravan approaching I've talked about illegal immigration for over Twenty years now and I've never wavered in my position the issue is really not that difficult if you acknowledge the simple fact\nThat people across the border illegally have come here legally as one caller pointed out which one of those on the other side do not want to call them illegal immigrants let alone illegal aliens so you have to term undocumented immigrants as if the only problem is they don't have documents as if they miss place them somewhere or lost them\nBecause if you acknowledge their coming here legally the argument might be quickly over\nIf there are legal that they're not allowed to be here and a story\nIf you own a home in someone tries to enter without your permission you would call the police to make sure they did get to go in\nThey wouldn't be able to say they belonged in your home but they just lack the proper documents similarly if someone walked into your bank and wants to take the money out of your account they would be asked to prove that it is their account if they said it was their account but they just didn't have the documents to prove that the banks would not permit them access\nWhich is why it's so ludicrous for the left to use the phrase on document\nAs if they are entitled to your house and bank account if only they could find a misplaced documents\nFor years now that that the left as one of the argument over language whether it's undocumented versus illegal livable wage versus minimum wage global warming or climate change or whatever it is the moment\nBut the left is much better to finding the terms and using the language to their benefit of course that helps heaven media on your side perpetuating these false it's so so those on our side or off and on the defensive even though they're explaining the office\nAnd the most recent case being parents with children\nTrying to get asylum if that's really the case if they're not just coming in for the benefits of work and President Trump and Republicans accuse you heard President Obama last hour we had the clip of him of ripping children from the mother's arms and putting these children in cold cages\nNever mind that this was started under the Obama administration\nHe has more I mean that would be the right word than anybody I Know President Trump and Republicans are on the defensive never mind that if the parents of these children didn't come to the border in the first place there would be no issue\nNo one's forcing them to come here they made a voluntary choice and we have a right to our sovereignty and to protect our borders and to decide who is welcome to enter just like we do with our homes\nBut the left the Democrats and the media often the same thing do not believe in sovereignty but rather they believed in open borders but they don't like to admit it because they know they would lose the argument\nWhich is why they would rather talk about tearing children out of their mother's arms never mind that when anyone does something illegal and their hold off to jail they'll their children do not go with them to jail they're also then so to speak torn away from them\nAnd the ... in the latest reincarnation of this conflict hundreds of Hondurans another legals are heading to the U.S border in a mass migration to seek asylum\nThat was no doubt my my name is Thirteen and other people who would do us harm or among them so again President Trump the Republicans will be on the defensive just because they want to defend our borders and the media no doubt about it will again show Ukraine children and distraught mothers\nBut no one is forcing them to come here and we have a right as I said to decide who gets the entire country or a house and under what circumstances\nOther things we have a right to protect the American people from harm where the from terrorism or as one caller mentioned last hour disease or even for that matter to make sure that people come here is a radical concept share our values\nAnd just about every country does this including our neighbor immediately to the south Mexico\nSome of us think this is so obvious but there have been huge forces arrayed against this common sense I mentioned it last hour the Democrats won more votes in the country club Republicans want cheap labor of course the Republicans are also the stupid party that's my party I Know\nSo you have people like George W. Bush remember this and Karl Rove saying things like Bush got up to forty percent of the Hispanic vote when he ran in Texas wonderful I'm not a math major but that seems like a formula for defeat\nA loss in politics is sixty to forty percent is huge and that's based on optimistic assumption most of the ... illegal immigrants come here for jobs as we've long established but they also take advantage of government handouts that the rest of us are paying for and the Republican Party can never out to the Democrats in offering better give it up\nSo here's a phrase I've used over the years if ever given a choice between Democrats and Democrats\nThey always choose the real thing\nWho are these people going to vote for it's not that hard to figure out\nAnd if left unchecked Republicans will never win a national election again\nSo even even on a purely selfish basis for those in the conservative side it is clear that we need to control the border but how about fairness for everybody\nWhat do you say to people around the world who have been waiting many years to get here but I have to undergo long waits and she bought a natural paperwork even have a chance of getting here\nSo they have to follow the rules but those are dash across the border do not\nWhich is why a border wall makes sense among other tools one color on a different radio network when I was on a week or so ago suggested that border walls don't work in the long run\nBut even if that were true I told him I bet they work in the short run to stop mass of people coming here don't you wish we had a border now as we will are going to be confronted with these people in short time not to mention these really live safe for murder by their ...\nWe need we need to clean this mess up and have an orderly procedure for coming into our country and I don't mean with a comprehensive immigration plan that has been signed onto better public as like Bush George W. Bush or Paul Ryan no amnesty and no pathway to citizenship should be accepted that rewards illegal behavior\nBut there to those who say the border wall won't work\nThey use the same or ... I mentioned this that the defenders of illegals murdering innocent Americans use and I had to be in the last summer when they say the documents commit oh he said the court challenge we have they committed mass murder no it's not like the argument or have they commit fewer crimes percentage wise the Native Americans\nWho cares even if that is true\nIf an American is killed or harmed by an illegal immigrant that person would not have been hurt if that illegal had been denied entry in the first place no matter what the percentage and that wall preventing one Hamas murderers in Israel for mentoring would have said that Israelis life the logic of the\nThe arguments is baffling unless you realize they have no real argument unless you change the words and the terms for example how can you ever justify sanctuary cities where criminal illegals are given safe harbor\nYou come up with so many arguments like illegals will not cooperate with the authorities you've heard this if they know they can be apprehended are sent home\nBut how about not allowing them to come in the first place and then we wouldn't care if they cooperated with authorities how can you ever justify harboring criminals who commit crimes and native born Americans have no asylum from\nYou change the debate to the evil police officers in ice who have the audacity to arrest people who commit crimes so the rest of us have to live with long waits at hospitals deteriorating schools and intolerable traffic while the elites often live behind walls in their gated communities\nSo what's my solution I said I Would give it to you take away the benefits like free health care and preschools you force strict penalties against businesses which one of you mentioned that hire illegals even sending some see CEOs to jail\nAnd you would be amazed at how many illegal immigrants would return home Romney had it right but he used the wrong language there we go again when he said self deport we keep losing the language war to the left\nBut I Would then say that those who remain I'd be willing to have a conversation with because they would stay for the right reasons\nAnd for heaven's sake please enough of the government sending out the wrong message with bilingual education classes were bilingual government documents\nOur country is United bites language and it's shared values English is our language and immigrants need to learn the language our history and our values\nAs I said her ancestors kiss the ground when they landed at Ellis Island as barks said one of the colors last hour they didn't come here for free benefits they didn't come here for free hospital care free schools\nThey didn't come here for any of that it was so happy to be in the land of freedom so let's build that wall and do everything to end illegal immigration and take our country back tell me what you're thinking one a prayer seven seven sings I'm Mark ... filling in for Dennis and Dennis Springer show\nBut nobody ever mentions it or not otherwise law abiding it's simply a mill my daughter was actually a victim of a I D theft by illegal aliens using her\nThe number was re stole choose a child mhm so I don't know why the conservatives Republicans don't push back on this whole illegal thing oh by by describing what's happening here in internally when people come into work\n[noise] [noise] yeah just a one one of the many problems with this whole thing it just seems obvious to me\nThere's got to be an orderly procedure that how someone gets into a country we call that legal immigration you have a plan that makes sense you give the opportunity to to the people you want to give the opportunity to\nIt seems so obvious to me and that's why you have to have when the language war because otherwise they put it in terms of ripping babies away from immigrant children and having immigrants always been a terrific a boost to the United states from er yeah legal in France but you changed the language let's go to Rick in the Bronx Rick you're on was mark\nThanks for taking my call mark I just want to point out one thing that seems to be ...\nI mean if you're like this caravan of course they want they want they either\nPathway contaminated only and the out a yellow El Salvador Guatemala and decent people what for most countries that Scott first started they just gang dogs and search team at all what you want to tell\nYou well know the real point is I thought you were getting too they aren't all good people that they are they're going to be terrorists among them they're going to be people that don't value the ideals that we do in the United states of America forgive me even people with disease right they haven't been said as as one caller pointed out so you have\nTo have some means of doing this some orderly process that's the whole point\nHis argument seems such such an easy one to win if you frame it in the right terms use the right language you know be compassionate people okay you want to come to this country I think we let a million people in a year\nThere's a way to do it here the rules here the procedures you have to follow that President Trump the Republicans are going to lose this one either way right you call out the national guard or whatever you do you stop them from coming in what you got to do your evil bad guys as Obama said ripping children away from their mothers and everybody joins in with that try\nAnd if you uh do stop them you have an invasion you have people coming into these people aren't coming in for silent maybe at some of them but a lot of them we know
