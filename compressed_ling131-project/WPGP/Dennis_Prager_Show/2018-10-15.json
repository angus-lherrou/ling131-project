I realized how unique unique not rare unique America was\nIn Jewish history and everybody else's history because it didn't matter that I was a Jew and I was a young guy my twenties joined it was very small city than Silicon Valley California it's Rotary Club the only Jew there it didn't mean the thing\nIt was just it was Dennis ... and they all do I was Jewish because I was the head of the Jewish Institute in that happened to be located there\nBut that doesn't matter\nDoesn't matter if you're turkey doesn't matter if you're Muslim doesn't matter if you're Arab doesn't matter if you're black it doesn't matter if you're a span of oh it mattered if you were black for much of American history Americans failed up there all night deals with regard to blocks I fully acknowledge it but it it it it it rapidly in the second half of the twenty century became a non issue\nSo you're black okay so you're not black okay\nAre you American then\nOr people see height but it doesn't matter people

Larry says not only do we gain seats in the Senate we may gain seats in the house is Larry Larry ... is is is optimistic\n... does\nLook at what happened in sixty\nThe mainstream\nSaid Hillary has it in the cat and a New York times Huffington Post at Ninety five percent chance of victory and what happened a silent majority trounced or\nIn the last year and a half how could it possibly be that the silent majority has been growing just for economic reasons alone let alone the fact that look at the statistics for African Americans they approval rating of the president has doubled in just the last year so how could the result will be better\nI find that hard to imagine all\nThe uh what I I heard about the black Americans vote was ... he he may get about twenty five percent which is that where the case that would end any democratic chances\nYeah if if I've seen figures it's up to thirty percent uh it's it's stunning and what happened last week with Kanye and in the White House and how the quote unquote mainstream media came out of the woodshed in its most bigoted hateful fire shelter\nMinstrel show event you know what a liquid for why you need grow yes and the wife\nDoesn't read rifles he puts on a red might have looked for institutionalized racism and you'll find it on the left today\nThat that is exactly right so right now\nDo you think this is by sixty four thousand dollar question and I I asked him last hour of my listeners\nDo you believe and I and I'll have to ask you was I asked myself no wishful thinking here Mm okay is not what we're doing All right not what we want but what do you think\nDo you believe that there will be or we have reached a tipping point where the left will simply do something so egregious I think the capital humans would be that example but others would differ\nBut do you believe we have hit one worry we'll get one or will never hit one that is the proverbial lobster or frog being boiled who doesn't even though he's being boiled alive what do you think\nI think it's already happened I think the fact that we don't talk about James Hodgkinson every single day and the most American have most Americans have no idea who James Hodgkinson is let's remember that the Steve ... was almost killed by a man who took a rifle in my hand go to a Republican\n... baseball practice session but when he was killed by this to brave kept to police officers what did they find his body\nThey found a hit list list of solely Republican congressman that this individual was going to assassinate its stomach that you know we forget all the people who are on that field\nFor life but ... so maybe my question wasn't clear I Know that there will be individuals who was tipped over right is there a point where Americans non left wing Americans yeah we'll have their tipping point and say ... oh\nOh the last ... really is dangerous\nOh it's happened I think it's happened and I don't think it's wishful thinking I just look at the social media and in the last three weeks with a capital hearing I I was in Manhattan last week for the for the loss of why we fight\nAnd an older couple recognize me as I was waiting to get on the train back to D.C and they came up to me and they said we just ... people living our lives in in in Trenton New Jersey but we've had enough where we're going to vote we're going to support down ticket Republicans because what they did to the godly man\nThe absolutely right just individual was truly filthy and discs\nI think so yes I think we have reached the tipping point when you have said it has like Feinstein like book or like a Kamala Harris him cute the reputation of a man who who is wider than the driven snow I think we've already arrived at us\nWell they would say yes that's the problem is wider than the driven snow\nThat's how sick it's become that that that's probably a a a a phrase that will be renounced but yeah so you think ... so I Want to get this clear you think that that I Do too\nI think that for a not for all Americans but for a very significant number of the Kavanaugh hearings worth tipping point to say the left and the Democrats have gone too far so that it that is your position\nIf if you if you want an eleven year old who's sitting in some ivory tower and being brainwashed every day if you're just an average American and you look at the first five minutes of
