will that that that they'll think ill during the hearing but even more important is that I think the problem we have is that the rest of the Republican leadership is not trying to energize the

think the protestors are energized the people were in the cats are energized the people screaming and Jeff Flake or energized there there are so many Americans\nOn all sides of the political spectrum

Kavanaugh display\nSo the\nThe science I'm looking at a picture of the signs of students here at the University of Texas Austin they have to understand Austin is the liberal city in Texas and anyway any UT branch will be the usual let liberal or left\nSo I see signs confirm Kavanaugh as the biggest along with change our mind\nA mix\nIs Kavanaugh for justice Kevin did nothing wrong kangaroo courts in Congress a hash tag me too me too what does it mean to gone\nDoes that mean\nA and past tech too far exclamation point\nKevin not guilty and which ones\nAre signs ripped up and anger chance of we believe survivors a large group of students became enraged Tuesday Afternoon that's yesterday by a pro Brent Brett Kavanaugh table any effort at the University of Texas at Austin put together by young conservatives of Texas chapter\nA crowd of furious students in circled the group and yelled at its members wall chanting obscenities and destroying their signs if you read my column yesterday you will understand why people on the left feel that the normal rules of civil society do not apply\nTo them\nThat is what it is these are this is our version of the ... the over man the person who is above its really above man they're above the normal constraints that civil society and civilization put on people\nThat is how left this regard themselves they're not bound by Judeo Christian principles they are not bound by civil principles of the society\nSo the notion that you have a right to your opinion without me screaming around you obscenities and ripping up your signs does not exist for people on the left that exist for liberals but it doesn't exist for leftist\nIt's a conservative group had set had decided to set up ... confirmed Kavanaugh display in an effort to show support for the embattled the U.S Supreme Court judge nominee and argue the need for corroborating evidence\nSaid student Anthony del ... female we should have um a vice chairman of the group\nThey drew up signs staving such phrases as\nA I go I guess it's all one I get it it's a\n... me too me too gone hashtags too far I guess it's it's just to make a statement using hashtags Kavanaugh not guilty no campus kangaroo courts in Congress they also put up a change my mind sign of coal to debate peers\nHold debate the left doesn't debate and circle\nLet's see here we didn't want people to talk to us but unfortunately it's hard to do that when you have an angry mob ripping our science and screaming in our faces why couldn't they rip their signs and not be arrested this is they see that the\nCivil authorities and college the Saudis help the left destroy civil law\nBy not prosecuting them they're saying you are above the law we agree with you on the left you are Wilbur mention\n\nThe half dozen

destructive force in\nAmerica the Democratic party\n[noise] and they really do and it and it is a responsibility a on a Republican to make sure that the people know what that we really are the party

you is the producer\nBut now interesting early because I Believe\nThat every one of them if every one of the three males affiliated with the direct presentation of the show triple gee the living martyr and I have feminine sucked\nI Do I Believe that and sure enough tripled jeeze feminine side came out where he said he would like to get a gift not a gift card\nAfter I laughed at him for about five minutes we resume the conversation\n[laughter]\n[laughter] that\nThey have gift cards when I was growing up not only that they had cars that yes running water showers bats yes no no no no it's amazing even even automatic transmission\nThat that's amazing I Know I Know I Can't believe that question did they have gift cards while he was that his that hilarious they've gift cards no no they was invented when you were born oh my God\nIt's this generation we keep him around as like a sort of a a you know to stay in touch\nWith what the with what the the new folk think anyway what\nSeven seven six eight seven seven to for three triple seven six and that is that that's the theory that I'm I'm working women love too by the way there's no better or worse here this is the ... at all there there is no\nSuch thing in this regard I'm simply offering you may be wrong by the way I I maybe I I think I'm right\nWell obviously or I wouldn't have said it but you know what it what is your take see and I I Know in this case by the way you may be curious I think I should add that show what is your Dennis prayers feminine side and I said it to these guys and the the the living martyr didn't fully believe me I don't know why\nI have no agenda here I I Know why he doesn't really believe I have a feminine side this has been a ... [laughter] no no no no no he doesn't believe I have a feminine side yes\nAnd he's wrong and I give you an example I prefer in movies I prefer romantic comedies\nTo slash him shoot 'em uh dramas where you know action to action dramas man ... yes Ben love high speed car chases the guy shot him and this and and as it does do not explode she sets explosion [laughter]\n... explosions [laughter] that was great I I I I I turned to the popcorn vendor when the when there's an explosion it it it does nothing for me but a romantic comedy I Am\nTotally enthralled I Love it I I Believe it I moved into the whole situation I mean I Love sleepless in Seattle I I was riveted\nYes\nI Know that guys yes I you don't even have to turn it off that tried triple ... so the living martyr is in the middle you liked both correct that was your statement you like a romantic comedies and and the explosions okay fine\nBy the way I did like I Love James Bond movies that I admit\nBut that was when I was when he smoked cigars and and the loved women I have to weigh in the ... the early days and and that's right and gift cards that is correct if you see Dr ... do you see that that that is a gift card slip through them that is exactly right\nYeah yeah and exploded the gift card did explode\nSo everybody was happy that the guys were happy and you know what it is [laughter]\nSo I Am this this is a male female that there should is devoted to Dennis this theory on gift card versus gift I didn't ask my wife I ... I I I I you know as well as I Know her\nI could say what do you think you know my wife very well why do you think a shoe would would would answer\nIt's a tough one what would your wife answer I suspect the gift yeah okay I I Do I Know there is a good argument in both I think if she like the gift I think she'd be very touched\nBut I Would be touched too if I like the gift but the chances of your getting me something that would that I Would enjoy as much as me getting the that\nAre are very small ... who knows better what I Want then I that's my that's my rational male brain talking\nSo if let's say if if there's a hundred dollar gift right since the generous give a hundred dollar gift\nThat somebody's spends they have fought to it and and I know they thought to it but it's not what I Would choose for me of course I'd rather have a hundred dollar gift certificate but people think this is another thing\nPeople think that you're getting them a gift certificate chose you didn't think you took the easy way out\nBut I I I don't relate to that at all\n[noise] listen don't couples set up what do they call when they set up an account at a at a department store furniture store\nYou you know what I mean you know ... people no no come on guys you guys are so out of it you don't ... couples marrying set up a thing what is it cold\n[laughter] this is a problem when you work with men\nUh any way they set up an account and you ... that way they could get the the the dishes they want they can get their register that thank you that's right they register with a store\nNow All right you're right I should've known knowing romantic comedies but the last time there was a registry even romantic comedy was Eighteen sixty nine first I'm a picture of taken\nSo that now that's an example though right that's like a gift card ... ... are couples are touched by that if you give in to their registry [noise] All right this is my uh this is my question here we're going to take a vote [noise]\nOne eight Prager seven seven six you're listening to the dentist\nOkay\nWe have standards at the ... show All right Christine I'm Sorry that you were even tangentially related to this sad moment\nShe there Oh yes I Am okay go ahead it is it is\nI I Hope she didn't get in trouble\nWell she may high but it's over [laughter] hey go ahead I\nI honestly I have a good car guinea how much sports leg off get car\nWhy cause pain to lose ... maybe twenty five dollar gift card yeah Hi I'm twenty twenty when you talk to and that gets quiet and you're going\nTo be all that is a very good point I never thought of that money that way you know what this thing\nThat it's very interesting you're so right but there's something that seems to be about well it's yeah it seems almost tacky and and um and it's ridiculous because it's no different from a gift card but I have no way you give a guy an envelope with a hundred dollar bill said again\nYou have to spend all the\nYou know no you're right I I couldn't agree more\nThat you take the car swept up in a nice little dog\nOn a big one [laughter] [laughter] well that's why [laughter]\nThat very funny that's a very funny thought you give somebody gets a big box the bail open it up as a hundred dollar bill on the bottom\nOf our I don't know\nWhat I Want better than me and it and it and my you know ... one company it that\nWay so you're sixty three at forty three would have preferred a gift yeah\nAll right so I don't think see I don't think it's age related I I have to yeah I I don't I think I think it's more sex related and that's my theory but I you know obviously you you do you prefer the the the money uh\nThere's a there's a there's a very a hearing All right good we have a male who prefers the gift will take a thank you Christine Marty in Indianapolis, Indiana Hi\nHey Dennis but my first time caller as well the first time that you're right now you gotta you gotta feed on that river crews there but\nYou
