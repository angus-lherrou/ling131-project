A. G. E.\nMy mom you know all we can you really talk about that subject for one hour every week oh my gosh\nSix days of radio and I don't have enough time and we've got so much to cover for you today\nAnd I was going to to go there with you immediately because I've got a great guess wind up Alan Gottlieb will be here momentarily followed by Rhonda ... from Chicago as can be great interview followed by a W. R. Hawkins from Breitbart News followed by a four hour with Dr John Lott\nWho I Know is frustrated and I I spoke with him today but I Can't wait to bring you this program so that [noise] excuse me a bear with me I Am getting over a cold and I don't want to keep reaching back behind me to the board hitting mute so if you hear me every once in awhile clearing my throat bear with me I Do apologize\nWhen I got I got to start the day off we start the hour off with you here today was is I got a phone call this morning\nA from on my studio mind I generally don't ever answered the phone I don't even know the number but it was ringing\nIt's absolutely and continue drinks where I decided I'd pick it up and tell a telemarketer where to go when I heard ... this is Mike ... LDC British radio how you did I and I am doing just fine Mike how are you just wonder if you might be able to join Kevin McGwire with us on the radio today\nIn about Fifteen minutes so I did and there is a big article that I just found the moments ago Kevin McGuire clashes with American gun rights supporter now this guy you know anything about Kevin McGuire\nKevin ... is a long time political a journalist pundit and radio hosts very well respected in England he's also so far left he's ready to fall off the planet\nThere is a clip here that's attached I Want you to take a listen to what I have to do is give you a theater of the mind\nBecause you can't see Kevin the clip is a video of him on the air with me he's letting me talk and the whole time he's rolling his eyes these huffing and puffing his shirts coming off the drone on his shoulders back\n[laughter] and after about eight to ten minutes of being on the air with him and my complete thorough utter destruction of him I Want to read you a quote from the bottom from one of the readers of this piece of take a listen and see how I did hear how to do\nIf I can get this to pop up here I Hope I can here we go cannot do it I might not be able to do it well we'll have to maybe pull that up in the later segment here or maybe in a in another state we'll see if I give me one more shot on this I just pulled the ... minutes ago so it's possible I might not be able to get it to run but we're going to try it again\nA background check looks at the background it doesn't look forward Kevin and that's the problem that we have these people actually start thirty mass shooters in America who all past background checks\nWe can add any what we want to the problem is\nThere are guns in American as Paul said if a madman wants to get a hold of a gun\nHe can in America and that's what it's unfortunate but it's true it's a very very complex issue as I said there are hundreds of millions of firearms in this country now your response was ban assault weapons well first of all I bought my first a are Fifteen during the Clinton assault weapons ban there are\nTens of millions of these guys in America that aren't going anywhere so it's wishful thinking it's easy and in the jerk reaction say my God we have to band is\nIn reality that's not going to work\nBecause they can't be bad they are all ready here millions upon millions of Americans are not going to turn in their lawfully own firearms who have done nothing wrong with their firearms and that's the vast majority of gun suddenly this complex and it's frustrating and I feel your frustration as an American gun owner we hate to see those were the ones that will just stop\nWell we don't the advocate for people murdering people and say\nThe fifth of Americans with buildings are intimidating the the whole fifth not do not I don't know I don't want you know any more I don't want your thoughts and prayers any more than ...\nNow he went ahead and got does what liberals do he lost the argument he got very huffy at me and he cut off my Mike\nNow was excuse me it was an awful lot of fun but I Want you to take a listen to it comment at the bottom of the article and then we're going to go to my first guest\nThis was from Alton Martin Palmer's to know the interview was longer than that one minute and forty second clip but he was completely early destroyed\nThis Kevin ... loose Kevin McGuire isn't ... rooted more at one of that the American was polite courteous and gracious throughout you have to present or got so angry after thoroughly losing the argument that he swam down on the phone and went into a tirade behind his back\nSo apparently after he hung up on me he went off on me on the air and that's fine I couldn't care less what losers though it made me ashamed to be from the same country I Am disgusted by this present or\nBy the way what on earth as American gun laws have to do with us here in the u._k. shouldn't we just bought out it isn't like the u._k. is such a fantastic place crime is through the roof and there were more murders in London last year than in New York let me go\nDirectly to Alan Gottlieb founder of\nThe second amendment foundation and have some fun with this as we move into other topics with you today Alan how're ya\nFind mark that sound like a ... a little little exchange there\nIt was a lot of fun and for somebody like you who has a has a lot of experience and you know people coming after you and you know these interviews are going to be set up so I've I've been on with with them with a cabin in the past so I knew what was coming you know it's interesting how he before he interviewed me\nHe interviewed a gentleman by the name of Paul with the Pittsburgh Post Gazette who absolutely nailed and said essentially kind of what I said\nBut he talked about more of the complexities of the issue he went deeper into why it's impossible why gun control laws don't work et cetera Kevin McGuire never set a thing to have never questioned him when he came after me because he had me on before and he knows I'm armed American radio and not a journalist with the Pittsburgh Post Gazette\nSo he you know he tried to attack me but he got put in place and I thought the comment from the uh from the reader of the article in Britain today was wonderful and I just wanted to get your thoughts on it\nWell I think he did a marvelous job uh unfortunately you're not going to change his mind or ... probably a significant amount of his viewers because his viewers of people just like him otherwise they wouldn't be nearly a but he did a very good job and you know that's the expected ... each getting at at a a left wing person to Britain\nOr I mean they're like people control I mean they like to control people it's just a problem as Britain they don't get into the criminals anymore so running wild\nYeah in a way that he doesn't like to talk about crime and Britain and so forth but now Piers Morgan put a tweet out the other day too I found this fascinating Pittsburgh shooters reporter to use and they are Fifteen the preferred weapon of choice for most mass shooters in America Sandy Hook Vegas et cetera no job will be here later to tell us that that's not true\nBecause they kill lots of people very fast this is what they look like can you post a photograph of us really people scary or Fifteen and he says I ask again why the ... are these legal for civilians and my reply was quite simple because tens of millions of responsibly armed Americans use them safely responsibly every single day\nNow how much of this argument now are we going to start seeing because of Pittsburgh I Want your thoughts now on how you think this whole thing is going to build up over the coming days and weeks ... by the mid term\nWell before I answer that I'd like to point out that this particular murderer then you have an AR you also had handguns with them as well [noise]\nUh and we don't know what what what kind of see actually used to do all the firing of how many ... bullets from which guns so when they go like to pick on the assault weapon you know if you're banned assault weapons has got to walk into an unarmed unprotected you know I you know synagogue\nOur nobody had a firearm to protect themselves because of their country policy uh and if he didn't use the R I couldn't eat probably did uses handguns anyway\nSo the problem here is is that none of this works and they just don't want to admit to it now and answering your question how it's going to play out there's no doubt that he pulled his gun rights and polish a lobbyist with your they can try and spin it in the evil of guns called the ... election or there's just there are two ways about it\nI'm not sure the American people are going to buy it because I think the American people just play ... recognize that fact that this was a hate crime I can committed against people of religion\nOr that it took a crazy crazy person to do this that it was a you know obviously murder that have a A R R as ... as you could walk in with\nA pipe bomb as well and and kill more people so the problem here is is that it it isn't about guns in America people get it so I'm not too concerned about how it's going to impact Mitchell elections\nI've I'm with you on that in fact I'm with you on that a hundred and ten percent at some things you can feel in your gut listener you and I know you know this you get that feeling I I'm not getting that gut feeling I've learned over many years in business them and just doing this that you you learn to trust\nYour got my gut instinct is generally always right at least ... percent of the time now and I'm I'm kind of feeling the same thing you know I like to point out that people would have\nHad I had the opportunity before he not hung up on me because he was destroyed and couldn't argue with me any more but\nIt's the fact that for example when we show in Virginia Tech used a glock Nineteen and twenty two to murder thirty two people and they don't want to hear that because they're okay with handguns than when you hit them with that they really get mad and pick their toys that low as well in like in ... and\n... in Britain than I Do care tank and see it as that is why they train them so let's be honest about it but at but again with what I think\nReinforces a our feelings isn't going to impact near term elections as a recent Gallup poll came out it was an all time low of American people wanting to ban a are fifteens\nWere able to go out and you were going to take a break right here let me go to that when we come back that fall I wanted to take you there right after this break sorry about having to cut you off there Alan Gottlieb founder Second Amendment foundation she's going to be a fun show to fly so Marco and be right back\nOkay these people are out spend enough now three to one and we need to get off our duff we've got to get active yes we have grass roots but we need assistance here let's go now to sixteen thirty nine you covered enough of it but I just want to ask you one question as we're coming up to this ballot initiative\nThat six hundred thousand I'm just going to say this from what I just heard you say\nYou felt better last week and you did this week is that first statement\n[noise] oh yeah if I had the money to compete with that certainly thousand dollars I I I feel as good as they did last week\nI don't feel that last minute money coming in from three big donors Bloomberg being one of those and you know one of the problems we have is they want to put a good spin on everything but you sometimes you can't believe you're on the letter Rick uh and sometimes it it's better to let people know who we are in the battle\nYou know I always say that are actually what election away from extinction and it's really true\nThat it absolutely is true and it's true every single election cycle it every single election cycle\nAll right let me move to another topic with your quick we've got just a couple of minutes s a F joins California group suing riverside county sheriff over C. C. W. policies this is not the first rodeo with the second amendment foundation supporting the rights of a legal American resident tell us about this one real quick\nListen to share this decided 'cause California Guinness is may issue says chairs get discretion of what they want to do you say that if you're a legal you know resident who holds a gun you know in in Sacramento a lo and behold you you
