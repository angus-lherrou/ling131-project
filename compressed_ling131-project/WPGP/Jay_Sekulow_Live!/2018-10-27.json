A. R. K. I. S. L. E. R. at AOL dot com and a lot of you have done that and you'll find out on my website and all these other sites where I Will be appearing next besides filling in for Laurie or Dennis or whatever\nI Do other stuff to\nLast hour talked about the effort of the left to blame these would be bombings on President Trump because the left and the media and the Democrats hate him\nIn this segment I Want to talk about what a great job in the ... a color at the end of the other our asked me to do that what is it done that's so good I think he didn't think there was anything but I Want to talk about what a great job President Trump has done during his time in office\nI set for months now that I care less about what he says and much more in what he does\nHis Cuisinart always helped him and he's in my opinion is answer many people you shouldn't and engaged with people beneath his position to his detriment I I play tennis a lot and ah when sometimes on the court people kind of know who I Am and they try to get my vote I just don't answer them\nOff and I am I getting paid for this about getting paid I'm not answering your guts\nBut he talks and you know get some debates with people who shouldn't\nBut I never expected him to govern in such a conservative way he is far surpass my expectations for him I must admit he was not my first choice in the primary season\nI was actually a Ted Cruz delicate in my initial judgment I thought Trump was only better than John ... which isn't saying much 'cause you can use to clients will be a Democrat\nBut I have long since submitted that far from being the worst choice or the second worst choice for president he may have very well been the only Republican that could have one\nIn fact I wondered how a lot of the callers suggested this last hour if profit Providence was involved in this election after off a bomb had done you know talking about radically changing our country it might have very well been too late to turn America back of Hillary had one\nAnd I don't know if you know Bruce ... he ... he ran against Barbara Boxer the but when she ran from the U.S Senate and I asked him if he thought God was involved in the founding of our country and the answer of course did you ever think how young the founders were and how they got almost everything right\nAnd we'll also Providence I Wonder that we got George Washington and Abraham Lincoln and Ronald Reagan when we needed the most\nAnd you get no argument from me about gods involvement and now I think we got Donald J Trump with all those personal shortcomings when the country needed him most yesterday one and I was a strong supporter of his during the general election\nOf course that doesn't matter much either considering we should try again and I remember many of us thought he would be very satisfied we would be very satisfied if President Trump would just nominate conservative judges especially from the Supreme Court\nSo I thought were way ahead of the game when he pointed Judge Gorsuch to the U.S Supreme Court but he didn't stop there let me go through the list that the caller wanted ending the Obamacare mandate opening up the Keystone Pipeline than Anwar reserves and in countless regulations hurting the economy\nA significant tax cut I don't know why and he talks about it but not enough Republicans do lowering our taxes and simplifying the tax forms moving of the U.S embassy to Jerusalem getting us out of the Paris Peace accords was drawn from the disastrous Iranian deal\nMeeting with Kim all young to possibly produce the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula getting American remains is already done that returned from North Korea\nAnd making sure our borders means something yeah color from last hour who knows what people are up to there just isn't it a coincidence that the coming right around the election and a mom who knows how they're getting paid how they're supporting themselves yeah I've heard local church groups and so on\nBut this isn't just organized spontaneously\nAnd of course the naming now for a second Supreme Court a choice a few weeks ago and he was successful another I'm Brett Kavanaugh the list goes on and on and the American people love that he is not politically correct\nAnd the American people are tired of all those politicians who Spain and Spain and spin that's where we are talking about last hour and are afraid to say what they are really thinking you don't have\nThat problem you can never say that about President Trump he may say too much but he never has two little he is one of the most conservative presidents in my lifetime he has done a great job and most of the American people get it\nBut it doesn't matter to the left or to Democrats or their comrades in the media\nI'm afraid to tell the left is the Democrats and liberal listeners so maybe I'll whisper this if the presidential election were held today President Trump would easily be reelected he's kept most of his promises and the American people appreciate that and he is resonating with the American people more than ever\nYou are dreaming if you think he's going to be defeated you will fail to get rid of him but not for lack of trying you start in the day he won\nActually we now know that they turn the resistance against him against much before election day but it was election day came they couldn't believe that this so called bumbling fools had won\nSo bumbling but he's still one no matter what the upper lead of the FBI and the Justice Department may have guaranteed he won\nAnd I was almost I mentioned this last hour in tears when I heard he won Pennsylvania\nWhich always seemed like a Republicans fool's gold now we're always going to win around who's going to win and nobody was going to win it but not only did he win but they are despite the best efforts he want he still here and he's going to be here for six and a half more years no matter the Miller persecution\nOr is that prosecution got to think about that what was that which one is that no matter the hostile media no matter the never Trump hers no matter all the elites in the swamp President Trump is still here\nWhich never should have happened according to them and despite their best efforts to destroy him including getting a special prosecutor point to and including the best efforts in terms of the bomber he won't work\nEven though they want accused him of being responsible for the bomber he's accused of everything and anything they can come up with he still hear\nIt never should have happened with the more investigation of laughing Jeff Sessions as an aside I'm disappointed never recused himself he played into the Democrats hands\nBut typically politicians talked our adversaries Hillary did it she talked to the Russians remember the reset button remember Obama saying that that he was reelected that he would take care of it and you know they work work it out\nAnd he promised that off Mike\nSo all of this you know I'm disappointed and sessions disappointed his lack of oversight should fire Rosenstein but the fact is President Trump has defeated all of this and as we said last hour the press can handle it\nThey can accept that this guy talks back then he says well we've been thinking all these years\nThat's why people are so thrilled with and finally we got someone in the Republican Party that has some courage it's about time that someone standing up for what\nWe believe in [noise] let me know what you think\nEight eighty nine seven one stage payday day [noise] seven to nine one seven to for

callers said what are we going to do\nRight excuse me can I Am tired how national caravan will be another data yeah yeah that can then it's Asian that's right the language is really I don't think that

come back to this country you don't know who's going to get murder who's going to cap that recording account what how they're going to get by going into people wake up\nYou have I have no I'm In my ... everybody has a lawn cutting my hair and all the politicians have rented [noise] yup why that have\nBeen in the Hollywood at least for now and again we protect our country\nExactly exactly I I was going to talk about illegal immigration will probably save it for money a Monday when I shall incidental but\nYou're absolutely right we would never let anybody would know documents come into our house and say you were in documented right to that would be illegal we'd never let anybody go to a bank account and said to the bank I just don't have the right documents but give me the money give me marks money no one would ever allow that what you allow people to look at Maxine\nWaters she's got four hundred million dollar home\nGot she's got a laundry got everything out but she wants to open

want to cook but Obama it had no money no job no not that she called them and I saw that by my eyes [laughter] we can't protect you want to buy\n[noise] let me tell you a story here and everybody out there\nThat a large mom viola told me years ago she was working at the polls that just shows the power Maxine Waters enter constituents have no idea what she's doing\n... who was working at the polls and poll worker and people would come in with Maxine list of people who to vote for\nAnd viola elders said to them but you're in the wrong area and they said but Maxine told us to come in here and vote for these candidates they act like sheep but if you could name a city or a school district where the Democrats have helped out the minorities to get ahead in their lives to have better schools\nThat live in such a chance to live the American dream but yet they keep voting for these people you just do wonder how they do that let me know what\nYou're saying in eighty nine seven one
