H. G. eat triple late nights and the ones that are too for three Larry Elder released after dot com studio what is the actual number of illegal aliens in this country a new study put the number and substantially higher than most people leave\nAnd next segment we're going to talk to California Republican candidate for governor John Cox\nNew poll shows that the repeal of the gas tax to Republicans assume would be popular in measure to repeal it turns out the repeal is not popular majority of California you want to keep the gas tax which increases the gas tax and also vehicle registration fees\nIn order to pay for infrastructure\n[noise] all that's coming up\nFrom a late nights have been one S. A. G. E. and Kanye West went on\nSaturday Night live and when the show was over before the studio audience went on a rant about the welfare state house destabilized families and that Ninety percent of the media is left wing\nI thought it was at a seat pac convention [noise]\nAll that and more now before the Ford Kavanaugh hearings where for Nader accusations and Kevin responded sixty nine percent of Republicans supported\nKavanaugh's\nNomination to the court thirty two percent of the general public support it\nNow\nWhen Ford testify but before Kevin responded listen to this panel headed up by Clinton apple is\nNo people are watching this all across the country has this began I got a text my friends saying she looks like every woman you know she says she and dean does uh she is someone who is keep\nIn mind this panel is before Kevin all testified but after four did\nCompletely recognizable to everybody in the country\nAh we we know women just like her and uh and she's certainly doesn't seem to be somebody with an agenda as she is putting yourself in this very difficult position\nI it's a very odd hearing and ah the difference between the Democrats and Republicans has been very striking but her persona I think has come off as so far as highly credible\nI've examined hundreds of witnesses on the witness than she is extremely credible she's extremely detail oriented they're a little things about what she has said like the fact that she has\nTwo front doors he can't make that stuff up it is so unusual that sort of detail it makes her testimony extremely credible and the fact that also that she said I Am terrified to be here I don't want to be here but I feel that this is\nMy civic duty I I found her to be one of the most credible witness is I think I've seen\nIt in Georgia have to say it is unmistakable\nHere how how clunky it is the transition between the Republicans on this committee to the Democrats you talked about Rachel Mitchell there who's been brought in by the Republican so that they would not have to question Dr Christine Blasey Ford or a wreck capital when he appears 'em\nBefore us here later today a foot that transition back and forth has been um bumpy if you will of what has not been bumpy it's sort of a temperature in tone in that room from the woman who was answering the questions Dr Christine Blasey Ford obviously up to the American people at home to make up their own minds about the veracity of what she's saying\nBut she has been very consistent George\nAgain that's an ABC panel led by George ... after Dr Christine forward testified before Brett Kavanaugh did me well on CNN Simone Sanders said this about Kevin Oh\nWhat I don't believe that cat and I told the entire truth on just the part that he noted about the yearbook entry but we called the young woman do when that ... because she was one of them\nBut she didn't know about I just thought it wasn't believable I think he he he told not to\nBuy you lied about things I don't think he needed to lie about that perhaps he thought that that he could not get any ground um because he didn't want to be found a couple of anything I at the most striking thing for me it was a thing that I understand that you had been if you believe you have not done something wrong and you add that and you angry but the way he\nPortrayed himself at the outset of the hearing today um he looked on hands\nOn and so based upon that reaction based upon the reaction by the ABC panel one would think that even Republicans might have gotten wildly on Brett Kavanaugh\nWho contrary moments where I mentioned that before the Ford Kevin hearings sixty nine percent of Republicans supported his nomination to the Supreme Court\nAfter the Ford Kavanaugh hearing the figure rose to Seventy five percent meanwhile forty six percent of Republicans said they would be angry as opposed to be disappointed\nIf Kavanaugh is rejected\nNow as far as the public at large is concern before the forward Kavanaugh hearings as I mentioned thirty two percent of voters favorite Kavanaugh's nomination now thirty seven thirty seven percent favorite now in thirty percent opposed now thirty seven percent of post\nSo it's appeared to shower the general public on Kavanaugh but not on Republican Republicans like anything though again Lindsey Graham has warned that this is the new norm watch out for your nominees guys\nThe polygraph and they didn't tell us until September twenty six and deal with this what's in front of you know I've got a guy who adamantly dads if everybody who actually knows him in a real way said this is not the guy I Know I got Dr Ford\nWho can't tell me the time in the place and we'll see what happens to be something to do that now I'm going to go and I I don't know for some Republicans not so this is in\nOur Republican fell [noise] if this becomes a new standard for you have an accusation for weeks you drop it right before the hearing you withhold from the committee a chance\nTo do this in a a professional timely fashion one day publically say\nTheir goal is to lay the vote get the Senate back in twenty eight and paint to make sure he can't fill the seat they're publicly saying that I don't want to reward that kind of behavior I think we've been very fair and to my Republican colleagues if you can ignore everything and this record\nLooking at allegation is thirty five years old this uncertain time place\nDate and no cooperation at that's enough for you [noise] God help us all as Republicans cost this happens to us it never happens to them but let me tell you my democratic friends\nIf this is the new norm you better watch out for your nominees [laughter] why\nSenator Ronald said women should not only to listen to they should be believed and she told me to shut up and do the right thing for a change to that Lindsey Graham said this survey ...\nThank you I Know I'm a single white male from South Carolina and I told I should shut up but I Will not shut up if that's okay because I got here the same way everybody else did\nThe faith on South Carolina voted for me and centers got to be their voice men and women\nAnd I'm not trying to be their voice today\nAnd uh maybe not just for South Carolina but a little bit about what I think is going on here\n[noise]\nJoy ... her over at the view in mid season for\nNot want to investigate this any further [noise] they just want to hold onto that power they know that this country is getting darker white era pans on now sixty one percent of all populated darker can I buy that oh I Am sixty one percent outcome white Caucasian race card can\nClaim forty five can hold the forty nine percent towards going down so it's almost like they worry that white people gonna lose all their\nPower so that they don't care and she's ... she's hotline he's like they just want to hold onto that how how does sound will be like South Africa apartheid rich template\nFat white people were running the country [noise] what\n\nHe's like they just want to hold onto that how how does sound will be like South Africa apartheid were ten percent\nWhite people were running the country it seems like that's the trajectory that we're on me the trajectory one on one of ... where\nDid we not just elected and re elect\nA black man for president Abilene, Texas the town\nWith a population over one hundred thousand that voted the most for President Trump eighty percent just elected a black guy for mayor\nHow's it haven't\nSeven hundred counties voted for Obama in two thousand two thousand twelve two hundred of those seven hundred which the Trump in two thousand sixteen did their racism just go in remission for eight years\n\nThe reason Trump got elected as because white people are afraid to countries becoming increasingly brown [noise]\nIsn't that racist [noise]\nUh I Am white so I was [noise] become back California Republican candidate for governor John ... is the unpopular gas tax is unpopular if he thinks it is [noise] I'm Larry Elder don't leave town\nLarry Elder all through\nUh this is not what the governor wants to happen but apparently if you are charters city and there are about a hundred and twenty starter cities in the state\nComing about two thirds of the population you have all these rights but you don't have as a general law city\nAnd uh but I wouldn't hold my breath waiting for San Francisco to do anything about this uh I mean\nYou know they're they're in the process of trying to get that the state to approve a a legal injection sites where addicts and showed up in a nice uh you know clean environment which I think is it's certainly ridiculous and it's not going to solve the problem of the horrendous drug addiction that's afflicting California\nJohn Cox when are you going to debate your opponent\nNext Monday at ten am on a public radio station he doesn't want to face me across a table on live television Larry I mean he's afraid that Mike good luck\nSo just an overwhelming [laughter] uh yeah\nI but really it's really actually a looked like such a youngster next to them a a which is good and I promise not to use his youth and inexperience against\nThem was John Cox speaking of of good looks he he is a a good looking guy and I and and I'm thinking maybe that's why you been able to get away with some of the stuff you've gotten away with this is the guy who had an affair with his best friend who was his campaign manager the wife of his best friend who is his campaign manager who does that it can still survive\nOr I don't know that's\nThe broke called people tell me a lesson Larry I got so many issues or people in California you don't want the rest of the California looking like San Francisco does these days I mean you made a roadmap to avoid the feces on the sidewalk so\nYou know I don't think Mr newsrooms answers for California or anywhere near what people want or they want lowered taxes they want lower cost\nThis guy will just Jack up taxes Jack up the cost of government he won't do anything about the school he's basically a holy city area of the teachers union then I I Want to treat teachers like professionals that they are a\nMr new some wants to keep 'em as a union members in a you know we need to make sure we teach our kids are in and get out from under a forty seventh and the nation we need to have our schools be number one in the nation and that would be the case when I'm the governor\nJohn Cox for governor dot com is John ... for governor dot com John only a few seconds left where does your opponent stand on the bullet train he's all over the place that he supported opposed to what what is it\n... for this thing on the air and figure out what he's going to do I mean he was talking or it

context short of his actions towards the women were making the accusations\nDo you think that that is not disqualifying record\nWell look I first off I don't know how you're going to prove that he's caught lying about something I mean this this is what he's he said that he drank he said that he drank to access at times that he was drunk at times he admitted to that the only thing he did not admit to his\nWas blacking out and not recalling things and he has you know he has his his college roommate basically you know what I'm saying I live with this guy for three years and I never saw him this
