Florida are Republicans are running a quote overtly racial campaigned against Gillum here's another pundits saying that the Republicans are trying to turn the Florida governor race into a race will\nPull it is and I think the Republican campaign the racist Republican campaign speaks to that as Cornell talked about\nA unless they make this of this campaign if you will on racial terms unless they turned it into a race war we've seen Andrew Gillum over and over again refused to take the bait he's running a unifying campaign\nTurn it into a race war\nIn talking about what he wants to do for all of the people the state of one\nIn the ... mold democratic candidate is refusing to take the bait like when a his opponent around us and its use the term monkey and rather than say was just a regular expression that people usually went\nWell I I I I ... a\nAn implied was racial\nMe my order while the Republican Party and his Republican opponent Rhonda scientists continue to try and bring this down why\nIt's very simple matter if the white electorate in Florida yeah goes eighty twenty four yeah Rhonda scientists and they can make this racing to find it all means disgusting racial jokes that they're trying to unfortunately that will be enough to win however\nDisgusting racial tropes\nOr if they can keep those margins down we know people of color are going to turn out much higher numbers because they're in St excited and enthused by the Guillain Canada safe so that's not going to be an issue or concern on the Democratic side\nBut I I thought that was voter suppression here you are saying the minority vote turnout is going to be large high but but I I thought they were being suppressed\nEyes but if the Republicans can make this a race war which is what they're trying to do not so subtly then\nNot even subtle that that's their calculus for how they win this election but it's reprehensible and I think the voters of the state of Florida\nOf all colors need to ask themselves why are we going to fall for these cheap tactics that not only undermine our campaign system they undermine our democracy joy that's the central question people need to ask themselves going into this election [noise]\nChris Matthews just conceded\nAnd most white vote for somebody if they think he's a racist why then with any politician was an art you two points above plant life run a campaign\nThat's racist here's what a pundit\nRunning right for roll call said\nThat there might have gone back to the women to the women's vote because I just I think it's critical that we you know we we always talk about the fact that there is a gender gap ah in elections and that whoever is going to be elected to office it's typically determined by the women's vote but I have to say I I I Am very pessimistic\nAbout what we will see happen with the white women felt in terms of whether they're going to got Republican or Democrat and and I would remind the audience\nThat for it not for the vote of black women and women of color Roy and Roy worry more would have been elected in Alabama I'm despite very credible charges um that indicated that he can get had engaged in pedophilia\nUm went back I think a racket Traister I Believe on has a new book out one of the things that she talks about as a white woman is that the belief that white women have always gain power for the ...\nI'm a ... ... the proximity that they have to white males to their husbands and they vote in the family that their husbands do because they always end somehow favors them and help that let it\nAnd another one they're completely ridiculous out and saying this because you know lying to federal they get trained on sale on raising the federal it is a lot of Democrats than a problem with federal any in Islam and then it's really tall\nTo say that people were protesting and fanning standing up for their rights are somehow I sell or somehow the bullies when it's actually the ... and policies that are
