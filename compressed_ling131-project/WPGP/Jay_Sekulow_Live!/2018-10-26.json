landed and close to the end of our number two one entire hour to go so let's make of it what we will hear at eight eight eight nine seven one said Mark Davis filling in for Larry and reminding you that for any of you who are approaching retirement or you're in retirement there is no more important issues and healthcare\nCandidates on the left in this election season are talking about one thing you've heard about her rights\nMedicare for all sounds so great Medicare for all\nIf this happens Medicare will die your Medicare under attack by people who think you'd just free stuffed paid for by other people there is no free lunch your Medicare the revenue millions of senior American spade into Italy open suddenly everybody it's socialized medicine so right now over Seventy Democrats have their names\nOn this bill that would turn Medicare into a single payer system European style and it's working so well for them over there\nA bill by Bernie Sanders has the support of one sort of Senate Democrats\nKids enrolled at birth hey there's a whim these bills won't just change Medicare they will destroy\nMedicare and that is why you need to go to don't touch my Medicare dot com don't touch my Medicare dot com and take a Mac pledge to bring a senior to the polls that's what it's about voting voting and voting in voting and voting\nYour Medicare is on the ballot this November only you can stop it don't touch my Medicare dot com check it out don't touch my Medicare dot com we're in Silicon valley can have Mark Davis in the Larry how are you doing\nFor the following has been ready to DC for politically correct attention dismay learn something he said Larry Elder\n[noise]\nDoing it for the same\nHatch [noise]\nWhat disaster and we are we do not show up to vote\nIf we do not going to say there there's there's there's there's an amazing coincidence of mess [noise]\nThe great guinea Joe Brown who is no longer with us by the way\nGator country in this or that that we knew going in the best of Mali had to record you didn't even remember Molly Hatchet ... what are they all got uncommon north slope\nFor me to have this opportunity to hang out on Larry Elder show today because a little bit of a chart history music history\nHere some me history just for everybody in and around Jacksonville thirty six is crazy thirty six years ago today um I sat down thoroughly it after did my first talk show ever on W. okay be Jacksonville, Florida [noise] ah\nYou know they say that that before yeah thank you [laughter] that was the reaction of the time [laughter]\nAnd so many radio careers find a hundred and radio guys and many of them will probably tell you a story about how it ended being fairly young and just being in the right place at the right time or somebody gives you an opportunity to do something you have absolutely no idea whether you can do it but you you show up you don't embarrass yourself for them\nAnd uh and look what happened to thirty six years later I most of the show holy cow so thanks thanks thanks Sarah everybody listening when we're here Sebastian Gorka is here tomorrow and I'm back\nOn Monday before Larry's return on um on Tuesday of next week All right I'm let's let's hit the reset top of the hour we sat on what we're doing the mystery packages I Am hearing a lot of skepticism about the preferred narrative of we have a conservative terrorists\nI'll believe we have a conservative terrorists when we have a conservative terrorists in handcuffs being arrested and fingerprinted till then I Am open to absolutely anything up even Chuck Todd but this kind of interesting\nEven Chuck Todd said today apparently uh how about the Russians some some and and you know what I Do know conservative terrorists Russians Democrat prankster or any of the amount of ...\nAbsolutely no idea no idea\nOf misspellings and ineptitude if it is the Russians and the Russian government at some you know idiot Russian guy in his basement and you know Michigan or something I I don't do so again the speculation games lovely parlor game you can play with your friends\nI have no idea and neither do you so it makes it a very bad idea to jump in and like we kind of know and that's that's that's the third level of noxious gas\nTo all this presumption and miss this drawl that the modern media culture has to lecture President Trump about his rhetoric when they call him a Hitler every day for lunch\nCome on man I'll take no lectures from CNN about civility and a a\n... decent seeing a discourse Artie phone number is eight eight eight nine seven one said so we we have no idea what's going on the package story let us lift up of prayer and every good wish for law enforcement and for the people who are working on that is so that we can get the bottom of it maybe sci fi and find out what a and see and find out what is what I'm going to say on saying\nYou can join me on this or not get free country if they don't find a suspect like in in weeks and I mean because if it was just some moron terrorists who happens to vote Republican\nOr they're going to find them probably by the weekend so if they don't find anybody for a few days you're much skepticism is only going to grow but yet I Will reach no conclusion I Will jump to a to know bottom line\nOf all of the game come to me here's something I'm not going to lead come to me the caravan President Trump apparently in the same mood deploying the military\nSecretary of defense James Mattis signing deployment orders as we speak sense of military down there I said for weeks that if if if this caravan gets the feeling they're about to get met by the United states military and I don't mean they're going to get they'll run over by tanks or anything but um they may turn around and and think better of this\nLet me let me do this I've been sitting on this this new\nColumn news written an opinion piece in um on Fox News today migrant caravan on the large what we must do it for when the caravan arrives at our border ready here we got\nThe caravan of an estimated seven thousand Central American invaders trekking through Mexico toward the United states is roughly one thousand miles from the nearest point of entry a second group of roughly one thousand is also seeking to join them\nThey may still be weeks away from our border but there's leaves a little time for President Trump\nCongress and all Americans who care about our national sovereignty and the rule of law to solve three incredibly pressing challenges first we must determine and do what we can right now to end this invasion before it reaches our doorstep\nSecond we must develop and execute a cohesive efficient effective planned for preventing these invaders from illegally crossing our border and for swiftly deporting those who are successful\nAnd finally we must fix the debilitating leaf stupid amalgam of immigration laws policies in court rulings that enable and encourage migrants to band together in stages these types of illegal invasions\nShould we fail to solve any of these problems are already dysfunctional immigration system will be further cripple our relationship with Mexico and Central America neighbors can be severely damaged our border will be overwhelmed by droves of new migrants and America will become significantly less safe\nIf this caravan is allowed to get through the end of the U.S the next caravan will be even bigger than one following that will be enormous according to the gallon world both twenty nine percent of people who want to migrate from Latin America in the Caribbean want to make the United states they're permanent home that is thirty seven\nMillion people who want to come here we must demand and ensure that they do so legally the clearest answer to alleviating decision\nWhile the Caribbean is still in Mexico is for Mexico to stop it\nPresident Trump is already made clear that securing the border is more important than our recent trade agreements with our southern neighbor Mexico should take him seriously\nMany of the members of this caravan forced their way through the Guatemala Mexico border they're already in violation of Mexican law Mexican law enforcement should take action\nFor the more we should not underestimate the degree to which human traffickers and transnational criminal gangs such as that has Thirteen and other cartels are involved with this invasion force\nMexican authorities should also be seeking to weed these elements out of a caravan and dealing with those who may have legitimate asylum claims through the Mexicans system\nOur Mexican neighbors must understand that while they did not assertively deal with this problem at their southern border they will own problem if it gets to their northern border this relates to what we must do it for when the caravan is allowed to arrive at the U.S border\nPresident Trump should instruct attorney general Jeff Sessions to issue a clarification to define the qualifications for asylum asylum is meant to provide protection for people who are fleeing real persecution and human rights abuses such as genocide simply being from a poor country that lacks opportunities does not\nQualify someone for asylum\nWe already have approximately seven hundred and fifty thousand backlogs asylum cases\nThese invaders should be screened preferably in Mexico so they never enter the U.S system federal government should also immediately begin coordinating with local and state governments along the border to develop an organized completely non violent system that can deter these migrants from crossing into the United states\nI Know Texas already worked with federal officials to prepare for mass migration events other border states should follow suit we must overwhelming invaders stopped them in their track to quickly return them to their home countries\nOur immigration system has been completely broken by Democrat back laws to make it easier for immigrants to flood our system and stay in our country while their cases take years to process\nThe immigration system has been further hobbled by activists judicial rulings that have ties the hands of border enforcement officials and prevented them from keeping track of those who cross the border illegally once we deal with the immediate problem\nOf this invasion caravan Republicans and the White House must work to fix our broken immigration system once and for all\nNewt Gingrich with an opinion piece ... bared Fox News dot com for your consumption if you wish\nAlready I'm about to consume some of your calls and we'll talk to each other about things and not a slow Newsweek so pick your favorite and let's go eight eight eight nine seven on stage Mark Davis in for Larry at Mark Davis on Twitter back it off and\nYou're listening to the Larry Elder [noise]\n[noise] good uh\nI called about back yeah so they found a\nA like a child is ... and they look like you know\nCause to pronounce your name ... ... down there wouldn't be [noise]\nAnd we could eliminate\nThe one that\nWasn't yes I suppose we have Dan yet but you but you know the Unabomber case is interesting because he was ship and stuff to people and they didn't find him for years so I I'm I'm fairly confident I doubt that I'm\nConfident in law enforcement most things like this are they start out as absurd mysteries and then you turn your head and a day or two or three or four later they gotta suspects like wow how did you guys do that they're miracle workers it's incredible but they'll tell you it's not miracles just hard solid police working diligence in work ethic\nAnd God Bless them and um I I buy hope we can get a few things settled here by finding a suspect a pretty soon we are in Anderson a South Carolina hey Sean Mark Davis and for Larry how you doing\nWhile you know one of my car was\nAt the moment I looked at I bomb issue it reminded me every time you see those minority\nUh at the college campuses where someone spray paint or something negative and then it turns\nOut to be exact victim that a\nClaim your ... you know claim that they were bad does happen then there were\n... or\nThe you know what I'm Talking about we're we ever want to be at the air force academy high school there and and the the the head guy they're delivered this impassioned thing was was beautiful it\nWas it was very gripping a\nHow we don't tolerate that it it doesn't speak for us so we have to rise above this and it was a lovely lovely thought a lovely lovely speech and you're trying to think it was a scam why did let it\nSo that everybody there are so many people know that I agree with that I mean and and so so what I put this past them I Would not not this would be typical it would be completely in character you getting nothing is beneath them\nBut does that mean that I somehow those who they did this or or even have an active leaning toward ed no I'm saying wide open I recommend everybody do the same let the let the the law enforcement folks do their work at some point we will have a suspect\nAnd then we'll know a lot more about what we're talking about here so to talk about
