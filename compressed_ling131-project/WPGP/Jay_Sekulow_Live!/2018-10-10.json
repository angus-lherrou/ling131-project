I was one of the most expensive how faith and they are now and again I think when you look at people in the Bible and it can get one for anything that\nHas her you know come out and ... there is no debate and we don't have the financial rate it's like hey Arnie sound has and it's kinda like\nWow you know\nI'm not quite sure what she's talking about what he said about monkey\nAgain would you ever heard of course not well here's the deal male we cannot go down the road of nonstop\nPolitical correctness and people are going to demagogue what you're saying like that's just unfortunately where we're at in this in this country the voters though they know that this was a non nothing burger and so I'm going to continue going forward just speaking the truth uh but I'm not going to be derailed by these fake controversies\nNow here's an article by a man named Matthew Chapman don't know who he is headlined GOP candidate wrote a book arguing the founding fathers were right not to abolish slavery\nAnd he's talking about Rhonda Santas around a standard wrote a book called green from our founding fathers first principles in the age of Obama and that's a take off from Obama's book dreams from my father\nQuote one of the most disturbing claims he made in the book was that Thurgood Marshall the first African American Supreme Court justice was wrong to suggest the founding fathers failure to abolish slavery in the constitution was a fundamental flaw\nIf the sand is simply left it at tolerating slavery was a central to get the southern states on board she might have had a point but the claim that the constitution somehow pre ordained at the end of slavery as written is pure whitewashing given that it took a bloody civil war\nTo do so\nAnd he talks about the three this deal that was made between the north in the south\nHow reprehensible that deal was another person who appears to be pretty ignorant about history is an article by Walter Williams called slavery quote\nAt the time of the Seventeen eighty seven\nConstitutional convention slaves were about forty percent of the population of some southern colonies\nIn talks about how the southerners want it to ... count each slave as one person in order to increase their representation in the north because they want it to limit the power of a slave holding ... states wanted them to have to count them at all so they agreed on telling them increase this as a compromise\nQuote many criticize writes Walter Williams this compromise as proof of racism which is what this guy said about round to Sanders\nQuestion to these grossly uninformed critics is whether they would have found it more preferable for slaves to be counted as whole person's slave candidates whole person would have given slave holding southern states much more political power\nOr which critics of the founders referred that the northern delegates not compromise and not allow slaves to be counted at all if they did is likely that the constitution would not have been ratified that's the question the emerges whether blacks would have been better off with northern states haven't gone there a way in southern states having gone there's\nResulting in no U.S Constitution and no union\nAnd then Walter Williams quote Patrick Henry\nWho set of this three fifths compromise quote as much as I deplore slavery I see that prudence forbids its abolition\nInto quote\nOne of the delegates Jane will strings Wilson said this about the compromise that it laid the foundation for managing slavery\nOut of this country and of course there's also a website maintained by the federal government called constitution Centre dot org and talks about the three fifty you\nQuote in truth it was a political deal that many delicate felt was essential to preserving the union the Madison was a slave owner he felt deeply conflicted about slavery\nBut he was a strong advocate of the constitution so we felt obligated to defend even the three this rule close quote what this guy criticizing wrong to say this is the saying is that the Sanders was wrong when you said that freezes compromise what's essential a and that the\nStates have been set for the eventual abolition of slavery\nThis guy is not true and therefore ... apparently be racist oh my goodness\n[noise] Rhonda Sanders has called out the double standard all these anti Semite that are surrounding his uh his opponent\nThey always just like the the Weather Channel that guys out there doing the things that and then the people are walking by like I was like all the time to create a narrative you do not\nDo that with Andrew Gillum have us Andrew Gillum why he had hair the council of American Islamic Relations to Tallahassee and twenty six votes so welcome them they weren't uninvited co conspirator in the holy land foundation terror financing dropped\nThe largest Sarah financing from history you welcome them he thanked them for what they were doing why were they in Tallahassee to protest the and CBS legislation that say that the legislature was doing what\nAnd where were the people criticizing all these anti Semite surrounding the Andrew\nGillum Kennedy yep

[laughter]\nDenise recalling a let's let's revisit\nThe last eight years you have a president who gave a addressed the United nations and vote for it which is a complete bogus thing\nYou didn't have his hands up didn't say don't shoot but a President Obama opted fit to talk about America flaws and suggested that Ferguson was a microcosm of it\nObama's attorney general Eric Holder said when it comes to matters of race America has been a nation of cowards close quote and he said that there were a America right now or is involved in ... racism gay free examples\nSays a push for voting rights was a first for for photo voter id was an example a pernicious racism never mind the majority of blacks weren't\nPhoto voter id\nPutin said a as another example of pernicious racism the fact that black boys or expelled or suspended from school and a greater percentage than the other kids in that particular school\nHe a Jesse Jackson even sued and all white school board in Decatur, Illinois for cutting out a bunch of black kids that were fighting after football game you argue that the all white um school board\nWas racist a and that the policy that apply to these black boys was racist\nDecatur defended himself by pointing out all around the country where the school board is all white or school board are considering a pope people of color close quote back black boys are still kicked out disproportionately compared to other boys at that given given school why because they're misbehaving\nThe third example that are Eric Holder gave as an example of punishes racism or is the fact that a black\nCriminal defendant who commit the same crime as a white criminal defendant gets a longer sentence and that is true what Eric Holder didn't tell you is if the U.S sentencing commission or that came up with that with that that also said the reason is for is the fact that judges\nOr when it comes to sentencing will take into consideration you defend this arrest record and it turns out the typical black to send it has a longer arrest record than typical white defend it as a result that black defend it gets a longer sentence nothing to do with racism or the U.S sentencing commission says that\nThe judges are taking into consideration legitimate factors that's all you got Eric Holder that's all you got\nAnd if I had a son he'd look like Trayvon remember that
