Ninety nine cents for the first month Larry Elder dot com that whole area of the dot com I presume would gay is arguing is that there have been times in our nation's history where our growth has been better but there's no question that\nThis is the biggest economy history has ever seen here's what the fed chair recently said\nI'm going to start with an overview of how my colleagues and I see the economy what we decided today and then a bit about or expectations for the months ahead or economy is strong growth is running at a healthy clip unemployment is low the number of people working is rising steadily\nThe valley of this on Phoenix, Arizona you know I've been loving coming out here for a number of years why am I here the Arizona citizens defense league meeting and like I Love this just as of this group is home to me that his family to me\nI Am a lifetime member and it just always an honor to be here thank goodness it's in Phoenix again this year but as an Arizona citizenship and sleek member and a big fan of the organization\nWhenever I have the opportunity to come out to speak and they're kind enough to ask me to speak again this year I'm going to jump on if it gets me an opportunity to come back to what I consider to be home that being\nPhoenix because it's just in my blood\nSo as I'm setting up here today it looks like I'm at a table where everybody's got their name cards out and everybody thinks I'm working here and having to I'm trying to have to explain to everybody that I'm not working here and because I'm not working here I really can't help people with certain name cards so if you hear us get interrupted on that I have to break away for justice\nAnd we're just trying to be really friendly to the best that we can so here we are at the Sheraton crushing in Phoenix, Arizona for armed American radios monster broadcast\nThe week of ten fourteen let's get started as I'm sitting here setting up and then a man into an individual walked up to me and did basically the same thing I was just telling you about asked me a question about the cards that was setting up the computer and the the portable remote studio and I shook his paw and he introduced himself to me as\nCombat Vietnam veteran but your your name first mark\n... marked on my show mark let me you introduce yourself as a combat veteran ladies and gentlemen the reason I Want to talk with a little bit about this and I've asked mark to sit there we've not met before have we know what you are Arizona citizens essentially yes that makes us brothers and I'm a life member and you say you've been a member now for about two and a half years\nFirst off let's go with a combat veteran\nYou began telling your story fascinating I asked you to sit down and I appreciate it if you tell listeners stormed American radio on two hundred plus radio stations around the country right now your story how'd you get here to ... D D L mark\nI served in Vietnam with the United States Navy\nOn a river supply bowed out of the deep water port of denying\nOur mission was to bring supplies to the troops in way and dog on a perfume and probably at reverse [noise]\nGoing up and down those rivers getting shot at it with shrapnel\nFiring our weapons throwing grenades\nWe needed to do that because the troops needed their supplies and you could not send the soldier out\nThe army and Marine Corps out without their supplies and we were carrying their supplies from the deep water port up to nine hours in way during the Tet Offensive I lost three guys from my riverboat and they were good guys they'll and Larry were Twenty one and Mike was\nTwenty years old how old were you mark I was twenty young kid I'm fifty years now I just got back fifty years ago I just got back from Vietnam\nBut I'll tell you I Know what you mean by that but I Want you to explain that\nMy guys didn't die in vain\nOur children our grandchildren freedom and liberty are worth dying for\nConcept here in America we're losing it\nI'm going to get deep here for just a second as okay we've never met so I'm gonna\nI'm at an event you know I'm asking you questions at that\nYou know if I'm if you're uncomfortable let me know when I don't think you will be no that's why you're sitting here ... you made a comment across the table right before I ask you to come on that made me say hey man get over here and how would you joined me for a segment\nAnd that was the comment that you made was they won't let you tell your story in schools right today this is a very dangerous time in America today I think you'll agree with me we're watching very harsh rhetoric come at us from the left\nThreatening violence from what are\nWidely regarded as Democrat leaders we've heard them from Hillary Clinton she can't be civil with us\nWe've heard it from Eric Holder and I don't consider Eric Holder a leader of the Democrat Party I consider him a loud mouth opportunists who will do and say whatever he has to do to stay in front of a camera because he apparently has political aspirations [noise] but he says when we go low\nThey're supposed to kick us [noise] you've got a story to tell but my kick is different ... explain that\nGod's chooses the color of our skin and God she uses it for a man or woman and God chooses our parents are brothers and sisters and God chooses the nation we are born and and I don't judge judge choices that makes no sense to me\nIt takes the race card right off the table well they don't the liberals don't want to hear that sentence it's a simple sense well they don't want to hear that sentence because it it wakes up part of their agenda takes got out of the equation or it takes\nA the race card off the table it takes a whole lot of things\nI Try and teach the kids just look at God's work just look at the work how perfect the world is and look where we are yeah come amazing\nLook how beautiful dislike yes this is the most beautiful places in America and there's more loving the world and there is hey\nWould you would never know that if you were just watching TV or if you were turning on the quote unquote news or if your head was buried in the quote unquote media and I've been teaching people for years to try to get their head out of this garbage and go out and live their lives and look around where they are and see what they see because guess what happens when you do that\nAll of a sudden you find out more people think like me then I'm told all day long and it's not as bad as I'm being told all day long I really am mainstream isn't that right\nThat's what you need to understand\nYour purpose in your place in the world\nAnd if you can't see God's work who who will look at yours well we'll look at your work no matter what happens in this world by itself you know the political left will never push us that way they're trying to terrorist out there trying to keep us from the news they want to destroy freedom in America why because socialism is their goal\nAnd socialism has been part of their agenda they've been quiet about it it's just been building for decades just but here's the lesson from Vietnam that they don't speak about\nThe great lesson from Vietnam was\nThe communists were supplying the north Vietnamese with a everything they could to defeat us and they realized they couldn't beat America through our military\nCouldn't do it but they saw the weakness at home\nWe elected bimbos ...\nAs our leaders\nAnd they were the ones that lost that war wasn't our economy so what happens is now here's of\nThe concept the communists learned that they need they could destroy America from within by supporting these idiots propaganda that we elect alright now\nLet me let me stop you for a second because you're going deep I could keep you for three hours but we have other believe me I really could I Do it's it's an honor to sit here and talk with you but it's a propaganda that we're talking about is what you're talking about they can beat us from within and they did it during the Vietnam War you know that first year doing is they're now that's where I Want to go with you know you're seeing that regenerate aren't you\nBecause the God the United states has a covenant with God that people don't speak about and the covenant is we're supposed to be the greatest nation economically militarily and spiritually\nThat our enemies with our in our shadow and the world would be a safer place well thank God for Donald Trump he's making us stronger\nWell you're not you watch Ninety two percent negative coverage and in today's day and age what again with how do I get to see how do how do we get to\n... and my job I Believe my mission was to get to those many high schools as I couldn't speak to as many young people as I could to give them the basic\nHave great America really is how successful are you getting in those schools\nI've been doing it for Eighteen years now and in the beginning I got the ten to twelve thousand kids a year now I'm lucky to make a thousand kids why because the liberals have taken over our educational system\nThe liberals have taken over our colleges and universities are high schools we can't I Can't get into any\nSo let me again there's always method to my madness where when I asked these questions you and you'll know what road I'm going down I Know you're well\nWe've known liberals event infiltrating our systems are our culture our our movies are films are just about everything music now Taylor Swift run in her mouth as far as I'm concerned\nJust shut up and play music and stop alienating half of America same thing with LeBron James Robert De Niro I Can't even watch Goodfellas anymore because of Robert Deniro so we've seen this coming what you were just talking about for quite some time\nThis is my question is is Democrat Republican it's an honor to sit here and talk with a man who's been through what you went through in defense of this nation talking about losing friends of yours that twenty Twenty one years old what\nDemocrat what American wouldn't want you talking to our kids about what is part of our history I just want them to\nHere's my line to these kids after you explain what their freedom cost how children used in Vietnam\nGiven that you have to explain the price of freedom then I my question to them as we are going to give your freedom to you can give it to drugs Alcohol Tobacco having a baby too young jail socialism or you can keep it for yourself you're not with what you do show is it okay now today but it's not out trying to explain to them\nI Would like them to keep their freedom for themselves and what they have to do to do that is just study\nThe declaration of independence the constitution and the bill of rights just understand what it says I have to go to the Bible and read what is trying to teach you just understand it's pretty much in a while but isn't it yes absolutely\nThat I use the Bible it right the gods as do I have a copy of the constitution within arm's length of me right now we went on your first or should we need to get back to that in America\nAmerica armed American radio sponsor broadcasts you get just a taste of what you're going to hear for the rest of the day today stick around with me from these remote

every year I think yeah I I find the irony in Michael Bloomberg to be absolutely hilarious if it weren't so dangerous because of the money that he's capable spending I use this analogy [noise]\nThis is a guy who wants to take away sugar sodas wants to keep eating bad foods right you're shaking your head also is to actually control you know he's running as a Democrat he was a ... a Republican now he's an independent see this is a guy that has no convictions but don't you find it ironic you stand up on the podium at the New York hotdog eating contest every year\nWhile he wants to take away oh you know things that causes obesity while he's introducing when he was mayor anyway well he's introducing folks are going to ... shutdown sixty five hotdogs in ten minutes\nYou know the whole irony of this thing gets me and and so with ... ... if this guy who go\nIt's a typical rich guy who sings because he made so much money\nHe's so much smarter than everybody else all he did was smarter he was smart enough to make more money that will at was well he up the guns that surround him when he won let's not never he won't give up anything this security I bet you his security at his house is far greater than most people you've got an army at his house yeah they can afford it\nBut he thinks because he's that smart\nWe Martin and everybody we've got about a fallacy of the the the left we've got about a valley so you're the Democrat\nWe've got about a minute ... directly to armed American radio listeners and tell them why it's so important that they stand up and be heard and fight for these rights\nCarry a weapon and when you can carry it in an open area carrying an open area so that everybody can see that\nDoes guns around and that's the bad guys can see you it's not about the good guys seeing you know it's about the bad guys seeing how many guns are out there and they got to rethink how they're going to be\nUm trying they're evil and that's the deal that guns in the way and it's supposed to be because good people need to carry them more and more good people\nMarked on my show there was a real pleasure meeting you\nI mean I'm Glad I had the opportunity God works in mysterious

mattress that I'm dealing with in a war doesn't go away\nYou said that it's been ... years and years and you feel you just left Vietnam\nI just got home and last month I got home\nAnd and er\nWow it's
