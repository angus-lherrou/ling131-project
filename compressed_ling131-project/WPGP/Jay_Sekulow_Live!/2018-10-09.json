disrespect the rule of law and they are showing disregard for those who are following the law\nAll Americans not only in the states most heavily affected but in every place in this country are rightly disturbed by the large numbers of illegal aliens entering our country the jobs they home I'd otherwise be held by citizens or legal immigrant the public service they use impose burdens on our taxpayers\nWe have to listen to the concerns that working ... hour for a guy working people have\nOver their record pace of immigration and its impact on their jobs wages housing schools tax bills and general living conditions these are valid\nConcerns expressed by decent unpatriotic citizens\nFrom all backgrounds all over\nIt making it easy to be an illegal alien there's no how about offering a

strengthen and expenditures across the country\nThat we all agree on the need to better secure the border to punish reporters who choose to hire illegal immigrants\nThat's why our administration is moved aggressively to secure our borders more by hiring a record number of new border guards by deporting twice as many criminal aliens as ever before\n\n\n[noise] moving\nForward [noise] we wish you the campaigners for illegal immigrants who are arrested for any crime watch and they wouldn't be placed into I mean ...\nWe will try to do more to speed the deportation of illegal aliens who arrested

security new technology new facilities and more people to stop process and deport illegal immigrants\nBy cracking down on illegal hiring by barring welfare benefits to illegal aliens\nOur enforcement priorities will include removing criminals gang members security\nThreats visa overstays public charges that is is relying on public welfare restraining the safety net along with millions of recent illegal arrivals\nRight now we've got millions of illegal immigrants who live and work here without knowing their identity or back row\nBut we are also a nation of laws it is wrong and ultimately self defeating for a nation of immigrants to permit the kind of abusive our immigration laws we have seen in recent years and we must do more to stop\nA we simply cannot allow people to pour into the
