A. G. E.\nThat his dog actual thing people say this is what you do ... you just\nFollowing who's been ready to DC or politically correct dismayed learn so it does say Larry Elder\n\nLarry over here the said from South central the unit just lowering the rates ... dome neurons are welcome to the program allow because we've got to cut me to say though is guaranteed a\n\nSub go dribble\nEight nine seven one S. H. G. E. triple eight nine to them and one seven to for three very older relief backyard calm studio we've been talking about this migrant caravan that according to a Mexican newspaper has now reached fourteen thousand people Van Jones CNN I think it's much more likely that Donald Trump is thanks\nThis them for ... to be paying for this is exactly the worst kind of think there'd be happening or in a moment like this because what it does is it gives a mother talking points down prop look at these invading hordes et cetera so I Do want to say one thing\nJust because someone is Middle Eastern of course there are no Middle Eastern people there but that doesn't mean that they're ... added doesn't mean that there are terrorists how do you know that\nWe were in this world now where Trump can say Middle Eastern and everybody then immediately somehow begin to think of terrorists but most of the terrorists that we are just as we've had the United states are not being committed by Middle Eastern people or by Muslims\nThere being committed by right wing fingers at our own country but I just ... this was a lie on top of lie on top ally wrapped up in live and then with his life went on top of it\nSo we should just let fourteen thousand people come here and so and if fourteen thousand more when a company can come to\nThis is outrageous\nWhat country will put up with this with Mexico\nPut up with a caravan of fourteen thousand what am I trying to get into their country are you kidding me\n\n[noise] according to the Washington Post\nQuote for now Mexican police have merely step aside as a caravan his past watching first as migrants took raft across the river to separate the country from Guatemala and then it continued by foot along the main highway chanting thief a poodle or yes we did get\n\nThe Washington Post continues the response appears to him that respond to appear to have been conveyed to the White House and now once again Mexico's most important bilateral relationship appears to be on shaky ground okay\nTrump tweeted sadly it looked like Mexico's police and military or aren't able to stop the caravan heading to the southern border of the United states\nLater on he said on Fox News I don't know what's going on with Mexico it looked like people are walking right through the middle of Mexico I'm not exactly thrilled they're either end of the\nGovernment said they were going to do something about it according to the Washington Post poll riot police have stopped to pose for pictures in their gear as if ready to combat the migrants many international TV crews filmed them before retreating\nAnd letting the caravan pass through undeterred [noise]\nTrump refer to himself at a nationalist and today in the in the oval office you clarified\nWe want to see the money to this lady is\nWilling to say\nThat I Love our country and our country has taken several second federal if you look at the trade deals and nobody knows are better than me\nI'm knocking out some of the worst deals I've ever seen when we're giving all of our wealth all of our money to other countries and then they don't treat us properly where we're protecting other rich countries very very rich countries including by the way a country that happens to be very much and then it was Saudi Arabia\nAnd mentally wealthy and we're taking care of the military for a fraction of the costs not fair to us other countries also immensely wealthy\nCountries as we have to get reimbursed for that we should not be the world's police keeper and not get reimbursed and by the way when I bring up to the edge of the countries like Japan\nPrime minister I'll be a friend of mine I bring it up\nHe looks at me and he goes I understand they understand that nobody has ever asked them what have you ever asked\nEvery other than us like you have to be like help out nobody has ever asked so that's a\nPretty unfair thing I'll get back to you all go back to his wait wait wait wait\nAt all I Want is for our country to be treated with respect that's what he means [noise] she she knew she was do we know he's a white nationalist that's a bone thrown to the races except maybe\nIt's for white people because white people won't vote for a guy most of them if they think they're racist\nBefore a couple of seconds I should have a pretty good report versus the yes side\nIs just to follow on your known as the losers were sending coded language ... some ... that would really be\nThere is a concern that you're assuming recorded message or a dog whistle out there there is a concern passive voice you mean that's what you think he's doing but you know\nI've never even heard that I cannot imagine that you mean I I'm a naturalist I never heard that theory about being a nationalist I've heard them all but I'm somebody that loves our country when I say a nationalist I don't like it when Germany is paying one percent of GDP report report says Jim Acosta\nFor NATO and we're paying for point three percent I don't like that that's not fair I don't like it was as an example we're protecting a hero and we're paying for almost the entire cost of the day that we're paying for a very very substantial portion\nFar greater than what it should be a we have great respect for those countries but on top of that I don't like it when they put up barriers to our farmers were farmers cannot sell it to Europe they have trade barriers that make it you guys know it's better than anybody than trade barriers that are\nAs severe as China's trade barriers which really coming down they want to make a deal very badly there'll be coming down\nBut I Am very proud of our country we cannot continue to allow what's happened to our country to continue to have on can't let it happen so I'm proud proud of our country that I Am a nationalist is a word that has it been used too much\nMoney as it but I'm very proud I think it should be brought back I'm somebody that wants to help other countries of the world\nBut I also have to take a whim to take care of our country\nWe cannot continue to allow\nOurselves to be due to the military and also jumped on track with the European Union as an example last year on trade when it was one hundred and fifty one billion dollars on top of that we lost hundreds of billions of dollars on protection and so we protect\nAnd we get killed ... do the training and they get killed can't do it\nI Want it to be fair so I Want them to open their borders I Want them to make it fair for our farmers are our companies are medical companies they sell medical equipment they just put restrictions on\nYear and a half ago with a medical equipment can't get into Europe even though it's better than what they are so they have to treat as well all I Want our country is to be treated well to be treated with respect for many years other countries that are allies of ours so that once\nThey have not treated our country's fairly so in that sense I Am absolutely a nationalist sub rather than\nYes the effort you said um this\nLast night in Texas [laughter] for the Trump referred to Maxine Waters\nToday part [noise]\nWhat what criminal aliens that American citizens which is why Democrats voted out of office when they\nHave to surrender Congress and she'd pull a secret shop sure\nMaxine Waters that severe they\nYou get that one\nShe's going to be in charge of the\nMass killing image [noise]\n[noise] when we come back President Trump talked about Saudi Arabia and what his response to the death of the Washington\nPost Saudi journalist [noise] we'll be all that's coming up AAA mentioned one S. H. G. and about one in ten young people get their news from late night TV and consider speed Kobe or to be the most trusted news source I Do not make this off I'm wary older [noise]\nYou are out of ought to shut up\nLarry Elder all through all the\nTibet is agree just conduct is abhorrent to everything we hold dear and sacred as Americans my administration will provide additional updates as they become available and I just want to thank everybody for their understanding [noise]\nWe're extremely angry upset unhappy about what we would this this morning and we will get to the bottom of it we will get\nTo the bottom of it in the president pledges we will find you and that is exactly what I Believe is going to happen in the meantime speculation as to who or what is behind all of this is all the last past and there are blaming Republicans they're blaming President Trump\nNancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer issued a joint statement saying that time and time again the president has condones physical violence number one we have no idea who is doing this number do we have no idea what their political ideology is maybe they don't even like the president number three\nHow hypocritical is\nFor the left leaders like pollution Schumer\nWho have sat by in silence not condemning the calls for violence and intimidation and harassment expressed by their own members of their own party like Cory Booker like job Maxine Waters like Hillary Clinton herself\nOver and over and over again in current like Eric Holder kick up a like a Tim Kaine former vice presidential candidate take this fight to the streets\nThey're encouraging physical confrontations every day they do not disavow those physical threats they do not just about anti pose actual\nAssault on people and now they're claiming that it's Trump who is condone physical violence and is responsible for these are potentially explosive devices being sent a prominent Democrats I don't buy a word of it\nLet's go to Houston, Texas will you're on the Larry Elder show it's Bob brand sitting in for will go running or for a Larry rather go right ahead\n[laughter] now you're afraid I either but I'm doing great I'm ... ... covered\nThings man you know ... from from the words of Robin manual you never let a good something along the lines of you know a good crisis go to waste right and and ... you know we see that with the Democrats man\nAnd and and they were or are trying to slap to blame or on Trump for there's like you said we don't even know you know who who do this on what their ideology is or anything I'm a ... they would try to try to get in a lot real quick you know the the the media man is is they\nThe media and the lip and general they they have made themselves the word pull each you know they try to try to control you know the mission of of a man and woman and and races and everything and and if you if you remember\nWhen Ted Cruz made the statement about New York value out out of me media just lost their oh yeah yeah well what\nWhat does he mean oh my God you know and they literally did we stole crazy because the man to New York you know one good way of what Mitch\nBut but but I didn't know that you know we do this then it will make our first yeah the the low income uh ... not not no information voters get a trigger though you know and so there and and that's exactly what they're doing this situation with his own that's nationalism things funny funny thing I Would say this I'm a go\nI had no idea 'cause we hear the word patriotism all the time\nYou rarely hear the word national is right and so I Know myself I I really I never really heard that except for you know in terms of you know races Crazy Stupid white or whatever so I actually looked it up\nYou know after Trump's it is and I saw you know ... this new era dot com it's there's right there plain as day is ... is\nWith patriotism and so I went wow okay\nI never knew this I I you know I never really paid that much attention to some of the okay I see what he's saying you know and and and and and the you know this is just another one of those opportunities with a meat that you know they sit around and it's almost like they sit around and just wait\nOn some triggered to to make their their their their their [laughter] you\nKnow and and if it never comes ... if they wait on it a will and then it never comes then they invented they make it happen that's exactly what this shows that's why they said well he didn't say white so we have to stick that word in and then kind of spread the message that he was talking
