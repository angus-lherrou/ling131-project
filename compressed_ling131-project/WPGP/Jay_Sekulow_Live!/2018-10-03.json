I mean I was very very uncomfortable with what a what a lot of\nThe promises that that went into this whole uh you know interaction I mean there was an assumption that of course we want to get rid of the blacks and that this young Harvard educated you know work with that but it's going to come up with a great solution had accomplished that it was awful\nAnd it was humorous planned the one that you just outlined about relocating them on the basis of these are going to be refurbished and then they get right up first refusal they wouldn't be able to do a forward to pay for it and voila they will be gone this was Schumer outlining this plan\nRight that's how they were selling them to say look what a genius he came up with a strategy would have thought is this is a massive stroke\nMhm now this plant never gotten implemented or do you know why not\nWell they do get in for months and then that they did do the refurbishing but uh they underestimated the capacity of the people to move back they\nWere able to raise the father who came back most of them and there's pretty much the neighborhood is the same as always been except that uh the blacks ended up with with better housing which was all for the good but that was not the intent is\nWhat is your father think of this plan\nWell my father was not really that political figure and uh and I didn't really discuss it with him I was a teenager and to me it was is revolting mhm so\nUm why did you take so long before writing about this you were sixteen years old but you didn't write about that was a kid\nAt the time but that but that's really what got me motivated to politics at all the years as I was getting engaged and as a writer I used to write for the Jewish magazines and eventually abroad and into the Washington DC magazines and I was working my way up\nThe ladder so to speak I always wanted to tell my story and in fact in Nineteen Ninety six\nI was a there was a fellow named Robert L Virgo who's running against sure for Congress and I actually went to apply to become his campaign manager and like you know who you are like ... you come from\nAs you don't understand I this man is\nIs ah you know even personified I if I could do I think to bring him down I was so so of course uh the local Republicans I never heard of me at the time and I and I didn't get the job but [noise] but uh so just to show you how passionate I was about that and I was also particularly offensive because\nHe was the congressmen for\nA very orthodox Jewish section in New York or he would go around and and pander to them or talk a little year this stuff like that mhm and then he would take their votes these is a really holy wonderful people\nAnd he would use their votes for all the evil society to manageable ... show was the most reliable vote for Bush is anything any type of thing that that involves\nA you know undermining right traditional society is the most reliable vote and his power came from or sex too sweet people who who is a good\nWe're ... we're we're putting ... article up on Larry on the dot com race to the top by Jay Honda Jay thank you very much for coming on maybe this time somebody will finally asked Chuck Schumer about this J. thing coming on the and I really appreciate it always a plus you\nGot it and now Schumer is blasting Kevin off for lacking the appropriate demeanor of a judge what kind of demeanor did you show when you were pushing that race is planning to get rid of blacks sir\nIf you say well maybe he's telling the truth and maybe he's not he doesn't belong on the Supreme Court\nAnd I think most Americans are saying that\nAgain even if you want to discount as some people do what happens when he was Fifteen in high school and Eighteen in college\nAnd how were you when you propose that racing scheme that day on that just spoke about\nYou Tana camp where he is saying and protesting at age fifty three\nHey if you were a racist in Nineteen Seventy four you're probably a racism twenty Eighteen right\nWhen it flies in the face being truthful unbelievable that's the key question here their demeanor you shorten show the demeanor of a judge at the hearing there is partisanship\nHe brought out the most raw form of partisanship so under coming of someone on the district court federal appeals court let alone the Supreme Court\nAnd he did not\nShow any semblance to always being a hundred per cent honest than truthful which is what we need in a Supreme Court justice\nNow this week at the FBI supposed to take the Democrats really wanted to be wrapped up in the weeks we're talking about that Renee in Little Rock Arkansas wants to weigh in on Mr Schumer Renee please don't leave town\nIn yesterday I asked you a couple of questions that you are women have you ever been a victim of sexual assault you or a man have you ever been a victim of sexual assault at the end of this hour I'll give you the results of them have a brand new question for you for tonight triple eight nine seven one S.
