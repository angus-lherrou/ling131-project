laughter they love to really kill people or intelligence blurry older a colleague of mine who happens to be black I think it's only relevant because we're talking about racism here doesn't think Trump is only racism there to see an analysis of sitting on July was ... he is aware and it doesn't mean that he is smart\nBut when a Donald Trump suggest Maxine Waters says a low IQ\nCourse he's racist but Don Lemon can say that I'm not very smart and um they mentioned ritual the intelligence of Kanye West not a problem\nThat we can only do that if we elect people who are going to back our agenda and

Brett Kavanaugh there was talk of impeaching venues Supreme Court justice if Democrats take control of the housing\nBut will you support would you support an impeachment effort if your party\nControls the house the I word impeachment when it comes to office the president any longer but now I'm Brett Kavanaugh it's something that you and support if he were elected in Congress\nThey think it is a good move for Democrats politically ... ethically morally to pursue potentially an investigation that could lead to impeachment\nNow than painting not the president but Brett Kavanaugh now that he's in Supreme Court justice riding on this idea that Democrats are are if the Democrats intend to empty such Kavanaugh as the way to keep the enthusiasm about the nomination and flag is it realistic\nTo expect an investigation that could potentially end with impeachment\nProceeding cabinet off they get control of the house possibly looking at impeachment uh what do you make of those pledges if there will be an attempt to impeach a justice capital\nI think that it shouldn't be that would you support the house investigation at the start for an impeachment vote and to judge Kavanaugh for Democrats could launch impeachment proceedings open investigations hearings against Kavanaugh but again the entire ... how much pressure\nAre Democrats here under when their vote for their voters to do something like in ph Brett Kavanaugh\nWhen you want peace when we've only had one heavy now ... into sweaty are afraid of everything it's like oh we can have Hillary Clinton talk because it will

threw him off the bench\nAnd then he ran for Congress played the race card and there he fit as we speak are getting back to CNN and the trashing Kanye West rocky sellers is a democratic strategist why isn't the comment he just now may bigoted\nI'm not sure he and using them as a prop per se but what Kanye West of done with Donald Trump is what other people have done who gravitated in his in his orbit which is just shower him with adulation for what reason I have no idea um but ... my issue with Kanye West is is quite simple um is that anti intellectualism simply isn't cool\nAnd Kanye West these issues as you say to these issues that they're going to talk about our our issues that are that are central issues and many African American communities are very important issues\nBut the fact is we're not sending Kanye West of the White House to talk about these issues because he can't he doesn't have the depth to um I Want to hear what Kanye West wants to do a when we're talking about criminal justice reform or prisoner reentry the fact that he cannot he doesn't have that that just the other day\nHe was talking about a film programs and how we needed to have more than programs that
