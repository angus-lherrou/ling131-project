imagine what the country would be with Donald Trump as our president for the country could be four years for the court it could be I don't even want to contemplate that now it's time for us to move to lose even he's a fake or\nHe has no consistency about him he said whatever comes into his hand at the moment he really has an eagle how has he gotten away with not turning over his tax returns the press seem to be very gentle with him on that at first I thought it was funny referring to Donald Trump's candidacy to think that there's a possibility that he could be president\nI think he's gotten so much free publicity every other candidate has had a turnover tax returns\nEnd of quote that was Ruth Bader Ginsburg letting you know how she felt about this Kennedy name Donald Trump cannot imagine him becoming president\nWhat he did now she apologized she said she shouldn't have said that I shouldn't have commented on a candidate and nobody calls her a partisan hack\nDo they have something else

illegally those who employ them and those who disrespect the rule of law close quote twenty sixteen eight years later that language was completely gone\nWhen Obama was running for reelection recall he was called a Porter in chief by Louis ...\nAnd then he said he would defer the deportation of undocumented immigrants arrived here\nNew York times wrote Obama quote with facing growing pressure from the Tina leaders and Democrats Warren that because of his harsh immigration enforcement his support with lagging among Latinos who could be crucial in his race for reelection cold cold\nAnd that shows you why the Democrats changed their rhetoric on immigration provoked\nLet's go back in time shall we\nBut those who enter the country illegally and those who employ them just respect the rule of law and they are showing disregard for those who are following the law\nAll Americans not only in the states most heavily affected but in every place in this country are rightly disturbed by the large numbers of illegal aliens entering our country the jobs they home I'd otherwise be held by citizens or legal immigrant the public service they use impose burdens on our taxpayers\nWe have to listen to the concerns that working ... hour forgot working people have over the record pace of immigration and its impact on their jobs wages housing schools tax\nBills and general living conditions these are valid concerns expressed by decent unpatriotic citizens from\nAll backgrounds all over\nIt making it easy to be an illegal alien is now how about offering a reward for being in a legal I notice that no sane country wouldn't do that right\nIn approaching immigration reform I Believe we must act tough practical reforms been insured and promote the legal and orderly and free of immigrants into our

immigrants who are arrested for any crime watch\nAnd they wouldn't be placed into I mean we\nWe will try to do more to speed the deportation of illegal aliens who are arrested for crimes to better identify illegal aliens in the workplace as recommended by the commission headed by former congresswoman Barbara Jordan\nI continue to believe that we need stronger enforcement on the border and at the workplace\nThat means a workable mandatory system that employers must use to verify the legality of their workers\nIf you break our laws by entering this country without permission and give birth to a child we reward that child with US citizenship\nAnd guarantee of equal access to all public in social services this society provides and that's a lot of services isn't any wonder that two thirds
