weeks back\nTry to anyway best I could took a few days went down to the seaside beach area you know just a little bit east the dust in West to Panama City the route thirty a area of the Florida Panhandle gorgeous beaches down there and when I had a house\nRented for about four days when I got down there I found out that there was some construction work going on in the house I said no no no not going to happen in the house I paid for not going to happen right so a\nRather than make a stink outta the deal you know what I decided to do I decided to play nice with everybody\nWith the with the real estate agent with the with the the the ... the managing company which I Believe was Wyndham I play nice with them and you know and and I had an opportunity\nTo me it just re store my state really in these tough incredibly difficult trying political times in America today sometimes we we tend to look at things through that prism we don't know who we are talking to and sometimes we pack we'd go on the attack because we're so edgy\nWe just don't know when this this this world we live in today puts us in that terrible mood\nAnd you know I met some great people one of them was a guy named Vance garrison who was the roof or doing the work at the house and I had a conversation with my son I look on vacation he says no we don't want to mess with your vacation when are you leaving\nI saw it on Wednesday he says will see on Wednesday did enjoy your time off and it was everything just worked out perfect amazing what being nice can do you get it back\nIs what I'm telling you you get

over with and we're going to keep them for a couple of segments I've got a surprise for coming in from Rob Pincus about a video you got to see I gotta squeeze man in the final segment so let's go right smack the Alan Gottlieb founder of the second amendment foundation Alan how\nThe heck are you lose faith in humanity out there isn't there out there are great people out there when you find the right\n[noise] yeah they're all gonna owners [laughter]\nThey are all gone if I can attest to that I Know Vance and the rest of those guys are where we had some just fantastic conversation and you're right they absolutely are\nBoy but it was it was a it was kind of an eye opening thing you go in and you think bad attitude and then what do you do you draw bad things going with a great attitude and great things happened\nSo I just wanted to just kind of want to throw that let's start with this this is the gorilla elephant whatever you want to call it in the room cabin off like you've got to tell me how you feel the bruising think\nWow I feel really great I think or any of it and the guides community should be on cloud nine ah this is very important battles with the lights\nOn that specialist static because we have to start petitions from the states in Memphis nation cutting us crude court this term and of course a cat and I was a that would give us a lot of problems in in getting those a circuit dishes either heard or you know\nAre getting a confirmation for the Supreme Court to correct the lawsuits\nSo I'm kind of excited on in the on pins and needles the session of the two important cases one man's coming out of the ... circuit when we wanted the trial court level and then lost by one vote and embarked panel\nAnd the ... circuit that's the suit that knocked out for a while at least the interstate ban on sales handguns tend to Nineteen sci fi ...\nAnd it says when you're in the same lab a instant background check all across the country there's no reason now why you could buy it shouldn't be able to buy an anywhere it's the same background check and then our second suit his tenure at California and the Ninth Circuit\nWere overturned a you know again I mean by panel in the Ninth Circuit a and that's the one that deals with California so called Hank roster that showing diminishing our Hank as their last for sale California every year\nA and virtually no new hangers get edited less old fall officers less less choice for buying hanging in the state of California at also deals with so called Microsoft apple requirement or where any new new handgun has to be able to be ... show micro standing out on it when you know if I had a cartridge\nUm and and the technology it's unproven and only as a single source provider to it\nAh and it's a real problem so I'm kind of excited about both those cases and and now I have a lot of the culture this coming year\nOh my gosh you know Alan I have to listen to your [noise]\nThose are pages of notes of things that I Want to talk with you about and you kind of it's so easy for you to just make it easy for me to crumble is up from wind okay let's go down some of the rabbit hole that you just opened up their let's talk briefly about the two cases now that Kavanaugh is on the court\nWhat I heard and I'm speaking on behalf of my listeners just make sure that they understand what I heard I Want to\nGet they get that information to them what I understand now is that with these two petitions now waiting that the court is getting ready to look at these in upcoming conferences or you're getting ready to file these where are we\nThere filed a we're waiting for the ... were waiting for the conference assignments right now or some kind of random ... you know there should be hopefully they'll take the case is and hopefully we'll have argued that so we're going to wear on pins and needles right now All right so\nLet me play a little bit of devil's advocate we know what happened with Gorsuch and with Thomas at the ... when they when the court did not grant search to that what I felt was a very very important case out there in California I really wish I knew all of us in the gun rights community had thought and hope and pray that they were going to take they did not\nAnd of course Gorsuch and Thomas penned a scathing I guess the descent\nTo why they should have a you know blaming the fact that the courts have been afraid of Second Amendment as of late treating it as a second class right having said that\nIt does this if either of these two cases get in to that pushes back further for any other cases that might be upcoming in other words will the court look at this and say you know what we don't want to take these yet or if we take these maybe not take one of these concealed carry cases down the road you have to be concerned with that\nWell one never knows no one knows what the logic is I don't want to take this all I can say is that you know as last year list is probably now it takes four justices or science type decide to hear a case right but it takes five it takes five to win it and usually if this for don't think they have this year so they don't want to take the case\nSo one would have to make the assumption that the reason why brutal wasn't cake you once they weren't sure they had the ...\nI'm hoping now we have this is talk\nAll right we're going to call this segment one for the books when we come back I'm going to continue with Alan Gottlieb founder of the second amendment foundation of got a number of things I Want to talk with them about\nListeners if you have any
