talking about the fourteenth amendment yesterday interview John each man the former dean at Chapman University school of law and we talked about this here's what President Trump said\nOn immigration some legal scholars believe you can get rid of the ... citizenship without changing the constitution Wade executive order exactly right or have you thought about this law it was always told me\nThat you needed a constitutional a member cussing line and you don't need a number one number one you don't need that number ... motions well you can definitely do it with an act of Congress but now they're saying I can do it just was an executive order\nNow how ridiculous we're the only country in the world where a person comes in has a baby and the baby is essentially a citizen of the United states for eighty five years with all of those benefits to kill us it's ridiculous and it has to end\nHave you talked about that with council you have to wear in the process in the process it will happen\nWith an executive order that's what you're talking about it as if I was thinking about I didn't think anybody but I knew that but me I thought it was the only one China could guess good press\nIssue when can he do this with an executive order\nWell I Believe because let's let's be real or for the president cannot amend the constitution and executive order Congress and amend the constitution by an act of Congress and the Supreme Court\nIsn't supposed to be able to amend the constitution by issuing a judgment or ruling\nBut that's not what the president is talking about here the constitution doesn't require birthright citizenship\nAs anybody born here and subject to the jurisdiction are citizens all he's trying to do it clarify what that phrase subject to the jurisdiction me and it doesn't mean anybody who happened to be subject to our laws because they're physically present here it meant something much more complete than that oh in the lead into the country being part of the body politic\nAnd that's what the debate of the fourteenth amendment make clear that's what the early Supreme Court decisions on that's made clear and the Supreme Court has never held otherwise\nAre we now so so that would mean that the children of citizens\nOr the children of lawful permanent residents are automatically citizens by virtue of the fourteenth amendment\nBut the children of temporary visitor whether it's a tourist visa or either ... or ... or or certainly the children are people who are not lawfully present in the United states at all or not automatic citizens according to the constitution and the president is trying to safely apply\nThat cause it was drafted and ratified and an ad that matter the people that path\nForty five seconds left professor I thought there was some sort of Supreme Court case that came out in the early eighties have some sort of footnote which people a point to to argue that anybody who's in the country even legally has a child on the American soil or is an automatic citizen isn't there some sort of case that people point to that rightly or wrongly they use to make that argument\nThey do they apply liver at all and it's ridiculous that said that they have to provide free education\nTo the children of illegal immigrants under the equal protection clause and excited a footnote that says look they're they're they're off of citizens if they're born here\nBut that was not a holding of the day it was hot it is in the case it was just what we called that stuff that the Supreme Court for the back of that ad added something\nWe come back I'll tell you about what the author of the fourteenth amendment his claws that his name is senator Jacob Howard also there was an Eighteen eighty four Supreme Court case a rule that of Native American born\nUnder the jurisdiction of Native American tribes not unilaterally making so United States citizen and I was Eighteen eighty four case Eighteen Ninety a case to court ruled a child born in this country to legal\nResident Chinese immigrants was included in the birthright citizenship but they have never ruled that a child born to illegal aliens on American soil is an automatic citizen yet that is how that fourteenth amendment has been interpreted and what I Believe Donald Trump is doing with this executive order is trying to spark\nA Supreme Court challenge to the executive order that ultimately will go all the way up to the Supreme Court\nAnd the justices she hopes and I hope will rule the way the senator\nJacob Howard who drafted this intended it would
