giant enormous show and two hundred affiliates that don't get to hear the daytime show you're going to love it so let me start with why was I in Arizona to begin with\nThe Arizona citizens defensively [noise] excuse me has asked me to speak I have three or four times now I I I've lost count\nBut I Love speaking of that event each year I'm a life member now so here's kind of my progression of my speaking relationship with the folks out of Arizona citizens eventually I actually woke up in tombstone Arizona number of years ago put my genes on drawing a shirt strapped on a firearm\nPut my stepson on put my fry boots on\nThe gun on my hip and drove to Tucson to speak to the Arizona citizens defensively meeting and I thought that was kind of cool when it dawned on me man I woke up and tombstone Arizona today put my boots my ... my gun on it came up here to Tucson to speak to\nOne of the greatest pro gun rights organizations grassroots organizations in the country I thought that was kind of cool to me that school stuff because I Love Arizona and I put you in particular I Love to them\nSo I thought that was it but I was a basic member of the organization at that time card carrying the next year I spoke as a sustaining member in Phoenix and then a couple of years later this year I speak as a life member and I couldn't be more proud of that fact\nSo this year\nI Am Alan Gottlieb and who you hear on the program founder of the second amendment foundation usually hear around every week out and I've been planning on personal trip the tombstone for just a couple of days to get out what turns out\nThat Gordon Anderson who we met in shots show in Vegas a couple of years ago invited us out along with the mayor of tombstone\nTo assist them with and appear at their freedom day celebration in honor of their proclamation of America's first proclaimed officials Second Amendment city\nBut it happened kind of quick and both of us were unable to get out there in June for personal reasons so we came out there this past week now\nWe had already pre planned this trip\nSo it was an awful lot of fun to pop into town Allen an eye on Monday we stayed until Tuesday we brought to live armed American radio daily shows from that living breathing history museum I've also broadcasted from tombstone in the past number of years about four years ago as well\nSo we were there for a number of reasons not just the history in the front of the town but we were working both days in fact Allen tend to USA Today op ed piece from malaria and motel and assisted me a production of both radio program so not all play I can assure used a lot of work going on\nBut here's the fun part and you're going to hear this in the third our today as I bring you the actual daily program for Monday This week from tombstone where my first guest was the tombstone mare\nDustin ask the pool who unbeknownst to Alan Gottlieb in myself prior to the program presented each of us with an honorary citizen of tombstone plaque\nAlong with two golden keys to the city now again if you know anything about me that's the coolest thing that's ever happened to me because I've been going after Tucson for twenty five plus years\nSo to have that to me was an absolute incredible honor I had no idea that he was going to do that and it took both of us by surprise I have that plaque sitting right here and I can promise you that's the coolest thing and I have a lot of cool things on the walls studio I can promise you from NASCAR stuff to gun stuff\nTo this this right here ranks right up there AS number one or at least tied for number one\nBut I got to tell you what were we doing there why were we there because we're beginning assisting that incredible little town with their upcoming freedom day celebration in June of twenty Nineteen next year where I can promise you will be there\nThey're thinking big into stone and they want our help and we are more than happy to assist them and we will be bringing some big names to that town in June I Can't give you the list of who who yet as it's building and we've got to reach out to a number of people but let's just say there will be a number of huge national celebrity figures\nAs are expected to be out there pro gun rights celebrities yeah hard to find right but they're out there some of them made movies that you might be familiar with like why it too so you know that kind of stuff\nIn fact right now Val Kilmer is into zone as I speak to you right now he got into town today we're hopeful that maybe we can bring him back again\nIn June he's been there before but delicious building from movie stars to talk radio host that you listen to and see on national TV politicians newsmakers\nSo it's going to be a giant enormous event into stone and we want you to make the pilgrimage with us there will be more on that over upcoming shows a months as we get closer to ... to believe me just going to be on you like that just going to happen so we'll have more on this throughout the year but suffice to say you'll hear a lot about it\nIn the third our specifics about it\nIs I talked to two of the city of tombstone movers and shakers Mr Gordon Anderson and married Dusten esque will who by the way that the conversation with him which is fascinating his family history you know he's going to tell you about it in the third our but it is just extremely cool one of the victims\nKilled by the earth's at the gunfight at the OK Corral had eighty dollars in his pocket given to him\nBy the ... great grandfather for payments earlier that day
