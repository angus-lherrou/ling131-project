recollection is the absolute truth I'm asking this as a lawyer do you feel a hundred percent certain that the events that she described um ah are true and are therefore disqualify look I I watch as much of her testimony as I could\nI found her very credible\nYou have to ask yourself why would anybody put themselves through this if they\nDid you ask a that same question about when he to

this was a fascinating exchange between ... between Chris Cuomo and Rick Santorum who will keep saying that Kevin testified that he was pure that he was a horrible you know you didn't\nIf he's lying about anything in this context short of his actions toward the women who are making the accusations do you think that that is not disqualify\nWell look I first off I don't know how you're going to prove that he's caught lying about something I mean this this is what he's he said that he drank he said that he drank to access at times that he was drunk at times he admitted to that the only thing he did not admit to his\nWas blacking out and not recalling things and he has you know he has his his college roommate basically you know saying you know I live with this guy for three years I never saw him in his position for the next day what ...\n... ... ah did also so that you never saw him blackout I don't know that the blackout standard\nIs the sole criterion I Know what you're saying that he got drunk I might I didn't really admitted any more than he needed to I Do think it's fair criticism to say that he was not talking about himself the way his classmates\nTalk about um the question is does it matter\nAnd I get I I don't think I I don't see where ... is it does he have to go out and say oh yeah I got I got ... no I mean it's\nSo dry I still don't you watch yes interview wait I

me now Iraq it up here that we drank beer or but you know maybe you want to many he was not talking about himself the way other people talk about him but\nJennifer somewhat that characterization that's not a lie well then why are all these people are like why are these people coming forward and went to school with them Rick and saying he's lying about who he was ... called I'm afraid\nI and I think that he is a lot of many many many many many more coming in and saying that the right Kevin or they know is exactly consistent with what he's saying yeah you have any like well yeah yeah backing off what sixty five women side to side of the documents are saying this is all a bunch of or not\nThat's not Brett Kavanaugh but just yesterday Romney there doesn't mean that didn't happen weren't there they they are tightening\nNone of them ever said he didn't party he didn't get drunk a lot that that he said if I were to vouch about his character your part right and I get why but it's got to be worse your party you say all these people came out to say that what the other people say it was on true but none of them say that\nNone of those sixty five a permit to parse a woman said and on the
