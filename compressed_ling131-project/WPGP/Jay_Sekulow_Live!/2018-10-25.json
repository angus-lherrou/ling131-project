I I talked with him cause some earlier today he was one of the first people to start using this term again several years ago trying to revive it because of its actual meaning it had been given a negative connotation by some\nWho are looking and you know what are we talking about political correctness in this uh open to the to the show there in the open to the our you know this uh this the following his way to peace keeper politically correct\nThe only thing politically correct about me when I Do this thing is that my politics are correct my politics are right that's\nThe political correctness that I'm about as far as being not offensive\nI don't care I'm not about not offending people and neither is ... now he's a fellow at the middle east forum the gates donating Institute and the or a Lincoln some of the Claremont Institute he was a former senior advisor to brags that leader Nigel for Raj\nAnd he knows about nationalism he knows that it means taking care of yourself and your nation first not about racial politics not about identity politics it's about the nation versus global is\nNationalism versus globalism\nIt's exactly what President Trump was talking about it was not a ambiguous it was very very clear so I wanted to talk to Rahim ... about what nationalism remain since they have that experience there and as I said he's one of the first people to kind of revive the term as the president said when he said you're not supposed to say that any more and it's ridiculous to say\nTo not be able to say I believe in my nation first\nThis this is part of that conversation with where he ...\nThank you for having me I have to have to say I wasn't one of the first ever given that given that nationalism goes back hundreds of years\nBut certainly in ... in in in modern lines I think we were reintroduced to the political lexicon but across the across the ocean I'm here in the United states\nI think that's that's a that's a great point a great distinction in and let's let's talk about that as as the president declared a correctly when he when he tried to draw the contrast between globalism thinking more about the world's up a needs rather than the needs of the nation that you are elected to represent the president said that very directly\nOr that he means nationalist in that I'm going to put my people first we're worried about the concerns of less than the rest of the globe second\nUm he said that national M Ms ... nationalism is kind of become a word that you don't use anymore and I think we should use it again what did he mean and why he's right of course because you saw the instant reaction why ... why did a tour nationalism which when compared to globalism\nIs a pretty benign term as far as I'm concerned that says more concerned about our people before the world's me\nWell he because there was actually a big role the generous about ... I mean ... can you if you think about what a dog um over the past Fifteen Twenty years actually it hasn't really considered itself with the rest of the world instead of itself\nWith a a political or cultural and meteor leads a around the world whether it's in Beijing London or New York city of Los Angeles you know global it'd be really served to shed be addressed um of the very very very few\nAre not married are very few have been exploited workers and folks on factories that are exploiting jobs from Racine, Wisconsin and so say for no reason you get\nA new drug Shea ... rolled people up with all the media were off the bat shady because we can go out for several years and I think people have studied his life by the way I've seen\nOver the course of his life especially when he talks about trade deals and that sort of thing that he's had these nationalistic plenty\nBut he's there actually come out and said it\nAnd and he and well he's gained by saying it is\nIs crazy gets another dividing line is very good at doing that is a dividing line that he knows that the that sort of the city to machine the Democrats the media all of those guys that they have to attack that lie they have to attack that product and that's how it is very very\nHard advice and gets mad and why would you be he's indispensable even at the age of Seventy whatever he is um and they they have the lecture logging them so they call them fight the idea of nationalism and it's a fight and the idea\nThat the nation states should be the final arbiter she'd be so Britain is almost impossible especially amongst Americans I mean you'll you'll you'll revolution was nationalist revolution\nHamilton Hamilton's ... on the subject of ... was a national issue document um you know what Teddy Roosevelt said about having one ... one of them one language and\nSay goodbye to the immigrant who will simulate is nationalism and they don't have arguments against that so that's why they're angry they are upset that either the mother from on them and I think that's what we've seen play out last routes\nI think that's well said the only argument they do have against that is just just say just scream racism which of course is the you know the easiest argument to make a ... or just use a fellow at the middle east forum the gates don't Institute in the Lincoln fellow at the\nEr Claremont Institute you know the president said when he pulled out of the Paris climate accord he said look I care more about and I was elected by the people of Pittsburgh not the people of Paris and another event he said in his first year in the presidency I was elected president of the United states not president of the world\nHow can any elected official whether it'd be president a member of our Congress or anywhere else suggested otherwise your job is to represent the people that chose not to represent the interests of outside nations especially if it comes at the expense of those who chose you to lead them\nYou know that's that's a really great point and and there's actually a fantastic book it's just come out on this subject if it's called the bigger picture of nationalism\nBy a professor older your I'm deserted and and he he sort of explains his childhood and and it it sort of awful and by awful I mean the rest of the world's all you know the ...\n... and I'm staring I'm not really a a an empire that we won't have right now you know it it sort of ... what we've done historically imperialistic global distinctly\nIs looked to one leader you know whether it's the king of England\nOr the Roman emperor or you know the the world is used to having ... story how words to one person where they are and they will\nOr several people wherever they are in the world and the world is currently doing that occurs hysterically down the last few decades with the president of the United states you know I always refer to build a ... in that in the in that office is referred to as the world leader the most powerful man in the world you know all of that sort of thing\nAnd and it's it's it's refreshing ... not just I think for Americans which holiday to you know ... trillion dollars being spent in Iraq and Afghanistan which was that it should be no money for public schools and it's a\nRight um I think it's refreshing for them but it's also refreshing it shouldn't be refreshing but the rest of the world\nA wet nations like Italy a nation is like the United states like India Australia and an oldies a a three independent sovereign nations\nActually don't have to act as protectorate table\nThey actually do have to act as independent sovereign nations and this was another thing that President Trump stretch when he talks about NATO he says look I'm not looking\nFor a vote for protectorate or the looking ... allies\nAnd and so this is a major reset what's going on now I'm ... and ... and it pains me to say that when he spoke about nationalism yet says ... there was a period in history where nationalism\nUh ethnic nationalism specifically but very I'd be very quickly and spiraled out of control but it ... the people don't know that nationalism actually goes back hundreds and hundreds of years and still looked like so many countries most countries I Would say around the world but for whatever reason\nLess media doesn't want to applaud United States\nAnd and of course the key there is ethnic nationalism is not what President Trump is talking about that's what they want to make it about that is what the left wants to make it about he's talking about nationalism versus globalism simple\nPatriotism and that is a very very big difference thanks again there were scenes are or where he is a song for joining us thanks to you for joining us will take time out five for
