and I've got it keyed up queued up ready to go Sarah Sanders a wonderful moving moment\nThen into the um had been into the jackals questioning or about why it's all Trump small\nBut I'm Sorry I I I just I've got a she wanted something to ready or the beginning because I'm just I'm just absorb is myself\nAnd look I I don't\nI don't really care what is in Shepard Smith brain\nI often care even less about what's what comes out of his mouth but at Fox News you have to know something and and I don't know what the deal is is there is there a a a a turnover in either the leadership change or a change of flavor\nIs it but because I mean Hannity still Hannity the addition of shows like Laura Ingraham magnificent of of of Brett Baer doing special report\nA Tucker Carlson is just a star and and I just love it love him and it's not like I necessarily need all my conservative shows\nShe have exactly the same take because even as conservatives as Republicans ... there are there are shades and nuances and ... and things that we we don't all we don't walk in lock step like Democrats do I envy them at some time but but we don't\nKnow what am I leading up to here I I just I Need you to absorb a minute and a fraction here of of shepherd Smith\nNow that this is ... it's funny list there there are the opinion shows in there are the news shows\nBut look there they're all ... ... maybe ... ... the news he is show that Fox does is special report with Brett Baer where'd you basically get a straight dose of news and then a panel of people have a wide variety of views who discuss it and that's great\nHannity conservative opinion show Laura Ingraham conservative opinion Joe Tucker Carlson conservative opinion show more than a gallon playing it more more straight and and less of of of her opinions and it's great and they're all great\n... what the hell is that in that our was Shepard Smith just what is that you've got that starship enterprise set may cover breaking news and and ... is a talented man he is a compelling broadcaster\nWhat in the world compels them to do list today\nThe U.S will deploy some five thousand proof to the southern border as early tomorrow as thousands of migrants make their way north from Mexico\nThe migrants according to the Fox news reporting are more than two months away if any of them actually come here\nBut tomorrow is one week\nBefore the midterm election\nWhich is what all of this is about\nThere is no invasion\nNo one's coming to get you there is nothing at all to worry about\nReally now\nObviously of look what I Do for a living everyone's it's titled do anything you obviously\nThis is a mockery of Americans not all of them necessarily conservative most of them probably aren't that right there was a mockery of you\nIf you think thousands of people pouring across the border is a bad idea I don't expect that they're going to set up a you know an M. S. Thirteen headquarters next door to my house I don't expect that but you know a hundred thousand of them will come pouring across the border like some remake of World War Z\nBut I Do expect that if we don't make a strong message that this caravan will come and if it is successful in reaching our borders been others will follow\nAnd I do not need weasel lectures from the likes of shepherd Smith about how my concerns are are somehow silly is he in title that you absolutely is I Would expect it from from psychopath like Lawrence O'Donnell\nAnd and from finger wagging scolds like Rachel Maddow I Would expect it from that\nAnd again and and I just wanted to I I don't need Fox News to be a team\nYou know which we all subtle for for just the same exact echo chamber news every day I I I liked diversity of opinion I like 'em but they they give they give us a show they give it a stinking show every day to insult the Fox news base\nAnd I just want you to know it ain't by accident is intentional they know he's doing it and they wanted him to do it why you'd\nHave to ask them [noise] [noise] okay let's see here [laughter] Mm\nLet me call in with a break come back and you'll hear Sarah Sanders in the immediate jak holes going after doing after we were in LA rich hey Mark Davis in for Larry welcome how are you\n[noise] [noise] Hi thank you very much are a little nervous but it might mean that can do or anybody listening to might go for it or ball\nThat'd be one year old I watch the news and especially when I catch a credit score I get so mad after he got off the TV and I have to go meditate\nBecause I'm not gonna use my wife understand and I\nGet mad and I talked to other people and they get mad I have a real question here who created this press corps who\nVoted all these guys then okay the credentials and then how do they ever get to say they record that may\nWell very that I Know that they and they and they know it and they don't care now and and I mean they're not supposed to quote unquote represent us in the way that elected officials do they are supposed to cover news in an unbiased and professionally honest\nAnd corrupted matter and the media have not done that successfully in at least a couple of generations and\nThe I or go have you not hurt Americans want you know [laughter] we ... we represent the American populace hello now\n... and and it's at ... and ... rich ... thank you I mean there are ... opinion shows how lovely opinion shows the conservative opinion shows tend to show up on Fox obviously the liberal opinion shows I mean ... I mean listen I just took a little jab\nAt both Donald and Maduro and Chris Matthews and that whole covenant and and and and and and that\nTotal head case Joe Scarborough but do they get to be over there on MSNBC and stoke the Trump painting fire of their viewer base of course they do of course they do and it's a free country and and there's a marketplace out there and\nAnd they've got X number of viewers and Fox has X number of viewers and and the trolls over on CNN at X. number of viewers and they're all trying to slice of the pie and get as many folks and they can sell advertising and make a buck good for them that's old justified\nBut remember what reporting used to be\nI'll share a secret what do you draw close to the radio real quick\n[noise] I have\nA journalism degree I\nPull up I Know I Know I Do University of Maryland Nineteen Seventy nine College of journalism proud of it\nAnd I was at saving somebody's happy I went and uh and and did radio news reporting in Charleston West Virginia soon to elect Senator Patrick Morrisey ah it had a blast my first two years I went to Jacksonville, Florida did some more reporting before the talk show thing drops in my lap\nAnd I guess that's worked out well for everyone but when it was a reporter when I was studying journalism everything was drilled into us even in the People's Republic of Maryland was objectivity present both sides to try to keep your own opinions out of your stories where in the world did that go\nAll right here's where I'm at a goes out for a second let you catch a couple of messages and come back and the message of Sarah Sanders is very moving in the press briefing and ah then you'll ah watch the wolves come after her there after right here on the Larry Elder show Mark Davis in today in your eye back\nFall through fall [noise] [noise]\nSort of said over the weekend that he could tone of his rhetoric\nThat let's see if any concern that all his words\nCode is fire approval pro people do awful\nIs certainly a the president wants a in home is where our country is hurting like we've seen 'em in the last several days I find ways to bring our country together and we've seen him do exactly that\nHowever the president is going to continue to draw a contrast a particularly as we go into the final days of an election the differences between the two parties that typically on policy differences you'll continue to see him make that contrast [laughter] ah but he has certainly I think\nFound those known to bring our country together and certainly focus on some of the things that all of us can support and all of us can condemn as well\nBut he's also harshly attack some of the various people to receive those white bombs in this morning suggesting that the news media is responsible for\nThat is you do that when it was this ... this was somebody who\nWhat is the Trump rallies this is somebody van covered with uh\nA tax on the media praised for for the president on either the shooter in Pittsburgh is somebody who was of\nPresidents with so much time talking about why is he out there\nWhen you say you might be why is the author\nVery very first\nThing that the president didn't was condemned the attack sloth in Pittsburgh and in the pipe bombs the very first thing the media did was blame the president and make him responsible for these rigs yank you accent\nIs outrageous that that would be the very first reaction that so many people across the country the I'm not finished the only person responsible\nFor carrying out either of these heinous acts were the individuals who carry them out it's not the president no more than it was Bernie Sanders fault for the individual who shot up a baseball field of congressional Republicans you can't start putting the responsibility of individuals on anybody but the individual who carries out the crime\nBam thank you very very much Sarah Huckabee Sanders for the win\n... were\nDestructive poison is covering this this media community is and people wonder why this course is uh there's dashed against the rocks\nIt's not because Trump wander the occasional bar but he throws in a tweet or the occasional moment in a rally the entire culture of reporters editors commentators who say that we're currently led by a racist or ... or\nHater a an evil person our dean compressor United States is evil president United States is evil Howard Dean\nReally that's why discourse is in trouble it ain't Trump's fault Mark Davis in the Larry be right back you're listening to the Larry Elder show\nHere with Mike stole from

the shooter I Want to speak the name of the idiot who was you know involved in the package bomb scare\nIt's hard to see this outside of the context of the president's hostility hostility towards towards Mrs Clinton who tried to briefly speak towards unity towards the rock Obama towards George Soros\nThe president and his allies they need to dial down the the political rhetoric they are making people let's say they are making journalist less safe and they're making law enforcement officers less safe\nBut we don't know who did this or we don't know what their motive was right but it's a very obvious thread and maybe it's meant as a ruse but it's an obvious threat the Obamas the Clintons John Brennan CNN\nUm George Soros these are people and organizations that President Trump continually attacking demonize is\nCaused by if you look at who they've targeted so far it's almost like they're following Donald Trump's Twitter feed and starting with Debbie Wasserman Schultz\n... certainly one question for the president one question for the White House is the rhetoric the intense rhetoric that he has been saying and his supporters have been giving out over these last several weeks leading into mid mid term elections and certainly even before that is that contributing to any of this\nSurvey I mean there are all people that Donald Trump eight they are all a people that he has used violent ugly incendiary rhetoric against uh whether it's journalists like CNN where there were John Brennan letter was address or Hillary Hillary Clinton you know from the lock her up chants\nAnd you know I was in the ... thing with my former colleagues to CNN and and they're scared and one highly former colleague said this is what happened when the president called the enemy of the people at five and I thought my gosh you know it's it's a tone and coming from the top and now to CNN has become a target\n[noise] wow [noise] [noise] it's all Trump's fault right\n\nI got a question\nWhat about

Know who to kick\n[noise] Cory Booker\nVersus Eric Holder the host apparently confused him and Hillary I'm\nCorrected her what's often called political correctness is politeness\n... um ... it's it's not being rude and and insulting to people on its respecting the diversity that we have in our society\nUh so I I don't know exactly how to answer that because you know the Democratic party is much\nMore diverse political party attracting people who are\nUm African American Latino uh algae maintain whatever the you know the the the reason why people feel more comfortable where they are taken in where they are included as part of a political movement or party\nAnd I don't think it's politically correct to say we value that and and I don't want to go around insulting people I don't want to paint with a broad brush every immigrant invests every African American is that every other person with you know different religious beliefs or whatever that is that child\nWhat do you think
