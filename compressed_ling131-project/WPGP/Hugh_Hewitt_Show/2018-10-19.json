probably a horribly clumsy analogy but uh\nBut but that that was me I mean I'm sixty right now\nSo in in my pre adolescent years through my adolescent years we're all the Apollo missions I Lived with them I read them\nAnd uh it it simply must be a God Singh aware through through a set of circumstances that I scarcely deserve that I was able to meet and hang out and speak with these folks and Neil was very unassuming he was very much the American hero very much uh the the the uh\nThe enthusiasts for his country but he was also very aware that he was representing him and he was representing humanity and it's the thing that made me probably the most nuts about the whole first name controversy it's like we had to pick sides it's either an American achievements\nOr a human achievement guys it's both they're\nNot mutually exclusive okay enough about that enough enough enough enough for that part of what's the best thing that I can share with you about Ted Cruz and a beta or\nFour months and months and months and months you know maybe not so much lately but for many moons are all the stories were pouring out of my state of\nTexas it's a close race oh Ted Cruz's in trouble oh Texas is going to turn purple and the way to turn in blue who there's never been a candidate like Mexico\nTed Cruz is running scared every single one of those stories were crap just to use the vernacular\nA it was ridiculous it is ridiculous this was never a close race on paper now were there a couple of polls\nThat there was one that had a beta with like a one or two point lead well we know the kind of recent history that polling organizations have had no don't wait but in fairness to that industry polls\nAre a snapshot of enthusiasm\nA ... that are taken in the blink of an eye\nSo if you go back when was that ... by one or two a month and a half ago company and something like that the August September ... his possible\n... and get a survey with a ... a sample size of acts might have run into a vein of democratic enthusiasm because let me tell you a Democrat enthusiasm in my state is higher than it has been in a long time now what does that mean\nWhat does that mean it means that Ted Cruz is not going to be ... by sixteen points as he did Paul Sadler six years ago to get to the Senate\nIt's not going to be a sixteen points when in fact it could be made as much as ten points closer I Believe that the ... and it's kind of a wide range but hey it's an election who knows these days predicting as a very sketchy game I consider the range of possibilities\nFor the Ted Cruz Beto O'Rourke race when we wake up on November seventh or go\nTo bed really late had been my case on the sex I Believe the range of possibility is Ted Cruz winning by four to Ted Cruz winning by twelve\nAt eight points but hey I bet if if he wins by for that means that Cruz voters weren't lazy it means that Texas Republicans were complacent it means that we sat on our jobs and we thought we got this\nAnd in in that capacity I never want to be part of the problem 'cause I'm here I live here my show is here\nAnd I know and I was I was hanging out with my buddies into Ted Cruz campaign last night did a Facebook Live with that I it's it's still post and I think ... we had a good time is about forty minutes or so talking about stuff pulling back the curtain on a few things it's all in the Ted Cruz Facebook page\nAt that as we get down to election day\nIf it's for points or five or God Forbid\nFree or something like that it'll be like beta one and we'll never be rid of these people\n[laughter] I
