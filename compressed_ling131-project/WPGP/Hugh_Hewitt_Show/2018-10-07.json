an issue that is often on the table in our show and American Life\nBut I think it's it's fascinating and I think you'll enjoy it and I don't want to hear your take very simple the subject\nI have no I Know what came to me yesterday and I don't remember what engendered it\nSo here it's very simple would you prefer a gift or a gift card as a gift and then\nMy theory is more men prefer a gift cards and more women preferred gifts and I have a theory as to why I have that theory\nSo [laughter] this is a theory\nAbout a theory my theory is women if they receive a gift they see wow look at the thought that was put into this uh getting me this gift that is really\nMoving and beautiful or beautiful and therefore moving men think hey\nWhat a great deal I now have a hundred dollars to spend at X Y or Z that I didn't have before I could buy exactly what I Want for me thank\nYou I Am I speaking for you Mr producer\nBut now interestingly because I Believe that every one if every one of the three males affiliated with the direct presentation of the show tripled gee the living martyr and I have feminine sucks I Do I Believe that and sure enough tripled\nJeeze feminine side came out where he said he would like to get a gift not a gift card after I laughed at him for about five minutes we resume the conversation\n[laughter] [laughter] that\nThey have gift cards when I was growing up not only that they have cars that yes running water showers bats yes no no no no it's amazing even even automatic transmission said\nThat that's amazing I Know I Know I Can't believe that question did they have gift cards while he was that held his that hilarious they've gift cards no no they was invented when you were born oh my God\nIt's this generation we keep him around is like a sort of a a a you know to stay in touch\nWith what the with what the the new folk think\nAnyway one aide Prager seven seven six eight seven seven to for three triple seven six\nAnd that is that that's the theory that I'm I'm working women love to find a way there's no better or worse here this is the er at all there there is no such thing in this regard I'm simply offering you may be wrong by the way I I maybe I I think I'm right\nWell obviously or I wouldn't have said it but you know what it what is your take see and I I Know in this case by the way you may be curious I think I should add so what is your Dennis prayers feminine side and I said it to these guys and the the the living martyr didn't fully believe me I don't know why\nI have no agenda here I think I Know why he doesn't really believe I have a feminine side this has been a ... [laughter] no no no no no he doesn't believe I have a feminine side yes\nAnd he's wrong and I give you an example I prefer in movies I prefer romantic comedies\nTo slash him showed um uh dramas where you know action to action dramas men law here yes Ben love high speed car chases\nThe guy shot him and this and and as it does do not exploded shit that's explosion [laughter] ... explosions\n[laughter] that was great I I I\nI I turned to the popcorn vendor when the when there's an explosion it it it does nothing for me but a romantic comedy I Am totally enthralled I Love it I I Believe it I moved into the whole situation I mean I Love sleepless in Seattle I I was riveted\nYes\nI Know that ... guys yes I you don't even have to turn it off that's right triple ... so the living martyr is in the middle you liked both correct that was your statement you like a romantic comedies and and the explosions okay fine\nBy the way I did like I Love James Bond movies that I admit\nBut that was when I was when he smoked cigars and and loved women I have to wait and the ... the early days and and that's right and gift cards that's correct if you see Dr know you see that they know that there's a gift card slip through them that is exactly right\nYeah yeah and exploded the gift card did explode\nSo everybody was happy that the guys were happy and you know what if [laughter]\nSo I Am this this is a male female addition is devoted to Dennis this theory on gift card versus gift I didn't ask my wife I ... I I I I you know as well as I Know her\nI could see what do you think you know my wife very well why do you think or sue would uh would would answer\nIt's a tough one what would your wife answer I suspect the gift yeah okay I I Do I Know there's a good argument in both I think if she likes the gift I think she'd be very touched\nBut I wouldn't be touched too if I liked the gift but the chances of your getting me something that would that I Would enjoy as much as me getting me that\n... are are very small ... who knows better what I Want then I that's why that's why rational male brain talking\nSo let's say if if there's a hundred dollar gift right so it's a generous gift a hundred dollar gift\nThat somebody's spends they have thought to it\nAnd and I know they gave thought to it but it's not what I Would choose for me of course I'd rather have a hundred dollar gift certificate but people think this is another thing people think that you're getting them a gift certificate shows you didn't think you took the easy way out\nBut I I I don't relate to that at all listen don't couples set up what do they call when they set up an account that are at a department store\nFurniture store\nYou you know what I mean you know ... people no no come on guys you guys are so out of it you don't ... couples marrying set up a thing what is it called [laughter]\nThis is a problem when you work with men\nUh any way they set up an account\nAnd you the ... that way they could get the the the dishes they want\nThey can get their register that thank you that's right they register with a store now All right you're right I should've known knowing romantic comedies but the last time there was a registry romantic comedy was Eighteen sixty nine the first or\nA picture of taken\nSo that now that's an example Poe right that's like a gift card\n... ... are couples are touched by that if you give in to their registry [noise] All right this is my uh this is my question here we're going to take a vote\nOne eight Prager seven seven six you're listening\nAt the Prager show All right Christine I'm Sorry that you were even tangentially related to this sad moment\n\nShe there oh okay yes I Am okay go ahead it is it is\nI I Hope she didn't get in trouble\n[laughter] well see me but it's over [laughter] hey go ahead\nI honestly I prefer cash because the car and they have much stores make off of gift card\nWhy cause pain to lose ... known them twenty five dollar gift card yeah\nSomething for twenty twenty going back to what in that gets quiet and you're going to remember\nOh that is a very good point I never thought of that money that way you know what this thing\nThat it's very interesting you're so right but there's something that seems to be about well if yeah it seems almost tacky and it and um and it's ridiculous because it's no different from a gift card but I don't know what you give a guy an envelope with a hundred dollar bill said again\nI don't you get to spend all of\nThe cat you know no you're right I I couldn't agree more\nThat you may be the cast wrap it up in the life little gift\n[laughter] a big one [laughter] [laughter] oh I beg why [laughter] very funny\nThat's a very forty four you give somebody gets a big box the bail opened it up there's a hundred dollar bill on the bottom\n[laughter] yeah [laughter] All right I agree with you know\nThat was what I Want better than me and it and it at my age you know one company by\nWhite so you're sixty three at forty three would have preferred a gift yeah\nAll right so I don't think the I don't think it's age related\nI I have to yeah I I don't I think I think it's more sex related\nAnd that's my theory but I you know obviously you you do you prefer the the the money uh there's a there's a there's a very er here All right good we have a male who prefers the gift will take a thank you Christine Marty in Indianapolis, Indiana Hi\nHey Dennis I'm a first time caller as well the first time that you're right now you gotta you gotta feed on that river crew there but\nYou would have the time of your life\nBecause just the people you'd be\nIran Iraq in I Would I'm loving the show I got a big and birth pilots are now as a male I'd say that I prefer yes thank you know your ticket later that it showed a lot more effort and I happen to agree with that statement very much so [noise]\nAll right stay on because I'm going to ask you what you think of my theory what'd you say [noise] I'm not going to call them a woman ...
