that is a dollar or so left in the rights mad at me I must be doing something like that is the talking point of talking points you\nKnow it was a mob on the front porch of the Supreme Court counting on the on the door it was a mob was chasing senators around it was a law that champion in front of the Congress it was a mob that chases people in Portland was a mob and the Frank Luntz video\nThe ... election is job versus mobs that a lot of people said because it's true doesn't make it a talking point and Brooke Baldwin is not the word police and the Democratic party is acting like a mob to Canada they can Minnesota were beaten by democratic activists over the weekend mob violence\nWe saw that Susan Collins needed the police the color out because the mom sent something we're not sure which I Know one senior government official who received a package that required the intervention security forces\nThe left in this country is on the ... and the left is represented in the Democratic party they are running the Democratic party they rarely attack on judge Kavanaugh and it is a mock\nMeanwhile Louis Farrakhan I guess I got to save Louis Farrakhan Twitter won't even confront the very ... anti Semitism Louis Farrakhan won't even do it but at least Lindsey Graham is still speaking straight ears Lindsay on Fox who they are the last number five\nBarely won take up a meal without enough or a Senator Feinstein who I liked very much but here's what I Want every democratic candidate for the Senate to be asked Tamara\nI Begin my show by telling you of course it's alliance defending freedom on the air at the Hugh Hewitt show if you go over to you you're a dot com you'll see a banner at the very top of the website that says please generously donated to alliance defending freedom\nCalled eight six six seven hundred and sixty eight six six seven hundred and ten sixty\nWhatever donation you make a large or small will be doubled and we'll be matched and to talk a little bit about alliance defending freedom of gotten that sharp joining me he's a senior counsel director of the center for legislative advocacy an alliance defending freedom good morning Matt welcome to your your job\nYour money out of me\nBut you know I've had so many alliance defending freedom people over the years I've been a long time sponsoring always my friend and they're in the news today because Allison rushing Allison Jones rushing\nWas nominated for the for certain had her hearing before the Senate Judiciary committee and I read from the people for the American way a mat\nDuring last go Allison rushing chose a summer position that the alliance defending freedom then called the Alliance Defense fund that it now and he has his one of the far right leaning organization opposing algae B. Q. equality church state separation abortion rights\nAnd the eleven years since she graduated law school she has continued to support the organization through its Blackstone legal fellowship which helps mentor in advance like minded lawyers I gotta tell ya I Love Allison rushing now more than I ever did\nWell we are uh you know the great late of judges overall being open up there and I'm very excited and it's up any as well\nNo well tell me about did you ever work with Allison have you ever did you do know or from your time as the legislative counsel now I did I\nOkay so I just want people to know the Blackstone fellowship program is one of the great reasons why it's defending freedom exist they meant to young lawyers they helped them get jobs they teach them up and originalism they help them with their careers they're everywhere but you're also on the hill Matt tell us what a ATF does on the hill\nLike there's a lot of work going on with legislation the impacts religious liberty that impacts campus free speech in a variety of issues and we're constantly consulted a without legal expertise that hates it the Supreme Court in litigation across the country of what is the impact of these laws who are they going to help\nWho are they going to hurt some bad laws out there and so we're asked to provide our legal guidance on these very important legislative issues with that\n[noise] so so how big is the center for legislative advocacy alliance defending freedom is quite vast I've got four thousand affiliated attorneys I've already mentioned the Blackstone fellows they've got their alumni throughout the country but this particular center is focused on statutes in drafting how big is it\nLooks like there's a handful of us were working at not only if they you know with policy group and allies on the hill but\nAcross the country with state policy groups that are fighting or religious freedom fighting for free speech and over again with they're helping them assaulting them odd pieces of legislation in the legal impact on just against taking legal expertise and helping to ensure that the law of supply with those legal\nNow you're lost some of your key people Matt Bowman went into the government of course uh my friend Carey went into the government ... you know Greg Scott went into the government came out of the government or how you doing when the government wants your lawyers to go to work for him\n[laughter] well you know there is a strong group of people across the country many came out of our lifestyle program that are passionate about fighting for religious freedom that we are blessed always have a strong ally of attorneys and others working with us\nJoining us in our work and stuff or you know although we all wish well as other positions where we're always blessed to have a strong crop ready to jump in and pick up the uh take up the battle with or religious freedom\nNow mantle and not math omen that sharp I'm Sorry about that I kind of think that the Supreme Court is going to find a way to get to the establishment clause quickly into finally bring some coherence I had dinner or when children ski on the program earlier this week he is a man of the left he's the dean of the Berkeley law school which was a left leaning place\nHe said he expected the new majority to articulate a rule that goes back to the original intention the public attention intention of the constitutional conventions ratifying the federal convention as it came out of Philadelphia\nWhich is we will not have one religion in the United states and we will not have overt financial support for religious institutions and everything else like crosses in graveyards that's just fine how are you as optimistic\nAs um ... pessimistic because he's not happy with that but I sure am\nYeah I I think the crack in the existing establishment clause just put them on him to show\nUp in a variety of on I think it's on the court is acting grapple with these issues and I think we're we're optimistic about the district instruction us that are on the court and a third jurisprudence on those issues and that hopefully at the correct some of the laws that have been\nA concerted into that establishment clause cases over the years\nMatter you getting worried about winning too much you want jak Philips a masterpiece cake shopping Lutheran schools you won a ... going back to Washington state a cheap Cochran got one point two million dollars is I'm a picture of him with David Quammen going up to to get his money from the city of Atlanta to get worried about winning too much\nWhenever I Do remember you know it's just a couple of weeks after jak\nOne that the state of Colorado went after him again I said the price of liberty at the title vigilant than I think it just demonstrates we can never sit back and just left on the Web but it's an ongoing battle because we know that it's like the Colorado that after jak all of these other situations\nLike religious freedom and free age\nThat's why we need alliance offending free to match sharp from the center for legislative advocacy it'll winds of freedom thank you let me give me the specifics America over here at dot com there is an ATF ban are kind of picture checked alternate means the man who owns masterpiece case shopping who had the courage the strength\nAnd the prayers of millions of people to persevere to win because the alliance defending freedom walk alongside of him a and it says will you please defend religious freedom if you click on that you can make a donation online if you'd call\nEight six six seven hundred ten sixty eight six six seven hundred ten sixty\nYou can also make a donation everywhere you go to tax deductible whatever you give us tax deductible hundred bucks tax deductible but it will become a two hundred dollar contribution you only get to the doctor honored you gave you don't get the duck the hundred that's matched\nBut we have a deep pocket donor who said I Will for this month match everything every dollar that comes in and so I'm just begging you now is the time making ... make it work\nCut over there we've had hundreds and hundreds of you respond thank you you you believe in religious freedom\nIf you go to church you should be supporting alliance defending freedom because they're coming for you to the left the mob left is not happy with faith based lifestyles and faith based messages and faith based speakers in public places they are not happy with um well we got a four circuit case\nWhere a bunch of the craziest from the extreme secularists wants to take down a one hundred year old war memorial in the shape of across to an Infantry Division that were slaughtered\nIn a in the great war hundred years old then there are a hundred years and they won and the ... circuit they won it's unbelievable but that will go up to the Supreme Court maybe they'll finally figure out that crosses in graveyards ... back to come down I keep thinking about the American cemetery\nOutside of Normandy that I was at a year ago with my friend Jay engineer up and just how moving it is\nAnd it's all stars of David Duke crosses I did not see any Islamic crescent some though I'm sure there are in some American Cemetery they're brought up in the American cemetery outside of Florence\nOutside of Normandy I Try and go to Arlington when I'm In town on Memorial Day as the fetching assist you and I have done the last couple of years across his everywhere and Jewish stars everywhere\nThis decision would render them all unconstitutional it's absurd it's not what the public understanding of the first amendment was at the time of the ratification that's originalism what did the public understand not the original intent of the frame or it's not their secret sauce\nBut what the public think they were voting for when they ratify the constitution there say conventions that's originalism and they they knew what they were voting for when they voted for the first amendment and ratified Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion or prohibiting the free exercise there of the first freedom of the religious freedom\nThe public knew it wasn't a secret it meant you can't set up a state church like bam in England that's all that I think it means you can't give money because they ... the ... the early Congress's routinely granted money to missionaries including Roman Catholic missionaries\nTo take the gospel to the Native American tribes that's what they routinely did that they didn't think that was unconstitutional I don't think it's unconstitutional today\nTo provide assistance to parochial schools and bus rides in textbooks I'm always up that's all wrong under an originalist understanding of the of the first amendment and I'm hoping that chief justice Roberts Justice Alito Justice Thomas justice Gorsuch and new Justice Stevens\nWill collectively come together and lay out a a you know a straightforward here's what it means and it doesn't mean anything else it doesn't mean anything else so stop trying to make a prayer at the opening of a city council unconstitutional so we had a congressional chaplains from the beginning\nLet's get back to the original is a tenth of the public at the time of the framing\nI'm not anti Semite and then I turned ... what a Twitter say they're not in effect yet that is\nJust remarkable Jack Dorsey and all of Silicon Valley are completely lost in\nBoth fear of the left in fear of Farrah Khan and fear the truth and they ... they like to take it out on Christians [noise] they like to go after evangelicals 'cause they know the Mormons are guns are if they don't\nFight back but this is ridiculous this is and I said let's says all
