Gingrich you're on the Mike Gallagher showing the relief factor dot com studios Mr Speaker I never thought I'd get inspired by the Washington Post but I I've interviewed Dan Balz a number of times over the years of various political conventions and debates and all\nAnd he wrote a piece this week headlined battleground house district remained close in New pool\nUm he he says there according to a new Washington post poll of the most contested districts in the country the Democrats now hold a statistically insignificant lead over Republicans again it's not supposed to happen that way this isn't supposed to be occurring\nNewt are or do we dare dream that the narrative that the Democrats are going to take the house but Republicans are going to control continue to control the Senate is not going to happen and the Republicans have a chance of holding both chambers\nYeah look I think first of all anybody who tells you to know what's going to happen or just you know members that two weeks out\nUh everybody was leave that out from would lose on election day uh five thirty eight the the New York times found the polling operation said there was a Seventy one percent likely would when I'm\nYou know virtually no one you know I was safe but some cry but I said for a long time ago when then but but I think this far out\nA loser dynamic developing we'll see how the dynamic continues but but for the last few each part of it then I wouldn't want to send my newsletters which with actions um the uh\nThe cabinet effect did three different things one\nIt galvanized the concert these who had really angry that sort of sleepwalking and happy and lots of good things but now they're angry and that's a huge increase in energy on the right which I she personally and I'm sure you see that as you're going to do an amazing look much more energy\nThan I can remember it anytime a in many many years a second I'm the mask came off\nOh I think that the nastiness but there's just this Spartacus moment like poker or the the the shouting over the chairman but by the Democratic senator from California Kamala Harris go down the list Harris I mean\nPeople the under you know the degree to which they are willing to exploit Dr Ford manipulate her keep her letter hitting spraying it at the last minute maximize public relations um people got a sense that\nYou know these people are really bad and I think that the Damascus continue to come off as we've seen more and more bad statements you more and more bad comments on the third thing that happened was all of a sudden particularly center racist\nPeople realized oh yeah this is a team sport and so somebody like bite us it would have been desperately trying to convince people until she was a moderate they looked up and they said wait a second you're going to vote for Schumer\nWell you're in a modern if you're going to look for sure what the latest polls that just came out this week show I Can't for example down sixteen points now nobody and she's a very very\nConfident a political figure she's very good campaigner for very long track record North Dakota nobody would have guessed she'd be down sixteen points\nAnd everywhere you turn now racist that the Democrats thought they were going to win a ... very very tight I'm In early voting we're seeing a of the Republicans are doing very well know again I don't I don't want to draw any any conclusion we still have almost two weeks\nAnd two weeks out I think Donald Trump would have lost\nBut he was gaining boats every single day right and we keep gaining boats every single day and frankly a caravan is is a is a huge or for the Democrats that they just can't\nI think answer too and I think among suburban a woman who have been one of the real weaknesses for Trump because they think about him is Thirteen games and they think about cartels and they think about a lawlessness\nAnd seven thousand people determined to break the law I think the legal Democrats and come back to the Republicans are in a much greater number then people would have just a month ago is\nIs it just me or does it feel you you're talking about prominent Democrats and the missteps of the last month or so I mean and you could go to Elizabeth Warren and her bizarre\nA decision to release this DNA test and create a whole new wave of of ridicule and scorn or the mob violence we're seeing we're seeing a Heidi Heitkamp I mean for crying out loud she's she tells the world she was ready to vote yes on Kavanaugh\nUntil she watched his testimony with the sound turned off\nAnd she didn't like his facial expressions doesn't it feel like the Democrats are a bit like the gang that couldn't shoot straight\nWell I think they have a huge problem I think their their base so far less now\nAnd the energy of their base and hatred that there'll be says Trump is showing chance yeah but they're surrounded all day by people who are giving them signals uh that don't work in the normal world\nRight and so you know comments like em I'm sure that that one that former attorney general said when the Republicans you're down a little probably gonna go low we kick kick him I'm sure that immediate crowd they liked it\nBut for the rest of the country it it was a little sobering to have somebody who's been chief law enforcement officer United States\nSuggesting that Republicans ought to get checked right on it comes it comes in the middle of a whole wave of these kind of states' rights and the other the other player is frankly a generation of left wing activist to get goofy things and said goofy things who are now running for office\nAnd we live in an age where YouTube and others allow us to track you know things in it so it's not just where they were having
