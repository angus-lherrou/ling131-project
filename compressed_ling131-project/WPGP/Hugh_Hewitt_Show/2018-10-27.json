his bread into the American bloodstream that we are supposed to have pity for this this person not for the women who are racing is beyond belief\nThat all the compassion goes to the man who's feels he's a woman and I have compassion for men think their women but I Do I also have compassion for all the women who want to run against women's bodies women body verses women body that's the way it should work but the lush liberal\nAllows the mean spirited left is to win every time that's the way it works liberals no there's something morally wrong with allowing a man body to race in a female

holding bonds and your portfolio the value of the bonds go down what about inflation that's another wrists so that's the risk that you your your portfolio is not going to keep up with increases in the cost of living so it's the risk that you're purchasing power will decline that means\nThat the same money doesn't buy as much there's risk with any investment choice\nIncluding the choice not to make

about your your approach to retirement\nYes absolutely it is a balancing act and that's why you need to work with the right professional and you've got to have a plan\nSo I Can't tell you how many times I've talked with my husband about doing different things maybe it was just planning a vacation or a camping trip and when we planted out ahead of time\nWe did much much better so we're talking

both age sixty two and they're ready to retire\nAnd I wanted to have a lot less risk than Tony in fact and it was really shocked when I showed her the analysis of how much she could really lose in her retirement portfolio\nThey could stand to lose a third of their savings neither one of them knew about that most people don't know how much risk they have\nAnd so I said what would it do to your ability to be retired if you didn't have thirty percent of your savings are you thinking about this right now are you thinking oh my goodness how much risk do I have in my portfolio am I going to make the wrong decisions because I don't have a plan\nCall me my number's eight hundred seven to five to nine a witness or financial advisors focused specifically on retirement income planning whether you're getting ready to retire like Annan Tony or whether you're already retired and you're drawing from your savings\nWere alive we'll answer the phone I'm going to give you the number twice or write it down the number's\nEight hundred seven to five to nine eight eight don't wait don't procrastinate call me at eight hundred seven to five to nine eight eight\nBats website if you haven't check this out this is a tremendous resource for you and it's just chock full of great information ... upcoming seminars are listed here you can find out more about ... and her team so\nSimply go to Beth Andrews dot info it's bath Andrews dot I. N. F. O. you know that's when we're keeping these risks in mind that you're talking about\nHow do we figure out how much risk we already have in our own strategy well I use the\nAndrews retirement GPS to determine if you're on track for for part of it and then I also use a team of CSP used to do a weighted average analysis\nWhich gives you a risk score so what you get is a score for what you've got in your investments and then I also make sure that my client walk through a risk questionnaire\nThat gives them a score for what they can actually tolerate it's amazing how many times those two numbers are really far apart so for many of my clients it helps to visualize the impact\nOf different market conditions so if we have another recession like we had in two thousand and we had again in two thousand and eight what does that do to your lifestyle if you are retired\nThat's all your assets to gather categorize like that that might show a different story than what you thought those quarterly statements are showing right yeah that's exactly right when you add it all up think about that stack of statements that is not a plan\nHaving money and your four one K. all by itself that's not a plan I had somebody come to me and say yeah best I've been\nWorking with this financial advisor for a few years and he said we're just going to roll over the four oh one K. into an IRA and draw down\nThat is not a plant and that could be a recipe for disaster\nSo when you add up everything that you have sometimes people find out they've got a lot more money in one area like large cap stocks than they thought because they've been plowed money into their four one K. for a long time and quite frankly large dogs have done really really well\nThis is called overlap and it might be where you have all your money in one category or maybe all your money in one stock cars you might own five or six different mutual funds that have a lot of money in one stock and said that can be really really dangerous\nSo when I was working with the Annan Tony recently we went through the Andrews retirement GPS and it showed them that they each had different risk profiles and it was averse to risk Tony was okay with some risk maybe not as much risk because they had\nBut now we had a starting point we knew exactly what we needed to do we needed to get to where each of them were comfortable\nAnd we needed to get to where it makes sense for them to be able to draw retirement income from the savings that they had\nNo family had a lot of longevity in it she was pretty confident she was going to live well into her nineties and Tony family didn't go in and I had a discussion about how risk is especially important\nConcerning women because women live longer we have to make sure that we preserve our savings for a much much longer time your health and your wells are connected there's no question about that\nNow Tony as a veteran so he's one of my heroes he did twenty five years in the coast guard he knew the risks in his job and he accepted that\nOn the other hand stayed home and raised three children she was her job was to keep those children face and she wanted to keep her money safe

one of her office is\nThe main office in South point and she has an additional office in Robin said here's ... phone number\nEight hundred Seventy five to nine eight eight and a number to call again it's eight hundred seven to five twenty nine eighty eight and her Web site that they Andrews died in ... we're talking today about risk and we've discussed the importance of diversifying across asset classes which is\nProbably the number one way to limit risking your portfolio that that's how else can we protect against the weak spots that might be lurking in our strategy well\nAs you said since the beginning of the show today is very important to have a plan and so part of your overall retirement plan should not only have that pie chart that diversification of assets that also should have some different accounts with different tax treatment\nNow I'll give you some examples of that I've got clients who needed to take a tremendous amount of money out of their Iowa re\nIn order to purchase a second home and we did some planning on that and we found out that they were going to have a very big tax bill and it was gonna bump 'em up to tax bracket so what we decided to do is to spread that out over time instead of taking it in any one year\nSo they use just strategy involved getting a loan for the second house now I Know having debt is an emotional issue especially in retirement but when we looked at the amount of money that they would need to pay on taxes to take that money out of their IRA\nAnd put it down in a lump sum it just wasn't worth it\nKeep in mind when you take big lump sum is out of your IRA you have to pay tax on the amount that you take out and then you have to pay tax on the tax and so on in order to get that money out so by the time we grow sit up\nAnd that was a big tax bill that they really wanted to avoid they wanted to avoid going up into\nOne or two higher income tax bracket now another thing that you can do is managed capital gain\nSome of my clients take the stocks that they have that have big capital gains on them and instead of giving cash to their church they give those ducks to the church and guess what the church doesn't pay taxes on the games you can do that with any qualified charity so it's just a way to manage taxes\nAnd have that tax diversity as well as to have diversity among different types of stocks large stocks and small stuff\nNow have that flexibility other times people just want to do day to day normal things like buying a car and so begging if we're planning on buying a car the next year we wanted to come out of that tax free account right\nIn the sounds to me tax I liked that word tax rate OK so bad [noise] how can tax diversification how can that help protect your assets from certain risks out there well having\nDifferent tax treatments in the different buckets of your retirement strategy gives you options now sometimes people have the opposite of spending money in large sums like buying a car or buying that second vacation home sometimes people don't have that option like in the in the instance of having a big medical expense\nOr if you have to take withdrawals to pay loans just because you want to get to retirement and not have any loan\nSo setting yourself up so that you have options gives you flexibility whether it's a good situation or a bad situation one of those situations that I can think of that happens frequently in that are are friends Tony An ana we're worried about is what if one person passes away early\nSo if you think about that Tony has a little bit of the veterans pension but most of their their income comes from Social Security\nNow is Tony does pass away before Anna she's going to be in a situation where she needs to make up the lost income from losing his Social Security by taking money out of their IRAs that means they higher tax situation for Anna\nNow you want to make sure that you meet with somebody that's qualified to give huge tax advice now I'm a CPA and I'm also a C. F. P. so I'm qualified to give tax advice on your account as well if you're only getting investment advice if you only sit down with your financial advisor and they're not telling you\nWhat the best way to take Social Security is and how to smooth out your taxes and give yourself tax options in the future that's not overall comprehensive invite\nThe plan sort of let you see the future so you can plan for unexpected health expenses or the sudden death of a spouse now we ended up with Tony and and we ended up purchasing some life insurance\nAnd it wasn't really convinced that if Tony was gone that she would have enough money to stay in her current house she lives really close or children and she's expecting their first grandchild coming up really soon\nSo one of her biggest fears was having to leave the lifestyle that she's got\nShe wants to stay in her house and spend time with her grandchild to we ended up putting some life insurance into the mix as well life insurance is tax free as well why not put your your plan and your savings in the hands of a genuine financial professional\nSomeone whose license to give tax and other advice as well as just investment advice\nCall me an eight hundred Seventy five to nine eight eight don't wait don't procrastinate if you call me right now we're live and we will answer the phone if you have at least two hundred thousand dollars save for retirement call me right now an eight hundred Seventy five to nine eight eight\nAnd you can reach back on line as well at best Andrews debt info you can learn more about the Andrews retirement and GPS and her upcoming dinner workshops again here's that website it's bath Andrews", "show_name": "Hugh Hewitt Show", "year": "2018", "city": "Pittsburgh", "day": "27"}
