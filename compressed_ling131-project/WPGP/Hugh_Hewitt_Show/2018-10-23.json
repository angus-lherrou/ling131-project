probably are very aware of\nAs a loyal listener of the Hugh Hewitt show uh the federation of Americans for immigration reform it is an extraordinarily important organization that really has their finger on the pulse of what's going on with respect\nTo the ... now the caravan is the lead story of the morning without question and a and that includes last night's massive rally in Texas for Ted Cruz are held by the president of the United states did you see\nNot just how many people were there but there was ongoing coverage throughout the day yesterday\nOn Fox News and in other places of the thousands and thousands of people who waited in line overnight some for twenty four maybe even pushing up to thirty six hours\nTo get in to hear the president in Texas a rallying for Ted Cruz last night and oh by the way what do you know what a strange strange sight to see you know it was only two short years ago\nMaybe two and a half a a little bit I guess when you go back to the summer of twenty sixteen and the primary season in the in the spring of or excuse me some are twenty fifty and then the primary season in the spring of twenty sixteen when Donald Trump and Ted Cruz we're not exactly sharing stages together in warm embrace\nAre lying to head the calls and\nAccusations of you know National Enquirer stories about a a Ted Cruz's father are related to JFK and an all or you know these are all of these kinds of strange things\nBut I'll tell you what nothing like two years of Democrat insanity to bring former political rivals together in common cause and at the end of the day that's what this is that's what this was\nThe president of United States last night rally in for and he's done this with others to\nYou know President Trump and Lindsey Graham didn't always get along very closely as you know Lindsey Graham was more closely aligned with one of President Trump's fiercest critics the late John McCain\nBut it's amazing what the Democrats can do for Republican unity and unification simply by being well very democratic and that's wrong way say but being very Democrat\nAnd that's essentially what has happened last night so the president of the United states last night a rallying for Ted Cruz and they came out by the thousands and thousands of people seem to at least say people the media the media the left\nDemocrats whatever you want to call them and kind of it's kind of all one in the same those are all synonymous with one another the media and the Democrats on the left are literally all synonymous with one another that will say that these are Trump crowds are overblown they tell you this rock Obama held a rally in California\nA short while ago filled with about three million just to just the the area and the county he was in about three million very very blue voters it's a very blue district hip seven hundred and fifty people come out to see him\nPresident Trump has tens of thousands at all of these rallies there were always overflow crowds outside they're studying up big TV monitors you know big screens for them to watch from the outside\nThey just want to be a part of it and the reason why isn't just enthusiasm for what President Trump stands for including\nHis very strong statements yesterday about um about the caravan with about migrants at about securing our border and so on and so forth it so that they're not just rallying for what the president is preaching and what the president President is\nIs I'm advocating it's rallying against the tactics of the left rallying against the bullying rallying against the intimidation rallying against the harassment rallying against the physical battery in a salt in some cases route rallying against um you know the media calling for these things\nRallying against the left are laughing when Republicans are treated in such ways\nI Know you played this yesterday that Bush and all you put a lot or ... yesterday and I'm surprised he didn't play the whole show an audio form because his voice was so bad and get well soon you hopefully you are a couple of you're not listening right now you should be sleeping after a night in Pittsburgh God Bless you\nAre but you should be sleeping but a Phillip range of course former Obama a W very ... deputy assistant secretary of state\nUh on on MSNBC\nThat essentially mocking Mitch McConnell who was a being harassed in a restaurant the way Sarah Sanders has been harassed and restaurants the way so many others have just been attacked or just for being Republicans just by rabid liberal protestors who listen to their masters\nOn national television online they listen to no debt wild they can listen to their own um there are no Democrats elected positions or other well respected positions of authority calling for an end to the harassment in the intimidation\nThere no no one is calling for an end to this have you heard Nancy Pelosi have you heard Chuck Schumer the two ranking members of Congress for the Democrats have you heard any of the more popular\nOr Democrats or who are kind of in the news you know the Elizabeth Warren's the Cory bookers the Kamala Harris says have you heard any of them denouncing Maxine Waters\nAnd those who would call for more violence intimidation and harassment of Republicans no they're not saying anything former President Obama who is still revered by the left\nIs he's speaking out and saying no stop this this is not what it's about we'll win in the streets by by uh intimidating harassing and and and quite frankly battering people in certain circumstances we don't win that way we win at the ballot box no\nNone of them are saying this instead they're on television\nAllowing the media and people like villa brains using the media to call for more of\nThis and guess what it is done is this rally those thousands of people to all of these places where the president is holding rallies by the thousands even though they can all get in your son enough seats and yet they're willing to sit outside\nFor twenty four hours for thirty six hours they're getting like there were at a at a football game Justin the chance that they can get in and if they can't get in and then they'll cheer from the outside of the venue like they did last night last night down in Houston\nThat's that's not just pro Trump that's rebelling against the insanity of the left that's rebelling against the calls for violence\nAnd the lack of calls for civility that's what's happening so the president of the United states really found\nA tremendous you know has found really a tremendous rallying cry you know and and that is against what the Democrats he latched on to something I Know he didn't coin it but a lot of people are truly brought into play and the president seems to have been braced it and that is\nJobs not mobs Democrats if you vote Democrat it brings you mobs if you vote Republican the president has taken a saying now\nBrings you jobs and he's a hundred percent right\nOver four million jobs created since he took over and of course the lowest unemployment rate we've seen in this country in nearly what five decades\nLiterally five decades I Want to say goes back to Nineteen sixty nine ah the lowest unemployment rate and of course the lowest all time unemployment rate for so many of those subgroups including African Americans Latino Americans uh women and youth\nIn terms of unemployment rates so you bring\nYou what do you want jobs are mobs and I think people are responding they're coming out to see the president they're coming out to listen they're coming out to hear him rally not only for his policies and for you know a continuation of the tax cuts and the things that have a you know that a sport our economic growth to the level that it has\nBut also for those members of Congress that need a little bit of a boost to make sure that we maintain the majority in both houses and also for those who are running\nNew candidates who are running I Will tell you this I kind of laugh somewhat when the president's\nHis own party to keep control but he would be ... you know he would be bucking political history in the same way that he bucket when he won the office of president in the first place it would just be an amazing thing\nBut at any rate the president last night obviously are spending a ...\nTalking about

yesterday the president was calling Ted Cruz lie in bed and suggesting or a you know the national Enquirer suggesting that his father was complicit in the murder of JFK and all of these other things and it's amazing\nWhat a little bit of a democratic extremism can do to bring a political rivals together and last night they were embracing one another as if they were long lost\nFriends do you see that kind of unity happening just a you know on an on an individual or an anecdotal scale or is this widespread Republicans\nAll coming together to combat what they see is democratic extreme as\nWell I don't know if I put it that way you know I think that you have a lot of Republicans that were at odds with President Trump twenty sixteen and understand where their voters our number one ... their voters like President Trump\nSo arguing or being at arm's length President Trump when you're running for reelection in mid term election where you\nNeed a Republican base turnout to begin with a ... that's not going to work\nOr you know number number two I'm the president has been helpful in in firing up the Republican base and especially the way politics has become so incensed Balkan eyes\nUm and they're just there's not a lot of currency out there or um for running a running in a lecture and especially in a red state like Texas and I could you know you could pick off a list of red states where they're at a Senate races are\nPotentially competitive Senate races it just doesn't do any good to 'em run away from Trump so if you if you want to make sure you get the turnout that you're going to need and if you want to make sure you're gonna get turn it you're going to campaign with the president and you're going to make nice looking up and I think it's just it's as simple as that\nYeah we ... David I'm director is our guest a buffer inserting a preview of that it's not so much just the the campaigning with the president and and being aligned with the president\nIs being United against the Democrats I feel like the Kavanaugh episode of this as late summer slashed ball\nOr along with this caravan episode now it is it is driving a lot more unity among Republicans because they feel like the Democrats have just become so extreme and are basically resorting to any measures necessary to try to stop President Trump I feel like more than rally for president it's railing against that Democrat push and that's what they're trying to do\nWell so I think that if if you will get correct look I think they're trying to use those two episodes we know that have a lot of impact on Senate races you know it has an impact\nOn some house races and you know the territory where you have solid Republican territory where Republican voters in this big aged from a place that that's what happens when you call Washington it for all the White House\nIn a midterm year I think having a kind of served to re engage Republicans and sort of wake up the conservative base\nAnd and so I think that's a big part of it I just think that when you're when you're looking at a Republican like Ted Cruz who had previously battle with the president and they didn't always get along and there are a number of Republicans in that boat if you look at senator Dean Heller in Nevada\nAnd then the calculation wasn't so much gee these Democrats really scare me\nI'm I'm going to be with Trump I think the calculation was\nThat I'm going to be with Trump because that's going to help me win because that's where my voters are and because fighting with a Republican president or find a Republican isn't going to do me any good\nIn the situation that I'm In I think with Kavanaugh and some of these other issues have done a native little bit easier unite with Trump look policy perspective because it has put in the background maybe one of those issues that were problematic about Trump and some of these states content\nIn a state like you know and a senior Arizona Texas a North Dakota Missouri\nUh the best place you could have been all along is probably with President Trump\nDavid I'm drunk or is our guest a this morning on the Hugh Hewitt programs so the the ... let's talk about why people want to align with the president the president that it was supposed to be so unpopular the latest poll I think it was just yesterday NBC Washington are are are not a washing the wall Street Journal poll\nShows him at forty seven percent which is Pete which is pretty amazing thing and when you compare it to President Obama going into his first midterm in twenty times he was that around forty five forty six I saw those numbers correctly yesterday\nHow do you explain that given the and I think you've seen the the same surveys done by the media Research Council and others that Ninety two percent of the press coverage for the president this entire summer has been negative Ninety two percent of stories including the Trump had been negative yet he's up there at forty seven percent I'd be explained that\nRepublican voters just don't pay attention and news stories that in that regard I mean I I don't think it matters to Republican voter what are right or or anybody in the media\nRight but it wasn't just a survey of Republican voters there was a survey of over\nNo I understand that but you have to look at this as when you've got a country that's divided down the mental essentially more or less and and you've got some ... orders of on each side that will swing a little\nBlaming Bob for that but if you can turn around getting the Senate back in jail and make sure that stays under control and Kevin McCarthy all will be forgiven time from off your job thank you [noise]\nDoing my best view doing my best to do my job in the face of incessant trolling from the host of the show who isn't actually hear my goodness gracious [noise]\nAh the Baker Mayfield story a thanks for joining us by France joining indeed from Cleveland, Ohio my home base the pain free really factor dot com studios of am fourteen twenty the answer things so much for joining us to start your day great conversation with David I'm drunk\nRan out of time before I could ask them a question about the caravan and and it's pretty obvious question and that is how we use it and why is it\nThat no Democrat politicians have spoken out against the care\nNot one not one I mean\nQuite literally no one is saying whoa whoa whoa whoa\nThere started with two thousand and is now up to seven thousand and by the time they reverse the one thousand miles they still have to go to get to the southern border of the United states\nIt'll probably go ten twelve Fifteen thousand whoa whoa whoa whoa we can't just take all of these people in\nWe can't just you know a release all of these thousands of people into the end of the fabric of the continental United States of America on a wink and a nod promised that they'll come back for an actual am they are now asylum hearing it's simple we can't\nDo that and also why is that why is the overwhelming majority of these individuals who are in this caravan why are the men of working age\nBecause there aren't a ton of families according to those reporting from a you know that caravan their families it's mostly males of working age that are coming here are these people are really\nSeeking asylum is there really something that terrible going on in the middle eastern Asia or Middle Eastern rather Central American nations although the president pointed out there are people from the middle east who have joined in as well\nRemember our southern border is essentially a revolving door for people to come into the United states from not just Mexico or from Central America but quite frankly from all over the world because these other countries are not taking their sovereignty as seriously as we uh we would like to hear\nBut anyway [noise] all of the Central American migrants are few things really so bad in their countries that they need to seek asylum from persecution\nAnd fear that they face in their own countries is that really what this is about is this really humanitarian issue where these people are being persecuted and they cannot you know they they cannot stay in their own countries without dying\nWell let's put that to the test for a moment we'll get a little credit to Fox News here and do a one of my listeners at my local show in Cleveland ah for sharing this with me this was a Fox News report from Sunday and I'm questions\nBy the reporter here from Fox News of a member of the caravan I think are extraordinarily revealing well the questions but moreover the answers are extraordinarily revealing I Want you to listen very carefully to what is really going on in this caravan of quote unquote migrants\nThat many of us believe are actually more like invaders trying to circumvent us immigration law please give the ...\nI didn't see as far as the eye can see I can see on during the immigrants that in order to take the bus into Honduras they went through about a mile and now they're trying to tackle Mexico right now they are north of that river [noise]\nNorth of the bridge that you saw people on yesterday so last night people got frustrated found a bridge Mexico's process about six hundred and forty people can get a visa for potentially asylum here could take forty five Ninety Days have look out for us it hey we're aware of that show last night\nIn Morales across the river swimming people came in droves I had to see maybe two hundred immigrants\nLast night maybe in a thirty minute time watching the river coming here and now you see them now I said they're going to be as a caravan me claim and they're on their way to a town called ... there were about we're right now about twenty miles north of that river\nGoing ... right now some people here you can see they're taking a break and they've got some shade here they're getting something great guy will be joined now by one of the members of the ah the caravan his name is Louis you're from Honduras tell me where are these people going why are they doing right now\nWe're going to ...\nIs people want to go to the border of United States and [noise] I mean we've come they coming over here because um [noise]\nA situation in our country is going back\nMay ask you this as well as you know\nThe un eighty hours here un high commissioner revenues refugees actually brought them in to try to help processing now the standard that they're going to use as unless you're a victim of her or him have a credible fear of persecution from race nationality religion or political views don't qualify for asylum so what are these people going to say when they get the United states\nFriday or say something\nI don't know they're gonna probably as they they gave him something they can stay on the United states when they give you can go to school so they apartments and they can go to work as you know President Trump is that's it\nThat's it\nThat's what you needed to hear and I hope you understood what you just heard you cannot claim asylum in the United states unless you are\nFleeing persecution on the basis of race or religion or sexual orientation et cetera he ran down the reporter ran down the things that you can claim asylum or you're being persecuted their country so what is it he asked this ... this caravan remember that you're going to say when you get up there and he said basically we're coming to pick your jobs\nYou heard him\nWere coming to take advantage of your educational system are going to put our kids in your schools and we're going to take your jobs he said we want to go there and we want to work and then what are you going to do with that money by the way are you going to spend it in the United states lost at least helping to contribute to the United states autonomy\nAnd he's not going to let people in Mexico said they are not going to let these people pass I Will tell you our earlier today we saw about two hundred wire police were going to stop them on this highway a brief they pulled back they retreated I don't think they want a confrontation with a point is president said he's not going to let people and you guys\nSaid at last I last left our land we we have over there but a a friend and bought or sold them all and people were upset voter nail radio in the United states\nThere's a change though as you know that Mexico in the United states is supposed to reach us third party saved agreement unless you qualify receiving request asylum in Mexico we're not going to the United states is not going to let you and that's going to be the reason for denial is that going to stand up\nThey do in fact they throw it away they tend to buy our countries we're coming\nAnd that's one of the money that is one of the\nIf they send us back we're going to turn around and come back again\nSo he says we're going to come here and we want to take jobs and we're going to take money and we're going to send it back to support our family's back there this is why it's the vast majority of the members of this caravan are like I said working age males because they're gonna come to the United states to work they're not fleeing persecution for the race in Honduras\nThey're not fleeing persecution because of their sexual orientation they're not fleeing persecution because of their ah of their uh ethnicity they're not fleeing persecution because of a of any reason whatsoever they're coming to the United states because their nation can't give them work\nAnd so they're coming to take jobs for people in another country and they're not going to repatriate those dollars back to their own country they don't want to come to the United states to be American\nHow do we know this\nBecause they're not walking under the American flag\nThey're walking behind a massive\nStreet wits banner of the Hondurans live and then they were flying Honduran flags over themselves as they march if a group of seven thousand people tries to enter another country flying their own flag that is not a migration that is an invasion\nThey don't want to abandon the nation that has essentially made their lives unlivable in their minds\nThey want to move that nation north into a better nation but not swear allegiance to that new nation one would think that it might be more beneficial for these people to be flying an American flag over their heads saying we love America we want the American dream instead they're flying the Honduran flag saying we have a right to come here\nAnd still be Honduras we're bringing Honduras north\nThrough Guatemala\nThrough Mexico and into the United states and you can't stop us and if you try to we will turn around and come back again\nBy the way the president lettuce and last time he's going to have to let us in this time to not the president of the United states last night speaking in Texas for this rally or Ted Cruz said really not so much I don't have to do that and I'm not going to do that\nAnd I'll let you hear a little bit more about that coming up after the break with the president says no we're not\nGoing to do that or we're going to use whatever means necessary including as many troops necessary to secure that border and not allow this phony claim of\nThis isn't just you know legitimate grass roots are just people are starting to walk and somebody else followed like Forrest Gump they're not just running alongside just random laying off the cuff this is an organized effort these people are funded and they're fed they're given rides\nNot all walking [noise] they're taking turns robbing trucks to what lengths do you want the president to go [noise]\nI Want to know how the president should stop these

need congressional approval to stop this because the president already has\nCongressional approval to stop this it wasn't given the Donald Trump the man\nThis was passed in Nineteen fifty two\nSection

just the difference between aliens in class of aliens is different or there is a difference because just aliens could mean\nA immigrants trying to come to the United states legally or illegally but literally trying to immigrate to the United states that's different from those seeking refuge in the United states or seeking asylum in the United states there are different classes of people who want to come to the United states\nAnd that's why the language of this law passed by Congress in Nineteen fifty two\nIs so important one of the president finds that the tree of any aliens or any class of aliens in to the United states would be detrimental to the interest of the United states he made by proclamation\nAnd for such period as he deems shell deem necessary\nSuspend the entry of all aliens or any class of aliens as immigrants or not immigrants again meaning refugee seekers or asylum seekers or impose on the entry of aliens any restrictions that he may deem inappropriate this gives the president plenty ... power\nTo decide who gets to come here and when and for how long it's not up to Congress anymore Congress gave that power to the president of the United states back in Nineteen
