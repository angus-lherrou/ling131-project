... will some of the Fifteen people brand new turkey claims were the hit team that killed ... close friends to ask them what they were doing an instant born the day 'cause she'll be died what do you see happening David\nWell the music the mood music for a while has indicated that Saudi Arabia would pin the blame on some scapegoat in their security services that turkey was likely to accept that explanation or as long as Saudi Arabia acknowledged that your mouth show he had been killed inside\nThe confidence in Istanbul and that seems like the way things are headed at this hour or last night of a well informed\nSource or who knows what the courts up to a told me that Saudi Arabia\nHad identified the person they're going to say is responsible or he put it more honestly and said the person that is responsible or someone in the intelligence services who knows crown prince Mohammed bin Salman personally and felt like he he this person and intelligence\nHad the authorization to carry out some kind of rendition and that went horribly wrong um if you've been following Saudi Arabia or you've been following this story that does seem terrifically plausible but it's convenient for Saudi Arabia for turkey and for the United states to find a way to move on\nAnd this is the Henry the second defense from when the English King\nSaid no one will know unwritten me of this troublesome praised informed as nice go up and slaughter Thomas it back in ... America the drill it works and you know the twelve hundred in the ... century I'm not sure it works today David absence of public judicial proceeding that the west can pursue what do you think oh well\nWhat his works mean you know for ... governments make do with a partial truth fairly often or the quarter public opinion is a different matter I think at this point are after all that we've seen\nLeaked by Turkish ah officials and all this been confirmed it's going to be hard for crown prince Mohammed bin Salman to repair his ... his reputation\nYou know he he'd gotten pretty far in the west as a reformer and somebody was going to open up the kingdom kind of an innovator and a new kind of leader for Saudi Arabia I think he's going to have a lot of trouble now getting that kind of selfies with Jeff Bezos and Mark Zuckerberg that he's been accustomed to\nIn fact the person that has been identified to you by a good source as likely to be pointed to as the prime mover of the rendition gone bad\nUm implicates NBS in ordering the rendition does that important do you do think the royal court changes in succession\nTwo elements there first of all I think this person is a intelligence officials who's going to take the blame if that person is try that person will be tried in that Saudi port so that's not the kind of court we're used to wear the defend it might have an opportunity to blame the ground perhaps\nA second of all\nA you know in the past a crown prince who came under this kind of a cloud\nMight have trouble with the succession a Saudi Arabia has changed crown prince Mohammed bin Salman has consolidated power like no figure in the kingdom in decades he holds all the key levers are and so the best handicapping it there's no one in a position to change of\nRain in to challenge him a while there are many people in the kingdom who are enjoying criticizing him over that he's made many enemies along the way\nNone of them seems to have\nEnough heft to push him out a lot of succession as long as his dad is okay with it and his dad is elderly and may not be that company right now\nA secretary of state Mike Pompeo wrapped up a very brief meeting with the king ah not too long ago as he expected me with NBS when he's there\nI'm expecting that he will I don't know the details of his schedule\nSo it is it possible that\nThere is within the guy and this was just a range of possibility and giving them the second option which is your ... responsibility but not a guilt\nThe other one as you say someone was trying to take me out the rogue operative was actually working to advance the exiled faction of the royals that I had improved and the Ritz Carlton has that been floated anywhere you\nKnow you know it to be honest a cynical as I Am I expected that is what they would go with I expected we would hear that there's rogue operative was associated with some old regime\nBut in fact what I'm told we're going to hear is that the rogue operative is someone who actually was a friend of a crown prince Mohammed bin Salman who felt like he had the okay from the crown prince to do this rendition\nAnd who was trying to make a name for himself who was trying to impress everybody with his daring do and be a quote unquote James Bond and it went horribly wrong\nThat is the Henry the second is pure Henry the second Thomas back at a parallel will that be enough for the United states John Bolton that I talked about this at that point he said we don't have the fact that the middle east anything is possible that was last Thursday would the Henry the second defense ... a sufficient for the United states\nWell a key question here is has turkey shared its intelligence red turkey Turkish officials have leaked to many people including me that they are in possession of audio and maybe video of from inside the conflict showing who did what in the ... you know they've got they've got the goods\nIf they've shared that with their U.S intelligence got her pies who often work very closely with the Turks then that's one thing and if they haven't if they've only briefed about it that's another that that diminishes the degree of seriousness for the U.S and diminishes the pressure on the U.S\nTo try to pursue this it depends on what the Turks have shared really\nRight now doesn't impact for example the war in Yemen and this is actually word comes home this is the anti Iran alliance ... stresses who's a Jordan and Egypt and Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates and Israel in America\nTrying to confront the who the who are sending rockets into Saudi Arabia that are made in Iran does this break that anti Iranian alliance which many of us have welcome a as being a necessary course correction in the middle east\nOr I'm not sure this has any impact on the Iranian allies I I'm not I don't see the United Arab Emirates or Israel or Egypt showing any squeamish than is whatsoever about what's been done here\nAnd so far it looks like President Trump is very willing to accept this explanation he was even yesterday\nYou know getting ahead of the Saudis and already suggesting that this was a rogue operator before the Saudis had begin to float that explanation\nThemselves so I think the geopolitics are likely to remain unchanged so long as the succession a inside Saudi Arabia is an changed\nAnd therefore arms sales on interrupted the American public accepts it moves on because it is an exotic story and read like a thriller I'm a ... has a lot of friends but it is it is very difficult to keep a story like this\nAbove the fold for very long ... Patrick\nYeah I think we're trying to say before where it's going to hit a the crown prince is with elite opinion\nYou know the wall street and Silicon Valley uh he's enjoy the company of those people he's worked hard to get them to invest in Saudi Arabia to bring their businesses and their insights and they know how to help diversify the Saudi economy he's going to find it very hard to be a front man for that sort of effort\nAnd that's not trivial because Saudi Arabia over the not too long term has got some real issues in terms of being able to support their economy on their oil revenue\nA last question Democrat Patrick Winn into the hands of the soldiers goes into a paperback edition or is this going to be the the forward because this is I don't know if it's a turning point or a bump in the road\nYou know it just sort of do\nWell I appreciate your coming to join me David ... come to New York times author of into the hands of the soldiers which is the definitive you've got to read it to understand what the Arab Spring was about what happened to the Arab Spring where the new on time comes from and how it is going to endure or not indoor\nThank you David let me that's just so great to be able to talk to someone actually knows what they're doing on Saudi Arabia is very difficult [noise]\nUm it is not difficult to tell you don't touch my Medicare dot com is where you go to join the a Mac team are fighting against Bernie care in these elections don't touch my Medicare dot com is run by the association of bitter American citizens dot us\nA Mac dot US you ought to be a member of that it's a million plus strong Dan Weber has built a machine\nAnd they counter left wing A.
