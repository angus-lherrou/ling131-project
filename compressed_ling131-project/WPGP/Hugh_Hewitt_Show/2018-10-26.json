helping us to recover that and um and I really do think that in the in the end argument is the answer um it's it's not that that that's what the constitution really is it's a framework to argue it it doesn't\nIt doesn't provide you with a clear set of answers it provides you with the ... which we argue and each generation needs to be able to do that all the time\nAnd Madison's example is I think maybe the best because he's not gifted in Hamilton is with charisma or physical size he hasn't got Washington's rectitude ... to ... or a legend but he just works at it he just work at it every day because you have\nTo pay any he thinks like a lawyer even though he's unlike Hamilton or out others or Jefferson he's not trained as a lawyer he just thinks that way and um\nAny you know he can change within his own mind that ability to sort of step on step across the chasm and occupy the other side and the and understand what balance me at all\nSo I went down to ... am I pronouncing correctly about three months ago and spent some time\nAround here but I tell ya\nAnd and I I went up to the second floor just looked at that window where he where he wrote those ... minutes in the constitution and I just thought to myself what a brain what an amazing area\nYeah up here it's actually more impressive that I ever thought I mean I've been there cases that especially they've renovated it's about what Fifteen miles from a lot of cello though a lot of people go to Monticello do good enough it at about a month to\nSo brave to be back in the early factor dot com studios inside of the beltway answer welcome my first guest this morning Florida's governor\nRick Scott is calling in from the sunshine state governor Scott welcome in the first question is how is the recovery in the panhandle going\nWhere we've got a lot of people working really hard uh down to about twenty three thousand or something morning or good or better\nWe're down to about twenty three thousand people without power right now homes and businesses that power so well on goal is to get most everybody back on except there'll be some pockets of people often slapped by um first of November the first part of next week's work with our utility companies\nWith having the weight National Guard a response I called up without number the national guard these communities don't andme over the home and she'll can ... and so we've got a lot of work to do a yesterday I was with vice president Pence which was a good day because he came down\nTo announce that the president's committed to rebuilding tend to air force base which is just\nTo the east of Panama City um that is a got a great military presence or the two and a half billion dollar impact\nOn our local economy there of course about twenty thousand jobs so that was a big deal we went to a a church that was providing a a really nice lunch to our National Guard the coast guard members and families from ten to ... so you know we're working hard every day and it's going to take a while um but\nFor the ... we've had these hurricanes before I had one last year we come back we we build stronger\nPeople love to live in Florida we've got the nicest people helping each other down here and got so many people coming from all over the country a serving food helping people parks on their house it's an it's really nice\nYou know I've got a lot of support for tumor but Khan over the last couple of weeks here because they they go down to the heavy lifting I'm sure you run into him but that Kendall announcement is huge truck time they were talking when the hurricane hit\nHow homestead never came back after Andrew twenty five years ago and sort of get the confirmation from the president the vice president there will be the ... is coming back that's a big deal to everyone in that community\nIt's a big deal and the truth is they need they need to come back it sorts of military mission you know we we don't have drilling in the eastern half of the uh the eastern part of the Gulf there that allows\nA our military to test I'm\nTest different um pieces of equipment they they can do a lot of training there which is where you know where the air force the navy that's where you're trained to learn to be a pilot\nAnd so they can do it and I interrupted by a commercial activity there so it's it's an important a mission for the for the United states we have twenty military bases and reunify the man and as governor I've tried to do everything I can to help them fulfill their mission\nAnd make sure all the military members enter veterans have all the resources they need to ... everybody want to live in the state\nNow now governor Rick Scott let's turn to politics or I've heard it's sad that you would be running away with the Senate race but for the fact\nMichael wiped out the voting ability of many Floridians in the panhandle I read an executive order you sent out our ... going to be able to vote because they want to send you to Washington is their senator they really do want to replace Bill Nelson I Want to send you\nBut they're going to be able to vote and you know there aren't any school to go to\nA Hewlett what we've done is we had eleven counties impacted and some some in fact a little bit less like a with a state capitals the county\nSo we sat down with their supervisors election they looked at the uh by county and we said how's how can we work with you to make sure you know people have the right to vote and they can get out there so you can vote by absentee or by mail um\nIn our state or you can do it by early voting and you can do it on election day and we've worked in every county to make sure of that you eat out the vote what they did in Bay county which is animosity\nHave five but supervised election wanted to do there has to stop by big mega sites because that's what we got\nA more damage where there's a lot of people and so the supervisors doing of elections down there is doing TSA\nI'm just making sure everybody gets out to vote and and clearly you know campaigns will go and make sure people know where to vote because what happens a lot of people they wake up on election day say okay I'm going to go vote and they just go to the last place they voted\nOn the last time and so there are everybody's working hard to let people know that you might have to be going to a different place\nAnd so how do you feel about the campaign right now I I look at the CPI average three of the last four polls have you had but you're busy doing hurricane recovery it's not really campaign mode in Rick Scott style which is a hundred and ten percent or however you juggling these things\nBut my first job is to take I'm going to get on the governor of my system so that's what I've been doing my wife has gone a campaign for me\nI when I had wanted to run back into it and she says that score eight honey but I hate public speaking I'm scared to death well she's given four or five speeches a day it's hot and has done a great job a so she's looking there but here's why we're going to let\nIt actually becomes evident when you see her and so in her ... here's the difference between the two of us\nI've been in the panhandle and then in his county's only three or four counties today\nMy opponent did three or four days a photo ops and he says there's nothing else I can do I wanna go back to campaign\nHe's a quarter and everybody knows that he doesn't wanna work he's not a worker of I Am and so people see that in there who's gonna win is they've watched for eight years that I've sat there and every day whatever whether whatever's going on I showed up\nAnd to my job she does all of a sudden\nHe can't he actually won in ... one thing he's done nothing on education and that's not on the environment and that did not transportation is up one day and it's become evidence and so he's the biggest example\nOf why we have to turn them he's done nothing in forty two years in ... in the public option\nForty two years wow you know and and the whole astronaut thing I actually thought he was an astronaut until someone informed me that he hitched a ride on the shuttle because he's on appropriations I really didn't think it was announced it I think it's one of those things that gets into the public safety\nAnd they said you went through the whole program and all that stuff and I'm just amazed that this is my literally right I don't know that so Governor Scott what what's your agenda going to be in D.C what do you want to bring to DC\nWell here's here's will give you and I'll give you why okay\nI grew up and found that I don't know my dad I Lived in public housing going up and I watch my mom's struggle with food on the table get healthcare it all the struggles that people have so when I became governor my goal was\nTo say that the three most important things to a family or one guy to have a job and put to your children have to have a great education because that's the chance to live the dream and number three you got to live in a sea change is a little bit when you go to Washington but it's the same thing\nWhat do we do to to make this economy better for everybody what do we do to have an education system and most of the education issues are going to be done at the state level and how do we keep people safe at the federal level more but it's going to be tied tied to the military um and so my my gender ... is\nIs to think about every family how do you make every family in America in a better position and so I think it's I think it's the ... at the federal level it's gonna be the economy is going to be how do we make sure we defend the feelings of this country\nNow governor I always tell people I Lived in California until two years ago I moved to Virginia to most diverse places in the country or Florida and California you've got lots of demographics or it's even a a greater ... in parts of California the Central Valley is not particularly diverse\nBut how do you but you do very well with the Cuban community the Latino community Puerto Rican community the African American community the or the Asian American community do very well in every community why is that\nI show up it's as simple as that\nUh I show up and in my eyes I tell her the light and the sitting governor of the state I'm going to represent you I and so so in so I'm I'm going to focus on issues that are important to you I Know I Know for the Cuban their ... year yes you're is over with rock bottom up\nAnd sit in a building also did with regard to Raul Castro\nIs waiting furious\nThat their country has basically been decimated by by a material and the Nicaraguan so furious will happen um\nWith our take away he's killing peaceful protesters and then with regard to Puerto Rican when they had Maria I showed up their eight times we bought resources we brought 'em I symptom highway patrol vehicles National Guard um utility workers\nJust show up and do your job and take care of everybody when you do people say look the guy cares about me for him\nWe could we could use that in some other campaigns Governor Scott it looks like you're surging it looks pretty good right now so last question what's your feeling about between the last ... you know we've got ten days now now the only ten days out\nOver there when we just got to get you know right now it was we got her message I just got to get people out to them you know if everybody gets out both of them were going to have a we're gonna have a big win because people know there's a big difference so\nEarly voting underway already can people go vote today\nOn one point seven million people have already voted a bias in the early and so early start is by county so in the pan ... I think in the pan handle it starts on Saturday in other parts of states already started so that people are voting that I think the estimate was going to be something like sixty five percent will be before election day\nWe're all my friends in Orlando and Tampa Sarasota in the panhandle all throughout Florida get out and vote early don't let it get their way go today Rick Scott good governor and activists posted on on tinder with everything else that's great news that the vice president brought down there yesterday\nA Chuck Todd and I were indeed thank you weren't they talking about whether or not it would it ever get back and that is great news I missed that yesterday and I'm Glad to hear that\nAnd I also think that President George W. Bush would have done something different and President Clinton would have done something different and present aren't taste audience I should have done something\nI think we're seeing here and there are moments that really has to present leadership and whether they have the moral leadership\nIronically given his statement to leave the country and Donald Trump had failed repeatedly he sounds when it came to Charlottesville he felt he fails when it came to the hurricane and this is another failure to bring the country together President Obama certainly would have handled it definitely there are times when you put partisanship aside\nAnd you try to bring the country together it's not just in this opportunity and dangerous ... because this is just escalating adults only probably going to get worse I think that the changes town\nHere I'm telling ya Democrats are going to go backwards because of this was just in shaker as I Know that Trump got nothing to do with it\nAnd they just reach
