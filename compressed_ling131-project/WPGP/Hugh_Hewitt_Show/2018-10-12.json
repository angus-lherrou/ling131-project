Ambassador John Bolton and here's the conversation we\nShould ... documents so you're you're glad we would have a use for your entire life for this job and you were right with the most disruptive presidents and fatter Jackson in the world order but is collapsing the job of what you thought it wouldn't be given all the years that you've studied the ad I say\nWell I think it's a it's a it's a job that really gives you an opportunity to serve the president or who's who's in office in every president has a different style\nOr I think good job of the national security advisor really is to make sure that whatever the style of the president that he gets the information he needs to make decisions or that he has the range of options that he needs and then that those decisions are carried out so that's my job I think it's fine\nThat we've got to disrupt the president even a kind of chaotic world because there are a lot of changes that need to be made a we're seeing a lot to do bills come do from the Obama administration so it's very fast paced\nUh but uh I wouldn't trade it for anything else\nLet me ask you about your own job since it's now in the United nation Nasser your recommendation president twofold what kind of personality and should this be a job in the cabinet or should it be stuck out\nWell you know on the second one it's really up to the president or he can make any job a cabinet rank\n'em then he'll make his decision a as he sees as best I ... I did not have cabinet rank uh when I was ... I don't think it affected me in any way either up at the un or in my dealings within the administration\nI think it's a job where you have to be prepared to get deep into the substance of issues I think it's very important in implementing policy and mostly what you do at the un is implement policy that you\nUnderstand the significance of the actions you're taking a and it'd be part of a team I felt very ... when I was there I helped make policy but I have a mostly to carry policy out\nSome national security advisers travel a lot some stay close to the oval office\nWhat's your travel schedule like looking forward especially between now and ...\nWell I've spent most of my time in Washington or traveling with the president when he travels overseas or I have done some travel I've got a trip coming up to Moscow in the caucuses countries are in about ten days reason for that is to continue to carry through on the\nConversation the President Trump and president potent hadn't Helsinki during the summer to talk about U.S Russian relations and the where we can make\nProgress where we still have issues and disagreement or and then in the caucuses to see the very significant geographical a role that they have dealing with Iran dealing with Russia dealing with turkey\nSo it's selected I work very closely with Jim Madison I pump a oh we had breakfast this morning as we do once a week to kick all these issues around and I think that's very important that the national security advisor I think under any presidential style has to be an honest broker and I I work hard at that\nWhen you sit down with your counterpart Russia next week are you going to tell them hands off our election I may say three or four times loudly\nYeah well every time I've met with the Russians in this job including with President putting themselves when I went to Russia to prepare for the Helsinki meeting I've made that point as has the president\nA is a message to believe that we're ... feet well so far we don't see the kind of Russian meddling we did in twenty sixteen Chris Wray the director the FBI said a couple of weeks ago that that could change with the stroke of the key\nWe are very worried about the question of Chinese interference not just in individual elections\nBut more broadly trying to influence the American political discussion with an influence campaign that uh I I think could well be unprecedented\nWe heard vice president Pence speak to this issue or last week it was a very important speech I think people need to read it and consider it a and I think the United states needs to stand up frankly to any foreign government\nThinks it's going to interfere in our politics we are a self governing people we will govern ourselves we don't need international institutions that tell us how to do it and we particularly don't need foreigners are trying to exert undue influence over\nWhat about these issues to the story of the day Jim ... we're trying to influence the response of the Saudi Government in the world at noon on Thursday are you satisfied with what the Saudis have told us about the disappearance of Mr ...\nWell I don't think we've we've known enough or I spoke with the crown prince yesterday along with Jared Kushner a secretary of state Mike Pompeo spoke to the crown prince is well the the president has spoken to this issue or it is something we need to get resolved to end or we need to do it as soon as possible\nIn the aftermath of the Annapolis newsroom shooting some people criticize the president or is the enemy of the people that are in the aftermath of the shocking disappear and some people have said the president is turning a\nBlind eye to violence against journalists are across the world particularly Russia what do you make a critic for the president trying to tie him to the show as\nWell I think this is ridiculous I mean I think this is a he has spoken out about it uh he's directed a secretary said Tom patio or to speak with a cause show he's a fiance and that'll happen as soon as they can get that scheduled a we're taking a number of other steps\nOr that I really can't get into at the moment but I think that uh it's just a hypocritical to say that somehow the president's not concerned about these things when manifestly his words in his actions are to the contrary\nUh Mr Nasir Saudi Arabia and political structures at best convoluted is it possible way or the Henry the second situation who will get rid of this metal some praise spiraling out of control or even something more and more level what that someone intended to undermine the crown prince and the king via this action\nYou know honestly we just don't know what the facts are and that was one of the points that are that I made to the crown prince or we need to find out what the facts are and we need to get this resolved quickly because if it is a a a a another operation\nA people need to understand that I I think the the Saudis themselves are being damaged because we don't have the facts out there is obviously been historical animosity between turkey and Saudi Arabia\nOr we have our own difficulties with turkey at the moment with they're keeping pastor Brunson effectively under house arrest for no good reason whatever a so this is a this is not that anybody's benefit and it needs to be\nCleared up is it possible that if the operation happen it could have happened without the knowledge of the crowd\nI I think a lot of things are possible in the middle East I'm at the United states does not have information that is not revealing a if we had information we'd we'd know better exactly how to handle is we've made it clear we want to know what the facts are we're going to continue to do that\nLet me turn from our ally to our enemy or the commander the Iranian Revolutionary guards who am I going to use social media to threaten the White House there are reports that there are sleeper cells in the United states given those sorts of threats and those sorts of reports or American should we be alarmed about solar money's reach into the United states\nI think we should be I think the Iranian regime is an enemy of the United states are we just had a within the past ... on the arrest of two Iranian agents in the United states\nUh scoping out Jewish and Israeli targets for possible attack uh we've seen France and other European countries\nArresting a agents of the Iranian intelligence service for planning an attack on a rally of dissident Iranians in Paris this summer we've seen France for example now impose sanctions against Iran because of this behavior\nSo we see Iran or not\nA conforming to western norms because of the Iran nuclear deal they've not done anything to try to\nModify our concern about their continued support for terrorism around the world they are accelerating this this regime is a threat that's why the president or got us out of the Iran nuclear deal that's why the economic sanctions or being re impose\nThat's why we're putting maximum pressure on the Iranian regime and just to be clear we are having a very significant effect you can hear the European governments talked about staying in the deal\nEuropean corporations and I mean the biggest one the biggest oil companies the biggest manufacturing firms are getting out of Iran are Iranian oil exports are plummeting their currency has gone through the for\nUnrest is spreading across the country even countries like China or reducing their imports of oil from Iran because they don't want to tangle with the United states\nUh this is something that we should be concerned about because Iran remains what it has been since Nineteen Seventy nine it's the world's leading state sponsor of terror at a press has its own citizens\nAnd it continues to pursue programs of weapons of mass destruction nuclear chemical and biological this is a dangerous stayed in the region and a dangerous stayed\nWorldwide and I like the

I'll keep following that but the wall Street Journal says they expect him to be released today that would make for a great great friday a pastor Brunson is free stay tuned America I'll be right back our number two to hear your child straight at\nPower lines are down it's that are out to be posted on that [noise] I'm pleased to welcome the guy who would be in charge in Ohio or a disaster to happen next year for the next four years Mike DeWine he's the attorney general in Ohio right now he's running for governor in one of the most closely watched graces in the United states\nFormer senator now attorney general DeWine welcome back to the euro ... W\nA huge great to be back with you and your listeners thank you very much\nOne of the things I think when we watch Michael come ashore governor or a general DeWine is\nWe listen to candidates than we think to ourselves are they are they able to handle a crisis and you've been doing this a long time now but but speaker Richard Cordray your your opponent has been a lawyer and a lawyer and he's been a lawyer or how about you [laughter]\nWell you know I've really tackle some tough problems and the interesting thing\nOr if you compare Cordray and Mike DeWine is that we both were attorney generals and uh you know I beat him eight years ago close race but I but I beat him but what we inherited\nA was a real mess attorney Joe Ohio runs the state crime lab and do what we took office a court right left us was if there was a rape or serious crime that occur in Ohio the unknown DNA was taken to the state crime lab\nA it was sat there if you can believe this for a hundred and twenty five days without him by overlooking that that's how far back off that they had and a quarter I left that mess and so we fixed it uh we turned cases around now\nA twenty four hours if it's an emergency uh we're doing four times as much DNA as we did the day he left office and you know our average time is about three weeks but we can turn case around very very quickly and another thing that he\nDidn't fare Cordray and what we've done a he left um they were they were all rape kits sitting and police departments all over the state of Ohio a lot of states that have this problem or he didn't do anything about it when I became attorney general we we\nStarted hearing about that and we actually have tested every single one of them we went out to the police say bring it to us we want to get this evidence are tested\nAnd we've tested as I said close to fourteen thousand uh some as these are all cold cases old cases uh some there's some Fifteen Years old\nAnd we've got hit or matches and thirty six percent so we've gone back you know and better than a third and told the local police who then turned told the victim hey we got your rape or we get your rapists\nAnd in our county alone in Cleveland where we had a\nLarge large number of them are they they have a indicted over seven hundred and fifty people\nRate while as all of that so it it's it's a great lesson and you see a problem you go after it a quarter right just just sat there and didn't uh you know do anything and don't forget a course his time are heading up Obama's a consumer group\nOut in Washington if you if you'll recall uh we we saw for example\nUh because of overregulation we ... we saw the number of our community banks with down significantly in Ohio and I'm sure that occurred in in other states as well just because of the over over regulation a quarter a and others had in place\nNow I got to ask your general DeWine the idea that Ohio which is doing well in this recovery I mean we've got I Know north eastern oil pretty doggone well I Know where it's done is cooking I Know that that's Trump country as well up in\nMoaning and trauma county nice to be what county but even in Cuyahoga County it's cooking why in the world would we turn the state over to the left the uh the laugh I mean what in the world well the people they think about\nThat that look that's absolutely right we're we're we're doing well in Ohio we do not want to go back to where\nWere ... years ago eight years ago when court or a a a ... was was attorney general and a ... ... you know he was the attorney general state of Ohio we had had lost a\nClose to four hundred thousand jobs a and you know we just were not moving our unemployment rate was high and in the last eight years under Republican conservative leadership uh we've kept taxes down cut taxes uh we've seen the economy move forward and so\nYou know what I Want to do my running mate John Houston we want to take a while to the next level uh we've come a long long way we do not want to go back uh we've got we've got a couple of challenges out there we got an opiate problem that we we have to get in front of and now instead of a you know\nPeople not being able to find jobs and not economy not moving for our biggest challenge now for employers is to find people who are qualified or people who\nAre able to pass a drug test so we're really focusing on you is is two things one is tackling a drug problem we have a twelve point action plan that makes makes a real sense is realistic\nOr some other things I'm already shirt has already started to do is attorney general but there are things I Can't do it until\nTill I'm governor I mean why things that we want to we think is very important is education and prevention for young young kitchen regarded drugs or you know I started my career as a county prosecuting attorney and I can tell you that I don't know in five years or ten years if we'll have an opiate problem but uh it there's always some drug problems and so we weren't prepared\nGetting a garden K through twelve southern age appropriate every year every year something that's been proven to to actually work we will implement that\nAnd it will make a huge difference the the other thing that we're we really want to do a is double doubt on President\nTrump's opportunities out a were have opportunities zones at Ohio oh this will mirror the tax cuts a ... in the job act that the president and Congress put through a we will make it so that uh\nSomebody looks at the state of Ohio they say well that's the place to invest that's where I I Want to take my ... capital gains I Want to take take it to Ohio or would do this in our you know most problematic areas and you know we we believe that\nA given that tax break us going to get a lot of money invested in Ohio we hope from a you know all over the country\nAre going to help ... yeah if you take that up the Youngstown Warren given the physical structure that exist there already in your combined with economic opportunities and it will cook I talked with a moaning valley chamber when they came to DC\nOn their flying but first she got away not tonight I'm flying into Columbus Ninety eight Ninety answer dot com and people want to come out and see a Mike Gallagher and Jim Jordan era taxes like sitting down at\nUm a over at the American college oh that'll be great if we're

state you and you mentioned you mentioned in an area of the state of Ohio in ... in eastern Ohio them hunting valley for example stupid metal\nUh what's your very very familiar with you know historically historically big big a Democrat area but socially conservative and\nWhat we saw course is what what President Trump did when he ran an exceedingly well uh in areas that\nYou know have never in in several lifetimes have not been a gone on Republican\nTroubled county went for Trump that has happened since I think Nixon\nOh I'm sure that's right it's been it's been a long time but but you're right we lay lay our opportunity zones on top of that I mean\nWe ... we have them with tax bill but we're on doubled down and I'll say we're going to do that with our our tax code in the state of Ohio too and and we really believe that it's going to have a lot of investment uh we ... we can't have there's there's not enough government money out there to have a government investment and have\nA we have to get the private sector and ... and we have some great things going for us and a lot of areas but with this with this tax cut that we're talking about that opportunity um it's really super economic you up in Ohio\nLast question attorney general Mike DeWine gonna be next governor Ohio and I was there for Rob Portman before I joined NBC and had to stop doing fundraisers there like a
