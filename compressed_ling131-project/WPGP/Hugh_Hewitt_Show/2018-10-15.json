equivalent of losing eight cruisers at a naval engagement\nThe cost of that is staggering\nAnd the accountability of it is going to be severe by bringing that up because last night the president was talking about general secretary of defense Mattis\nHere's what he said number three\nWhat about general matter is he going to have what I don't know he hasn't told me that relationship with him it could be that he is I think he's sort of a Democrat if you want to know the truth\nBut General Mattis has a good guy we get along very well may leave I mean at some point everybody last everybody people leave that's Washington\nThat is right away completely true even during the early days of the war\nWhen there and by the early days of the war the war has been going on since two thousand and

important to refer to ... because he was a civilian without a general\nHas to look at losing Seventeen twenty twos\nAnd say who is that on\nWho is responsible for that that is a ... that is a

about matters for the new uh because the secretary of defense and great admiration for\n... how did you read the president's comments last night\nAs people who can read the president like book\nTold me that there's no question the president has sour on General Mattis sometimes the president throw\nThings out it'd be mischievous or maybe not ... they'll how there'll be ... but for\nThe president has there been some rumblings the distance between him and the defense secretary to go on sixty minutes it and it's sort of a Democrat and you may leave and I don't need a better than he does\nWhat's fascinating about this is two things one both Republicans and Democrats say this would be a very concerning\nDeparture they see a General Mattis is wise and a stable force within the administration where the national security apparatus actually has worked very well and the second and the president may not know this but\nGeneral Mattis is not going to allow themselves to be bullied in the orchard the way President Trump sometimes there's people that he turns on if he senses that President Trump is telling you selling his ... short ... when I wrote it next year and today\nHe's just going to head out and what these uh ... needs to go\nUnder no circumstances if not confirming someone else is going to be hard\nWell I got to tell you my one of the stories I've covered this morning that doesn't has gotten much attention yet\nIs the strategic disaster of the destruction of tend to air force base apparently Seventeen at twenty twos were left behind it they may have all been destroyed maybe by some miracle God they weren't the hangar they can't get in\nSeventeen F twenty two judges is close to a ten percent of the force it's a strategic disaster and the accountability for that you know that the navy fires admirals when they collide ships are they going round and this may reach the secretary of defense level that is a disaster\nSort of like losing a major battle in the those are our greatest weapons along with the uh Ohio class nuclear submarines had you heard about this yet\n[noise] yes 'cause I saw an estimate that are obviously runs Italy and\n... dollars but you're\nThe way that you need is a fascinating way to look at it yes their planes you could fly them out of there\nAnd there are there the greatest player ever flown they are that the apex predator in the war and Seventeen them\nNot removed I I think that will be a secretary of defense accountability issue Scott\nYourself some started started but is there a from a base of aircraft like flipped on their backs they're using the air\nInside the whole of that and it's kind of it's kind of call\nA lot about is is interaction with you because I found in my interviews in the debates he's incredibly\nInteresting to listen to\nBecause he yeah he waged narrative and he ends up where he wants to go but you got to give them two to three minutes to get there\nYou are given safe because he will not only answer your question but also bringing up three more if you're a reporter to follow up with\nYou know he knows when he wants to tell you every reporter goes in there knowing that\nNot just with him but but any add the\nPolitician is going to take you where they want they he doesn't it is very different way which is you know they were driven our profession a little crazy but in all honesty I actually like per se actually like\nTo talk and if you've seen it in the fast you press conferences that he's held and he enjoyed it\nAnd and you know so he doesn't mind the top question\nWhat well that's it and it'll hurt if you listen closely he will also give you leads but but that would be unfortunate dynamic in the blue bobble newsrooms is if you don't interrupt them your seem to have been a roll over what in fact you're being a good reporter\nAnd so the Leslie stall I think she interrupted him fifty or sixty times and they use voice over as opposed to just raw footage it's so fundamentally erroneous approach the reporting\nWell your job as a reporter is not only to ask questions you find out whatever you know whatever it is you want to find out\nMore so in ... right I mean and you do that not just with politicians but you do that with people to people will tell you their story if you give them enough room to do that\nAnd and President Trump was very willing to uh to to tell his story in in our interview in a you know and I and I think that he is here that\nUh if you listen to the audio and if you you'll see that in the in the end the written I'm part of the of the interview he one of the things I thought was no sort of fascinating and this this is just a silly little nugget but it's important when during the interview he said you know veto\nThere's fourteen thousand people or is it ten ten thousand people outside\nAnd you know there there's a part of it like yeah yeah okay\nI but then after the interview we let the talk of her and I left that then you just a little bit early so that we could go file story there was no cell service inside we locked outside you know chatting and all of us that\nThere's a crowd of people yeah I'm not exaggerating Italy and ... and it's like what I told reporters\nBefore and they didn't listen to it sort of a combination of a tailgate party and you can eat buffet concerts there you're there [laughter] name\nScreen their front of it they're all happy there's\nThere's beach ball being bounced back and forth of get to sort of riding the crowd and this crowd but\nNot leaving it was happy and it was it was in its John itching\nThing to see because you can't say it\nBut you don't ever really have the ability to see it as a reporter because you're stuck inside I wondered why do\nPeople have got to go and listen to the audio of a Salinas Ito talking with Donald Trump it's an interesting different take Salinas he does our patriot mobile bundler wait do Selena followers on Twitter that Salinas Ito follow may to patriot mobile\nDot com forward slash you because I Am telling you right now ah my patriot mobile backup phone my second phone my journalist's phone is and I think everyone's gonna end up with two votes\nOr answer your second one should be patriot mobile and you can switch very easily them great plans have affordable androids and iPhones at four bucks a month while supplies last but mostly\nThey've got great great service coverage\nBut every time you pay your cell phone bill what's your move to a patriot mobile you're contributing to great conservative causes from the Heritage Foundation of the ... to a lot of pro life organization right now patriot mobile dot com forward slash you recall one eight hundred a patriot\nAh that is very unexpected and suggests a significant change in\nThe negotiations a hard Brexit looks increasingly likely to me I'm joined by Robert Costa\nHere's the host of Washington weaken review on Friday nights on PBS she is a Washington Post reporter uh park so often they probably got mine at MSNBC and a regular guest Robert good morning ah what do you make of the news from Britain I just announced that the magazine that are not Maggie Theresa May is coming to address the parliament\nAre striking news it just it another example of how this\nBalance threes and may has tried to strike a beam someone who can be both in the ... camp but also work with and then they go she ate or try to have some kind of agreement\nWith the Europeans just not working as an appetite against globalization and the ranks of the conservative party they want their their heart exit I mean the barrage\nWalk of the Tory party is really the heart and soul the Tory party and there's still a lot of anxious about Theresa May what she's trying to do and maybe salvage the relationship with Europe rather than moving away\nThe I Will watch that story very closely on to another story and I I think this has implications for last night's interview when the president brought up secretary of defense Mattis suggested maybe he's not long for the administration\nRobert I Am stunned there were Seventeen F twenty choose left behind and Kendall air force base their presumed damage at least and perhaps destroyed they can't get into the hangar that's eight percent of our strategic weapon or number one the greatest fighter ever made we only have two hundred of them or something like that I\nThere will be accountability here is this going to be the occasion for the secretary of defense and fall in the store and say a buck stops with me I run the department of defense those planes were my watch and Mr President here's my resignation\nSecretary Mattis has signaled to a lot of people inside of the Pentagon and the administration that he's probably going to eat the terms that this is someone who is on his way out though\nThis whole situation with the planes it could prompt\nOr but it always been really heading for the exit and the president kind of like a Democrat on him and it was\nRevealing it as a secretary of defense really worn out his welcome highly respected by the president and others the administration but not the one who's going\nTo hear Becker terrier the fence\nBut he's also a huge proponent of accountability and they they fired five senior admirals last year over collisions and grounding Z and I think this is a way for him to send a message about accountability now it's just a huge strategic blow to the United states that if that is the early reporting is correct [noise]\nLet me move to Maggie Haberman you and Maggie no the president about as well as anyone and she interviewed a bunch of rally a tenders a four story yesterday\nAbout why they loved Trump and then there are four things quote he wins regardless of how fungible the definition of winning maybe he takes the fight directly to Democrats unlike previous Republican presidential candidates who preferred comedy ever controversy\nHe does not bow the politically correct culture and he does not condescend to them and to quote it is that last thing Robert Koester that I think is so critical\nPeople really resent the blue bubbles of Manhattan and Washington Silicon Valley in Hollywood they really have gotten the sense in the first man flop the movie flopping confirms that send me a which do not know or care about them your comment\nI saw her white I mean\nI thought it was a really inspiring film or about the country and I thought the space program that was very accurate in about ... is the courage to go to space uh but I guess the there were different issues surrounding that film and\nThe American flag and different things that I Do it not being successful I at the box office\nAh but I think you're right Maggie ... story is strong and that it shows I was just on on the trail with the president last week I was on air force one in Erie, Pennsylvania\nAnd at the rally she's the crowds are still there and he is an
