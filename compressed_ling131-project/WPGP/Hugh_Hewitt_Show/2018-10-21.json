Obama\nSo back to the question why is there such preoccupation because one one is\nIf you have a moral sense and it's a very important thing for a lot of people think well of themselves and we we can feel good about ourselves we are bringing to the world's attention something terrible\nThat they're an ally of the United states is the second reason\nIs that he's not only an ally of the Saudi regime was not only valley of the United states is an ally of the most hated man in the world most hated man in the world for the left about Kim Jong un and it was about the Ayatollah Khamenei me\nA new is not a it is not Bashar al Assad's a it is Donald Trump is by far the most hated man in the world's media ... world's media run by the left and the left hates him more than any of them and if she has a friend the friend is hated\n\nThose are the two reasons so water we should posted do here is the question on the tape what are we supposed to do we can't deny him is because it's it would be a lawyer can tell lies kept an eye on what the Saudi regime that does it go up all the way to the crown prince we don't know\nBut that it was these are these are pretty well connected man apparently who\nAre engaged in this murder so what are we supposed to do cancel a hundred billion dollars whatever what is the ... that they ordered in in ... five hundred billion right\nThat's a lot of a that's a lot of jobs so you'll say well listen morale will be more important than jobs to which the answer is what is that yes it is yes morality\nIs more important than jobs however there are two big cavity up here one is jobs is a moral issue\nIt's about it it's not unrelated to morality whether or not we can ... a a naval tens of thousands of Americans to work\nBut if but murder is murder I I I fully agree I have a hierarchy of moral good and the hierarchy of Laurel bad that's a very big component of my moral thinking\nBut the a lot of save the Saudi regime or toppled because of sanctions by the United states first of all if they didn't have America to buy stuff from they would buy it elsewhere\nThey're not going to stop buying military equipment number two and most important if you really want to talk more real than the greatest moral good right now might be in the world the world scene might be opposing Iran\nIran is the most evil actor on earth\nThe north Korean regime is the most evil regime domestically\nThe Iranian regime is the most evil regime in terms of foreign evil evil outside of its borders it's it's great enemy is Saudi Arabia\nNow you'll say so we are supposed compromise our values because they're our ally and because the enemy of the enemy is my friend no you don't compromise your moral values you speak out\nYou condemn you try to make that ally ... more decent place but you don't abandon that ally because there are greater good the most obvious example being a man who didn't kill one dissident but about twenty five million\nGift that figure because it's not possible for the human mind to wrap itself around it and that is Joseph Stalin and we back Joseph Stalin knowing that he was slaughtering people in the millions because he was on our side against a greater enemy Adolf Hitler\nAnd that is the way the world works for people who are willing to look at the world the way it works not the way we imagine we allowed Jimmy Carter allowed the America under Jimmy Carter allowed the shah to step down in Iraq\nBecause of the various\nThings that he did that were bad like his show ... is the world a better place because the ayatollah regime\nTook over the answer is obvious one eighth pray you're Seventy Seventy six is the number I'm Dennis praying\nWith Dennis trigger show live from the relief factor pain free studio [noise]\nTroubled themselves and in\nThis case it Saudi Arabia and ironically it's happening with Saudi Arabia is becoming a morally\nBetter place that's the irony\nAll right\nFeinstein Feinstein wants to reopen Kavanaugh

delay I'm\nSo for her the issue is how do I win not waters right they will open hearings again on the Supreme Court justice I Want you to understand something about the Democratic party today because it's a left wing liberal party\nEvery institution it doesn't control it wishes to destroy you realize that\nIt doesn't control the electoral college it wishes to destroy\nIt does in wishes to and the electoral college\nIt doesn't control the Supreme Court for the first time in my lifetime and in the lifetime of any of these senators so it calls the court illegitimate that it's a regular phrase the the court has no longer Supreme Court is no longer seen as legitimate because it's not left\nIf it's not left it's not legitimate you understand\nIt's a force for chaos left isn't it is a false it just purely a tornado of destruction\nNow where was the article about how the Senate protects white voters against black voters and Hispanic voters did you see that it was the Washington Post I think what a bite of been the New York times\nThey hate the Senate because the Senate like the electoral college is state based not population based\nThis is the United states of America the states are to have their own worlds indeed genius I could cry about the genius of the founders of this country\nAnd their genius they wanted competing moral societies as it were cold states to see which one works they didn't they weren't so arrogant just to think they knew exactly what would\nWork really that's why we have ... states that's why we have a son [noise] so now everything they don't control is
