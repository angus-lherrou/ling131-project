I have a son and daughter hooked on both sides of this my son was falsely accused my daughter was right just like a thick down her ... her\nAssault or was arrested and my son was cleared so the whole women are automatically going to believe the achieved there as wrong because we have sons as well\nWhat did you get the ... what do you think about the president last night did he attack\nHe was right on he said everything that everybody in the general public is saying\nBut the media is not talking about because they don't and I understand that people don't want to be accused of being insensitive to the victims of assault I've represented a victim of assault so I Know I've got a complete defense I Know it I tried to get justice against the system I know what the me too movement is up against I just don't believe Dr ward a doctor for\nSharing your guest enough that she just enough and was just taken out that she can't be prosecuted\nHere there was not one non verifiable fact in her testimony I point out that so unusual when you can't find one non verifiable fact and I hope no Republican is being intimidated by threat them impeachment that simply will not fly and in San Diego and San Diego where do you think Dan\n[noise] well you know that for other reasons you mentioned a Ford is a woman who can only be character I take into account and comfortable that exception um she alternatively troll ...\nAnd then and it kept Trump practically have Pakistan town\nWhich is just another indication that hurt deliberate manipulation\n... given that you don't believe or what did you make of the president's comments last night was he a mocking her that's the word they're using Waze marking her\nUm as you say he was into marking her or say\nIt was the testimony that I'd prefer that that\nThat is not as much as that but I Am not sure that help I got out of it that way he he\nDecided to break the glass and it may not have been proven that would have been better had Mitch McConnell or someone else pointed out there was no fear of flying\nThe committee offered to come to her and she was not aware of that something about the lawyer or the boyfriends letter on polygraph set on not hearing about the sexual assault the second door investigation that Rachel Mitchell report someone else should have done it but he didn't see it getting done so he did it\nWell I got that and right guy doesn't call into question cannot fitness to be a judge it calls into question for it to be well put well put\nAgain Lindsey Graham on Fox News last night here at the political reality ... number Thirteen\nOr service intervening say they've got to look at it that was kind of have a town that colleagues uh this is the new normal guy have Saul who want to be a judge and listen to and and uh I wasn't going\nTo end on Saturday cut number Thirteen on Hannity\nWell the cabin I'll bump Israel that the the biggest change in the twenty eighth team mid term some\nPolitical observation in North Dakota sixty the twenty eighth he should be confirmed every race in these ... are red states held by Democrat there's been a surge by Republicans why or whether you're a top Republican libertarian vegetarian\nMcCain Republican Romney Republican Bush Republican you're mad as hell because we're all United that this is unfair what they're doing it this good decent man cannot than so the Republican year will be a Democrat and Republican you been able to do something my friends on the other side I could never do not this party\nListening this morning so pleased a welcome back from the United States Senate representing Iowa the great state of Iowa senator Joni Ernst hello senator urged\nOh good morning he'll how're you doing\nI'm great I I Want to give you a a GPS I'm where we are this morning so I I spent the first hour talking\nOnly two women first time caller I talked to Cathy in Scranton and in Dallas Sarah in Tampa and in Detroit was a teenage son Norma in Michigan Alexander in Newport Beach California a lame in Louisville\nJeannie in Oregon showing in Columbus and in San Diego offers same colors all of them what Kavanaugh's confirmed nine out of ten of them support what the president said last night one wish the hat and set it\nAnd they all don't believe Dr Ford's testimony though they are all very sympathetic and indeed one as a daughter who's ... survivor of sexual assault that's\nJust a slice of what I've been hearing what have you been hearing\nWell I Am hearing of course at an next or at a cause I get to the office a lot of them are are saying\nGet Kavanaugh and firearms and then there are others that um are you know adamantly oppose way the those folks on the TV all the time um but what I Do hear when I'm Out in Nevada and people just can't understand um why we haven't moved on with a getting him confirmed\nThey understand that he has the right credentials to sit on the nation's highest court and ... that that we should get this done found\nOut a ... I Do not believe the president was mocking the idea of someone being assaulted last night he was poking holes in testimony and I want to reveal a few things with you about the testimony [noise] first of all there was a story in Politico\nThat she had a fear of flying which is why that had to be the way she never actually said that herself but that was represented the committee she did say\nShe was not aware that the committee would come to her so that could be on her lawyers her former boyfriend has filed a letter saying she some earlier with polygraph they'd never discuss sexual assault\nThere they knew real clear investigations report that the second front door contractor evidence shows it was not about claustrophobia but at second entrance for an office\nThere wasn't a single verifiable assertion or testimony and not one that could be disproven either and then there's the Rachel Mitchell Report I simply do not believe that that testimony could knock Brett Kavanaugh of consideration\nNo I'd I don't believe so either and and Dr Ford I\nDo honestly believe that she has experienced trauma at some point so do I sure do I I I think most folks would agree with that however um even the witness says that she called forward actually uh can't corroborate or\nSimply tear down that that testimony that she gave about um some party that she had attended tell unfortunately um for for her I don't\nFind that can be a credible message again I Do want to reiterate that I Do think she experienced trauma that I don't know and it wasn't proven that it was judge Kavanaugh\nMeanwhile we have the secondary assault on judge Kavanaugh who I Do not know by the way he's ten years younger than I Am so we did not move in the same circles but he he strikes me as a very good and decent man and his two daughters caught me ten and a fourteen year old\nThey will be dealing with this for the rest of their life and that people have not stood up to a to underscore that\nTheir father is not a gang rape is but none of this has been proven that Sheldon Whitehouse his allegation was libel and slander ascend immediately reputed referred by the committee for prosecution are you and your colleagues doing enough to stand\nUp and and stand by judge cabin on your view\nWell I think we are standing up for judge Kavanaugh of course you won't hear any of those stories covered by mainstream media um fight we certainly respect him we respect his family they have been put through um the\nThe worst possible situation ever with their father being demeaned and end is credited and\nAnd that's very unfortunate and we have those discussions on why would anybody want to step up be nominated for such an important position why would anybody want to run for office if it's simply takes an accusation and unproven accusation which can put a family literally through how\nNot cheering Adler who would be the chairman of how judiciary if the Democrats take the house that's a very scary thought he said he is going to open impeachment hearings based upon the judges perjury nothing he said I'm I've been doing this for thirty five years remotely approaches\nPerjury as a lawyer and not that there's not a single on verifiable assertion that he made he\nDr arises drinking he did not denies drinking ... why would anyone take that seriously\nWell at just look around here it's all about obstruction at about resistance\nAnd as about what can we stop and put it in the president's way what can we put in Congress his way to stop them from doing a better job for the United states of America I mean look at our economy and how strong we are doing right now and and\nNow thanks to our counterparts across the aisle they have tried to slow us down stop at every opportunity whether it's getting rid of unnecessary regulation whether it is as stopping the tax cuts and JOBS Act what ever it\nIs they try and delight delay resist um and that's exactly what they're doing in the house\nIf they take the house we can expect that for the next two years\nNow I have been calling this frequently on line the new McCarthyism because McCarthyism as the taking of a very serious charge that's been proven in other contexts in that case originally treasonous conduct against the Rosenberg perjury by his and the signing it to the Hollywood screenwriters that's McCarthyism\nThis McCarthyism is taking people like ... Harvey Weinstein and Bill Cosby and they're horrible crimes in attributing them\nTo a Brett Kavanaugh and I think people need to stand up and say this is hysterical and it's deeply unfair senator\nAnd as it is absolutely unfair and it is absolutely ridiculous if you look around the Senate you can point fingers here too and members that have added admittedly I'm had bad behavior and they're in their past which\nProbably surpasses any accusation that has been\nLeveled against Brett Kavanaugh so I think people should tread very lightly on the things that they are throwing at this respectable man and his family\nThey don't want it to come around five fold against them in the future so\nUm we just need to do a better job here in the United states at teaching our children what is appropriate behavior what is not appropriate behavior and then of course I'm\nJust doing better as society but for other members to kind of laugh about what they did in their college days and then I point the finger at Brett Kavanaugh on say you are not qualified to serve on our nation's highest court because you drank beer and high school or college you know shame on you\nThey had better start thinking twice about what they're doing\nYou know a Jeff Flake cry of campaign within four and I believe to be a fair and decent man he actually\nHad good faith and the Democrats who's been proven wrong of course they did not use this to wait for the FBI report they immediately moved the goalposts have you got any sense when the FBI is going to finish and therefore a motion for cloture filed do you have a timetable\nI Do think that we will say that this week I think the FBI as probably winding down as as we are speaking out with their witnesses and I know that our leader is very intent on getting this uh voted on this week\nSo as soon as we can receive the report I Do think it is important to a\nReview the information and the report for the supplemental investigation um we need to know that for our constituents just be able to verify you know everything is okay if everything does check out and then we move forward and and have the same wrapped up but I Would anticipate um as the leader has said that he wants to see it down\nThis way have you heard any ... I've heard that possibly the FBI report will be done today in culture filed tonight have you heard that\nUh I have heard some semblance of that\nBut um again I I Would hesitate to say that on on a national program I just think that uh we have to make sure that we are going through the report that we have had time to absorb it and make sure that we're able to push back to our our constituents that everything has got to go and then we move forward do\nYou expect at this point at this point obviously with a report to review that you will be voting for judge cabinet\nI well I'm I'm less there as something that surfaces and they are and the investigative report that you know the supplemental report that would corroborate Dr forwards testimony unless that happens I plan to support judge Kavanaugh\nAnd last thing I Want to play pea Lindsey Graham on on a Sean Hannity last by cutting number Fifteen what about these red state Democrats I think they're toast over all of ... do you agree with that senator I let him to go ahead\nI Do I absolutely agree with an underground then and a lens they has been a hero through this process he clearly phase what is going on he has been able to demonstrate that and and clear concise and language for\nEvery one which we all appreciate I but I Do believe that those are Democrats that are in red states that are up this year they are going to have a very very difficult time if they did not support judge Kavanaugh you know if\nAnd they're also they're also Joni Ernst\nJust said last houses senators glass houses about your college drinking

the most classic team in all of a sport that was at the game great when go pack go we are headed towards the Superbowl\nSo your judgment is that those are good uniforms to wear\nYeah absolutely that bad I just I ride even from everything I've ever known about the case of\nMarines I just I mean you've just come from the marine corps approach the static alright\nJudge let's talk about judge Kavanaugh I spent the first hour I talked to ten women ball all first time caller and I've gone through their name for Joni Ernst and people heard them nine of them are believed the president did the right thing last like ten of them believe judge Kavanaugh should be confirmed what are you hearing in your district\nYou know I was at a a couple of parade this weekend and then just running around or the ... meeting with a bunch of people so that they can but I certainly had a lot of people both men\nAnd women come up to me saying they were just very disgusted with the way the political circus played out in the Senate and I do think it's transparent that there are many at Iraq that who are just trying to delay this past election and would like nothing more than ... delayed seeping bill\nAnd tell her half the Democratic when the president gained twenty twenty and I think even if you're right in the middle right let's figure it out of committed part of that one way or the other I think there is a general that that OK elections have consequences edited and the president right in the authority to nominate\nSomeone a and that judge Kavanaugh none of the allegations against him and they cooperated in any way I just would draw people's attention\nTo the non page memo that the outside prosecutor Rachel Mitchell\nSent to the Senate on Sunday and while your average person I think not read that and I am or even your average politician right rarely read more than one page um\nI Do think it expresses what I've found to be the comic that an attack at my district as quick and which is to say we have enormous fifth to see the doctor for it but\nNone of the accusations she has made so far has had any iota of cooperation and that has to do to stand right we can't have a standard where you can make any accusation without any cooperation and that that I have to destroy so my wife is another reason and no capable people will want to serve in public office going forward\nI also point out and and Joni Ernst confirmed all this uh there are enormous gaps in holes in her testimony the fear of flying story did not pan out not aware that the committee would come to her that would be on her lawyers her ex boyfriend is now sworn under oath that she's familiar with polygraph there's a second new story\nOn the second door having nothing to do with ... there wasn't a single verifiable
