I think in the ... ... if I'm not mistaken in civil suits the preponderance of evidence standard that's different from beyond reasonable doubt just for ... but it doesn't even meet the preponderance\nOf evidence that Republicans seem to show absolutely fairness in the accuser and giving difference in the wavering members in his own caucus delayed the confirmation one vote one week and the FBI made additional in where he's\nAt midway guys with the second ranking Republican in the United States Senate and also a member of the Judiciary Committee John Cornyn also formerly a Texas Supreme Court justice [noise]\nNow if in fact we get word that the FBI is done and that shouldn't all center as well have they report it's okay to file the notion of cloture because that's just thirty hours of debate people will have plenty of time to read the report\nThat's right down to the Senate rules are there will be at least a an intervening day or the other words you filed today tomorrow intervening day and then the vote cloture vote wouldn't be until the following day so there'll be plenty of time for senators to read the FBI's a supplemental background investigation\nSenator I represented the victim of the sexual assault on a major college campus I catch a more because of confidentiality I'm very sympathetic to victims because the institutions in America have not yet adopted to deal with these but that they're changing nevertheless I'm a lawyer like you and I know one\nThe fear of flying narrative that was given to the committee that simply wasn't true it wasn't given by her I was getting by the lawyers her ex boyfriend has filed an affidavit saying she is familiar with polygraphs inconsistent with their testimony testimony and this is a lawyer deal\nDid not contain a single verifiable assertion nor one that could be disproven that very rare and then we have the Rachel Mitchell Report are there are problems whether testimony\nWell there are some awesome well Rachel Mitchell uh\nWas retained by the committee to question Dr Ford um\nAnd I thought that are very professional job but I thought she got the basic facts out demonstrated that there are gaps I understand the victims of of trauma can have some memory lapses and it's hard to reconstruct things after thirty five years but\nI just don't think and I think the American people don't believe that uncorroborated allegations should be enough to condemn or a nominee\nSo let's go to the last issue which is Jerry ... Adler the incoming chairman of the house Judiciary Committee if the Democrats take the house\nSays he was holding each month proceedings I say bring those on because they will be laughing stocks about Seventy rule I just got into it she said Brett Kavanaugh why I said he absolutely did not lie about drinking he did not lie about devil's triangle people who say that don't understand what perjury is are lying is your assessment a senator\nWell I think it's this has gotten a a ridiculous and I'm sure we're talking about in prison as high school yearbook whether he threw ice on somebody at some point in the past um I think they've been unsuccessful in attacking the judges credibility\nAnd feel like a now they're often this wild goose chase and uh the goalposts has five friend the majority leader who likes to say uh after continued to move a but it's time to vote\nHere's what Lindsey Graham said on Fox News last night cutting number Fifteen what about these red state Democrats\nAll of them all up\nAll of them politically in any and I didn't know the only thing that are open seemingly they even have access to say that\nNo Senator Cornyn Joni Ernst agreed with that do you agree with that\nI I agree uh because I think I'm In these red states that President Trump carried a I think the uh I think the judicial I mean I'm Sorry I just I think the Senate candidates incumbents running or looking at their own polls in our polls are confirming what are the ones you just said\nAs the national Republican Senatorial Committee come back and confirmed that to you\nOr we talked Cory Gardner who's the chairman this year as a as bad as basically confirmed\nThat you know I think something very big is going on and I've been doing this show since two thousand I've been doing radio since Nineteen Ninety nothing compares to the visceral rejection of the McCarthyism directed\nBrett Kavanaugh nothing and I think it's because of his kids why because they are being so badly injured and I'm just thinking twenty thirty forty years from now people will throw this at them and judge Kavanaugh knows that and that's why he's angry what do you think Senator Cornyn\nI don't blame him for being angry and this uh this ridiculous allegation that the judge will somehow be a partisan or hug not display the appropriate temperament on the bench this man has been slandered he's been accused of multiple crimes\nAnd he felt it was important to defend his good name and I I thought I thought he handled it appropriately\nUh there were a couple of times where I think well one time in particular where he asked judge or sugar corporate shark question he came back and apologize for that and I think that was the right thing to do\nBut he shouldn't be expected just to take a business slander these allegations of\nCriminal conduct and are ruining his reputation and good name and damaging as family anybody in that position who feels like they had been falsely accused I think would be angry and uh be justified in showing some of that anger\nThat last question senator I I Know that some people might be a ... some good faith because of the FBI report not to vote for\nJudge cabin I I think it will be a huge mistake unless they're direct corroborating evidence but I also believe the Republican dozens of boredom his or her career done as a Republican I've never seen the bass Vince

all across the country they would bring your Bible to school day here's my sailed a colleague Joe Walsh Jim valium focus on the family\nEducate in late ... what is bring you in the school that\nWe started this five years ago we had eight thousand children the first year participate last year we had five hundred and fifty two thousand wow\nChildren participated elementary school junior high high school even college kids both from public schools as well as Christian schools but it's just to set aside a day to kind of flex your religious liberty allow a little bit and there is this is totally constitutional\nJust simply bring your Bible to school and read it and nobody can take it away that's\nOne of the great things about living in America but oftentimes a school administrator or a teacher will come up and say hey you can't do that it's illegal right have a one sheet from alliance defending freedom you have\nA people can print that at the website they give it to the teacher and I go oh okay it looks like it's\nA way to go ahead and that's typically how that goes on in your face thing these now\nUh are usually pulling together a little table talk Bible study at lunch at school they're reading the book at John or something it's yeah self directed yeah so they do whatever they want to do but at the website bring your Bible dot org we have\nIdeas for youth pastors and test of teachers and parents on what to do\nGym if we've got families or even young people listening to us right now and they they're thinking this is a cool idea I mean how will they know if anybody else's bringing a Bible to school and and what they might be able to do\nThe power of just the freedom way out the shaming just say yeah I'm a Christian I'm bringing my Bible to school to be able to share with my friends during free time lunchtime\nA this is what I can do is a Christian in this country and here's the thing showed that always was frustrating for the those who might have posed this you know they talk about not shaming and the importance of no bowling and yet when children do this we'll get the reports of teachers and others who are really shaming the kids yeah kids we have\nMany reports were teachers or grabbing the Bible's putting them in their debt\nAnd telling the students they can't bring the school that sounds like the Soviet everybody and so for these kids to be able to ... religious liberty muscle in the United states it's completely constitutional\nSo we're going to talk about having all of your eggs in one basket so getting in to talk with your financial advisor getting over that ... that\nAnd then speaking with your advisor about diversifying your your assets not having all your eggs in one basket\nSo bad how is having all your eggs in one basket as you say a risk and how will diversification how well having all your eggs in one basket\nLeaves you extremely vulnerable so if it's all in the market you're very vulnerable to market swings if it's all in cash account\nYou're very vulnerable to things like inflation so to somebody that lives long life like my grandparents your lifestyle goes down and down and down over the years so we want to talk about your savings becoming diversify to supplement your existing retirement income sources like Social Security\nTo Social Security maybe your spouse has Social Security and if you're one of the really lucky ones you have a pension\nYour savings your retirement nest egg can give you income to supplement that because there is no retirement without income so I was talking with John and Betty in my office this week and we talked about having their money in three world\nWere first world is an emergency fund we're going to talk about that later on the show having money aside so that if you have something unexpected happened that you can cover it with your savings and the second bucket it's having an income bucket while you might ask what is it that bucket\nYou might have interest producing savings like CDs or bonds or annuities annuities are great asset to put inside that income bucket\nAnd you know people here that word and they think you know oh my gosh I've heard bad things about annuities and I have to\nKeep in mind there's about a thousand annuities out there and we're networks financial advisors only use about five of them so if you're going to use in a new any for income we got to make sure that you get the right one\nAnd then there's the gross bucket of John and they were able to tolerate a little bit of risk but not a lot so they said yeah that if we have our income covered we can tolerate a little bit of up and down in the market\nDo you have those three worlds covers the income world the banking world and the growth world that's on Wall street if you don't think your assets are properly diversified and you don't know how you're going to be able to cover the income that you need in retirement\nGive us a call right now we are alive and will pick up the phone number is eight hundred seven to five to nine eight eight come right into the office and speak directly with me in a confidential environment or you can sign up for one of our dinner seminars or workshops\nEither way the numbers the same here it is right at that it's eight hundred Seventy five to nine eight eight\nWe are so glad you're spending some time with us here on the show this is a net worth financial hour Meghan most ... alongside bath Andrews that number again to reach out to bat you can send a visit with her at one of her office locations eight hundred Seventy five\nTo nine eight eight or go on line she has a great website at bath Andrews dot in oh now that's how this diversification combat inflation inflation is pretty low these days still right yeah even\nWith really low inflation it creeps up on you so if we think about it inflation doubles the amount of money that we need to spend about every eight teen years\nSo if you're on fixed income like a pension or you're on Social Security and your Social Security goes up but not enough to keep pace with general inflation and especially inflation in the healthcare industry that means more and more money has to come out of your savings every year\nNow inflation does seem really low but if you compare it to say the dividends rate on the S. and P. five hundred\nThat dividend rate is the only one point Seventy eight percent as of march two thousand Eighteen so if you're only getting less than two percent and did it and you need to dip into your principal to be able to take out enough to live\nBut that you do want to have them next correct\nYes so back to market swings eggs in one basket so if your portfolio is a hundred percent stocks whenever the market goes down you have less money to spend to think about two thousand and eight\nIf you had a million dollars in two thousand and eight and then you came back and looked at your financial statements six months later\nIf your money was all in the stock market all in the S. and P. five hundred now your million dollars only worth five hundred thousand\nThat might not have been a big deal when you were working and saving as much money into your retirement savings as possible but\nIf you're drawing money out now all of a sudden you have half as much to draw from that's a big deal so we need to have diversification we need to have all the parts of your portfolio that don't move in the same direction\nAnd we will have an overall mix that you are comfortable with the amount of up and down that's the ... the amount that you could possibly lose\nSo we want to know that you have the right assets to generate income and we got to figure out how much income you need so that we can understand the long term benefits of diversify your overall investment mix\nThat that asset allocation does need some attention from time to time on my right\nOh yeah absolutely you got to check in and rebalance at least once a year or when you experience a major life of that so that your portfolio is still doing what you want to do\nSo talking with John and Betty and they said they're retiring this year and they said well we don't want to work until Seventy to get the maximum Social Security and I said that's OK\nYou're sixty three right now that seven years of planning that we have to do to get you from when you're done working too when you draw your Social Security so every year we're getting together and we're looking at how the changes in the tax laws are going to affect them during that period of time\nAnd guess what John and they don't have to take a distribution from their retirement accounts at that age\nBut for a tax planning purposes it might make sense so every year we are getting together and were determining where that income rate should be to we can get the most effective tax planning for then don't forget\nThe Social Security laws have changed a few times over the years we need to make sure we get back together and go over the laws and make sure that their plan is still current with the way that the Social Security laws are and the tax laws are\nNow that he has a lot of money in some stocks about over a hundred thousand dollars that are not inside of her IRA and she's been very hesitant to cash any of those ... even though they're too aggressive for her but now that she and John are retired and they're not taking Social Security or require distributions yet\nShe's gonna cash some of those stocks and pay the capital gains at the lower rate a that's a win for both of them\nIf you have at least two hundred thousand dollars to invest and you want to get that level of diversification if you want to get year by year tax plan\nCalled me at eight hundred Seventy five to nine eight eight we used the net worth

formed Bush dark with a comfortable feeling\nPretty soon you build trust that so important do you have\nA relationship with your financial advisor don't recommend having a first date with family members that were the bars on your first day you'll share some coffee in conversation and they're all they want to learn about you and your family and they want you to get to know them a lot of advisors are home to priest in your money\nAnd the team is worth about ... or more interested in building trust but that takes time so we called them today covering seven to five twenty nine and set

I'm a member of the visor Motor Company [noise]\nHave you with us for the networks financial hour Meghan back here with the Andrews founder and president of network advisors her phone number eight hundred Seventy\nFive to nine eight eight again that's eight hundred seven to five twenty nine eighty eight our show today is all about the five major risks to your retirement that I Wonder how you determine exactly how much you should save for retirement\nOh boy that's a great question because there really is no one magic number it's not like you know the commercial where the guys walking around carrying the big number with him you got to figure that out just like there's no one shot\nThat makes everything go away it protects you against everything that can happen in retirement so the magic thing is to get a plan get the networks retirement GPS it tells you very clearly just like your GPS\nDoes where you're at right now and it tells you step by step what you need to do to get to retirement\nAnd through retirement without running out of money that's the number one thing that people are worried about so when you talk about taking money out of your savings there is a drawl percentage that you can take so if you're thinking about spending say five thousand dollars a month\nAnd your pension covers two thousand to that in your Social Security covers another two thousand dollars of that you need to draw it a thousand dollars a month well let's get together and figure out if your savings can withstand that one thousand dollars a month\nThat is terrific advice because if I Can't I Would imagine you are in trouble so back to a lot of people I'm guessing a withdrawal right between three and five percent that could actually seem pretty low right\nYeah and I get that because you look at the stock market returns and they might be seven percent or eleven percent but the problem with that is it's not sustainable it's not even Steven every year so the prudent man's rule was\nFour percent and so the believe me a lot of economists I've worked on this guy that did the sharks in my office Roger if it's in Bloomberg all these that all this statistical analysis they looked at a withdrawal rate\nIn the portfolio over all the different time frames that have existed in mark history and what they found is that a four percent withdrawal rate they called death the prudent man's rule\nIs you about a Seventy percent chance of not out living your money [laughter] you know having the Seventy oh saying I don't like those odd to\nMe and another advisor in my office are getting on a plane to go to a conference this week and if that pilot says to us we have a Seventy percent chance of landing safely [laughter] we're not getting on that plane good point so here we are talking about all the money\nThat you have saved for your retirement you spent all of your working years thirty thirty five forty years saving and working really really hard and that money now has to carry you through the rest of your retirement years\nIf you have a Seventy percent chance of that being successful are you going to get on that bandwagon I don't know\nSo here's the thing recently so within the last seven years interest\nRates have been very low and David in rates have been very low and difficult to sustain because companies don't want to make that commitment that they're going to pay out a ... year after year after year and sometimes they don't have to they can cut their dividends so because of lower interest rates and lower ...\nNow the prudent withdraw percentage is three percent\nReally so if you have a million dollars saved up half on on your thirty thousand dollars a year that's not that much\nTo guess what threw careful planning we can increase the amount that you can draw out of your retirement savings it's all about a probability so we'll show you the probability that she won't run out of money using the networks retirement GPS\nAnd a lot of times that probabilities zero or thirty percent not good but through some careful planning and some diversification we can increase your probability of never depleting your assets all the way up to Ninety percent Ninety two percent Ninety five percent\nWe can increase the shot that you have that you're not going to outlive your savings that is what the networks retirement GPS is all about\nSo the new rule is three percent withdrawal the old rule was four percent withdrawal through careful planning a lotta times we can get you a five or six percent withdrawal rate\nSo that's the difference between taking out thirty thousand dollars a year from your million in savings to taking out fifty thousand a year or sixty thousand a year\nThat's a huge difference in the lifestyle that you can have and you can take it out with the confidence that no matter what happens in the market the economy or the world that you can have that paycheck that direct deposit into your account\nEvery single year every single decade for the rest of your retirement years\nIf you want to get that security of a paycheck of a direct deposit that you will never outlive make sure you call and set an appointment to talk with me\nWe'll get together in my office in her own lacks confidential atmosphere or if you want to meet me through a seminar or a workshop\nIf you have at least two hundred thousand dollars to invest call me gift that security my number's eight hundred Seventy five to nine eight eight don't make mistakes second bankrupt your entire retirement again my number is eight hundred Seventy five to nine

N. F. O. now that's having a budget that seems incredibly important right especially if you're on limited income as in retirement so how do you defend yourself against oh emergencies that could come your way yeah that is\nReally a good point it's funny how many people head into retirement\nAnd forget that emergencies will still happen they're still going to need to buy a car every so often they're still going to have around here flooding [laughter] and maybe some snow or ice damage maybe you're going to have a health issue or a broken angle", "show_name": "Hugh Hewitt Show", "year": "2018", "city": "Pittsburgh", "day": "06"}
