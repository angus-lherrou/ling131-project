hard to repair\nWhat's your assessment at why by the way do we keep us twenty twos at our hurricane area\nSo as best I can tell from trying to read through this and I'm looking forward to being back

hangar but no hangar is built to withstand a hundred and fifty plus miles per hour winds and seven of the seven of the Seventeen when Lester rated hangers\nI think it's important to note that no one

the problem here is the skin on the plane\nThere's a lot of radar absorbent material ram involved and the repairing and replacing could be very expensive and my understanding of the initial site survey suggests that the air frames\nAppear to be okay so we believe we can get most of them back on track to repairing the skins\nUm will be a very expensive proposition finally I just stay\nOut of your question you know why we're so many their ground\nThis goes back really to the Obama administration decision to halt the program a two thousand nine Secretary Gates was the ultimate decided that decision and the decision to cut back on air force personnel and train maintain ers and funds for reading it so we had to answer the reason that the question that so many were on the ground and the

G. H. dot com busy um twelve fifty to answer\n\nWelcome back to the law review on who you're talking to him the city of Atlanta fired fire chief Calvin Cochran for authoring a book about his Christian beliefs on his own\nThe alliance of bending freedom came to Cochran side after they become clear but his First Amendment rights had been violated [noise] here's my colleague Michael ... bed with the tree and ATF senior counsel David Corcoran tell us\nWhat's happening with this law case that you've taken up on behalf of cheap\nSo the the city argued they were trying to be inclusive believe it or not by firing the chief because they didn't agree with that too so I didn't I didn't quite understand that but we filed a lawsuit on behalf of the chief the good news is is that we argue that the policy they actually required\nPrior permission so they told the cheap afterward that oh no you can't write a book on your own time for a Bible study unless you get prior permission from the food and the allows you to do so we challenge that as being unconstitutional is only probably permission needed is the first amendment and the judge ruled with us [noise]\nUm so that the judge ruled in favor of the cheap and now we're going to trial to figure out where the case goes through there and and how much damage as for the chief\nAnd that's a terrific so this is all still pending but again I just want to remind people that right now for the rest of this week um if you give a hundred dollars to alliance defending freedom to help fight for chief Cochran in for clients just like him\nWho are defending their own religious liberty and defending your religious liberty if you were a hundred dollars is going to be doubled\nBecause there's a matching fund going on right now\nPlease give what you can five hundred dollars would be great and that's a terrific goal because that provides a thousand dollars to this vital cause I'll go to the Michael midday dot com click on the banner for

four\nThree three eight eight a chief Cochran if if you win this case with God's help\n'em you hope to go back to work um in public service\nUh yes uh I'm actually speaking to be restored everything that I was taken away from me including being restored to the office of our chief of the city [noise]\nDo give you an example if you were to get a benefit of a thousand dollars a month at age sixty two\nAnd instead of taking ... sixty two you waited until your full retirement age so for most baby boomers that sixty six might be sixty six and a few months that thousand dollars a month goes up to Thirteen thirty three a month\nAnd if you wait until Seventy that thousand dollars a month goes up to Seventeen sixteen man that's seven hundred and sixty dollars every single month every single year and every single decade for the rest of your life\nNow a lot of people have talked to me about well yeah but by the time I break even I'm going to be eighty two years old that's exactly right and so if I run a financial plan in the networks\nRetirement GPS side by side with somebody that takes her Social Security at sixty two compared to somebody that takes or Social Security at aged Seventy\nGuess what those plans both run out of money at the same time because it's such a long break even hears what's different and I was all you women out there to be listening to this and also all of you husband's out there who really really care about your wives\nOne one spouse dies when there's two people in a household and one spouse passes away the higher of the two benefits remains and the lower of the two benefits goes away\nSo yeah you can draw your Social Security is sixty to break even at eighty two which one of us is more likely to live past age ... eighty two we women now that's not always the case you know I've seen plenty of men who have had their their wife passed away but\nThe point is that the surviving spouse gets to keep the bigger of the two benefits and if that benefit is seven hundred and sixty dollars a month bigger that is a huge difference when the other Social Security has gone away\nIf you would like to learn how to optimize your Social Security benefit\nThat would be an important decision that you should talk with your financial advisor about there's also some important tax ramifications regarding Social Security which is less heavily taxed than distributions from your pension or your IRA\nGive us a call our number is eight hundred Seventy five to nine eight eight if you have at least two hundred thousand dollars to invest in you would like to receive a Social Security optimization by the leading Social Security expert\nHis name is Dr Lawrence Cutler cough make sure you give me a call and we'll use this as part of your overall retirement GPS here's the number again if you have at least two hundred thousand dollars to invest call me at eight hundred Seventy five to nine eight eight\nYou can also check out back on line she has a great website\nFor you just to go to Beth Andrews dot info that's bad Andrew dot\nI. N. F. O. a bath pensions at least in the traditional sense I Know those are a lot less common these days and there is this worry out there that lingers amongst a lot of us that Social Security not that strong and my dry up\nDoes anything on your list here any of your assets that you brought to us today do any of those things that count for shortfalls that we might experiences were trying to find our retirement yeah\nActually I'm really glad you brought this up because this is a really big one sources that provide guaranteed income streams during retirement so we've talked about pensions and Social Security so fewer and fewer pensions out\nThere and we also talked about the fact that Social Security is not designed to cover all of your retirement living expenses so people really need an additional guaranteed source of retirement income\nSo I was actually working with Brady in hand uh recently and they were sixty two years old and they needed two thousand dollars every single month to supplement their Social Security and so we needed to come up with a mechanism to cover that on a guaranteed basis and so one of their options\nGoes to use bonds bonds are not very very uh conducive for income right now and another on other options were to use it a new\nContract and Britain you looked at me and he said oh man I've heard some bad things about annuities and I said yeah Brady I have to here's the interesting thing I agree with all that bad press that's out there about annuity contracts\nThere's about a thousand of them in Pennsylvania and I only use about three to five of 'em because there's so many bad features out there so few are interested in making sure that you can supplement your Social Security with additional manmade pension or self made pension\nMake sure you give me a call an annuity can be a good way to convert lump sum that you've been building up inside a retirement account into a guaranteed income stream\nHow readily available bats are these in plan a newly mechanisms\nWell not nearly as available if people would like the investment options with ... and other retirement savings through your employer man they're very limited\nThere's only very few of them that will allow you to convert that lump sum into a stream of income so I'll give you one example if you happen to have TI a craft\nThrough a college or university they will let you do that but that's one of the very few examples\nAnd so if you have a four O. one K. which you can do is you can roll it over and then you can invest however you want so that you're going from very limited investment options into the whole world of investment options\nAnd annuities might be suitable for part of that money I wouldn't say put all of your money into their\nSo here's another thing that's really important now what I was talking with gradient Hannah Brady is an engineer and he's working for a pretty big engineering company and at the age of sixty two without being retired he said well I won't be able to do that for another five or six years until I retire\nAnd said well Brady what if the market tanks between now and then we just recently seen a big example of that he said yeah I've been very worried about my four oh one K. and I said Brady overall are you at a game and he said yes even though he's given a little bit of that back in the last couple of weeks\nAnd I said do you want to lock that Cain in ... he said yes\nAnd I said here's the deal Brady you are over the age of fifty nine and a half and you're still working but you can still roll out the bulk of that for all and K into your own IRA mhm British says no kidding\nAnd so we ended up rolling out the bulk of the money out of Brady for all and K while he was still working now almost all plans allow this not all of them so ask me if you don't know if your plans allows allows that\nAnd we also left Brady plant open so that he could continue making tax deductible contributions and getting matching contributions Brady said wow I thought it was captive in this ... all these years\nIf you have a four O. one K. or a four oh three B or another work related retirement plan almost all of those plans allow that if you don't know if your plan does asked me if you would like to look at finding a way to supplement your Social Security with income that you can't outlive\nAnd making that work in conjunction with their Social Security strategy that you and your spouse can't outlive it protects your spouse\nCalled me right now we're alive and we will answer the phone number is eight hundred seven to five to

this is the largest drop we've seen on Wall street since February why does it mean for you as you get closer to retirement Muslims in in in here from David\nOctober ... the worst day for the down since February a big drop in popular tax stock splitting impact will sell off in motion so what does this mean for you and your finances and most importantly your retirement\nDavid by a well known

more than two decades he's nine time New York times best selling author\nOf books including smart couples finish rich and smart women finished rich and today he's co founder of ag wealth management one of America's fastest growing our eye gaze David wealth and we are thrilled to have you with us today\nWill Megan it's great to be with you even though the you know it's a little ugly in the markets still great to be with you so thanks for having me on the show\nLet's not about that and eight hundred plus point drop the Dow Jones we know that rarely happens due to just\nOne event so set the stage for a year what smart then sell off\n... well it's a handful of things first of all and it's it's really taken place over three or four days so we were over a thousand pointed down on the Dow\nIn a handful days here and this is scaring people and and so the question becomes all is there anything specific that's going on and I'll give you a handful of\nThe first thing is that rates are going and you even heard the president talked about this well let's break it down what does that mean when you hear rates are going up and that is raising rates\nThe fed the actually been raising rates really since two thousand but most recently the fed raises rates on the money that things can land they call it the Federal Reserve fund rate ... record happened in September and\nWhen those rates went up a couple of things happened first of all the costs to borrow money goes right so you're going to borrow money for a home if you're going to refinance your home if you're going to buy a car and you're going to finance that car or you're going to use credit cards for that matter any\nWhere where you're borrowing money the cost to borrow that money is now going up and that's books\nAll smokes the market right because if you're home maybe people will buy the buy less home they'll refinance or home last so they'll buy less cars or they'll shop less would have cost more to borrow money the markets can spoof that consumers will slow down on their spending and so that's the first thing it's really been a story about\nThe bad and rates going up now we have to put down a little bit in the context because\nLet's be honest rates have been really really really really low like you know we've had historically low rates for well over ten years and those historical rates which the fed put in place after our great recession\nWe're successful that's what got the economy going again and that's why we are right now enjoying what is the longest bull marketing history so\nYou have to put that in perspective um and there are also some other things are happening that are influencing the stock market which is as rates have gone up\nThe ten year treasury the rates have gone up on that right now so right now the three or the ten year treasuries over three point one five to as I speak that means if you go and buy a ten year treasury are going to get a rate of\nThree point one five to ... percent and that's the highest rates we've seen on tenure treasuries and like seven years so that's also a very interesting thing that's happened and then there's the fact that the tech market hasn't weighed like this right let me see if\nWe sell often tech stocks particularly\nTech stocks though\nI'm like Amazon and Facebook and that's not all related interest rates there's been some data breaches with companies involved like Amazon a potentially data breach and Facebook had a recent data breach so there's been so often these tech stocks but again\nMaking putting that in perspective it's been the tech stocks have been driving the market hire companies you know we call them fang companies like Facebook\nAmazon and Netflix and Google use ... tech companies\nHave been absolutely on fire in terms of growing and they've been the stocks been driving the market hires the fact they pulled down a little bit um it's not that surprising and it was probably about time for us to see tech stocks pull back\nAnd I think the third thing that we know is affecting the market is actually the global markets that trade wars um all this talk of trade war with China\nIs having an impact and it's been really having an impact globally the global markets have been really down compared to our market like the U.S economy has just been on fire we have been\nAbsolutely crushing it we've had the best stock market in the world um and so we you know us pulling back a little bit compared to what's happening abroad um it's really been a lot less like abroad the global markets but down emerging marked down\nAnd we've just been doing great so I think it was sort of time for the U.S markets maybe take a little bit of a breather to an almost a recognized that things are slowing down globally partially because of the fear of these trade wars with China\nTo several components leading to this precipitous drop on Wall street David I Want to go back to those rising rate I Know that they can sell trouble for the overall economy but aren't higher interest rates are really good for retirees\nWill you know you're exactly right they are good for retirees especially retirees by the way we'll pay down their debt right which is something I've talked about for Twenty years the fastest way to\nTo reach retirement early is to pay your debt off so if you reached retirement and you and you don't have a mortgage payment you don't have a car loan\nAnd you're probably not using credit cards to borrow money if if you're doing one retirement than the good news about race going higher\nIs that the rates on your money market and your checking account and CDs and again treasuries are going higher and if you're most retirees live off of the income that their retirement money produces", "year": "2018",
