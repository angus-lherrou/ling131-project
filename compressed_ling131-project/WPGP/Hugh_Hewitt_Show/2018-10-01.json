of me by by not speaking up for judge Kavanaugh against\nThe the malignant charges\nI don't expect Chris Coons and Angus King or good men to stand and vote for judge Kavanaugh they would prefer a liberal to be there that's what their party believes that's what they're states believe I actually don't think Maine believes that they may wants cabinet confirmed but Angus King can do what he was but I expect them to stand up and say this is disgusting\nWhat has happened to this good man and I don't expect ... cutting about how angry he is because he has a ten year old and a fourteen year old

Cotton went up the rangers lead the way as a slogan and eat eat demonstrated how you do this cut number twenty seven\nIf it turns out that he was not truthful about something that has nothing to do with what allegedly happened thirty six years ago truthfulness it's still something you want and the Supreme Court nominee that was relevant\n... what are you talking about trying it turns out in the course of the FBI investigator and it is if you want to have an open ended fishing expedition I think that's not fair senator what are you talking about I'm asking\nYou if in the investigation and turns out that something outside of that is if his testimony turns out to ... and John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham said if there is some shocking new bit of a not an accusation but evidence\nAnd proof then of course I'm open to value wedding that evidence but I said I strongly suspect that every statement that was made that the Judiciary Committee under penalty of perjury is the exact same statements can be made to the FBI and I don't know what I'm doing and I I just\nThink it's right to push back what are you talking about are you in favor of an open ended ... and John Dickerson said that's not fair I Wish the only\nMy only criticism of Tom Cotton because it is absolutely fair to call what is going on McCarthyism it is absolutely fair John to point out that your show is in the

there is legitimate reasons to believe that Christine Ford it's long and that alone shit sculpting\nSincerely wrong sincerely ... I mean she keeps her compelling but sincerely wrong about a false memory that's exactly one of the possibilities out there but in the meantime the lack of corroborating evidence means that this morphed into McCarthyism\nBecause it wasn't just it just Dr forge one recollection which by the way it's been exposes internally inconsistent as as completely changing over periods of time to the

asked I just pray for him thank you\nThank you Lindsey Graham was on with George Stephanopoulos cut number Seventeen\nI think so I think what happened here is that ah there you see these three senators who are my friends wanted the FBI to do what the committee is that they wanted the FBI to talk to mark judge a teacher a and miss Kaiser miss Kaiser says somebody was important to me\nThe skies are never said I don't believe that before but when Dr Ford says I was asked his party where it happened um it I wasn't there I don't know Brett Kavanaugh so she was confused as to me and the thing there\nSo I think they will be testimony taken by the FBI from these witnesses Mr ... interview about the FBI and mark judge will be asked to jail with us Brett Kavanaugh drugs are getting right women and I think that'd be the scope of it and that should be the ... center is isn't isn't testimony about\nJudge Kavanaugh drinking in college if you're interviewing every marriage isn't that relevant or he's had six six at the ah background checks he's been on the political stage for twenty six years\nHe's not a stumbling boggling dropped I don't believe that you could have ... accomplished and then a serial rapist in high school and stop it for the rest of the life out one person who is in charge of Germany's legal prayer service and he did anything inappropriate\nSo uh the
