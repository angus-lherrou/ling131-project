increase Republican majorities in the online edition of his truck maybe outside our norms but he is succeeding\nFor all of us I'll tell you about it in a second\nAnd it's all about the Kavanaugh nomination at the bottom line\nIt's why we need to go and elect Kevin Cramer over Heidi Heitkamp in North Dakota it's why we have to elect Matt Rosendale over Jon Tester in Montana it's why Joe Donnelly has to lose in Indiana and Mike\nBraun deserves the or when\nIt's white Josh Hawley needs to go to the Senate from Missouri and not Claire McCaskill spent twelve years not representing Missouri there it's why Rick Scott the governor of Florida who is facing a hurricane this week by the American Michael strengthening intensity may hit the pan handle this week Rick Scott will handle it\nDid a great governor it'll be a great senator\nIt's why even though he voted\nFor Brett Kavanaugh the only Democrat or dead Joe mansion needs to go Patt Morrison needs to when they're in West Virginia you\nKnow that he would have gone the other way in any other year don't be fooled by that and Wisconsin hey listen dairy state people you know the Trump brought home the good for you in the new U.S NCA the replacement of NAFTA\nBut live book there would have voted for cabinet and ... tiny Baldwin voted against that and it was what we saw\nIn Wisconsin five years ago the mob mob came to town and you know what it did to Wisconsin Wisconsin's booming now because of the mob was rejected and we have to reject them a barrier Michigan\nGo vote for John James goodness gracious what a hero as opposed to Debbie Stabenow a West Point combat helicopter pilot\nBusinessman sorry to say go blue business school as well\nJohn jammed in Ohio Jim Renee see great congressman great businessmen vote for him over Sherrod Brown that's nine states now in Texas\nTed Cruz is going to win handily I Believe that in Tennessee Marsha Blackburn has surged say eight points that 'cause everyone knows Bill Bryson would vote to make Chuck Schumer the majority leader that's not Tennessee Tennessee has read I think Nevada Dean Heller as a chance to pull it out now\nBecause people realize how than is the market in the Senate and they cannot get both said Nevada will get nothing they got to have one Republican one Democrat or they will get nothing they're too small there too fragile they depend too much and Adam Black salts running a great campaign but friends if you're given any money away and give it to Martha Mick Sally\nChi congresswoman Mick Sally the first female combat fighter pilot in the United States Air force\nA great congresswoman from Tucson she has a friend of mine she has a survivor of sexual abuse she is going to be an amazing senator as opposed to Christian cinema who is a hard left radical pretending to be the cheese puff girl\nYou know they're happy face she's a hard left radical\nMartha mix Sally as a combat veteran\nAnd an eight ten pilot threat and ten hours in that a cat\nSo the cat on a court fight was clarify and I'm going to read this again even though I did it last year or so you can hear it's my post column this morning make this argument as President Trump's first two years in office\nCome to a close we've seen to originalist justices confirmed to the Supreme Court twenty six originalist appeals court judges confirmed ten more dominant\nIn forty one new district court judges on the bench and dozens more pending add to that\nThe repeal of the sequester on defense spending and a massive military rebuilt underway a massive tax\nCuts of unprecedented depth and structural check a renegotiated trade deal between the United states Mexico and Canada withdraw from the ... Iran deal and in fact the absurd as Paris accord the rollback of job Kelly and bureaucrat empowering regulations by the hundreds and economy surging law unemployment drops a three point seven\nPercent in a new one time in the middle east one that arose despite us ... recognition of Jerusalem as the capital of Israel that the United states and Israel line and cooperating closely with Egypt Saudi Arabia Jordan United Arab Emirates Kuwait and Bahrain and now a new government in Iraq against the expansion is Iranian theocratic\nThat I mentioned the devastation and defeat of ISIS in its physical Calif but that's not even the entire list of accomplishments but it's enough to silence the never Trump voters who used to mock Trump supporting conservatives by posting a street sign carrying the name Gorsuch about rising floodwaters those of us who followed the presidents often confusing\nLoud ex temper rainiest and disruptive presidency not biased tweets\nThat buys administration deeds and those are the congressional Republicans are amused that the never Trump rump\nHas stopped the but Gorsuch nonsense\nMany of the successes especially with regard to the judiciary are because of the unparalleled scaled up Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell supported by Judiciary Committee chairman Charles Grassley in the Senate Joe peacock us\nWhich is almost always held together as a whole\nMcConnell is as I've said before the single most effective congressional leader the GOP is that in my lifetime and it looks as if there's a majority will grow in November the Republican House majority may be preserved as well Speaker Paul Ryan majority leader Kevin McCarthy and their caucus crafted and pass the tax bill\nAs well as fourteen congressional Review Act resolutions and the robots military spending bills Republican candidate should put both to the achievements outlined above and the rapidly expanding economy and they're closing campaigned they should also dwell\nOn the prospect of the enraged left controlling anything um government Democrat Gerald Nadler of New York\nWho would take the gavel the house Judiciary Committee has already promised to pursuit of justice Brett Kavanaugh to satisfy his party's French Democrat Maxine Waters who would gain the gab all of the house financial services\nCommittee has urged the physical pursuit of a Republican colleagues across an out in public places the radical right but the Democrats lead again by representative Nancy Pelosi what set\nOut to destroy the Trump economic momentum and to paralyze the regulatory roll back with a hundred hearings and inquisition Trump is as we're seeing today is Andrew Jackson must have been in Eighteen twenty nine to the people of both\nParties or used to different rules sets I Am one of them plus my criticism of the president or many in detail but my fear of the wild eyed left is far greater\nThan my discomfort with his bowl and China shop politics the left we saw this weekend last contrast unfavorably with the president's hyperbole than occasional cruelty he's now a snarling\nEnraged collected scream on the left\nTo give it power would be the risk fraying even further the common bonds of citizenship best for them the Democrats are spent a long time in the wilderness justice to San Francisco Democrats of Nineteen eighty four so very wrong about the Soviet Union needed to endure such an exile after the attempted\nBombing of cabinet boaters must\nNot reward that outburst of the new McCarthyism in the least\nWhere it will be repeated review the ... the first few paragraphs about vote\nTo repeat those sorts of achievement instead of empowering the enraged mobs\nDon't just return the Republicans will increase their majorities any increase prosperity and security judicial restraint and free enterprise even as we collectively figure out a president who may be outside our national north for the office but who is succeeding for us all that's my column and the Washington Post\nYes it is controversial it has got to you know probably two thousand negative comments by now I don't know how many negative comments\nGot a one point five thousand comments Fifteen hundred comments went up last night and I'm quite sure that uh fourteen thousand Ninety of them are negative they always happen that the mob on line I read a\nMob on line [noise] just the same mob chased Jeff Flake around the same mob chased Lindsey Graham and you know why we like Lindsey Graham and Tom Cotton Chuck Grassley and Mitch McConnell and John Cornyn\nThose are the fiber took the
